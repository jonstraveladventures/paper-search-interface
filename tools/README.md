# Analysis Tools

This directory contains various analysis tools for working with the paper search interface data. All tools are designed to work with the `all_papers.csv` file generated by `combine_papers.py`.

## üìä Data Analysis Tools

### Core Analysis Scripts

#### `check_african_papers_status.py`
**Purpose**: Analyzes whether the African papers analysis included rejected papers and shows the difference between including all papers vs. only accepted papers.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/check_african_papers_status.py
```

**Output**:
- Comparison of paper counts between original analysis (including rejected) and accepted-only analysis
- Breakdown of rejected papers by status
- Summary statistics for both approaches

#### `check_paper_status.py`
**Purpose**: Analyzes the paper statuses in the dataset to understand what types of papers are included.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/check_paper_status.py
```

**Output**:
- Breakdown of all paper statuses in the dataset
- Analysis of rejected/withdrawn papers
- Analysis of accepted/published papers
- Specific analysis for AI-related fields (2015-2024)

#### `check_sudan_data.py`
**Purpose**: Specifically checks for papers from Sudan and other African countries that might not be included in the top 15 countries analysis.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/check_sudan_data.py
```

**Output**:
- List of all African countries with papers
- Specific analysis of Sudan papers
- Countries that might be missing from temporal analysis
- Complete breakdown of African research presence

### Data Extraction Tools

#### `extract_african_research_areas_accepted.py`
**Purpose**: Extracts the research area breakdown for African papers with only accepted papers.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/extract_african_research_areas_accepted.py
```

**Output**:
- Research area breakdown for accepted African papers only
- Mathematica-compatible code for pie chart generation
- Percentage breakdown by research area

#### `extract_mathematica_format_accepted.py`
**Purpose**: Extracts country temporal data in Mathematica format for African papers with only accepted papers.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/extract_mathematica_format_accepted.py
```

**Output**:
- Mathematica-compatible format for country temporal data
- Includes ALL African countries with any accepted papers
- Data for years 2015-2024 (last 10 years)
- Summary statistics by country

#### `create_csv_exports.py`
**Purpose**: Creates CSV files for African papers data with only accepted papers.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/create_csv_exports.py
```

**Output Files**:
- `african_country_temporal_2015_2024_accepted.csv`: Country-year breakdown
- `african_research_areas_accepted.csv`: Research area breakdown

### Global Analysis Tools

#### `extract_global_country_data_accepted_only.py`
**Purpose**: Extracts all countries in the world and their paper counts for AI-related fields (2015-2024), filtered to only accepted papers.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/extract_global_country_data_accepted_only.py
```

**Output**:
- Global country paper counts for AI fields (accepted papers only)
- Regional analysis
- CSV export: `global_country_papers_accepted_only_2015_2024.csv`

#### `update_csv_with_accepted_papers.py`
**Purpose**: Updates a user-provided CSV file with paper counts from the accepted-only global analysis.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/update_csv_with_accepted_papers.py
```

**Output**:
- Updated CSV file with paper counts replacing population data
- Output: `/Users/jonathanshock/Downloads/data_with_accepted_papers.csv`

### Visualization Tools

#### `african_ai_visualizations.py`
**Purpose**: Generates various data visualizations for African AI research.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/african_ai_visualizations.py
```

**Output**:
- Multiple PNG files with visualizations
- Publication trends, research areas, country analysis, etc.
- All visualizations filtered for African countries only

### Data Extraction Tools

#### `extract_country_temporal_data.py`
**Purpose**: Extracts and displays the country temporal data used in the African AI research visualization.

**Usage**:
```bash
python tools/extract_country_temporal_data.py
```

**Output**:
- Detailed breakdown of publications by African country and year
- Summary statistics
- Data used for temporal visualizations

## üîß Prerequisites

Before running any analysis tools, ensure you have:

1. **Data File**: `all_papers.csv` in the root directory (run `combine_papers.py` first)
2. **Python Dependencies**: 
   - pandas
   - matplotlib (for visualizations)
   - seaborn (for visualizations)

## üìã Data Filtering

Most tools use consistent filtering criteria:

### African Countries
All tools use the same set of 54 African countries for consistency.

### Accepted Papers Only
Tools that filter for "accepted papers only" exclude:
- Reject
- Withdraw  
- Desk Reject
- NeurIPS 2023 Conference Withdrawn Submission

### Year Range
- Most analyses focus on 2015-2024 (10 years)
- Some include all years up to 2024

## üìä Output Formats

### CSV Files
- Country-year temporal data
- Research area breakdowns
- Global country statistics

### Mathematica Code
- Ready-to-use code for pie charts
- Country temporal data in Mathematica format

### Visualizations
- PNG files for various charts and graphs
- Publication trends, research areas, country analysis

## üéØ Use Cases

### Research Analysis
- Understanding African AI research trends
- Comparing accepted vs. all papers
- Identifying research gaps and opportunities

### Data Visualization
- Creating charts for presentations
- Generating Mathematica visualizations
- Exporting data for external analysis

### Data Quality Assessment
- Checking paper status distributions
- Verifying country coverage
- Identifying missing data

## üìù Notes

- All tools are designed to work with the Paper Copilot dataset structure
- Tools are focused on AI-related research areas
- African country definitions are consistent across all tools
- Output files are saved in the current directory unless specified otherwise
