In this paper, we consider the recovery of jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) scenario where signal is represented as a matrix and the sparsity of signal occurs in a common location set. The sparse MMV model can be formulated as a matrix $(2,1)$-norm minimization problem. However, the $(2,1)$-norm minimization problem is much more difficult to solve than l1-norm minimization. In this paper, we propose a very fast algorithm, called MMV-ADM, for jointly sparse signal recovery in MMV settings based on the alternating direction method (ADM). The MMV-ADM alternately updates the signal matrix, the Lagrangian multiplier and the residue, and all update rules only involve matrix or vector multiplications and summations, so it is simple, easy to implement and much more fast than the state-of-the-art method MMVprox.

The quality of the Nystr\u00f6m  approximation highly depends on the subset of columns used, which are usually selected using random sampling. This paper presents a novel recursive algorithm for calculating the Nystr\u00f6m approximation, and an effective greedy criterion for column selection. Further, a very efficient variant is proposed for greedy sampling, which works on random partitions of data instances. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that the proposed greedy algorithms achieve significant improvements in approximating kernel matrices, with minimum overhead in run time.",

Such a heuristic approach to objective building does not always work. For example, addition of an $L_1$ penalty to the KL-divergence fails to induce any sparsity, as the $L_1$ norm of any vector in a simplex is a constant.

In both of these cases, we show that a hard objective relaxed to obtain penalties can be more tightly approximated.

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets.

Yet it is still common to train their  parameters to approximately maximize training likelihood.  We argue that instead, one should seek the parameters that minimize the empirical risk of the entire imperfect system.  We show how to locally optimize this risk using back-propagation and stochastic meta-descent.

KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where kernels are defined ($\\mathbb{R}^d$, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not exist.

Tillman et al. (2009) showed how directed graphical models learned from such datasets can be integrated to construct an equivalence class of structures over all variables.

We provide a quantitative consistency analysis of a procedure based on node-wise multi-class logistic regression with group-sparse regularization.  We first consider general $m$-ary pairwise models \u2013 where each factor depends on at most two variables. We show that when the number of samples scale as $n > K(m-1)^2 d^2 \\log ((m-1)^2(p-1))$ \u2013 where $d$ is the maximum degree and $K$ a fixed constant \u2013 the procedure succeeds in recovering the graph with high probability. For general models with $c$-way factors, the natural multi-way extension of the pairwise method quickly becomes very computationally complex. So we studied the effectiveness of using the pairwise method even while the true model has higher order factors. Surprisingly, we show that under slightly more stringent conditions, the pairwise procedure still recovers the graph structure,  when the samples scale as $n > K (m-1)^2 d^{\\frac{3}{2}c - 1} \\log ( (m-1)^c (p-1)^{c-1} )$.",

We provide a quantitative consistency analysis of a procedure based on node-wise multi-class logistic regression with group-sparse regularization.  We first consider general $m$-ary pairwise models \u2013 where each factor depends on at most two variables. We show that when the number of samples scale as $n > K(m-1)^2 d^2 \\log ((m-1)^2(p-1))$ \u2013 where $d$ is the maximum degree and $K$ a fixed constant \u2013 the procedure succeeds in recovering the graph with high probability. For general models with $c$-way factors, the natural multi-way extension of the pairwise method quickly becomes very computationally complex. So we studied the effectiveness of using the pairwise method even while the true model has higher order factors.

Recent work in parallel Gibbs sampling has focused on update schedules which do not guarantee convergence to the intended stationary distribution.  In this work, we propose two methods to construct parallel Gibbs samplers guaranteed to draw from the targeted distribution. The first method, called the Chromatic sampler, uses graph coloring to construct a direct parallelization of the classic sequential scan Gibbs sampler.  In the case of 2-colorable models we relate the Chromatic sampler to the Synchronous Gibbs sampler (which draws all variables simultaneously in parallel), and reveal new ergodic properties of Synchronous Gibbs chains.  Our second method, the Splash sampler, is a complementary strategy which can be used when the variables are tightly coupled. This constructs and samples multiple blocks in parallel, using a novel locking protocol and an iterative junction tree generation algorithm.  We further improve the Splash sampler through adaptive tree construction.  We demonstrate the benefits of our two sampling algorithms on large synthetic and real-world models using a 32 processor multi-core system.",

Although the statistical relational learning (SRL) community has recently developed many classification methods for graph and network domains, much of this work has focused on modeling domains where there is a single network for learning. For example, we could learn a model to predict the political views of users in an online social network, based on the friendship relationships among users. In this example, the data would be drawn from a single large network (e.g., Facebook) and increasing the data size would correspond to acquiring a larger graph. Although SRL methods can successfully improve classification in these types of domains, there has been little theoretical analysis of addressing the issue of single network domains. In particular, the asymptotic properties of estimation are not clear if the size of the model grows with the size of the network. In this work, we focus on outlining the conditions under which learning from a single network will be asymptotically consistent and normal. Moreover, we compare the properties of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with that of generalized maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE) and use the resulting understanding to propose novel MPLE estimators for single network domains. We include empirical analysis on both synthetic and real network data to illustrate the findings.",

However, often times, influence is topic dependent, e.g., a web page of high influence in politics may be an unknown entity in sports.  We design a new model called TopicFlow, which combines ideas from network flow and topic modeling, to learn this notion of topic specific influences of hyperlinked documents in a completely unsupervised fashion. On the task of citation recommendation, which is an instance of capturing influence, the TopicFlow model, when combined with TF-IDF based cosine similarity, outperforms several competitive baselines by as much as 11.8%. Our empirical study of the model's output on ACL corpus demonstrates its ability to identify topically influential documents. The Topic- Flow model is also competitive with the state-of-theart Relational Topic Models in predicting the likelihood of unseen text on two different data sets. Due to its ability to learn topic-specific flows across each hyperlink, the TopicFlow model can be a powerful visualization tool to track the diffusion of topics across a citation network.",
