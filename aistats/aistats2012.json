As different radioactive materials have different effects to human body, it is important to know the types of nuclides and their levels of concentration from the recorded mixture of radiations to well take necessary measures. We presently formulate a Bayesian generative model for the data available on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster across Japan. The model can infer from the sparsely sampled measurements what nuclides are present as well as their concentration levels. An important property of the proposed model is that it admits unique recovery of the parameters. On synthetic data we demonstrate that our model is able to infer the underlying components and on data from the Fukushima Daiichi plant we establish that the model is able to well account for the data. We further demonstrate how the model extends to include all the available measurements recorded throughout Japan.

        "abstract": "Most clustering algorithms produce a single clustering solution. This is inadequate for many data sets that are multi-faceted and can be grouped and interpreted in many different ways.  Moreover, for high-dimensional data, different features may be relevant or irrelevant to each clustering solution, suggesting the need for feature selection in clustering. Features relevant to one clustering interpretation may be different from the ones relevant for an alternative interpretation or view of the data.  In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian model that can discover multiple clustering solutions from data and the feature subsets that are relevant for the clusters in each view. In our model, the features in different views may be shared and therefore the sets of relevant features are allowed to overlap.  We model feature relevance to each view using an Indian Buffet Process and the cluster membership in each view using a Chinese Restaurant Process.

This is inadequate for many data sets that are multi-faceted and can be grouped and interpreted in many different ways.  Moreover, for high-dimensional data, different features may be relevant or irrelevant to each clustering solution, suggesting the need for feature selection in clustering. Features relevant to one clustering interpretation may be different from the ones relevant for an alternative interpretation or view of the data.  In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian model that can discover multiple clustering solutions from data and the feature subsets that are relevant for the clusters in each view. In our model, the features in different views may be shared and therefore the sets of relevant features are allowed to overlap.  We model feature relevance to each view using an Indian Buffet Process and the cluster membership in each view using a Chinese Restaurant Process.  We provide an inference approach to learn the latent parameters corresponding to this multiple partitioning problem.  Our model not only learns the features and clusters in each view but also automatically learns the number of clusters, number of views and number of features in each view.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Some supervised learning tasks do not fit the usual single annotator scenario. In these problems, ground-truth may not exist and multiple annotators are generally available. A few approaches have been proposed to address this learning problem. In this setting active learning (AL), the problem of optimally selecting unlabeled samples for labeling, offers new challenges and has received little attention. In multiple annotator AL, it is not sufficient to select a sample for labeling since, in addition, an optimal annotator must also be selected. This setting is of great interest as annotators\u2019 expertise generally varies and could depend on the given sample itself; additionally, some annotators may be adversarial. Thus, clearly the information provided by some annotators should be more valuable than that provided by others and it could vary across data points. We propose an AL approach for this new scenario motivated by information theoretic principles.

In these problems, ground-truth may not exist and multiple annotators are generally available. A few approaches have been proposed to address this learning problem. In this setting active learning (AL), the problem of optimally selecting unlabeled samples for labeling, offers new challenges and has received little attention. In multiple annotator AL, it is not sufficient to select a sample for labeling since, in addition, an optimal annotator must also be selected. This setting is of great interest as annotators\u2019 expertise generally varies and could depend on the given sample itself; additionally, some annotators may be adversarial. Thus, clearly the information provided by some annotators should be more valuable than that provided by others and it could vary across data points. We propose an AL approach for this new scenario motivated by information theoretic principles. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the information that an annotator label provides about the true (but unknown) label of the data point. We develop this concept, propose an algorithm for active learning, and experimentally validate the proposed approach.}\n}",

        "author": "Marco Grzegorzyk; Dirk Husmeier",
        "abstract": "To relax the homogeneity assumption of classical dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), various recent studies have combined DBNs with multiple changepoint processes. The underlying assumption is that the parameters associated with time series segments delimited by multiple changepoints are a priori independent. Under weak regularity conditions, the parameters can be integrated out in the likelihood, leading to a closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood.

The Bethe approximation reduces the problem of computing the partition function in a graphical model to that of solving a set of non-linear equations, so-called the Bethe equation. On the other hand, the BP algorithm is a popular heuristic method for estimating marginal distribution in a graphical model. Although they are inspired and developed from different directions, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2004) established a somewhat surprising connection: the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following important question to understand their limitations and empirical successes: the Bethe equation is computationally easy to solve? We present a message passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in polynomial number of bitwise operations for arbitrary binary graphical models of n nodes where the maximum degree in the underlying graph is O(log n). Our algorithm, an alternative to BP fixing its convergence issue, is the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed point computation in such a large class of graphical models. Moreover, we believe that our technique is of broader interest to understand the computational complexity of the cavity method in statistical physics.",

Although they are inspired and developed from different directions, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2004) established a somewhat surprising connection: the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following important question to understand their limitations and empirical successes: the Bethe equation is computationally easy to solve? We present a message passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in polynomial number of bitwise operations for arbitrary binary graphical models of n nodes where the maximum degree in the underlying graph is O(log n). Our algorithm, an alternative to BP fixing its convergence issue, is the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed point computation in such a large class of graphical models. Moreover, we believe that our technique is of broader interest to understand the computational complexity of the cavity method in statistical physics.}\n}",

Modern algorithms for linear classification can train reasonably good models while going through the data in only tens of rounds. However, large data often does not fit in the memory of a single machine, which makes the bottleneck in large-scale learning the disk I/O, not the CPU. Following this observation, Yu et al.

In this paper, rather than optimizing algorithms on a single machine, we propose and implement distributed algorithms that achieve parallel disk loading and access the disk only once. Our large-scale learning algorithms are based on the framework of alternating direction methods of multipliers. The framework derives a subproblem that remains to be solved efficiently for which we propose using dual coordinate descent. Our experimental evaluations on large datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speedup over the classifier proposed by Yu et al. running on a single machine.

By organizing the data in a suitable structure, the time complexity of our best method for evaluating the bound at each branch is reduced from O(H^2) to O(H). This permits searching for the MAP solution in O(BH+Q) instead of O(BH^2) (without using the data structure), where B is the number of branches and Q is the one-time cost to build the data structure which is proportional to H^2. Our analysis on synthetic data shows that, given a limited time budget, our method solves problems that are characterized by a much larger number of states when compared to state-of-the-art exact inference algorithms (e.g., Marinescu and Dechter (2007); Sontag et al.

In particular, our approach is an order of magnitude faster on average than Sontag et al.\u2019s Cluster Pursuit\u00a0(CP) on human pose estimation problems.

In this paper we present a framework that seeks and finds the optimal solution of several NP-hard graph partitioning problems. We use a classical approach to ratio problems where we repeatedly ask whether the optimal solution is greater than or less than some constant - lambda.

Note that this is also equivalent to recovering the underlying graph structure of a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF).  We present two novel greedy approaches to solving this problem.  The first estimates the non-zero covariates of the overall inverse covariance matrix using a series of global forward and backward greedy steps.  The second estimates the neighborhood of each node in the graph separately, again using greedy forward and backward steps, and combines the intermediate neighborhoods to form an overall estimate. The principal contribution of this paper is a rigorous analysis of the sparsistency, or consistency in recovering the sparsity pattern of the inverse covariance matrix. Surprisingly, we show that both the local and global greedy methods learn the full structure of the model with high probability given just O(d log(p)) samples, which is a significant improvement over state of the art L1-regularized Gaussian MLE (Graphical Lasso) that requires O(d^2 log(p)) samples. Moreover, the restricted eigenvalue and smoothness conditions imposed by our greedy methods are much weaker than the strong irrepresentable conditions required by the L1-regularization based methods. We corroborate our results with extensive simulations and examples, comparing our local and global greedy methods to the L1-regularized Gaussian MLE as well as the nodewise L1-regularized linear regression (Neighborhood Lasso).",

The approach relies on the Locality Preserving Criterion, which preserves the locality of the data points. However, LPI takes every word in a data corpus into account, even though many words may not be useful for document clustering. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach called Locality Preserving Feature Learning (LPFL), which incorporates feature selection into LPI. Specifically, we aim to find a subset of features, and learn a linear transformation to optimize the Locality Preserving Criterion based on these features. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed integer programming problem, which we relax into a constrained Frobenius norm minimization problem, and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction Method (ADM). ADM, which iteratively updates the linear transformation matrix, the residue matrix and the Lagrangian multiplier, is theoretically guaranteed to converge at the rate O(1/t). Experiments on benchmark document datasets show that our proposed method outperforms LPI, as well as other state-of-the-art document analysis approaches.",

We propose a computationally efficient approach to estimate the partition sum in a structured learning problem. The key idea is a lower bound of the partition sum that can be evaluated in a fixed number of message passing iterations. The bound makes use of a subset of the variables, a feedback vertex set, which allows us to decompose the graph into tractable parts. Furthermore, a tightening strategy for the bound is presented, which finds the states of the feedback vertex set that maximally increase the bound, and clamps them.

        "abstract": "The use of the standard hinge loss for structured outputs, for the learning to rank problem, faces two main caveats: (a) the label space, the set of all possible permutations of items to be ranked, is too large, and also less amenable to the usual dynamic-programming based techniques used for structured outputs, and (b) the supervision or training data consists of instances with multiple labels per input, instead of just a single label. The most natural way to deal with such multiple labels leads, unfortunately, to a non-convex surrogate. In this paper, we propose a general class of perturbation-based surrogates that leverage the large margin approach, and are convex.

Existing sparse CCA models do not incorporate structural information among variables such as pathways of genes. This work extends the sparse CCA so that it could exploit either the pre-given or unknown group structure via the structured-sparsity-inducing penalty. Such structured penalty poses new challenge on optimization techniques. To address this challenge, by specializing the excessive gap framework, we develop a scalable primal-dual optimization algorithm with a fast rate of convergence. Empirical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured sparse CCA on both simulated and genetic datasets.",

This work extends the sparse CCA so that it could exploit either the pre-given or unknown group structure via the structured-sparsity-inducing penalty. Such structured penalty poses new challenge on optimization techniques. To address this challenge, by specializing the excessive gap framework, we develop a scalable primal-dual optimization algorithm with a fast rate of convergence. Empirical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured sparse CCA on both simulated and genetic datasets.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Standard compressive sensing results state that to exactly recover an s sparse signal in Rp, one requires O(s log p) measurements. While this bound is extremely useful in practice, often real world signals are not only sparse, but also exhibit structure in the sparsity pattern. We focus on group-structured patterns in this paper. Under this model, groups of signal coefficients are active (or inactive) together. The groups are prede- fined, but the particular set of groups that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show that exploiting knowledge of groups can further reduce the number of measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on the number of groups under consideration, and not the particulars of the groups (e.g., compositions, sizes, ex- tents, overlaps, etc.). Experiments show that our result holds for a variety of overlapping group configurations.",

We provide the first formal positive result showing that even in the unrealizable case, the runtime can decrease exponentially while only  requiring a polynomial growth of the number of examples.
