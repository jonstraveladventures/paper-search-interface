Most previous studies for the joint estimation of multiple sGGMs rely on penalized log-likelihood estimators that involve expensive and difficult non-smooth optimizations. We propose a novel approach, FASJEM for \\underlinefast and \\underlinescalable \\underlinejoint structure-\\underlineestimation of \\underlinemultiple sGGMs at a large scale. As the first study of joint sGGM using the M-estimator framework, our work has three major contributions: (1) We solve FASJEM through an entry-wise manner which is parallelizable. (2) We choose a proximal algorithm to optimize FASJEM. This improves the computational efficiency from $O(Kp^3)$ to $O(Kp^2)$ and reduces the memory requirement from $O(Kp^2)$ to $O(K)$. (3) We theoretically prove that FASJEM achieves a consistent estimation with a convergence rate of $O(\\log(Kp)/n_tot)$. On several synthetic and four real-world datasets, FASJEM shows significant improvements over baselines on accuracy, computational complexity and memory costs.",

This reveals their motivation and aptness as structural priors formulated by embedding the effect in a particular functional space. This also gives rise to a range of new, kernel-based matching estimators that arise when one embeds the effect in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

We demonstrate that, in both maximum likelihood and max-margin learning, training conditional RBMs with BP as the inference routine can provide significantly better results than current state-of-the-art CD methods on structured prediction problems.

In this work, we present a matrix-based implementation of belief propagation algorithms on CRBMs, which is easily scalable to tens of thousands of visible and hidden units.  We demonstrate that, in both maximum likelihood and max-margin learning, training conditional RBMs with BP as the inference routine can provide significantly better results than current state-of-the-art CD methods on structured prediction problems.  We also include practical guidelines on training CRBMs with BP, and some insights on the interaction of learning and inference algorithms for CRBMs.}\n}",

We propose a practical private EM algorithm that overcomes this challenge using two innovations: (1) a novel moment perturbation formulation for differentially private EM (DP-EM), and (2) the use of two recently developed composition methods to bound the privacy \u201ccost\u201d of multiple EM iterations: the moments accountant (MA) and zero-mean concentrated differential privacy (zCDP).  Both MA and zCDP bound the moment generating function of the privacy loss random variable and achieve a refined tail bound, which effectively decrease the amount of additive noise.

GPs are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest.

Recently, \\emphsubspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) was proposed as a practical algorithm for density ridge estimation. A key technical ingredient in SCMS is to accurately estimate the ratios of the density derivatives to the density. SCMS takes a three-step approach for this purpose \u2014 first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator and division by an estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method that directly estimates the ratios without going through density estimation and division. Our proposed estimator has an analytic-form solution and it can be computed efficiently. We further establish a non-parametric convergence bound for the proposed ratio estimator.

Recently, \\emphsubspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) was proposed as a practical algorithm for density ridge estimation. A key technical ingredient in SCMS is to accurately estimate the ratios of the density derivatives to the density. SCMS takes a three-step approach for this purpose \u2014 first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator and division by an estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method that directly estimates the ratios without going through density estimation and division. Our proposed estimator has an analytic-form solution and it can be computed efficiently. We further establish a non-parametric convergence bound for the proposed ratio estimator. Finally, based on this direct ratio estimator, we develop a practical algorithm for density ridge estimation and experimentally demonstrate its usefulness on a variety of datasets.}\n}",

In this paper, we explore a new similarity metric called \u201ccross-predictability\u201d: the degree to which a future value in each time series is predicted by past values of the others.  However, it is challenging to estimate such cross-predictability among time series in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of time series is much larger than the length of each time series. We address this challenge with a sparsity assumption: only time series in the same cluster have significant cross-predictability with each other.  We demonstrate that this approach is computationally attractive, and  provide a theoretical proof that the proposed algorithm will identify the correct clustering structure with high probability under certain conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical high-dimensional time series clustering algorithm with a provable guarantee.

Recently,   various norms were proposed, which can be  best described as instances of ordered weighted $\\ell_1$ norms (OWL), as an alternative to $\\ell_1$ regularization used in LASSO. OWL can identify groups of correlated variables but  it forces the model to be constant within a group.  This artifact induces unnecessary bias in the model estimation.  In this paper we take a submodular perspective and show that  OWL can be posed as the Lov\u00e1sz extension of a suitably defined submodular function. The submodular perspective not only explains the group-wise constant behavior of OWL, but also suggests alternatives. The main contribution of this paper is smoothed OWL (SOWL), a new family of norms, which  not only identifies the groups but also allows the model to be flexible inside a group.   We establish several algorithmic and theoretical properties of SOWL including group identification and model consistency. We also provide algorithmic tools to compute the SOWL norm and its proximal operator, whose computational complexity  $O(d\\log d)$ is significantly better than that of general purpose solvers in $O(d^2\\log d)$.

In such problems, each sample x itself is associated with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by samples $z_i_i=1^M$, and the goal is to learn a function f that links these conditional distributions to target values y. These problems become very challenging when we only have limited samples or in the extreme case only one sample from each conditional distribution. Commonly used approaches either assume that z is independent of x, or require an overwhelmingly large set of samples from each conditional distribution.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach which employs a new min-max reformulation of the learning from conditional distribution problem.  With such new reformulation, we only need to deal with the joint distribution p(z,x). We also design an efficient learning algorithm, Embedding-SGD, and establish theoretical sample complexity for such problems. Finally, our numerical experiments, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over existing algorithms.",

While there are many important analyses of this estimation problem, the present paper derives convergence rates in other practical settings that are less understood, namely, extensions of traditional Lipschitz smoothness conditions, and common high-dimensional settings with structured data (e.g. manifold data, sparse data).   Various interesting facts, which hold in earlier settings, are shown to extend to these settings. Namely, (1) optimal rates depend only on the smoothness of the ratio f, and not on the densities $f_Q$, $f_P$, supporting the belief that plugging in estimates for $f_Q$, $f_P$ is suboptimal; (2) optimal rates depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data, i.e. this problem \u2013 unlike density estimation \u2013 escapes the curse of dimension.

In contrast to prior work, we focus on the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly.  We propose ECED, a novel, efficient active learning algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated, noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective, which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the approximation bound.

In contrast to prior work, we focus on the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly.  We propose ECED, a novel, efficient active learning algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated, noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective, which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the approximation bound. We demonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on two problem instances, including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish among economic theories of how people make risky decisions, and an active preference learning task via pairwise comparisons.}\n}",

In this paper, we characterize the learnability of fully-connected neural networks via both positive and negative results. We focus on $\\ell_1$-regularized networks, where the $\\ell_1$-norm of the incoming weights of every neuron is assumed to be bounded by a constant $B > 0$. Our first result shows that such networks are properly learnable in $\\text{poly}(n,d,\\exp(1/\u03b5^2))$ time, where $n$ and $d$ are the sample size and the input dimension, and $\u03b5> 0$ is the gap to optimality. The bound is achieved by repeatedly sampling over a low-dimensional manifold so as to ensure approximate optimality, but avoids the $\\exp(d)$ cost of exhaustively searching over the parameter space. We also establish a hardness result showing that the exponential dependence on $1/\u03b5$ is unavoidable unless $\\bf RP = \\bf NP$.  Our second result shows that the exponential dependence on $1/\u03b5$ can be avoided by exploiting the underlying structure of the data distribution. In particular, if the positive and negative examples can be separated with margin $\u03b3> 0$ by an unknown neural network, then the network can be learned in $\\text{poly}(n,d,1/\u03b5)$ time. The bound is achieved by an ensemble method which uses the first algorithm as a weak learner. We further show that the separability assumption can be weakened to tolerate noisy labels. Finally, we show that the exponential dependence on $1/\u03b3$ is unimprovable under a certain cryptographic assumption.",

R2PCA takes RANSAC\u2019s principle of using as little data as possible one step further. It iteratively selects small subsets of the data to identify pieces of the principal components, to then stitch them together. We show that if the principal components are in general position and the errors are sufficiently sparse, R2PCA will exactly recover the principal components with probability 1, in lieu of assumptions on coherence or the distribution of the sparse errors, and even under adversarial settings.

R2PCA takes RANSAC\u2019s principle of using as little data as possible one step further. It iteratively selects small subsets of the data to identify pieces of the principal components, to then stitch them together. We show that if the principal components are in general position and the errors are sufficiently sparse, R2PCA will exactly recover the principal components with probability 1, in lieu of assumptions on coherence or the distribution of the sparse errors, and even under adversarial settings.

        "abstract": "Greedy algorithms are widely used for problems in machine learning such as feature selection and set function optimization.  Unfortunately, for large datasets, the running time of even greedy algorithms can be quite high.  This is because for each greedy step we need to refit a model or calculate a function using the previously selected choices and the new candidate.   Two algorithms that are faster approximations to the greedy forward selection were introduced recently\u00a0[Mirzasoleiman et al., 2013, 2015]. They achieve better performance by exploiting stochastic evaluation and distributed computation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance guarantees for submodular functions.  In this paper we show that divergent from previously held opinion, submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees for these two algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our result extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of functions.

Unfortunately, for large datasets, the running time of even greedy algorithms can be quite high.  This is because for each greedy step we need to refit a model or calculate a function using the previously selected choices and the new candidate.   Two algorithms that are faster approximations to the greedy forward selection were introduced recently\u00a0[Mirzasoleiman et al., 2013, 2015]. They achieve better performance by exploiting stochastic evaluation and distributed computation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance guarantees for submodular functions.  In this paper we show that divergent from previously held opinion, submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees for these two algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our result extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of functions. Furthermore, we show that a bounded submodularity ratio can be used to provide data dependent bounds that can sometimes be tighter also for submodular functions. We empirically validate our work by showing superior performance of fast greedy approximations versus several established baselines on artificial and real datasets. }\n}",

The main challenge of the problem is that the individual values of the row and column are unobserved. We assume that these values are stochastic and drawn independently. We propose a computationally-efficient algorithm for solving our problem, which we call Rank1Elim. We derive a O((K + L) (1 / Delta) log n) upper bound on its n-step regret, where K is the number of rows, L is the number of columns, and Delta is the minimum of the row and column gaps; under the assumption that the mean row and column rewards are bounded away from zero. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first bandit algorithm that finds the maximum entry of a rank-1 matrix whose regret is linear in K + L, 1 / Delta, and log n. We also derive a nearly matching lower bound. Finally, we evaluate Rank1Elim empirically on multiple problems.

We analyze the regret of Thompson sampling (TS) (a.k.a. posterior-sampling for reinforcement learning) in the frequentist setting, i.e., when the parameters characterizing the LQ dynamics are fixed. Despite the empirical and theoretical success in a wide range of problems from multi-armed bandit to linear bandit, we show that when studying the frequentist regret TS in control problems, we need to trade-off the frequency of sampling optimistic parameters and the frequency of switches in the control policy. This results in an overall regret of $O(T^2/3)$, which is significantly worse than the regret $O(\\sqrtT)$ achieved by the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty algorithm in LQ control problems.",

Alternative settings include active exploration, where a learner tries to gain accurate estimates of the rewards of all arms.

For instance, in educational games the designer wants to gather generalizable knowledge about the behavior of the students and teaching strategies (small estimation errors) but, at the same time, the system needs to avoid giving a bad experience to the players, who may leave the system permanently (large reward). In this paper, we formalize this tradeoff and introduce the ForcingBalance algorithm whose performance is provably close to the best possible tradeoff strategy.
