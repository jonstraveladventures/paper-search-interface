        "abstract": "The classical minimal model of glucose disposal was proposed as a powerful modeling approach to estimating the insulin sensitivity and the glucose effectiveness, which are very useful in the study of diabetes. The minimal model is a highly ill-posed inverse problem and most often the reconstruction of the glucose kinetics has been done by deterministic iterative numerical algorithms. However, these algorithms do not consider the severe ill-posedness inherent in the minimal model and may only be efficient when a good initial estimate is provided. In this work we adopt graphical models as a powerful and flexible modeling framework for regularizing the problem and thereby allow for estimation of the insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness. We illustrate how the reconstruction algorithm may be efficiently implemented in a Bayesian approach where posterior sampling is made through the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We demonstrate the method on simulated data.",

In essence, in the algorithms developed for discrete networks we only have to change \"strong marginalization\" (exact) into \"weak marginalization\" (same moments) or, equivalently, the \"sum\" operation in the (generalized) sum-product algorithm into a \"collapse\" operation. We describe both a message-free single-loop algorithm based on fixed-point iteration and a more tedious double-loop algorithm guaranteed to converge to a minimum of the Kikuchi free energy.

Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone. We have therefore recently developed a general purpose inference engine called VIBES [1] (\u2019Variational Inference for Bayesian Networks\u2019) which allows a wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding. New models are specified as a directed acyclic graph using an interface analogous to a drawing package, and VIBES then automatically generates and solves the variational equations. The original version of VIBES assumed a fully factorized variational posterior distribution. In this paper we present an extension of VIBES in which the variational posterior distribution corresponds to a sub-graph of the full probabilistic model.

        "abstract": "In an influential paper Kohavi and John [7] presented a number of disadvantages of the filter approach to the feature selection problem, steering research towards algorithms adopting the wrapper approach. We show here that neither approach is inherently better and that any practical feature selection algorithm needs to at least consider the learner used for classification and the metric used for evaluating the learner\u2019s performance. In the process we formally define the feature selection problem, re-examine the relationship between relevancy and filter algorithms, and establish a connection between Kohavi and John\u2019s definition of relevancy to the Markov Blanket of a target variable in a Bayesian Network faithful to some data distribution. The theoretical results lead to principled ways of designing optimal filter algorithms of which we present one example.",

Here we develop a class of local message-passing algorithms, which we call tree-reweighted belief propagation, for efficiently computing the value of these upper bounds, as well as the associated pseudomarginals. We also consider the uses of our bounds for the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation. For a completely observed model, our analysis gives rise to a concave lower bound on the log likelihood of the data. Maximizing this lower bound yields an approximate ML estimate which, in analogy to the moment-matching of exact ML estimation, can be interpreted in terms of pseudo-moment-matching. We present preliminary results illustrating the behavior of this approximate ML estimator.",
