Inspired by previous work, we develop an homotopy algorithm which solves the \\ell_1-regularized least square problem for a sequence of decreasing values of the regularization parameter. Compared to the previous method, our algorithm is more efficient in the sense it only updates the solution once for each intermediate problem, and more practical in the sense it has a simple stopping criterion by checking the sparsity of the intermediate solution. Theoretical analysis reveals that our method enjoys a linear convergence rate in reducing the recovery error. Furthermore, our guarantee for recovering the top s elements of the target vector is tighter than previous results, and that for recovering the target vector itself matches the state of the art in compressive sensing.",

Inspired by previous work, we develop an homotopy algorithm which solves the \\ell_1-regularized least square problem for a sequence of decreasing values of the regularization parameter. Compared to the previous method, our algorithm is more efficient in the sense it only updates the solution once for each intermediate problem, and more practical in the sense it has a simple stopping criterion by checking the sparsity of the intermediate solution. Theoretical analysis reveals that our method enjoys a linear convergence rate in reducing the recovery error. Furthermore, our guarantee for recovering the top s elements of the target vector is tighter than previous results, and that for recovering the target vector itself matches the state of the art in compressive sensing.}\n}",

In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian design matrix are randomly sparsified so that only a very small fraction of  entries are nonzero. Our proposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the major cost is one linear scan of the coordinates. Using our proposed \\textbf\\em \u201ctie estimator\u201d, we are able to recover a K-sparse signal of length N using  1.551 eK \\log K/\u03b4measurements (where \u03b4\u22640.05 is the confidence) in one scan. The practical performance of our method, however, can be substantially better than this bound.   The Gaussian design assumption is not essential although it simplifies the analysis.   \\noindent Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan) recovery algorithms using sparse matrices would  require substantially  (e.g., one order of magnitude) more measurements than L1 decoding by linear programming, when the nonzero coordinates of signals can be either negative or positive.  In this paper, following a well-known experimental setup\u00a0\\citeUrl:wiki_sparse, we show that, at the same number of measurements, the recovery accuracies   of our proposed method are similar to   the standard L1 decoding.",

In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian design matrix are randomly sparsified so that only a very small fraction of  entries are nonzero. Our proposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the major cost is one linear scan of the coordinates. Using our proposed \\textbf\\em \u201ctie estimator\u201d, we are able to recover a K-sparse signal of length N using  1.551 eK \\log K/\u03b4measurements (where \u03b4\u22640.05 is the confidence) in one scan. The practical performance of our method, however, can be substantially better than this bound.   The Gaussian design assumption is not essential although it simplifies the analysis.   \\noindent Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan) recovery algorithms using sparse matrices would  require substantially  (e.g., one order of magnitude) more measurements than L1 decoding by linear programming, when the nonzero coordinates of signals can be either negative or positive.  In this paper, following a well-known experimental setup\u00a0\\citeUrl:wiki_sparse, we show that, at the same number of measurements, the recovery accuracies   of our proposed method are similar to   the standard L1 decoding.}\n}",

We also discuss the extension of our algorithm to computing the posteriors of s\u00a0>p\u00a0>t relations, i.e., a directed path from s to t via p. We apply our algorithm to a biological data set for discovering protein signaling pathways.}\n}",

In this paper, formalize a new class of multi-armed bandit methods, Global Multi-armed Bandit (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability one. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each other\u2019s rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the parameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the informativeness of the arms.

In many real world applications, we usually have some prior knowledge about the underlying graph structure, such as degree distribution and block structure. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model for describing the block structure in general exponential families, and optimize it by an Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm with variational Bayes. Experimental results show that our method performs well on both synthetic and real data.

In many real world applications, we usually have some prior knowledge about the underlying graph structure, such as degree distribution and block structure. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model for describing the block structure in general exponential families, and optimize it by an Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm with variational Bayes. Experimental results show that our method performs well on both synthetic and real data. Further, our method can predict overlapped block structure of a graphical model in general exponential families.}\n}",

In this paper, we investigate 1-bit CS problems for sparse signals using the recently proposed k-support norm. We show that the new estimator has a closed-form solution, so no optimization is needed. We establish consistency and recovery guarantees of the estimator for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian random measurements. For Gaussian measurements, our estimator is comparable to the best known in the literature, along with guarantees on support recovery. For sub-Gaussian measurements, our estimator has an irreducible error which, unlike existing results, can be controlled by scaling the measurement vectors. In both cases, our analysis covers the setting of model misspecification, i.e., when the true sparsity is unknown. Experimental results illustrate several strengths of the new estimator.",

In this paper, we investigate 1-bit CS problems for sparse signals using the recently proposed k-support norm. We show that the new estimator has a closed-form solution, so no optimization is needed. We establish consistency and recovery guarantees of the estimator for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian random measurements. For Gaussian measurements, our estimator is comparable to the best known in the literature, along with guarantees on support recovery. For sub-Gaussian measurements, our estimator has an irreducible error which, unlike existing results, can be controlled by scaling the measurement vectors. In both cases, our analysis covers the setting of model misspecification, i.e., when the true sparsity is unknown. Experimental results illustrate several strengths of the new estimator.}\n}",

Yet the preference orders by real humans become irrationally reversed, when the choice set of available options is manipulated. In order to accurately predict choice decisions involving preference reversals, which existing econometric methods have failed to incorporate, the authors introduce a new cognitive choice model whose parameters are efficiently fitted with a global convex optimization algorithm. The proposed model captures each human as a Bayesian decision maker facing a mental conflict between objective evaluation samples and a subjective prior, where the underlying objective evaluation function is rationally independent from contexts while the subjective prior is irrationally determined by each choice set. As the key idea to analytically handle the irrationality and to yield the convex optimization, the Bayesian decision mechanism is implemented as a closed-form Gaussian process regression using similarities among the available options in each context. By explaining the irrational decisions as a consequence of averting uncertainty, the proposed model outperformed the existing econometric models in predicting the irrational choice decisions recorded in real-world datasets.",

In general, robust classifications are used to create a classifier robust to data by taking into account the uncertainty of the data. Our result shows that regularized classifications inherit robustness and provide reason on why some regularized classifications tend to be robust against data. Although most robust classification problems assume that every uncertain data lie within an identical bounded set, this paper considers a generalized model where the sizes of the bounded sets are different for each data. These models can be transformed into regularized classification models where the penalties for each data are assigned according to their losses. We see that considering such models opens up for new applications. For an example, we show that this robust classification technique can be used for Imbalanced Data Learning. We conducted experimentation with actual data and compared it with other IDL algorithms such as Cost Sensitive SVMs. This is a novel usage for the robust classification scheme and encourages it to be a suitable candidate for imbalanced data learning.",

        "author": "Simon Lacoste-Julien; Fredrik Lindsten; Francis Bach",
        "abstract": "Recently, the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm was suggested as a procedure to obtain adaptive quadrature rules for integrals of functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a potentially faster rate of convergence than Monte Carlo integration (and \u201ckernel herding\u201d was shown to be a special case of this procedure). In this paper, we propose to replace the random sampling step in a particle filter by Frank-Wolfe optimization. By optimizing the position of the particles, we can obtain better accuracy than random or quasi-Monte Carlo sampling.

        "abstract": "This paper studies the off-policy evaluation problem, where one aims to estimate the value of a target policy based on a sample of observations collected by another policy.

Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gaertner et. al, 2002] in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].",

However, it is well-established that in the high-dimensional setting (p > N) the underlying projection estimator degenerates. Moreover, any linear discriminate function involving a large number of features may be difficult to interpret. To ameliorate these issues, two general categories of sparse LDA modifications have been proposed, both to reduce the number of active features and to stabilize the resulting projections. The first, based on optimal scoring, is more straightforward to implement and analyze but has been heavily criticized for its ambiguous connection with the original LDA formulation. In contrast, a second strategy applies sparse penalty functions directly to the original LDA objective but requires additional heuristic trade-off parameters, has unknown global and local minima properties, and requires a greedy sequential optimization procedure. In all cases the choice of sparse regularizer can be important, but no rigorous guidelines have been provided regarding which penalty might be preferable. Against this backdrop, we winnow down the broad space of candidate sparse LDA algorithms and promote a specific selection based on optimal scoring coupled with a particular, complementary sparse regularizer.

For massive data, it is necessary to store and process subsets on different machines in a distributed manner. We propose a simple, general, and highly efficient approach, which first runs a posterior sampling algorithm in parallel on different machines for subsets of a large data set. To combine these subset posteriors, we calculate the Wasserstein barycenter via a highly efficient linear program. The resulting estimate for the Wasserstein posterior (WASP) has an atomic form, facilitating straightforward estimation of posterior summaries of functionals of interest. The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data. We provide theoretical justification in terms of posterior consistency and algorithm efficiency.  Examples are provided in complex settings including Gaussian process regression and nonparametric Bayes mixture models.",
