The problem is technically challenging because the parametric part is unconstrained and the model is underdetermined, while the response is allowed to be unbounded with subgaussian tails. Under natural regularity conditions, we bound the generalization error as a function of the metric entropy of \\mathcalH and the dimension of the linear model. Our main tool is a ratio-type concentration inequality for increments of empirical processes, based on which we are able to give an exponential tail bound on the size of the parametric component. We also provide a comparison to alternatives of this technique and discuss why and when the unconstrained parametric part in the model may cause a problem in terms of the expected risk. We also explain by means of a specific example why this problem cannot be detected using the results of classical asymptotic analysis often seen in the statistics literature.",

Experimental results on three diverse datasets comparing NCRF to a few baseline alternatives give evidence of its robust learning, remarkable predictive performance, good mixing and computational efficiency.}\n}",

However, in some applications,  e.g., large-scale collaborative filtering and tensor factorization,  VB is still computationally too costly.  In such cases,   looser approximations  such as MAP estimation and partially Bayesian (PB) learning,  where a part of the parameters are point-estimated,  seem attractive.  In this paper,   we theoretically investigate the behavior of the MAP and the PB solutions of matrix factorization.  A notable finding is that the global solutions of MAP and PB in the empirical Bayesian scenario,  where the hyperparameters are also estimated from observation,  are trivial and useless,  while  their local solutions behave similarly to the global solution of VB.

However, in some applications,  e.g., large-scale collaborative filtering and tensor factorization,  VB is still computationally too costly.  In such cases,   looser approximations  such as MAP estimation and partially Bayesian (PB) learning,  where a part of the parameters are point-estimated,  seem attractive.  In this paper,   we theoretically investigate the behavior of the MAP and the PB solutions of matrix factorization.  A notable finding is that the global solutions of MAP and PB in the empirical Bayesian scenario,  where the hyperparameters are also estimated from observation,  are trivial and useless,  while  their local solutions behave similarly to the global solution of VB.  This suggests that empirical MAP and empirical PB with local search can be alternatives to empirical VB  equipped with the useful automatic relevance determination property.

The first problem studied is that of class proportion estimation, which is the problem of estimating the class proportions in an unlabeled testing data set given labeled examples of each class. Compared to previous work on this problem, our approach has the novel feature that it does not require labeled training data from one of the classes. This property allows us to address the second domain adaptation problem, namely, multiclass anomaly rejection. Here, the goal is to design a classifier that has the option of assigning a \u201creject\u201d label, indicating that the instance did not arise from a class present in the training data.

The first problem studied is that of class proportion estimation, which is the problem of estimating the class proportions in an unlabeled testing data set given labeled examples of each class. Compared to previous work on this problem, our approach has the novel feature that it does not require labeled training data from one of the classes. This property allows us to address the second domain adaptation problem, namely, multiclass anomaly rejection. Here, the goal is to design a classifier that has the option of assigning a \u201creject\u201d label, indicating that the instance did not arise from a class present in the training data.

Joint estimation of the parameters of all the layers is a difficult nonconvex optimization.

Such models often exhibit considerable symmetry, and it is a challenge to devise algorithms that exploit this symmetry to speed up inference.   Here we address this task in the context of the MAP inference problem and its linear programming relaxations. We show that symmetry in these problems  can be discovered using an elegant algorithm known as the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (k-WL) algorithm. We run k-WL on the original graphical model, and not on the far larger graph of the linear program (LP) as proposed in earlier work in the field. Furthermore, the algorithm is polynomial and thus far more practical than other previous approaches which rely on orbit partitions that are GI complete to find. The fact that k-WL can be used in this manner follows from the recently introduced notion of k-local LPs and their relation to Sherali Adams relaxations of graph automorphisms. Finally, for relational models such as Markov logic networks, the benefits of our approach are even more dramatic, as we can discover symmetries in the original domain graph, as opposed to running lifting on the much larger grounded model.",

We run k-WL on the original graphical model, and not on the far larger graph of the linear program (LP) as proposed in earlier work in the field. Furthermore, the algorithm is polynomial and thus far more practical than other previous approaches which rely on orbit partitions that are GI complete to find. The fact that k-WL can be used in this manner follows from the recently introduced notion of k-local LPs and their relation to Sherali Adams relaxations of graph automorphisms. Finally, for relational models such as Markov logic networks, the benefits of our approach are even more dramatic, as we can discover symmetries in the original domain graph, as opposed to running lifting on the much larger grounded model.}\n}",

        "abstract": "MinHash and SimHash are the two widely adopted Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithms for large-scale data processing applications. Deciding which LSH to use for a particular problem at hand is an important question, which has no clear answer in the existing  literature. In this study, we provide a theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always outperforms  SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as search.      The collision probability of MinHash is a function of  \\em resemblance similarity (\\mathcalR), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of  \\em cosine  similarity (\\mathcalS). To provide a common basis for  comparison,  we evaluate  retrieval results in terms of \\mathcalS for both MinHash and SimHash. This evaluation is valid  as we can prove that MinHash is  a valid LSH with respect to \\mathcalS, by using a  general inequality  \\mathcalS^2\u2264\\mathcalR\u2264\\frac\\mathcalS2-\\mathcalS.

Deciding which LSH to use for a particular problem at hand is an important question, which has no clear answer in the existing  literature. In this study, we provide a theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always outperforms  SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as search.      The collision probability of MinHash is a function of  \\em resemblance similarity (\\mathcalR), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of  \\em cosine  similarity (\\mathcalS). To provide a common basis for  comparison,  we evaluate  retrieval results in terms of \\mathcalS for both MinHash and SimHash.

        "abstract": "Latent vector autoregressive models for categorical time series have a wide range of potential applications from marketing research to healthcare analytics. However, a brute-force particle filter implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm often fails to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters due to the Monte Carlo approximation of the E-step and multiple local optima of the log-likelihood function. This paper proposes two auxiliary techniques that help stabilize and calibrate the estimated parameters. These two techniques, namely \\textitasymptotic mean regularization and \\textitlow-resolution augmentation, do not require any additional parameter tuning, and can be implemented by modifying the brute-force EM algorithm.

However, a brute-force particle filter implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm often fails to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters due to the Monte Carlo approximation of the E-step and multiple local optima of the log-likelihood function. This paper proposes two auxiliary techniques that help stabilize and calibrate the estimated parameters. These two techniques, namely \\textitasymptotic mean regularization and \\textitlow-resolution augmentation, do not require any additional parameter tuning, and can be implemented by modifying the brute-force EM algorithm.

Our approach is based on the following key result that we prove in the paper: if an MLN has no shared terms then MAP inference over it can be reduced to MAP inference over a Markov network having the following properties: (i) the number of random variables in the Markov network is equal to the number of first-order atoms in the MLN; and (ii) the domain size of each variable in the Markov network is equal to the number of groundings of the corresponding first-order atom. We show that inference over this Markov network is exponentially more efficient than ground inference, namely inference over the Markov network obtained by grounding all first-order atoms in the MLN. We improve this result further by showing that if non-shared MLNs contain no self joins, namely every atom appears at most once in each of its formulas, then all variables in the corresponding Markov network need only be bi-valued.  Our approach is quite general and can be easily applied to an arbitrary MLN by simply grounding all of its shared terms. The key feature of our approach is that because we reduce lifted inference to propositional inference, we can use any propositional MAP inference algorithm for performing lifted MAP inference. Within our approach, we experimented with two propositional MAP inference algorithms: Gurobi and MaxWalkSAT. Our experiments on several benchmark MLNs clearly demonstrate our approach is superior to ground MAP inference in terms of scalability and solution quality.",

Our new bound has a clear interpretation and reveals meaningful structural properties of the linear regression problem that makes it solvable effectively in a small dimensional random subspace.

In practice, however, due to its cubic time complexity with respect to the rank of factor matrices, existing variational inference algorithms for BMF are not well suited to web-scale datasets where billions of ratings provided by millions of users are available. The time complexity even increases when the side information, such as user binary implicit feedback or item content information, is incorporated into variational Bayesian matrix factorization (VBMF).

Since this approach introduces additional cubic time complexity with respect to the size of feature vectors, the use of rich side information in a form of high-dimensional feature vector is prohibited. In this paper, we present a scalable inference for VBMF with side information, the complexity of which is linear in the rank K of factor matrices.

Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node.

In this paper, we propose MAD-Sketch, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which compactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a randomized data structure.

We support our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe that MAD-Sketch achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art graph-based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at the same time achieving up to 10x speedup.

We apply the method to Gaussian process classification, a situation where the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimized in traditional VB can be infinite, and to robust Gaussian process regression, where the inference process is dramatically simplified in comparison to EP.    Code to reproduce all the experiments can be found at github.com/SheffieldML/TVB.}\n}",

While the first approach is very problem-specific, the second approach has computational overheads in learning multiple layers and fine-tuning of the model. In this paper, we propose an approach called wide learning based on arc-cosine kernels, that learns a single layer of infinite width.
