We generalize a recent static co-occurrence model, the CODE model of Globerson et al. (2004), to the dynamic setting: we seek coordinates for each entity at each time step. The coordinates can change with time to explain new observations, but since large changes are improbable, we can exploit data at previous and subsequent steps to find a better explanation for current observations. To make inference tractable, we show how to approximate our observation model with a Gaussian distribution, allowing the use of a Kalman filter for tractable inference. The result is the first algorithm for dynamic embedding of co-occurrence data which provides distributional information for its coordinate estimates.

We demonstrate our model both on synthetic data and on author-word data from the NIPS corpus, showing that it produces intuitively reasonable embeddings. We also provide evidence for the usefulness of our model by its performance on an author-prediction task.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Although clustering data into mutually exclusive partitions has been an extremely successful approach to unsupervised learning, there are many situations in which a richer model is needed to fully represent the data.  This is the case in problems where data points actually simultaneously belong to multiple, overlapping clusters. For example a particular gene may have several functions, therefore belonging to several distinct clusters of genes, and a biologist may want to discover these through unsupervised modeling of gene expression data. We present a new nonparametric Bayesian method, the Infinite Overlapping Mixture Model (IOMM), for modeling overlapping clusters. The IOMM uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster and forms an overlapping mixture by taking products of such distributions, much like products of experts (Hinton, 2002). The IOMM allows an unbounded number of clusters, and assignments of points to (multiple) clusters is modeled using an Indian Buffet Process (IBP), (Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2006). The IOMM has the desirable properties of being able to focus in on overlapping regions while maintaining the ability to model a potentially infinite number of clusters which may overlap. We derive MCMC inference algorithms for the IOMM and show that these can be used to cluster movies into multiple genres.",

        "abstract": "Analogical reasoning depends fundamentally on the ability to learn and generalize about relations between objects. There are many ways in which objects can be related, making automated analogical reasoning very challenging. Here we develop an approach which, given a set of pairs of related objects S = {A^1:B^1, A^2:B^2, ..., A^N:B^N }, measures how well other pairs A:B fit in with the set S. This addresses the question: is the relation between objects A and B analogous to those relations found in S? We recast this classical problem as a problem of Bayesian analysis of relational data. This problem is nontrivial because direct similarity between objects is not a good way of measuring analogies. For instance, the analogy between an electron around the nucleus of an atom and a planet around the Sun is hardly justified by isolated, non-relational, comparisons of an electron to a planet, and a nucleus to the Sun. We develop a generative model for predicting the existence of relationships and extend the framework of Ghahramani and Heller (2005) to provide a Bayesian measure for how analogous a relation is to other relations. This sheds new light on an old problem, which we motivate and illustrate through practical applications in exploratory data analysis.",

Our results show that we find better local minima compared to the heuristic methods those problems are usually solved with. However this does not always translate into a better test error suggesting an inadequacy of the objective function.

Here we present an efficient algorithm for choosing the optimal (most informative) query when the output labels are related to the inputs by a generalized linear model (GLM). The algorithm is based on a Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution of the GLM's parameters. The algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a single two-dimensional search to choose the optimal query and has complexity $O(n^2)$ (with $n$ the dimension of the feature space), making active learning with GLMs feasible even for high-dimensional feature spaces. In certain cases the twodimensional search may be reduced to a onedimensional search, further improving the algorithm's efficiency. Simulation results show that the model parameters can be estimated much more efficiently using the active learning technique than by using randomly chosen queries. We compute the asymptotic posterior covariance semi-analytically and demonstrate that the algorithm empirically achieves this asymptotic convergence rate, which is generally better than the convergence rate in the random-query setting. Finally, we generalize the approach to efficiently handle both output history effects (for applications to time-series models of autoregressive type) and slow, non-systematic drifts in the model parameters",

        "abstract": "The Support Vector Machine (SVM) has become one of the most popular machine learning techniques in recent years. The success of the SVM is mostly due to its elegant margin concept and theory in binary classification. Generalization to the multicategory setting, however, is not trivial.

A priority-driven search algorithm is guaranteed to return the optimal answer if the priority function is an underestimate of the true cost function. We introduce the notion of a probable approximate underestimate, and show that it can be used to compute a probable approximate solution to the inference problem when used as a priority function. We show that we can learn probable approximate underestimate functions which have the functional form of simpler, easy to decode models. These models can be learned from unlabeled data by solving a linear/quadratic optimization problem. As a result, we get a priority function that can be computed quickly, and results in solutions that are (provably) almost optimal most of the time. Using these ideas, discriminative classifiers such as semi-Markov CRFs and discriminative parsers can be sped up using a generalization of the A* algorithm. Further, this technique resolves one of the biggest obstacles to the use of A* as a general decoding procedure, namely that of coming up with a admissible priority function. Applying this technique results in a algorithm that is more than 3 times as fast as the Viterbi algorithm for decoding semi-Markov Conditional Markov Models.",

We introduce the notion of a probable approximate underestimate, and show that it can be used to compute a probable approximate solution to the inference problem when used as a priority function. We show that we can learn probable approximate underestimate functions which have the functional form of simpler, easy to decode models. These models can be learned from unlabeled data by solving a linear/quadratic optimization problem. As a result, we get a priority function that can be computed quickly, and results in solutions that are (provably) almost optimal most of the time. Using these ideas, discriminative classifiers such as semi-Markov CRFs and discriminative parsers can be sped up using a generalization of the A* algorithm. Further, this technique resolves one of the biggest obstacles to the use of A* as a general decoding procedure, namely that of coming up with a admissible priority function. Applying this technique results in a algorithm that is more than 3 times as fast as the Viterbi algorithm for decoding semi-Markov Conditional Markov Models.}\n}",

The method is a variation on and generalization of the method recently introduced by Montanari and Rizzo [2005]. It consists of two steps: (i) standard BP is used to calculate cavity distributions for each variable (i.e. probability distributions on the Markov blanket of a variable for a modified graphical model, in which the factors involving that variable have been removed); (ii) all cavity distributions are combined by a messagepassing algorithm to obtain consistent single node marginals. The method is exact if the graphical model contains a single loop. The complexity of the method is exponential in the size of the Markov blankets. The results are very accurate in general: the error is often several orders of magnitude smaller than that of standard BP, as illustrated by numerical experiments.",

In this paper, we construct a novel algorithm for supervised metric learning, which learns a distance function by directly minimizing the leave-one-out regression error. We show that our algorithm makes kernel regression comparable with the state of the art on several benchmark datasets, and we provide efficient implementation details enabling application to datasets with \u00a0O(10k) instances.

We show that our algorithm makes kernel regression comparable with the state of the art on several benchmark datasets, and we provide efficient implementation details enabling application to datasets with \u00a0O(10k) instances. Further, we show that our algorithm can be viewed as a supervised variation of PCA and can be used for dimensionality reduction and high dimensional data visualization.}\n}",

MVE follows an approach similar to algorithms such as Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), in that it learns a kernel matrix using an SDP before applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). However, the objective function for MVE directly optimizes the eigenspectrum of the data to preserve as much of its energy as possible within the few dimensions available to the embedding. Simultaneously, remaining eigenspectrum energy is minimized in directions orthogonal to the embedding thereby keeping data in a so-called minimum volume manifold.

        "abstract": "The Logistic-Normal Topic Admixture Model (LoNTAM), also known as correlated topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), is a promising and expressive admixture-based text model. It can capture topic correlations via the use of a logistic-normal distribution to model non-trivial variabilities in the topic mixing vectors underlying documents. However, the non-conjugacy caused by the logistic-normal makes posterior inference and model learning significantly more challenging.

        "abstract": "Kernel methods implicitly map data points from the input space to some feature space where even relatively simple algorithms such as linear methods can deliver very impressive performance. Of crucial importance though is the choice of the kernel function, which determines the mapping between the input space and the feature space. The past few years have seen many efforts in learning either the kernel function or the kernel matrix. In this paper, we study the problem of learning the kernel hyperparameter in the context of the kernelized LASSO regression model. Specifically, we propose a solution path algorithm with respect to the hyperparameter of the kernel function.

Of crucial importance though is the choice of the kernel function, which determines the mapping between the input space and the feature space. The past few years have seen many efforts in learning either the kernel function or the kernel matrix. In this paper, we study the problem of learning the kernel hyperparameter in the context of the kernelized LASSO regression model. Specifically, we propose a solution path algorithm with respect to the hyperparameter of the kernel function. As the kernel hyperparameter changes its value, the solution path can be traced exactly without having to train the model multiple times. As a result, the optimal solution can be identified efficiently. Some simulation results will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed kernel path algorithm.}\n}",
