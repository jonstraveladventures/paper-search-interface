Based on projected gradient descent and the double thresholding operator, our proposed generic algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unknown low-rank and sparse matrices at a locally linear rate, while matching the best-known robustness guarantee (i.e., tolerance for sparsity).

From this initialization we show theoretically and experimentally that EM converges exponentially fast to the true model parameters.

In this study, we explore whether one iteration of k-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with C at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is typically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many hidden states tractable.

The basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear complexity of O(NCD) required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity.

We focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with O(NG\u00b2D), and variational k-means, scaling with O(NGD) per iteration. Empirical results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as k-means.

Under the assumption of an independence between the function relating cause and effect, the conditional noise distribution, and the distribution of the cause, we show that the errors are smaller in causal direction if both variables are equally scaled and the causal relation is close to deterministic.

        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in learning algorithms that involve interaction between hu- man and machine. Comparison-based queries are among the most natural ways to get feed- back from humans. A challenge in designing comparison-based interactive learning algorithms is coping with noisy answers. The most common fix is to submit a query several times, but this is not applicable in many situations due to its prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of independent noise in different repetitions of the same query. In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about the answer. This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human in noise-prone regions. We also consider the ap- plication of this weak oracle model to the problem of content search (a variant of the nearest neighbor search problem) through comparisons. More specifically, we aim at devising efficient algorithms to locate a target object in a database equipped with a dissimilarity metric via invocation of the weak comparison oracle. We propose two algorithms termed Worcs-I and Worcs-II (Weak-Oracle Comparison- based Search), which provably locate the tar- get object in a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the target distribution. While Worcs-I provides better theoretical guarantees, Worcs-II is applicable to more technically challenging scenarios where the algorithm has limited access to the ranking dis- similarity between objects. A series of experiments validate the performance of our proposed algorithms.",

Combining the local permutation scheme with these kernel tests leads to better calibration but lower power.  For smaller sample sizes and lower dimensions, the proposed test is faster than random fourier feature-based kernel tests if (embarrassingly) parallelized, but the runtime increases more sharply with sample size and dimensionality.

        "abstract": "Value aggregation is a general framework for solving imitation learning problems. Based on the idea of data aggregation, it generates a policy sequence by iteratively interleaving policy optimization and evaluation in an online learning setting. While the existence of a good policy in the policy sequence can be guaranteed non-asymptotically, little is known about the convergence of the sequence or the performance of the last policy. In this paper, we debunk the common belief that value aggregation always produces a convergent policy sequence with improving performance.

We then use MPC to find a control sequence that minimises the expected long-term cost. We provide theoretical guarantees for first-order optimality in the GP-based transition models with deterministic approximate inference for long-term planning.

To do this, we follow a hierarchical approach, where we first learn the parameters that are to be tied using a non-relational learner. We then use a relational learner to learn the tied-parameter MLN with initial values derived from parameters learned by the non-relational learner.

The model is learned by fitting the derivative of the log density, the score, thus avoiding the need to compute a normalization constant. We improved the computational efficiency of an earlier solution with a low-rank, Nystr\u00f6m-like solution. The new solution retains the consistency and convergence rates of the full-rank solution (exactly in Fisher distance, and nearly in other distances), with guarantees on the degree of cost and storage reduction.

We demonstrate our technique by analyzing 2.7 million police stops of pedestrians in New York City.}\n}",

It is known that GBS obtains the gold standard query cost of O(log n) for problems satisfying the k-neighborly condition, which requires any two tests to be connected by a sequence of tests where neighboring tests disagree on at most k hypotheses. In this paper, we introduce a weaker condition, split-neighborly, which requires that for the set of hypotheses two neighbors disagree on, any subset is splittable by some test.

Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces severely after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a deep network is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model, and thus the parameter gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods often suffer not only from degeneration of the convergence speed but also from limitations in the representational power of the trained network. To overcome this issue, we propose an additional layer called the gradient layer to seek a descent direction in an infinite-dimensional space. Because the layer is constructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are not restricted by the specific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As a result, we can get out of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move towards the global optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon is explained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient layer. Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer naturally constructs the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we demonstrate that this procedure can be regarded as a discretization method of the gradient flow that naturally reduces the objective function. Finally, the method is tested using several numerical experiments, which show its fast convergence.",

        "abstract": "We consider the statistical problem of recovering a hidden \"ground truth\" binary labeling for the vertices of a graph up to low Hamming error from noisy edge and vertex measurements.  We present new algorithms and a sharp finite-sample analysis for this problem on trees and sparse graphs with poor expansion properties such as hypergrids and ring lattices. Our method generalizes and improves over that of Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices. For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground truth with optimal Hamming error has optimal sample complexity and implies recovery results for all connected graphs. Here, the presence of side information is critical to obtain a non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to tree decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain graph families such as lattices, resulting in optimal recovery error rates that can be obtained efficiently The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2) apply an analysis influenced by statistical learning theory to show that we can infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements.

We present new algorithms and a sharp finite-sample analysis for this problem on trees and sparse graphs with poor expansion properties such as hypergrids and ring lattices. Our method generalizes and improves over that of Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices. For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground truth with optimal Hamming error has optimal sample complexity and implies recovery results for all connected graphs. Here, the presence of side information is critical to obtain a non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to tree decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain graph families such as lattices, resulting in optimal recovery error rates that can be obtained efficiently The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2) apply an analysis influenced by statistical learning theory to show that we can infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements.

        "abstract": "Most second order methods are inapplicable to large scale empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems because both, the number of samples N and number of parameters p are large. Large N makes it costly to evaluate Hessians and large p makes it costly to invert Hessians.

        "abstract": "The problem of low-rank matrix completion is continually attracting attention for its applicability to many real-world problems. Still, the large size, extreme sparsity, and non-uniformity of these matrices pose a challenge. In this paper, we make the observation that even when the observed matrix is too sparse for accurate completion, there may be portions of the data where completion is still possible. We propose the completeID algorithm, which exploits the non-uniformity of the observation, to analyze the completability of the input instead of blindly applying completion. Balancing statistical accuracy with computational efficiency, we relate completability to edge-connectivity of the graph associated with the input partially-observed matrix.

Still, the large size, extreme sparsity, and non-uniformity of these matrices pose a challenge. In this paper, we make the observation that even when the observed matrix is too sparse for accurate completion, there may be portions of the data where completion is still possible. We propose the completeID algorithm, which exploits the non-uniformity of the observation, to analyze the completability of the input instead of blindly applying completion. Balancing statistical accuracy with computational efficiency, we relate completability to edge-connectivity of the graph associated with the input partially-observed matrix. We develop the MaxKCD algorithm for finding maximally k-edge-connected components efficiently. Experiments across datasets from a variety of applications demonstrate not only the success of completeID but also the importance of completability analysis.}\n}",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose the multi-objective contextual bandit problem with similarity information. This problem extends the classical contextual bandit problem with similarity information by introducing multiple and possibly conflicting objectives. Since the best arm in each objective can be different given the context, learning the best arm based on a single objective can jeopardize the rewards obtained from the other objectives. To handle this issue, we define a new performance metric, called the contextual Pareto regret, to evaluate the performance of the learner. Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret is the sum of the distances of the arms chosen by the learner to the context dependent Pareto front. For this problem, we develop a new online learning algorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ), which exploits the idea of contextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to the Pareto front for each observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint context-arm set according to the observed rewards and locations of the  context-arm pairs selected in the past. Then, we prove that PCZ achieves $\\tilde O (T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ Pareto regret where $d_p$ is the Pareto zooming dimension that depends on the size of the set of near-optimal context-arm pairs. Moreover, we show that this regret bound is nearly optimal by providing an almost matching $\u03a9(T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ lower bound.",

To facilitate understanding of the target hypothesis, it is crucial for the teaching algorithm to use examples which are interpretable to the human learner. In this paper, we propose NOTES, a principled framework for constructing interpretable teaching sets, utilizing explanations to accelerate the teaching process. Our algorithm is built upon a natural stochastic model of learners and a novel submodular surrogate objective function which greedily selects interpretable teaching examples. We prove that NOTES is competitive with the optimal explanation-based teaching strategy. We further instantiate NOTES with a specific hypothesis class, which can be viewed as an interpretable approximation of any hypothesis class, allowing us to handle complex hypothesis in practice.

To facilitate understanding of the target hypothesis, it is crucial for the teaching algorithm to use examples which are interpretable to the human learner. In this paper, we propose NOTES, a principled framework for constructing interpretable teaching sets, utilizing explanations to accelerate the teaching process. Our algorithm is built upon a natural stochastic model of learners and a novel submodular surrogate objective function which greedily selects interpretable teaching examples. We prove that NOTES is competitive with the optimal explanation-based teaching strategy. We further instantiate NOTES with a specific hypothesis class, which can be viewed as an interpretable approximation of any hypothesis class, allowing us to handle complex hypothesis in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NOTES on several image classification tasks, for both simulated and real human learners.

Our approach is nonparametric: we assume that each item i and each user u have unobserved features x_i and y_u, and that the associated rating is given by $g_u(f(x_i,y_u))$ where f is Lipschitz and g_u is a monotonic transformation that depends on the user. We propose a k-nearest neighbors-like algorithm and prove that it is consistent.

Recent work has focused on learning such models using inference (or recognition) networks; we identify a crucial problem when modeling large, sparse, high-dimensional datasets \u2013 underfitting. We study the extent of underfitting, highlighting that its severity increases with the sparsity of the data.

Although well studied in human learning and increasingly in machine learning, we lack formal frameworks through which we may reason about the benefits and limitations of cooperative inference. We present such a framework. We introduce novel indices for measuring the effectiveness of probabilistic and cooperative information transmission. We relate our indices to the well-known Teaching Dimension in deterministic settings. We prove conditions under which optimal cooperative inference can be achieved, including a representation theorem that constrains the form of inductive biases for learners optimized for cooperative inference.

        "abstract": "Variational inference is a powerful approach for approximate posterior inference. However, it is sensitive to initialization and can be subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we develop proximity variational inference (PVI). PVI is a new method for optimizing the variational objective that constrains subsequent iterates of the variational parameters to robustify the optimization path. Consequently, PVI is less sensitive to initial- ization and optimization quirks and finds better local optima. We demonstrate our method on four proximity statistics. We study PVI on a Bernoulli factor model and sigmoid belief network fit to real and synthetic data and compare to deterministic annealing (Katahira et al., 2008). We highlight the flexibility of PVI by designing a proximity statistic for Bayesian deep learning models such as the variational autoencoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) and show that it gives better performance by reducing overpruning. PVI also yields improved predictions in a deep generative model of text. Empirically, we show that PVI consistently finds better local optima and gives better predictive performance.",

Combinatorial optimization algorithms may enable efficient point estimation, but fully Bayesian inference poses a severe challenge in this high-dimensional, discrete space. To surmount this challenge, we start by relaxing the discrete set of permutation matrices to its convex hull the Birkhoff polytope, the set of doubly-stochastic matrices.  We then introduce two novel transformations: an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope, and a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope.

To surmount this challenge, we start by relaxing the discrete set of permutation matrices to its convex hull the Birkhoff polytope, the set of doubly-stochastic matrices.  We then introduce two novel transformations: an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope, and a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope.

In this paper, we present a new model for learning robust locally-linear controllable embedding (RCE). Our model directly estimates the predictive conditional density of the future observation given the current one, while introducing the bottleneck between the current and future observations. Although the bottleneck provides a natural embedding candidate for control, our RCE model introduces additional specific structures in the generative graphical model so that the model dynamics can be robustly linearized.

We propose a framework for training supervised latent Dirichlet allocation that balances two goals: faithful generative explanations of high-dimensional data and accurate prediction of associated class labels. Existing approaches fail to balance these goals by not properly handling a fundamental asymmetry: the intended application is always predicting labels from data, not data from labels.

We propose a novel rejection sampling step that discards samples from the variational posterior which are assigned low likelihoods by the model. Our approach provides an arbitrarily accurate approximation of the true posterior at the expense of extra computation. Using a new gradient estimator for the resulting unnormalized proposal distribution, we achieve average improvements of 3.71 nats and 0.31 nats over state-of-the-art single-sample and multi-sample alternatives respectively for estimating marginal log-likelihoods using sigmoid belief networks on the MNIST dataset. We show both theoretically and empirically how explicitly rejecting samples, while seemingly challenging to analyze due to the implicit nature of the resulting unnormalized proposal distribution, can have benefits over the competing state-of-the-art alternatives based on importance weighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach via experiments on synthetic data and a benchmark density estimation task with sigmoid belief networks over the MNIST dataset.",

One general class of algorithms for optimizing interactions with the world, while simultaneously learning how the world operates, is the multi-armed bandit setting and, in particular, the contextual bandit case. In this setting, for each executed action, one observes rewards that are dependent on a given \u2019context\u2019, available at each interaction with the world. The Thompson sampling algorithm has recently been shown to enjoy provable optimality properties for this set of problems, and to perform well in real-world settings. It facilitates  generative and interpretable modeling of the problem at hand. Nevertheless, the design and complexity of the model limit its application, since one must both sample from the distributions modeled and calculate their expected rewards. We here show how these limitations can be overcome using variational inference to approximate complex models, applying to the reinforcement learning case advances developed for the inference case in the machine learning community over the past two decades. We consider contextual multi-armed bandit applications where the true reward distribution is unknown and complex, which we approximate with a mixture model whose parameters are inferred via variational inference. We show how the proposed variational Thompson sampling approach is accurate in approximating the true distribution, and attains reduced regrets even with complex reward distributions. The proposed algorithm is valuable for practical scenarios where restrictive modeling assumptions are undesirable.",
