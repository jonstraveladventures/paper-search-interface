The framework is not restricted to dependent versions of a specific nonparametric model, but can be applied to all models that can be represented using completely random measures. Several existing dependent random measures can be seen as specific cases of this framework. Interesting properties of the resulting measures are derived and the efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by constructing a covariate-dependent latent  feature model and topic model that obtain superior predictive performance.",

Various methods for lifted probabilistic inference have been proposed, but our understanding of these methods and the relationships between them is still limited, compared to their propositional counterparts. The only existing theoretical characterization of lifting is a completeness result for weighted first-order model counting. This paper addresses the question whether the same completeness result holds for other lifted inference algorithms. We answer this question positively for lifted variable elimination (LVE). Our proof relies on introducing a novel inference operator for LVE.",

        "author": "James Sharpnack; Aarti Singh; Akshay Krishnamurthy",
        "abstract": "We consider the detection of clusters of activation over graphs under Gaussian noise.  This problem appears in many real world scenarios, such as the detecting contamination or seismic activity by sensor networks, viruses in human and computer networks, and groups with anomalous behavior in social and biological networks.  Despite the wide applicability of such a detection algorithm, there has been little success in the development of computationally feasible methods with provable theoretical guarantees.  To this end, we introduce the spanning tree wavelet basis over a graph, a localized basis that reflects the topology of the graph.  We first provide a necessary condition for asymptotic distinguishability of the null and alternative hypotheses.  Then we prove that for any spanning tree, we can hope to correctly detect signals in a low signal-to-noise regime using spanning tree wavelets.  We propose a randomized test, in which we use a uniform spanning tree in the basis construction.  Using electrical network theory, we show that the uniform spanning tree provides strong guarantees that in many cases match our necessary condition.

This problem appears in many real world scenarios, such as the detecting contamination or seismic activity by sensor networks, viruses in human and computer networks, and groups with anomalous behavior in social and biological networks.  Despite the wide applicability of such a detection algorithm, there has been little success in the development of computationally feasible methods with provable theoretical guarantees.  To this end, we introduce the spanning tree wavelet basis over a graph, a localized basis that reflects the topology of the graph.  We first provide a necessary condition for asymptotic distinguishability of the null and alternative hypotheses.  Then we prove that for any spanning tree, we can hope to correctly detect signals in a low signal-to-noise regime using spanning tree wavelets.  We propose a randomized test, in which we use a uniform spanning tree in the basis construction.  Using electrical network theory, we show that the uniform spanning tree provides strong guarantees that in many cases match our necessary condition.

Not surprisingly, learning networks that closely match the given data and have a bounded tree-width has recently attracted some attention.  In this paper we aim to lay groundwork for future research on the topic by studying the exact complexity of this problem. We give the first non-trivial exact algorithm for the NP-hard problem of finding an optimal Bayesian network of tree-width at most w, with running time 3^n n^w + O(1), and provide an implementation of this algorithm. Additionally, we propose a variant of Bayesian network learning with \u201csuper-structures\u201d, and show that finding a Bayesian network consistent with a given super-structure is fixed-parameter tractable in the tree-width of the super-structure.",
