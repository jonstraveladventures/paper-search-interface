        "abstract": "We propose a sequential learning policy for noisy discrete global optimization and ranking and selection (R&S) problems with high dimensional sparse belief functions, where there are hundreds or even thousands of features, but only a small portion of these features contain explanatory power. Our problem setting, motivated by the experimental sciences, arises where we have to choose which experiment to run next. Here the experiments are time-consuming and expensive. We derive a sparse knowledge gradient (SpKG) decision policy based on the \\ell_1-penalized regression Lasso to identify the sparsity pattern before our budget is exhausted. This policy is a unique and novel hybrid of Bayesian R&S with a frequentist learning approach. Theoretically, we provide the error bound of the posterior mean estimate, which has shown to be at the minimax optimal \\sqrts\\log p/n rate.

Our problem setting, motivated by the experimental sciences, arises where we have to choose which experiment to run next. Here the experiments are time-consuming and expensive. We derive a sparse knowledge gradient (SpKG) decision policy based on the \\ell_1-penalized regression Lasso to identify the sparsity pattern before our budget is exhausted. This policy is a unique and novel hybrid of Bayesian R&S with a frequentist learning approach. Theoretically, we provide the error bound of the posterior mean estimate, which has shown to be at the minimax optimal \\sqrts\\log p/n rate.

Typical applications include many popular statistical machine learning methods such as elastic-net regression, ridge penalized logistic regression, and sparse additive regression. Existing optimization literature has shown that the CBCD-type methods attain iteration complexity of O(p\u22c5\\log(1/\u03b5)),  where \u03b5is a pre-specified accuracy of the objective value, and p is the number of blocks. However, such iteration complexity explicitly depends on p, and therefore is at least p times worse than those of gradient descent methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved convergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show that for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity of the CBCD-type methods matches that of the GD methods in term of dependency on p (up to a \\log^2 p factor). Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a factor of p/\\log^2p. We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our improved complexity bounds are tight (up to a \\log^2 p factor) if the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix do not scale with p. Finally, we generalize our analysis to other strongly convex minimization problems beyond quadratic ones.",

Yet, kernel methods often require the user to select a predefined kernel to build an estimator with. However, there is often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a N \\times N Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of N instances.

However, they are also inefficient, requiring a complete re-execution of the program on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals. C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls.  It is particularly effective at speeding up recursive programs with many local latent variables.

An appealing alternative is to use tractable probabilistic models, such as arithmetic circuits (ACs) and sum-product networks (SPNs), in which marginal and conditional queries can be answered efficiently.  In this paper, we present the first discriminative structure learning algorithm for ACs, DACLearn (Discriminative AC Learner).  Like previous work on generative structure learning, DACLearn finds a log-linear model with conjunctive features, using the size of an equivalent AC representation as a learning bias.  Unlike previous work, DACLearn optimizes conditional likelihood, resulting in a more accurate conditional distribution.  DACLearn also learns much more compact ACs than generative methods, since it does not need to represent a consistent distribution over the evidence variables.  To ensure efficiency, DACLearn uses novel initialization and search heuristics to drastically reduce the number of feature evaluations required to learn an accurate model.  In experiments on 20 benchmark domains, we find that our DACLearn learns models that are more accurate and compact than other tractable generative and discriminative methods.",

Empirically, our approach is orders of magnitude more efficient than the state-of-the-art at enumerating equivalence classes.}\n}",

Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient for the clustering to be correct, due to the notorious \u201cgraph connectivity problem\u201d [15]. In this paper, we investigate the graph connectivity problem for noisy sparse sub-space clustering and show that a simple post-processing procedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering under certain \u201cgeneral position\u201d or \u201crestricted eigenvalue\u201d assumptions. We also show that our condition is almost tight with adversarial noise perturbation by constructing a counter-example. These results provide the first exact clustering guarantee of noisy SSC for subspaces of dimension greater then 3.}\n}",

A common approach is based on using Gaussian Process (GP) to model the objective function. Applying GP to higher dimensional settings is generally difficult due to the curse of dimensionality for nonparametric regression. Existing works makes strong assumptions such as the function is low-dimensional embedding (Wang et al., 2013) or is axis-aligned additive (Kandasamy et al., 2015). In this pa- per, we generalize the existing assumption to a projected-additive assumption. Our generalization provides the benefits of i) greatly increasing the space of functions that can be modeled by our approach, which covers the previous works (Wang et al., 2013; Kandasamy et al., 2015) as special cases, and ii) efficiently handling the learning in a larger model space. We prove that the regret for projected-additive functions has only linear dependence on the number of dimensions in this general setting. Directly using projected-additive GP (Gilboa et al., 2013) to BO results in a non-box constraint, which is not easy to optimize. We tackle this problem by proposing a restricted-projection-pursuit GP for BO. We conduct experiments on synthetic examples and scientific and hyper-parameter tuning tasks in many cases.

Since the agent\u2019s behavior originates in its policy and MDP policies depend on both the stochastic system dynamics as well as the reward function, the solution of the inverse problem is significantly influenced by both. Current IRL approaches assume that if the transition model is unknown, additional samples from the system\u2019s dynamics are accessible, or the observed behavior provides enough samples of the system\u2019s dynamics to solve the inverse problem accurately. These assumptions are often not satisfied. To overcome this, we present a gradient-based IRL approach that simultaneously estimates the system\u2019s dynamics. By solving the combined optimization problem, our approach takes into account the bias of the demonstrations, which stems from the generating policy. The evaluation on a synthetic MDP and a transfer learning task shows improvements regarding the sample efficiency as well as the accuracy of the estimated reward functions and transition models.",

For example, there may not be a well-defined \u201cbest\u201d distribution as there is in the standard bandit setting. The best distribution depends on the rewards that have been obtained and on the remaining time horizon. Whereas in the standard bandit setting, it is sensible to compare policies with an oracle which plays the single best arm, in the extreme bandit setting, there are multiple sensible oracle models.

The side-information is given as a multi-level structure, taxonomy, or ontology, with nodes at each level being categorical-valued observations. For example, when modeling documents with a two-level side-information (documents being at level-zero), level-one may represent (one or more) authors associated with each document and level-two may represent affiliations of each author. The model easily generalizes to more than two levels (or taxonomy/ontology of arbitrary depth). Our model can learn embeddings of entities present at each level in the data/side-information hierarchy (e.g., documents, authors, affiliations, in the previous example), with appropriate sharing of information across levels. The model also enjoys full local conjugacy, facilitating efficient Gibbs sampling for model inference. Inference cost scales in the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix, which is especially appealing for real-world massive but sparse matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model on several real-world data sets.",

As in the case of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), non-stationary algorithms are shown to exhibit better performance bounds compared to their stationary counterparts. The obtained bounds are generically composed of three terms: 1) a dependency on \u03b3(discount factor), 2) a concentrability coefficient and 3) a propagation error term. This error, depending on the algorithm, can be caused by a regression step, a policy evaluation step or a best-response evaluation step. As a second contribution, we empirically demonstrate, on generic MGs (called Garnets), that non-stationary algorithms outperform their stationary counterparts. In addition, it is shown that their performance mostly depends on the nature of the propagation error.

        "abstract": "Variational methods have been recently considered for scaling the training process of Gaussian process classifiers to large datasets. As an alternative, we describe here how to train these classifiers efficiently using expectation propagation (EP). The proposed EP method allows to train Gaussian process classifiers on very large datasets, with millions of instances, that were out of the reach of previous implementations of EP.

It is a flexible model that can capture highly-nonlinear functions for complex data sets. However, the network structure of DGP often makes inference computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient sequential inference framework for DGP, where the data is processed sequentially.

        "abstract": "Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) provides a concise set of basis vectors which capture non-linear structures within large data sets, and is a central tool in data analysis and learning.

The established practice requires a user-defined bounded domain, which is assumed to contain the global optimizer. However, when little is known about the probed objective function, it can be difficult to prescribe such a domain. In this work, we modify the standard Bayesian optimization framework in a principled way to allow for unconstrained exploration of the search space.

The established practice requires a user-defined bounded domain, which is assumed to contain the global optimizer. However, when little is known about the probed objective function, it can be difficult to prescribe such a domain. In this work, we modify the standard Bayesian optimization framework in a principled way to allow for unconstrained exploration of the search space.
