        "abstract": "We present a decentralized algorithm for estimating mutual 3-D poses in a group of mobile robots, such as a team of UAVs. Our algorithm uses bearing measurements reconstructed, e.g., by a visual sensor, and inertial measurements coming from the robot IMU. Since identification of a specific robot in a group would require visual tagging and may be cumbersome in practice, we simply assume that the bearing measurements are anonymous. The proposed localization method is a non-trivial extension of our previous algorithm for the 2-D case [1], and exhibits similar performance and robustness. An experimental validation of the algorithm has been performed using quadrotor UAVs.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are widely used to estimate the shape of the face together with its orientation, but AAM approaches tend to fail when the face is under wide angular variations. Although it is feasible to capture the overall 3D face structure using 3D data from range cameras, the locations of facial features are often estimated imprecisely or incorrectly due to depth measurement uncertainty. Face alignment using 2D and 3D images suffer from different issues and have varying reliability in different situations. The existing approaches introduce a weighting function to balance 2D and 3D alignments in which the weighting function is tuned manually and the sensor characteristics are not taken into account. In this paper, we propose to balance 3D face alignment using 2D and 3D data based on the observed data and the sensors characteristics. The feasibility of wide-angle face alignment is demonstrated using two different sets of depth and conventional cameras. The experimental results show that a stable alignment is achieved with a maximum improvement of 26% compared to 3D AAM using 2D image and 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art 3DMM methods in terms of 3D head pose estimation.",

A partitioned visual servoing control is used in order to generate the robot motion, keeping always the ball in the field of view of the camera. When the ball is detected, the camera mounted on the robot end-effector is commanded to follow a suitable baseline in order to acquire measurements and provide a first possible interception point through a linear estimation process. Thereafter, further visual measures are acquired in order to continuously refine the previous prediction through a non-linear estimation process. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",

The arrival time field is used for guiding the expansion of a randomized tree search in a favorable way, considering kinodynamic constraints of the robot.

To overcome the training issue, we introduce a methodology for learning 3D descriptors from synthetic CAD-models and classification of never-before-seen objects at the first glance, where classification rates and speed are suited for robotics tasks. We provide this in 3DNet (3d-net.org), a free resource for object class recognition and 6DOF pose estimation from point cloud data. 3DNet provides a large-scale hierarchical CAD-model databases with increasing numbers of classes and difficulty with 10, 50, 100 and 200 object classes together with evaluation datasets that contain thousands of scenes captured with a RGB-D sensor. 3DNet further provides an open-source framework based on the Point Cloud Library (PCL) for testing new descriptors and benchmarking of state-of-the-art descriptors together with pose estimation procedures to enable robotics tasks such as search and grasping.",

        "abstract": "The batteries of many consumer products are both a substantial portion of the product's cost and commonly a first point of failure. Accurately predicting remaining battery life can lower costs by reducing unnecessary battery replacements. Unfortunately, battery dynamics are extremely complex, and we often lack the domain knowledge required to construct a model by hand. In this work, we take a data-driven approach and aim to learn a model of battery time-to-death from training data. Using a Dirichlet process prior over mixture weights, we learn an infinite mixture model for battery health. The Bayesian aspect of our model helps to avoid over-fitting while the nonparametric nature of the model allows the data to control the size of the model, preventing under-fitting. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness by making time-to-death predictions using real data from nickel-metal hydride battery packs.",

The system enables MR image-guided placement of a curved, steerable active cannula. It is suitable for a variety of clinical applications including image-guided neurosurgery and percutaneous interventions, along with procedures that involve accessing a desired image target, through a curved trajectory. This 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic device is piezoelectrically actuated to provide precision motion with joint-level precision of better than 0.03mm, and is fully MRI-compatible allowing simultaneous robotic motion and imaging with no image quality degradation. The MRI compatibility of the robot has been evaluated under 3 Tesla MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences, with an average signal to noise ratio loss of less than 2% during actuator motion. The accuracy of active cannula control was evaluated in benchtop trials using an external optical tracking system with RMS error in tip placement of 1.00mm. Preliminary phantom trials of three active cannula placements in the MRI scanner showed cannula trajectories that agree with our kinematic model, with a RMS tip placement error of 0.61 - 2.24 mm.",

        "abstract": "Power-to-weight ratio of actuators is extremely important for robots, particularly mobile robots. The combination of electric motor and speed reducer, which is the most common driving mechanism for robots, can utilize the motor in the area where its power output is high when the reduction ratio is appropriately designed relative to the load. However, in the case of applications in which the load significantly changes, the motor has to be operated in the area where its power output significantly drops. This problem has restricted the capability of mobile robots, especially biologically inspired robots. Therefore in this paper I focus on a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Crank-type CVTs, which have been used for robotic joints, have the major disadvantage of a limited range of motion due to the dead point of the crank. Thus, this paper proposes the Radial Crank-type CVT (RC-CVT), which overcomes this limit of range of motion by increasing the number of links driving the crank of the CVT. This RC-CVT holds promise as an efficient robotic joint as it can utilize ball screws. This paper shows the equations of kinematics and statics of the RC-CVT and also describes the design and test of the prototype. The application to a quadruped robot is also introduced.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in high-speed Atomic Force Microscopy is the low vertical bandwidth of the Z-scanner feedback loop. The maximum vertical feedback bandwidth is limited by the first Z-axis resonance frequency of the scanner. In this article, the design of a fast Z-scanner for high-speed Atomic Force Microscopy is presented. The Z-scanner consists of a piezoelectric stack actuator and a diaphragm flexure. The flexure provides the necessary preload to the actuator to prevent it from getting damaged during high-speed scans. A finite-element-analysis based optimization method is used to achieve a high resonance frequency of about 60 kHz. A counterbalance is added to the Z-scanner to minimize the inertial effect which tends to cause vibrations in the lateral axes of the device. This mechanical design enabled us to achieve a closed-loop vertical control bandwidth of 6.5 kHz. This is significantly higher than the closed loop bandwidth of the commercial AFM in which this stage was tested. AFM images of a test grating with sharp corners were recorded at a resolution of 200\u00d7200 pixels at 10 Hz, 100 Hz and 200 Hz line rates without noticeable image artifacts due to insufficient vertical bandwidth and vibrations.",

        "abstract": "A novel behavior based locomotion controller (BBLC) capable of adapting to unknown disturbances is presented. The proposed controller implements a behavior based control architecture by subdividing the walking control into several task-space controllers such as swing leg control and center of gravity (COG) position control. For each task-space controller, a number of behaviors, which plan the reference task-space trajectories, are designed based on existing stabilizing controllers or strategies inspired by human walking biomechanics. A Q-learning algorithm is used to classify which behavior combinations can compensate for specific disturbances. The controller is implemented on a planar biped simulation with push type disturbances applied on flat and sloped terrain. The results show that stabilization strategies, capable of compensating for these disturbances emerge from the combination of different task level behaviors, without a priori knowledge of the nature of the disturbances.",

Traditional control actuators for air vehicles including DC servomotors and shape memory alloy are either too heavy or too slow to control a fast moving NAV. This paper develops a new bio-inspired active tail mechanism to stabilize an inverted pendulum with the same mass and inertia as the NAV. An analysis of the dynamic model shows a critical angle at which the control actuator can no longer stabilize the pendulum varies significantly with link lengths and mass ratios. Based on this dynamic model, an LQR controller is developed and implemented as a state space controller on a microcontroller based test setup. Using a gyroscope to measure the pendulum's angular velocity and estimate the angle, the active tail mechanism was able to stabilize the pendulum for over five minutes before falling due to drift in the gyroscope sensor.",

From our analytical and experimental tests, it was revealed that these circular compliant joints have desirable characteristics for composing a compliant parallel mechanism. Based on these primary experimental results, we developed a 3-DOF compliant parallel mechanism for an optic component positioning machine. The prototype evaluation tests revealed the mechanism's advantageous characteristics.",

The key to the design is the use of a single motor to actuate the compliant body and to generate thrust. The robot has the same geometrical properties of a subcarangiform swimmer with the same length. The design is based on rigid head and fin linked together with a compliant body. The flexible part is modelled as a non-uniform cantilever beam actuated by a concentrated moment. The dynamics of the compliant body are studied and a relationship between the applied moment and the resulting motion is derived. A prototype that implements the proposed approach is built. Experiments on the prototype are done to identify the model parameters and to validate the theoretical modelling.",

        "abstract": "To fulfill the needs for accurate trajectory tracking with large displacement in a handheld instrument, a 3-DOF serial compliant mechanism is developed. The mechanism is compact with a total length less than 150 mm and a maximum diameter of 22 mm. Two flexures are developed using different rapid prototyping techniques: one 3-DOF flexural lever made of Vero-Gray by Polyjet and a 1-DOF translational flexure made of stainless steel by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). Analytical and Finite Element (FE) models are developed for the proposed flexural mechanisms. Experiments are conducted on a prototype. To improve the tracking accuracy, the hysteretic nonlinearities of the system are modeled using Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. Inverse feedforward controller is implemented to linearize the relationship between input and output. The tracking errors are reduced while maintaining a fast response of the system. The total tracking errors are identified individually for each axis and then compensated. Tracking performances of the tool tip are evaluated experimentally with different inputs. The RMS tracking error of the proposed mechanism is lower than 1 \u00b5m in all axes, which is improved more than four times compared to the previous systems.",

In terms of performance this display achieves an excellent combination of force, amplitude and spatiotemporal resolution at the tactors, surpassing the performance of devices of a similar footprint. Its operation is based on the display of surface shape to an area of the fingertip through a 4\u00d74 array of vertically moving tactors. The tactors are spring loaded and are actuated remotely by dc motors through a flexible tendon transmission. This work presents the overall design, control and performance of the device. A preliminary analysis of the transmission system is presented and is used to compensate for output errors induced by component elasticity.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel design approach for a two-DOF foot force sensor for a high speed running quadruped. The adopted approach harnesses the deformation property of an elastomeric material to relate applied force to measurable deformation. A lightweight, robust and compact magnetic-field based sensing system, consisting of an assembly of miniature hall-effect sensors, is employed to infer the positional information of a magnet embedded in the elastomeric material. Instead of solving two non-linear models (magnetic field and elastomeric) sequentially, a direct approach of using artificial neural networks (ANN) is utilized to relate magnetic flux density (MFD) measurements to applied forces. The force sensor, which weighs only 24.5 gms, provides a measurement range of 0 \u2013 1000 N normal to the ground and up to \u00b1 125N parallel to the ground. The mean force measurement accuracy was found to be within 7% of the applied forces. The sensor designed as part of this work finds direct applications in ground reaction force sensing for a running quadrupedal robot.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing need for the inspection of nuclear power plants worldwide. To access complex underwater structures and perform non-destructive evaluation, robots must be tetherless, compact, highly maneuverable, and have a smooth body shape with minimal appendages. A new water jet propulsion system using fluidic valves coupled with centrifugal pumps is developed for precision maneuvering. A hybrid control system that combines continuous pump regulation and discrete Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of fluidic valves is proposed. This control scheme provides high accuracy, high bandwidth, and flexibility in maneuvering control. First, the functional requirements for nuclear power plant inspection are discussed, followed by the basic design concept of an inspection robot. Miniaturized Coanda-effect valves are designed and built based on CFD and mathematical analysis. The hybrid control system incorporating the pump/valve system is designed and tested. Experimental results illustrate that the hybrid control scheme holds substantial promise and is capable of very precise orientation control. Based on these, a full 4-DOF robot is designed, and its key components are described.",

        "abstract": "Elastic elements in prosthetic devices can help to reduce peak power (PP) and energy requirements (ER) for the actuators. Calculations showed that it is impossible with current commercial motor technology to mimic human ankle behavior in detail for higher walking and running speeds with single motor solutions using a Serial Elastic Actuator (SEA). Concerning this result we checked the requirements of a parallel elastic actuator (PEA) and a combination of serial and parallel (SE+PEA) springs. We found that a PEA can reduce PP additionally in comparison to the SEA by pre-loading the spring in the flight phase. This reduces also peak torque. But this loading needs additional energy so that the ER increase in comparison to the SEA. The SE+PEA concept can further decrease PP. With that, the ER are less than the PEA but higher than for the SEA. The results show less benefit for the PEA and the SE+PEA when a constant stiffness and a fixed parallel spring slack length is used for both gaits and all speeds. All concepts show that mimicking human ankle joint behavior in running and walking at higher speeds is still challenging for single motor devices.",

The proposed approach abstracts the lower structural property of the tactile image by analyzing the covariance between pressure values and their locations on the sensor and identifies three orthogonal principal axes of the pressure distribution. Classifying contact shapes based on the principal axes allows the results to be invariant to the rotation of the contact shape. A na\u00efve Bayes classifier is implemented to classify the shape and pose of the local contact shapes. Using an off-shelf low resolution tactile array sensor which comprises of 5\u00d79 pressure elements, an overall accuracy of 97.5% has been achieved in classifying six primitive contact shapes. The proposed method is very computational efficient (total classifying time for a local contact shape = 576\u03bcs (1736 Hz)). The test results demonstrate that the proposed method is practical to be implemented on robotic hands equipped with tactile array sensors for conducting manipulation tasks where real-time classification is essential.",

The first layer is a K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier that categorizes human actions into two classes based on the existence of locomotion, and the second layer consists of two multi-layer recurrent neural networks that distinguish between subclasses within each class. A pyramid of histograms of oriented gradients (PHOG) descriptor is proposed for extracting local and spatial features. The PHOG descriptor reduces the dimensionality of input space drastically, which results in better convergence for the learning and classification processes. Computer simulations were conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed CHARS and the role of temporal factor in solving this problem. A widely used KTH human-action database and the human-action dataset from our lab were utilized for performance evaluation. The proposed CHARS was found to perform better than other existing human-action recognition methods and achieved a 95.55% recognition rate.",

To really exploit the potential of robots in these scenarios, it should be possible to enforce force and geometrical constraints in an easy and flexible way. iTaSC allows to express such constraints in different frames expressed in arbitrary spaces and to obtain control setpoints in a systematic way. In previous implementations of iTaSC, industrial velocity-controlled robots were considered. This work presents an extension of the iTaSC-framework that allows to take advantage of the back-drivability of a robot thus avoiding the use of force sensors. Then, as a casestudy, the iTaSC-framework is used to formulate a (positionposition) teleoperation scheme. The theoretical findings are experimentally validated using a PR2 robot.",

        "abstract": "Inverse optimal control is the problem of computing a cost function that would have resulted in an observed sequence of decisions. The standard formulation of this problem assumes that decisions are optimal and tries to minimize the difference between what was observed and what would have been observed given a candidate cost function. We assume instead that decisions are only approximately optimal and try to minimize the extent to which observed decisions violate first-order necessary conditions for optimality. For a discrete-time optimal control system with a cost function that is a linear combination of known basis functions, this formulation leads to an efficient method of solution as an unconstrained least-squares problem. We apply this approach to both simulated and experimental data to obtain a simple model of human walking trajectories. This model might subsequently be used either for control of a humanoid robot or for predicting human motion when moving a robot through crowded areas.",

The problem is the estimation of a scalar field. To this aim in a probabilistic framework a solution is proposed that takes into account several constraints. The attention is focused on the vehicles motion generation and the developed strategy is designed for multiple, autonomous and distributed robots. It makes use of the Voronoi tessellation's properties to automatically distribute the vehicles' motion and of the Null-Space-Behavioral control to handle eventually conflicting motion tasks (as reaching a given point while avoiding obstacles). The algorithm can be tailored based on the communication and computational capabilities of the robots. A discussion and possible counterexamples of the applications of existing approaches are provided in the paper. Numerical simulations illustrate the results.",

        "abstract": "The most classical solution to generate whole-body motions on humanoid robots is to use the inverse kinematics on a set of tasks. It enables flexibility, repeatability, sensor-feedback if needed, and can be applied in real time onboard the robot. However, it cannot comprehend the whole complexity of the robot dynamics. Inverse dynamics is then a mandatory evolution. Before application as a generic motion generator, two important concerns need to be solved. First, when including in the motion-generation problem the forces and torques variables, the numerical conditioning can become very low, inducing undesired behaviors or even divergence. Second, the computational costs of the problem resolution is much more important than when considering the kinematics alone. This paper proposes a complete reformulation of the inverse-dynamics problem, by cutting the ill-conditioned part of the problem, solving in a same way the problem of numerical stability and of cost reduction. The approach is validated by a set of dynamic whole-body movements of the HRP-2 robot.",

The main contribution is a fast method to evaluate distances between the robot and possibly moving obstacles (including humans), based on the concept of depth space. The distances are used to generate repulsive vectors that are used to control the robot while executing a generic motion task. The repulsive vectors can also take advantage of an estimation of the obstacle velocity. In order to preserve the execution of a Cartesian task with a redundant manipulator, a simple collision avoidance algorithm has been implemented where different reaction behaviors are set up for the end-effector and for other control points along the robot structure. The complete collision avoidance framework, from perception of the environment to joint-level robot control, is presented for a 7-dof KUKA Light-Weight-Robot IV using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. Experimental results are reported for dynamic environments with obstacles and a human.",

        "abstract": "We present our digital fabrication technique for manufacturing active objects in 2D from a collection of smart particles. Given a passive model of the object to be formed, we envision submerging this original in a vat of smart particles, executing the new shape duplication algorithm described in this paper, and then brushing aside any extra modules to reveal both the original object and an exact copy, side-by-side. Extensions to the duplication algorithm can be used to create a magnified version of the original or multiple copies of the model object. Our novel duplication algorithm uses a distributed approach to identify the geometric specification of the object being duplicated and then forms the duplicate from spare modules in the vicinity of the original. This paper details the duplication algorithm and the features that make it robust to (1) an imperfect packing of the modules around the original object; (2) missing communication links between neighboring modules; and (3) missing modules in the vicinity of the duplicate object(s). We show that the algorithm requires O(1) storage space per module and that the algorithm exchanges O(n) messages per module. Finally, we present experimental results from 60 hardware trials and 150 simulations. These experiments demonstrate the algorithm working correctly and reliably despite broken communication links and missing modules.",

        "abstract": "Visible light communication systems have gained prominence as a method for wireless underwater communications. This is because these systems are capable of long distance communications in water with high bandwidths. A requirement of visible light systems, however, is consistent line of sight to maintain a communication link. This arises from the directional nature of visible light emitters and detectors. One solution to this problem is to implement feedback control in order to \u201cpoint\u201d visible light emitters and detectors at one another. This in turn requires precise estimation of the relative locations of these two components as a feedback signal. In this work, a system is presented that uses the modulated light signal both as a medium with which to carry data and as a reference upon which to base the localization of a mobile robot. This is therefore a dual-use system, for both communication and localization. First, this paper presents the architecture of a dual-use visible light communication and localization system. The localization is carried out using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm. Then, a planar version of this dual-use system is tested, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-use approach.",

With an iterative heuristic search approach for the maximum similarity in these comparisons, robust 3D object pose estimation has been obtained to place an inspection camera to its new initial pose. Then a visual servo technique is used to accurately place this camera so that a reliable visual inspection can be carried out. Contrast with those feature-based or texture-based approaches where textures are required, only the object's geometry information is needed in this framework, therefore this system can deal with the untextured objects (for instance metal parts) well. This paper describes the system configuration and operational procedure in detail. Experiments results are presented to evaluate the system performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Increasingly, robots are being applied to challenges in dynamic, unstructured environments including urban search and rescue (USAR), planetary exploration, and military missions. During the execution of these missions, the robot may unintentionally tip over, rendering it unable to move normally. The ability to self-right and recover in such situations is crucial to mission completion and safe robot recovery. However, to date, nearly all self-righting solutions have been point solutions, each designed for a specific platform. As a first step toward a generic solution, this paper presents a framework for analyzing the self-righting capabilities of any generic robot on sloped planar surfaces. Based on the planar assumption, interactions with the ground can be defined entirely in terms of the robot's convex hull. Motion of arms, legs, or other appendages may change the convex hull shape and/or center of mass position, affecting the robot's orientation. Our framework for solving this problem can be summarized as follows: first, for each stable conformation, we analyze the position of the center of mass relative to the vertical projection of the convex hull face in contact with the ground. From this, we develop a conformation space map, defining stable state sets as nodes and the conformations where discontinuous state changes occur as transitions. Finally, we convert this map into a directed graph, and assign costs to the transitions according to changes in potential energy between states. Based upon the ability to traverse this directed graph to the goal state, one can analyze a robot's ability to self-right. To illustrate each step in our framework, we use a simple two-dimensional robot with a one degree of freedom arm, and then show a case study of iRobot's 510 Packbot\u00ae. Ultimately, we project that this framework will be useful both for designing robots with the ability to self-right and for planning joint movements to achieve efficient, autonomous self-righting behav...

        "abstract": "A person practicing parkour is an incredible display of intelligent planning; he must reason carefully about his velocity and contact placement far into the future in order to locomote quickly through an environment. We seek to develop planners that will enable robotic systems to replicate this performance. An ideal planner can learn from examples and formulate feasible full-body plans to traverse a new environment. The proposed approach uses momentum equivalence to reduce the full-body system into a simplified one. Low-dimensional trajectory primitives are then composed by a sampling planner called Sampled Composition A* to produce candidate solutions that are adjusted by a trajectory optimizer and mapped to a full-body robot. Using primitives collected from a variety of sources, this technique is able to produce solutions to an assortment of simulated locomotion problems.",

        "abstract": "For the purpose of ergonomic human-machine interaction and geometrical design of hand held haptic devices, a kinematic model that represents the functional anatomy of different human hands is desired. It is the goal of this paper to present a kinematic hand model that is based on human physiology and that is easily adaptable to represent various real human hand sizes. This is achieved by exploiting body proportions to derive finger segment lengths from the hand length. A partial hand model validation, involving index- and middle finger validation using a group of subjects, indicates that the use of body proportions offers a good estimate of finger length from a given hand length. Model estimated fingertip positions over a motion trajectory remain within reasonable limits when compared with experimental data for this subject group. The model is promising for usage in practical situations since only hand length, which is easy to measure or to obtain from literature, is required as an input. Phalange lengths, which are sparsely available from literature and difficult to measure, are generated by the model.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Pursuit evasion problems, in which evading targets must be cleared from an environment, are encountered in surveillance and search and rescue applications. Several works have addressed variants of this problem in order to study strategies for the pursuers. As a common trait, many of these works present results in the general form: given some assumptions on the environment, on the pursuers, and on the evaders, upper and lower bounds are calculated for the time needed for (the probability of, the resources needed for, ...) clearing the environment. The question \u201cwhat is the optimal strategy for a given pursuer in a given environment to clear a given evader?\u201d is left largely open. In this paper, we propose a game theoretical framework that contributes in finding an answer to the above question in a version of the pursuit evasion problem in which the evader enters and exits a grid environment and the pursuer has to intercept it along its path. We adopt a criterion for optimality related to the probability of capture. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in simulated settings and we provide some hints to generalize the framework to other versions of the pursuit evasion problem.",

In this paper, a general mechanical model with a geometrically exact approach for tendon-driven continuum manipulators is presented. This model can be applied to a wide range of manipulators thanks to the generality of the parameters which can be set. The approach proposed could as well be a powerful tool for developing the control strategy. The model is also capable of properly simulating the coupled tendon drive, because it takes into account the torsion of the robot arm rather than neglecting it, as it is common practice in other existing models.",

Our framework consists of the following four components: (1) a module for detecting both Lambertian and non-Lambertian (i.e. specular) handles, (2) a module for opening and closing novel cabinets using impedance control and for learning their kinematic models, (3) a module for storing and retrieving information about these objects in the map, and (4) a module for reliably operating cabinets of which the kinematic model is known. The presented work is the result of a collaboration of three PR2 beta sites. We rigorously evaluated our approach on 29 cabinets in five real kitchens located at our institutions. These kitchens contained 13 drawers, 12 doors, 2 refrigerators and 2 dishwashers. We evaluated the overall performance of detecting the handle of a novel cabinet, operating it and storing its model in a semantic map. We found that our approach was successful in 51.9% of all 104 trials. With this work, we contribute a well-tested building block of open-source software for future robotic service applications.",

        "abstract": "There is a strong push within the mining sector to develop and adopt automation technology, including autonomous vehicles such as excavators, trucks and drills. However, for autonomous systems to operate effectively in this domain, new perception capabilities are required to build rich models of a mine. A key element of this is an ability to sense and model the sub-surface geological structure as well as the more traditional robotic models, which typically estimate terrain and obstacles. This paper presents a new automated geological perception system to support autonomous mining. It uses hyperspectral imaging sensors and a supervised learning algorithm to detect and classify geological structures, and ultimately build a rich model of the operating environment. The presented algorithm uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) and an Observation Angle Dependent (OAD) covariance function. Further, the resulting geological model can be improved by fusing data from two hyperspectral scanners which measure different regions of the spectrum. The approach is demonstrated using data from an operational iron-ore mine. Fusion of classification results from the two sensors shows better agreement with ground truth mapping done in the field, compared to results from individual sensors.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a strategy for grasp and manipulation of unknown objects. In order to derive force relations of fingers, the groped shape of soft fingers is introduced. The groped shape is not equal to the real object shape, but is tightly related to the force equilibrium of fingers. By considering contact forces of the groped shape, a simple control parameters can be derived. The manipulation of an object is easily accomplished by embedding the concept of virtual centroid into the grasp control to redistribute internal forces. With these concepts, an object can be easily translated, rotated, and manipulated by relocating fingers. The proposed method is verified with experiments.",

This problem is cast as a convex optimization problem, considering also joint torque constraints. A solution suitable for on-line implementation is proposed, which allows a substantial reduction of the computational load by dynamically decreasing the number of active torque constraints. Moreover, for the case of a bimanual manipulation system, a sub-optimal single-hand optimization algorithm is presented and compared with the optimal one. The effectiveness of the described methods has been tested in a simulation case study.",

It can be assumed that this is due to lack of driving skills which lead to making wrong decisions according to cognition and operating in correct way. In this paper, we propose a novel assisted driving system intended to help drivers to improve their skills for the reverse parking. The system is able to assist the driver by haptic instruction on the steering wheel in order to induce the driver to make the adequate operation. For the validation, we developed a 1/10 scale car simulator as a simulation environment on which we installed the proposed assistance method and conducted reverse parking experiment by using the simulator. According to the experiment, we validated that the parking accuracy and the trajectory similarity of subjects assisted by proposed system significantly increased compare to subjects unassisted. Consequently, the proposed assisted driving system could accelerate the learning of humans' driving skills.",

The goal of the evader is to keep the pursuer at all time farther from it than this capture distance. In this paper, we found closed-form representations of the motion primitives and time-optimal strategies for each player. These strategies are in Nash Equilibrium, meaning that any unilateral deviation of each player from these strategies does not provide to such player benefit toward the goal of winning the game. We also present the condition defining the winner of the game and we construct a solution over the entire reduced space.",

Experimental results of the quadrotor in pose and hybrid pose-wrench control mode are presented, showing stable behaviour while moving in contact. Whereas a lot of research nowadays is focused mainly on free-flight applications, stable and robust wrench control of quadrotors in direct contact with their environment, opens up new application areas for this class of flying robots.",

The descriptor is based on recent results from the machine learning community. It automatically learns feature responses in the neighborhood of detected interest points and is able to combine all available information, such as color and depth into one, concise representation. To demonstrate the strength of this approach we show its applicability to different recognition problems. We evaluate the quality of the descriptor on the RGB-D Object Dataset where it is competitive with previously published results and propose an embedding into an image processing pipeline for object recognition and pose estimation.",

A comparison between the normal operation mode and the backup solution reveals minimal difference between the respective orientation estimates, a position error growth sub-linear with time during GPS outage and a seamless transition back to GPS-based operation.",

        "abstract": "Braitenberg vehicles have attracted many students to work in robotics because of their apparent simplicity as control mechanisms. However, the lack of a formal theory supporting them entails they are used by the robotic community only as a teaching tool. This paper presents the first joint theoretical and comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of Braitenberg vehicles 2 and 3. The presented mathematical model of the vehicles is a non-linear dynamical system which is analysed for general conditions. This work paves the way to a proper and complete understanding of Braitenberg vehicles through a new theoretical framework. This framework allows the exploration of new applications and shows the need of stimulus analysis to drive its behaviour.",

The usage of robot vision is highly preferred to obtain reliable results. In the past different algorithms for localizing objects as well as for motion planning to avoid collisions between gripper, object and environment were presented and even some commercial Bin-Picking systems are available. Nevertheless a realistic simulation taking account of various vision and robot systems and path planning strategies to predict cycle times is still not possible. In this paper a universal software framework with the focus on virtual Bin-Picking is presented. Utilizing a generic approach this framework enables the integration of various algorithms for object recognition, motion planning, different types of robots, grippers and vision systems. Thus an efficient simulation of different (virtual) Bin-Picking setups including equipment such as sensor devices or robot controllers within a virtual environment is possible. Furthermore the use of such a system allows the prediction of cycle times, percentage of tangible objects or testing of different Bin-Picking setups.",

The scenario we are considering is motivated by the 2011 IEEE Virtual Manufacturing Automation Challenge (VMAC). It consists of multiple autonomously guided vehicles (AGVs), transporting pallets of various goods between several input and output locations, through an unstructured warehouse environment. Only a map of the warehouse and a pallet delivery list are provided a priori. Pallets must be delivered to the output locations in the shortest time possible, while respecting the ordering of different pallet types specified by the delivery list. The presented control system handles all aspects of warehouse operation, from individual vehicle control to high-level mission planning and coordination. Delivery mission assignments are optimized using dynamic programming and simulated annealing techniques. Mission executions are coordinated using graph search methods and a modified version of the Banker's algorithm, to ensure safe, collision and deadlock-free system operation. System performance is evaluated on a virtual warehouse model, using the high fidelity USARSim simulator.",

        "abstract": "Clinical studies confirm that mental illnesses such as autism, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. show behavioral abnormalities even at very young ages; the early diagnosis of which can help steer effective treatments. Most often, the behavior of such at-risk children deviate in very subtle ways from that of a normal child; correct diagnosis of which requires prolonged and continuous monitoring of their activities by a clinician, which is a difficult and time intensive task. As a result, the development of automation tools for assisting in such monitoring activities will be an important step towards effective utilization of the diagnostic resources. In this paper, we approach the problem from a computer vision standpoint, and propose a novel system for the automatic monitoring of the behavior of children in their natural environment through the deployment of multiple non-invasive sensors (cameras and depth sensors). We provide details of our system, together with algorithms for the robust tracking of the activities of the children. Our experiments, conducted in the Shirley G. Moore Laboratory School, demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a walking biped, based on principles of mammalian neuromuscular architecture. Walking in mammals is a fluid, dynamical interaction between a central pattern generator, the biomechanics of the body, the environment, and sensory feedback. Our robot is designed based on principles of human leg muscle architecture. We incorporate load detecting force sensors that model Golgi tendon organs in the muscles, as well as foot pressure and joint angle sensors. These sensory feedback sources model those available in the human body. The robot is controlled by a spiking neuron simulation that integrates centrally generated (CPG) with peripheral (reflexive) responses. Using recent understanding of the neurobiology of locomotion, we are able to generate an effective and stable walking pattern using interactions between the biomechanics, CPG, and reflexive responses. The CPG drives overall limb motion at the hips, while phase modulated reflexive responses adapt the pattern of the lower limb to the needs of the step cycle. Load detection by the force sensors in the limb generates propulsive stepping, and controls entrainment of the CPG through positive force feedback. These concepts are important ones for locomotion in mammals that should be considered by roboticists developing walking robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new hand-held device capable of amplifying delicate micromanipulation forces during minimal invasive surgical tasks. It relays force sensing to the user through a simple sliding feature that is coupled to the surgical tool, which translates relative to the casing of the device held by the operator. This forgoes the need of grounding frames or anchoring mechanisms to the body, allowing the device to be used in general surgical environments without affecting the workflow. The device uses a three-phase linear motor that is compact and capable of generating high forces that allow amplification factors of up to \u00d715. It features a closed-loop force control scheme to perform the required force amplification in which the force exerted on to the user is measured, forming the feedback in the control loop. The device permits interchangeability of instrumentation through a simple docking feature, and thus can be generalized to a range of surgical instruments for micromanipulation tasks. Detailed bench tests and user trials have been performed to validate the accuracy and practical performance of the device. The results have shown a five times reduction of the minimum force threshold perceived by the subjects and ergonomically sound manipulation advantages.",

Third, key points on the stored trajectories are extracted. These key points are considered in a general case, and then used to implement the manipulation skills. Finally, knotting task is generated by synthesis of the manipulation skills. An overhand knot was made by the actual robot for the validity of the proposed method.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we design and validate a new tentacle-based approach, for avoiding obstacles during appearance-based navigation with a wheeled mobile robot. In the past, we have developed a framework for safe visual navigation. The robot follows a path represented as a set of key images, and during obstacle circumnavigation, the on-board camera is actuated to maintain scene visibility. In those works, the model used for obstacle avoidance was obtained using a potential vector field. Here, a more sophisticated and efficient method, that exploits the robot kinematic model, and predicts collision at look-ahead distances, is designed and integrated in that framework. Outdoor experiments comparing the two models show that the new approach presents many advantages. Higher speeds and precision can be attained, very cluttered scenarios involving large obstacles can be successfully dealt with, and the control inputs are smoother.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous guidance of agricultural vehicles is vital as mechanized farming production becomes more prevalent. It is crucial that tractor-trailers are guided with accuracy in both lateral and longitudinal directions, whilst being affected by large disturbance forces, or slips, owing to uncertain and undulating terrain. Previous research has been concentrated on trajectory control that provides longitudinal and lateral accuracy if the vehicle moves without sliding and/or the trailer is passive. In this paper, we extend current results by addressing the problem of robust trajectory tracking along straight and circular paths of a tractors with steerable trailers. We develop a controller that is a robust combination of a backstepping and nonlinear PI control. For vehicles subjected to slip, the proposed controller makes the lateral deviations and the orientation errors of the tractor and trailer converge to a neighborhood near the origin. Simulation results are presented to illustrate that the suggested controller ensures precise trajectory tracking in the presence of slip.",

        "abstract": "Correspondence searching among different images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. It is important to find correspondences correctly and rapidly, especially for real-time tracking systems. Therefore, the definition of search areas in images is crucial. Traditional epipolar constraint is not noise-enduring; some reformative methods lack explicit geometric meanings. All of them cannot help defining rational search areas under noises. This paper proposes two new binocular imaging constraints with clear geometric meanings and strong restraining forces. Based on them, a novel searching strategy among multiimages is developed which can define optimal search areas with smallest sizes but best reliability. Practical algorithms for implementation are presented and experiments with real images are performed, validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) have been introduced to improve, at the design level, the safety and the energy efficiency of the new generation of robots that have to interact closely with humans. A wide variety of design solutions have recently been proposed, and a common factor in most of the VSAs is the introduction of a flexible transmission with varying stiffness. This, from the control perspective, usually implies a nonlinear actuation plant with varying dynamics following time-varying parameters, which requires more complex control strategies with respect to those developed for flexible joints with a constant stiffness. For this reason, this paper proposes an approach for controlling the link position and stiffness of a VSA. The link positioning relies on a LQR-based gain scheduling approach useful for continuously adjusting the control effort based on the current stiffness of the flexible transmission. The stiffness perceived at the output link is adjusted to match the varying task requirements through the combination of the positioning gains and the mechanical stiffness. The stability of the overall strategy is briefly discussed. The effectiveness of the controller in terms of tracking performance and stiffness adjustment is verified through experiments on the Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS).",

        "abstract": "Detecting cars in real-world images is an important task for autonomous driving, yet it remains unsolved. The system described in this paper takes advantage of context and scale to build a monocular single-frame image-based car detector that significantly outperforms the baseline. The system uses a probabilistic model to combine multiple forms of evidence for both context and scale to locate cars in a real-world image. We also use scale filtering to speed up our algorithm by a factor of 3.3 compared to the baseline. By using a calibrated camera and localization on a road map, we are able to obtain context and scale information from a single image without the use of a 3D laser. The system outperforms the baseline by an absolute 9.4% in overall average precision and 11.7% in average precision for cars smaller than 50 pixels in height, for which context and scale cues are especially important.",

However, the control of flexible joint manipulators in a bilateral teleoperation scenario is still an open problem. In the present paper we report two versions of a proportional plus damping injection controller that are capable of globally stabilizing a nonlinear bilateral teleoperator with joint flexibility and variable time-delays. The first version controls a teleoperator composed by a rigid local manipulator and a flexible joint remote manipulator and the second version deals with local and remote manipulators with joint flexibility. For both schemes, it is proved that the joint and motor velocities and the local and remote position error are bounded. Moreover, if the human operator and remote environment forces are zero then velocities asymptotically converge to zero and position tracking is established. Simulations are presented to show the performance of the proposed controllers.",

In addition, it develops a new psychological scale to quantify general impressions regarding humanoids based on these basic perspectives (Study 2). In Study 1, to discover the basic perspectives toward humanoids, we used 11 humanoids and collected data from 919 Japanese people ranging from teenagers to people in their 70s in three big cities. We asked people to describe their impressions in free text about the robots. Five psychologists analyzed the qualitative data to categorize all the descriptions into several categories. Then, we made the items based on the obtained descriptions to construct a new psychological scale for evaluating general impressions regarding humanoids. In Study 2, we asked 2,624 Japanese who did not participate in Study 1 to evaluate 11 humanoids on the developed scale. Factor analysis showed that nine factors should be used for evaluating the general impressions regarding humanoids: Familiarity, Repulsion, Performance, Utility, Motion, Sound, Voice, Humanness, and Entitativity. The factor structure is clear and its reliability as a psychological scale is satisfactorily high. Finally, we discuss the usability of the new scale.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we introduce a novel concept of real-time microscopic particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) for high-speed microchannel flows in a lab-on-a-chip using a frame-straddling high-speed vision system with two camera inputs; it can synchronize two camera inputs with the same view field with a time delay on a submicrosecond time scale. To improve the measurable range of velocity in microchannel flow observation, we propose a variable-frame-straddling optical flow (VFS-OF) algorithm that can simultaneously estimate the microchannel flow distribution as gradient-based optical flows using frame-straddled images from the two camera inputs; their frame-straddling time is determined by the amplitude of the estimated optical flow to avoid large image displacements between frames that often generate serious errors in optical flow estimation. We built a real-time micro-PIV system by software-implementing the VFS-OF algorithm in a high-speed vision system with two frame-straddled cameras; it can execute real-time video processing and recording of 512\u00d7512-pixel images at 2000 frames per second for the two cameras and control their frame-straddling time from 0 to 0.5 ms with 9.9-ns steps. Our micro-PIV system can estimate the velocity distribution of high-speed microchannel flows at 1 m/s or more in real time by controlling the frame-straddling time. Experimental results were performed for microfluidic flows on microchannels with widths of hundreds of micrometers to verify the performance of our micro-PIV system based on the VFS-OF algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an efficient real-time autonomous driving motion planner with trajectory optimization is proposed. The planner first discretizes the plan space and searches for the best trajectory based on a set of cost functions. Then an iterative optimization is applied to both the path and speed of the resultant trajectory. The post-optimization is of low computational complexity and is able to converge to a higher-quality solution within a few iterations. Compared with the planner without optimization, this framework can reduce the planning time by 52% and improve the trajectory quality. The proposed motion planner is implemented and tested both in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle in three different scenarios. Experiments show that the planner outputs high-quality trajectories and performs intelligent driving behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Some of the unique properties associated with running with curved legs or feet (as opposed to point-contact feet) are examined in this work, including the rolling contact motion, the change of the leg's effective stiffness and rest length, the shift of the effective flexion point along the leg, and the compliant-vaulting motions over its tiptoe during stance. To examine these factors, a novel torque-driven reduced-order dynamical model with a clock-based control scheme and with a simple motor model is developed (named as torque-driven and damped half-circle-leg model (TD-HCL)). The controller parameters are optimized for running efficiency and forward speed using a direct search method, and the results are compared to those of other existing dynamical models such as the torque-driven and damped spring-loaded-inverted-pendulum (TD-SLIP) model, the torque-driven and damped two-segment-leg (TD-TSL) model, and the TD-SLIP with a rolling foot (TD-SLIP-RF) model. The results show that running with rolling is more efficient and more stable than running with legs that involve pin joint contact model. This work begins to explain why autonomous robots using curved legs run efficiently and robustly. New curved legs are designed and manufactured in order to validate these results.",

The algorithm accommodates an operational space of multiple end-effectors, and is the lowest-order algorithm published to date for this computation. The key feature of this algorithm is the explicit calculation and use of matrices that propagate a force across a span of several links in a single operation. This approach allows the algorithm to achieve a computational complexity of O(N +md+m2) where N is the number of bodies, m is the number of end-effectors, and d is the depth of the system's connectivity tree. A detailed cost comparison is provided to the propagation algorithms of Rodriguez et al. (complexity O(N + dm2)) and to the sparse factorization methods of Featherstone (complexity O(nd2 + md2 + m2d)). For the majority of examples considered, our algorithm outperforms the previous best recursive algorithm, and demonstrates efficiency gains over sparse methods for some topologies.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a framework, called Lightning, for planning paths in high-dimensional spaces that is able to learn from experience, with the aim of reducing computation time. This framework is intended for manipulation tasks that arise in applications ranging from domestic assistance to robot-assisted surgery. Our framework consists of two main modules, which run in parallel: a planning-from-scratch module, and a module that retrieves and repairs paths stored in a path library. After a path is generated for a new query, a library manager decides whether to store the path based on computation time and the generated path's similarity to the retrieved path. To retrieve an appropriate path from the library we use two heuristics that exploit two key aspects of the problem: (i) A correlation between the amount a path violates constraints and the amount of time needed to repair that path, and (ii) the implicit division of constraints into those that vary across environments in which the robot operates and those that do not. We evaluated an implementation of the framework on several tasks for the PR2 mobile manipulator and a minimally-invasive surgery robot in simulation. We found that the retrieve-and-repair module produced paths faster than planning-from-scratch in over 90% of test cases for the PR2 and in 58% of test cases for the minimally-invasive surgery robot.",

Prior research has shown that PRMs can be augmented with useful information to model interesting scenarios related to multi-agent interaction and coordination. Pursuit evasion is the problem of planning the motions of one or more agents to effectively track and/or capture an initially unseen evader in an environment. Unlike prior probabilistic approaches that assume the environment is partitioned into convex cells or square grids, we present a sampling-based technique that allows us to generalize the problem to an arbitrary partitioning of the environment. We then show how PRMs can exploit this method using Voronoi diagrams. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of this approach and demonstrate its validity experimentally.",

It subdivides configuration space (C-space) into (possibly overlapping) regions and independently, in parallel, uses standard (sequential) sampling-based planners to construct roadmaps in each region. Next, in parallel, regional roadmaps in adjacent regions are connected to form a global roadmap. By subdividing the space and restricting the locality of connection attempts, we reduce the work and inter-processor communication associated with nearest neighbor calculation, a critical bottleneck for scalability in existing parallel motion planning methods. We show that our method is general enough to handle a variety of planning schemes, including the widely used Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithms. We compare our approach to two other existing parallel algorithms and demonstrate that our approach achieves better and more scalable performance. Our approach achieves almost linear scalability on a 2400 core LINUX cluster and on a 153,216 core Cray XE6 petascale machine.",

Current solutions range from basic behavior-based approaches to sophisticated reasoning systems, in each case depending on the complexity of the robot's task as well as the available amount of computing time. In this paper, we present a behavior specification language, which is called b-script, to describe hierarchical agent behaviors using the programming concept of generators. We show that this is a convenient approach to realize complex robot behaviors in an intuitive and clean way that can be used in large-scale. Furthermore, the actual implementation of this language is in particular suited to be used on resource-restricted embedded systems. This is shown in different examples of a Nao robot in a robot soccer scenario.",

        "abstract": "Building a photorealistic, 3D model of an object or a complete scene from image-based methods is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and has many applications in robotic perception, navigation, exploration and mapping. In this paper, we extend current state-of-the-art in the computation of depth maps by presenting an accurate and computationally efficient iterative hierarchical algorithm for multi-view stereo. The algorithm is designed to utilise all available contextual information to compute highly-accurate and robust depth maps by iteratively examining different image resolutions in an image-pyramid. The novelty in our approach is that we are able to incrementally improve the depth fidelity as the algorithm progresses through the image pyramid by utilising a local method. This is achieved in a computationally efficient manner by simultaneously enforcing the consistency of the depth-map by continual comparison with neighbouring depth-maps. We present a detailed description of the algorithm, and describe how each step is carried out. The proposed technique is used to analyse multi-view stereo data from two well-known, standard datasets, and presented results show a significant decrease in computation time, as well as an increase in overall accuracy of the computed depth maps.",

        "abstract": "Industrial robotic manipulators have excellent repeatability while accuracy is significantly poorer. Numerous error sources in the robotic workcell contributes to the accuracy problem. Modeling and identification of all the errors to achieve the required levels of accuracy may be difficult. To resolve the accuracy issues, a sensor based indirect error compensation approach is proposed in this paper where the errors are compensated online via measurements of the work object. The sensor captures a point cloud of the work object and with the CAD model of the work object, the actual relative pose of the sensor frame and work object frame can be established via a point cloud registration. Once this relationship has been established, the robot will be able to move the tool accurately relative to the work object frame near the point of compensation. A data pre-processing technique is proposed to reduce computation time and prevent a local minima solution during point cloud registration. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic studies have suggested a contribution of limit-cycle oscillation of the neuro-mechanical periphery to human walking by demonstrating stable bipedal robotic gaits with minimal actuation and control. As behavioral evidence of limit-cycle oscillation in human walking, we recently reported entrainment of human gaits to mechanical perturbations. We observed synchronization of human walking with mechanical perturbation only when the perturbation period was close to the original walking period. In addition, the entrainment was always accompanied by phase locking at the end of double-stance. A highly-simplified state-determined walker reproduced these salient features: 1) entrainment to periodic perturbations with a narrow basin of entrainment and 2) phase-locking at the end of double stance. Importantly, the model required neither supra-spinal control nor an intrinsic self-sustaining neural oscillator (like a rhythmic central pattern generator), which suggests that prominent features of human walking may stem from simple afferent feedback processes that produce limit-cycle oscillation of the neuro-mechanical periphery without significant involvement of the brain or rhythmic central pattern generators. One limitation of that model was that it entrained only to perturbations faster than the unperturbed walking period. In the study reported here, we modified the model to have two independent steps per stride. The revised model reproduced entrainment to perturbations both slower and faster than the unperturbed cadence, as observed experimentally in human walking.",

Given two non-singular configurations of the manipulator, the method attempts to connect them through a configuration space path that maintains a minimum clearance with respect to the singularity locus at all points. The method is resolution-complete, in the sense that it always returns a path if one exists at a given resolution, or returns \u201cfailure\u201d otherwise. The path is computed by defining a new manifold that maintains a one-to-one correspondence with the singularity-free configuration space of the manipulator, and then using a higher-dimensional continuation technique to explore this manifold systematically from one configuration, until the second configuration is found. Examples are included that demonstrate the performance of the method on illustrative situations.",

In contrast to the standard EKF update, whose complexity is up to O(N4) (N is the number of robots in a team), we introduce a Modified Householder QR algorithm which fully exploits the sparse structure of the matrix H, and prove that the overall complexity of the EKF update, based on our QR factorization scheme, reduces to O(N3). Finally, we validate the Modified Householder QR algorithm through extensive simulations, and demonstrate its superior performance both in terms of accuracy and CPU runtime, as compared to the current state-of-the-art QR decomposition algorithm for sparse matrices.",

        "abstract": "In the case of some elderly or disabled persons, not only the motor ability, but also the environment perception ability is sometimes deteriorated. To assist the daily living motion of those people, power-assist robots with the perception-assist have been proposed. The power-assist robot with the perception-assist assists not only the user's motion but also the user's interaction with an environment, by applying the modification force to the user's motion if it is necessary. Since it is difficult for the robot to prepare all proper perception-assist for every task, tool, and environment previously, the robot needs to learn the proper perception-assist for each task, tool and environment by itself. The effectiveness of the performed perception-assist by the robot has been judged by the EMG signals. However, if the EMG signals do not change enough for the judgment, the learning of the robot might not succeed. In this paper, both EMG signals and EEG signals are measured at the same time to observe the features of these signals when users use the power-assist robot. EEG signals are used as the criteria of the effectiveness of the performed perception-assist in addition to EMG signals.",

We introduce the energy efficiency as a cost function to generate motion of a snake robot. We propose a control strategy for switching grounded parts of the snake robot so as to minimize the energy consumption. Simulation results show that the motion optimizing the energy efficiency of the snake robot differs depending on the velocity to be generated and the optimal motion is similar to the sinus-lifting motion.",

One of the largest problems for older adults is the imbalance of participation to conversation. Our approach is to develop a system that assists group conversation of older adults, by evaluating speech duration and facial expression of each participant during conversation. It enables all participants evenly to take part in the conversation, which tends to be difficult for older adults. We analyzed 15 group conversations for calculating the parameters used for evaluating the conversation. The effectiveness of the system using the obtained parameters was validated through the experiment. The system which evaluates only speech duration of each participant and the system which evaluates both speech duration and facial expression of each participant during group conversation were compared by analyzing 8 group conversations for each. The results demonstrated that the system which evaluates both speech duration and facial expression of each participant can make all participants to take part in the conversation evenly and actively. We successfully developed the system that can support group conversation regardless of the contents.",

        "abstract": "For effective human-robot interaction, a robot should be able to make prediction about future circumstance. This enables the robot to generate preparative behaviors to reduce waiting time, thereby greatly improving the quality of the interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic temporal prediction method for proactive interaction that is based on a Bayesian network approach. In our proposed method, conditional probabilities of temporal events can be explicitly represented by defining temporal nodes in a Bayesian network. Utilizing these nodes, both temporal and causal information can be simultaneously inferred in a unified framework. An assistant robot can use the temporal Bayesian network to infer the best proactive action and the best time to act so that the waiting time for both the human and the robot is minimized. To validate our proposed method, we present experimental results for case in which a robot assists in a human assembly task.",

We then demonstrate how these models can be used for highly accurate detection and pose estimation in an end-to-end robotic perception system incorporating simultaneous segmentation, object classification, and pose fitting. The system can handle occlusions, illumination changes, multiple objects, and multiple instances of the same object. The system placed first in the ICRA 2011 Solutions in Perception instance recognition challenge.

It is proposed that the three-link module is a pivotal element in formulation of high-dimensional humanoids. The equations of motion of the module are first derived by projection of the free body equations of motion onto the space of the translation of an arbitrary point and Bryant angles and angular velocities. It is then shown that the formulation can be used as a construction module for systems with a larger number of segments. Holonomic and nonholonomic constraints are included to show the feasibility and versatility for representing other parts of the humanoid system. Digital computer simulations are presented to test the module's formulation and demonstrate its behavior in two maneuvers, jumping and sway.",

        "abstract": "Control of soft robots remains nowadays a big challenge, as it does in the larger category of continuum robots. In this paper a direct and inverse kinetics models are described for a non-constant curvature structure. A major effort has been put recently in modelling and controlling constant curvature structures, such as cylindrical shaped manipulators. Manipulators with non-constant curvature, on the other hand, have been treated with a piecewise constant curvature approximation. In this work a non-constant curvature manipulator with a conical shape is built, taking inspiration from the anatomy of the octopus arm. The choice of a conical shape manipulator made of soft material is justified by its enhanced capability in grasping objects of different sizes. A different approach from the piecewise constant curvature approximation is employed for direct and inverse kinematics model. A continuum geometrically exact approach for direct kinetics model and a Jacobian method for inverse case are proposed. They are validated experimentally with a prototype soft robot arm moving in water. Results show a desired tip position in the task-space can be achieved automatically with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.",

The nodes of an MFG are features such as scale invariant feature transformation (SIFT) feature points, line segments, lines, and planes while edges of the MFG represent different geometric relationships such as adjacency, parallelism, collinearity, and coplanarity. MFG also connects the features in two views and the corresponding 3D coordinate system. Building on SIFT feature points and line segments, MFG is constructed using feature fusion which incrementally, iteratively, and extensively verifies the aforementioned geometric relationships using random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework. Physical experiments show that MFG can be successfully constructed in urban area and the construction method is demonstrated to be very robust in identifying feature correspondence.",

The in-depth understanding of the passivity is helpful to design more efficient bipedal gaits. In this paper, we investigate the principle mechanism of passive dynamic walking and propose a unified framework for virtual passive bipedal gait generation. The framework shows the physical system's kinetic energy varies inversely proportional to the imitated virtual system's potential energy. Based on this property we propose a kinetic energy tracking control law to realize virtual passive dynamic walking on any slopes in any virtual gravity fields. Numerical simulations are given to support our proposal.",

Automatically adjusting its joint axes, AssistOn-SE: can enable a perfect match between human joint axes and the device axes, not only guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy, but also extending the usable range of motion for the shoulder joint. Moreover, the adjustability feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the exoskeleton, allowing more effective time be spend on exercises instead of wasting this valuable resource for adjustments. Back-driveable design of AssistOn-SE: supports both passive translational movements of the center of glenohumeral joint and independent active control of these degrees of freedom. Thanks to this property, glenohumeral mobilization and scapular stabilization exercises can also be delivered with AssistOn-SE:, extending the type of therapies that can be administered using upper-arm exoskeletons. We introduce the design of the exoskeleton and present the kinematic analysis of its self-aligning joint. We also provide implementation details for an early prototype as well as some experimental results detailing range of motion of the device and its ability to track movements of the shoulder girdle.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid reactive-deliberative architectures in robotics combine reactive sub-policies for fast action execution with goal sequencing and deliberation. The need for replanning, however, presents a challenge for reactivity and hinders the potential for guarantees about the plan quality. In this paper, we argue that one can integrate abstract planning provided by symbolic dynamic programming in first order logic into a reactive robotic architecture, and that such an integration is in fact natural and has advantages over traditional approaches. In particular, it allows the integrated system to spend off-line time planning for a policy, and then use the policy reactively in open worlds, in situations with unexpected outcomes, and even in new environments, all by simply reacting to a state change executing a new action proposed by the policy. We demonstrate the viability of the approach by integrating the FODD-Planner with the robotic DIARC architecture showing how an appropriate interface can be defined and that this integration can yield robust goal-based action execution on robots in open worlds.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an algorithm that considers uncertainty while solving the simultaneous task and motion planning (STAMP) problem. Information about uncertainty is transferred to the task planning level from the motion planning level using the concept of a task motion multigraph (TMM). TMMs were introduced in previous work to improve the efficiency of solving the STAMP problem for mobile manipulators. In this work, Markov Decision Processes are used in conjunction with TMMs to select sequences of actions that solve the STAMP problem such that the resulting solutions have higher probability of feasibility. Experimental evaluation indicates significantly improved probability of feasibility for solutions to the STAMP problem, compared to algorithms that ignore uncertainty information when selecting possible sequences of actions. At the same time, the efficiency due to TMMs is largely maintained.",

Systematic errors of odometry can be reduced by the calibration of kinematic parameters. The UMBmark method is one of the widely used calibration schemes for two wheel differential mobile robot. In this paper, the accurate calibration scheme of kinematic parameters is proposed by extending the conventional UMBmark. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as two issues. The first contribution is to present new calibration scheme that reduce the approximation error of calibration equations in UMBmark method. The new equations were derived from the robot's final orientation errors in test track. The second contribution is to propose the consideration of the coupled effects between wheel diameter errors and wheelbase errors in test track for calibration experiments. The calibration performance can be significantly improved by applying new calibration equations were derived to overcome the limitations of the conventional scheme. The numerical simulations and experimental results show that the odometry accuracy can be improved by the proposed calibration schemes.",

        "abstract": "Methods for acquisition and maintenance of an environment model are central to a broad class of mobility and navigation problems. Towards this end, various metric, topological or hybrid models have been proposed. Due to recent advances in sensing and recognition, acquisition of semantic models of the environments have gained increased interest in the community. In this work, we will demonstrate a capability of using weak semantic models of the environment to induce different topological models, capturing the spatial semantics of the environment at different levels. In the first stage of the model acquisition, we propose to compute semantic layout of the street scenes imagery by recognizing and segmenting buildings, roads, sky, cars and trees. Given such semantic layout, we propose an informative feature characterizing the layout and train a classifier to recognize street intersections in challenging urban inner city scenes. We also show how the evidence of different semantic concepts can induce useful topological representation of the environment, which can aid navigation and localization tasks. To demonstrate the approach, we carry out experiments on a challenging dataset of omnidirectional inner city street views and report the performance of both semantic segmentation and intersection classification.",

Machine learning has proven a significant aid in this task; in recent years learning from demonstration has become especially popular, leading to improved systems while requiring less expert tuning and interaction. However, these approaches still place a burden on the expert, specifically to choose the best demonstrations to provide. This work proposes two approaches for active learning from demonstration, in which the learning system requests specific demonstrations from the expert. The approaches identify examples for which expert demonstration is predicted to provide useful information on concepts which are either novel or uncertain to the current system. Experimental results demonstrate both improved generalization performance and reduced expert interaction when using these approaches.",

Especially the ability to recognize and manipulate unknown objects is crucial to successfully work in natural environments. Visual object recognition, however, still remains a challenging problem, as three-dimensional objects often give rise to ambiguous, two-dimensional views. Here, we propose a perception-driven, multisensory exploration and recognition scheme to actively resolve ambiguities that emerge at certain viewpoints. We define an efficient method to acquire two-dimensional views in an object-centered task space and sample characteristic views on a view sphere. Information is accumulated during the recognition process and used to select actions expected to be most beneficial in discriminating similar objects. Besides visual information we take into account proprioceptive information to create more reliable hypotheses. Simulation and real-world results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of active, multisensory exploration over passive, visiononly recognition methods.",

These systems are generally comprised of multiple identical robotic systems in order to simplify manufacturability and programmability, reduce cost, and provide fault tolerance. This work takes advantage of the homogeneity and multiplicity of multi-robot systems to enhance the convergence rate of adaptive dynamic parameter estimation through collaboration. The collaborative adaptive dynamic parameter estimation of multi-robot systems is accomplished by penalizing the pair-wise disagreement of both state and parameter estimates. Consensus and convergence is based on Lyapunov stability arguments. Simulation studies with multiple Pioneer 3-DX systems provides verification of the proposed theoretic collaborative adaptive parameter estimation predictions.",

A model reference adaptive control law is developed and applied to the orthosis in order to make the system (shank-orthosis) track a desired trajectory predefined by a rehabilitation doctor. The main advantage of this control law is the on-line parameters regulation allowing to ensure the best performance of the system. A Lyapunov-based analysis is performed to prove the input-to-state stability of the orthosis with respect to a bounded human torque. The performance of the system is then shown through some simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient path planning for humanoid robots by combining grid-based 2D planning with footstep planning. In this way, we exploit the advantages of both frameworks, namely fast planning on grids and the ability to find solutions in situations where grid-based planning fails. Our method computes a global solution by adaptively switching between fast grid-based planning in open spaces and footstep planning in the vicinity of obstacles. To decide which planning framework to use, our approach classifies the environment into regions of different complexity with respect to the traversability. Experiments carried out in a simulated office environment and with a Nao humanoid show that (i) our approach significantly reduces the planning time compared to pure footstep planning and (ii) the resulting plans are almost as good as globally computed optimal footstep paths.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a new open-loop model for a Magneto-Rheological (MR) based actuator is presented. The model consists of two parts relating the output torque of the actuator to its internal magnetic field, and the internal magnetic field to the applied current. Each part possesses its own hysteretic behavior. The first part uses an open-loop Bouc-Wen model to relate the output torque to internal magnetic field. The second part uses a novel nonlinear adaptive observer that relates the internal magnetic field to the applied current. The model facilitates accurate control of the actuator using its input current. It also eliminates the need for force/torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The accuracy of the constructed model is validated through simulations. The overall model as well as each part of it is assessed against a widely accepted hysteresis modeling approach, known as the Preisach model and its advantages are highlighted. The second part of model is also compared to Bingham model which has been broadly employed in modeling of MR fluid dynamic. Bouc-Wen model shows higher accuracy in capturing hysteretic behavior of MR fluid in comparison to non-hysteretic Bingham model. Experimental results using the prototyped actuation mechanism further verify the accuracy of the model and demonstrate its effectiveness.",

Traditionally, the sampling methods collect measurements without considering possible distributions of target signals. A feedback driven algorithm is discussed in this paper, where new measurements are determined based on the analysis of existing observations. The information amount of each potential measurement is evaluated under a sparse domain based on compressive sensing framework given all existing information shared among networked mobile sensors, and the most informative one is selected. The efficiency of this information-driven method falls into the information maximization for each individual measurement. The simulation results show the efficacy and efficiency of this approach, where a scalar field is recovered.",

In this paper we implement rheotaxis behaviour in a fish robot, a behaviour common to many aquatic species. We use two pressure sensors on the head of the robot to identify the pressure differences on the left and right side and control the heading of the fish robot by turning a servo-motor actuated tail. The controller is inspired by the Braitenberg vehicle 2b, a simple biological model of tropotaxis, that has been used in many robotic applications. The experiments, conducted in a flow pipe with a uniform flow, show that the robot is able to orient itself, and keep the orientation, to the incoming current. Our results demonstrate that guidance of a fish robot relative to a flow can be implemented as a simple rheotaxis behaviour using two sensors and a Braitenberg 2b controller.",

For this interface system surface Electromyogram (EMG) of various muscles which a user still has control, are used as input signals for controlling a tablet. The aim of this system is to extract additional intention of user while user doing deskwork. The characteristic EMG patterns, which are observed when agonistic and antagonistic muscles contract together, are utilized for extracting operational intention. Since these patterns are rarely observed while user doing deskwork or other actions of daily life, this methodology can discriminate the derivation of EMG whether intentional or not. Then the operability of interface system are evaluated by Fitts' law based test GUI. The experimental results show the validity of our proposed interface system comparering with other alternative interface systems.",

        "abstract": "Particle filter is one of the most widely applied stochastic sampling tools for state estimation problems in practice. However, the proposal distribution in the traditional particle filter is the transition probability based on state equation, which would heavily affect estimation performance in that the samples are blindly drawn without considering the current observation information. Additionally, the fixed particle number in the typical particle filter would lead to wasteful computation, especially when the posterior distribution greatly varies over time. In this paper, an advanced adaptive nonparametric particle filter is proposed by incorporating gaussian process based proposal distribution into KLD-Sampling particle filter framework so that the high-qualified particles with adaptively KLD based quantity are drawn from the learned proposal with observation information at each time step to improve the approximation accuracy and efficiency. Our state estimation experiments on univariate nonstationary growth model and two-link robot arm show that the adaptive nonparametric particle filter outperforms the existing approaches with smaller size of particles.",

Specifically, in the first step, we estimate a subset of the 3D relative rotation parameters by analytically minimizing a least-squares cost function. We then back-substitute these estimates in the measurement constraints, and determine the rest of the 3D transformation parameters by analytically minimizing a second least-squares cost function. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to controlling the motion of a team of agents so that they jointly minimize a cost function utilizing Bayes risk. We use a particle-based approach and approximations that allow us to express the optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear program. We illustrate this approach with an area protection problem in which a team of mobile agents must intercept mobile targets before the targets enter a specified area. Bayes risk is a useful measure of performance for applications where agents must perform a classification task. By minimizing Bayes risk, agents are able to explicitly account for the cost of incorrect classification. In our application, a team of mobile agents must classify potential mobile targets as threat or safe based on the likelihood the targets will enter the specified area. The agents must also maneuver to intercept targets that are classified as threat.",

The proposed approach incrementally constructs the hierarchical roadmap which has a multi-layered structure using a sonar grid map when a mobile robot navigates in unexplored area. The hierarchical roadmap can almost completely cover the traversable areas in the environment. The mobile robot path planner using the hierarchical roadmap can efficiently search for appropriate paths under the limited computing power and time by reducing the search space size.

        "abstract": "Stochastic Clustering Auctions (SCAs) constitute a class of cooperative auction methods that enable improvement of the global cost of the task allocations obtained with fast greedy algorithms. Prior research had developed Contracts Sequencing Algorithms (CSAs) that are deterministic and enable transfers, swaps, and other types of contracts between team members. In contrast to CSAs, SCAs use stochastic transfers or swaps between the task clusters assigned to each team member and have algorithm parameters that can enable tradeoffs between optimality and computational and communication requirements. The first SCA was based on a \u201cGibbs Sampler\u201d and constrained the stochastic cluster reallocations to simple single transfers or swaps; it is applicable to heterogeneous teams. Subsequently, a more efficient SCA was developed, based on the generalized Swendsen-Wang method; it achieves the increased efficiency by connecting tasks that appear to be synergistic and then stochastically reassigning these connected tasks, hence enabling more complex and efficient movements between clusters than the first SCA. However, its application was limited to homogeneous teams. The contribution of this work is to present an efficient SCA for heterogeneous teams; it is based on a modified Swendsen-Wang method. For centralized auctioning and homogeneous teams, extensive numerical experiments were used to provide a comparison in terms of costs and computational and communication requirements of the three SCAs and a baseline CSA. It was seen that the new SCA maintains the efficiency of the second SCA and can yield similar performance to the baseline CSA in far fewer iterations. The same metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the new SCA for heterogeneous teams. A distributed version of the new SCA was also evaluated in numerical experiments. The results show that, as expected, the distributed SCA continually improves the global performance with each iteration, but converges to a lower ... Show More",

These implementations are both based on manipulator tip position feedback from an electromagnetic sensor. The command tracking and disturbance rejection properties of the two control implementations are shown to be approximately equivalent, and provide improved position control when compared to open-loop control, without sacrificing system stability.",

Adaptive sampling approaches can only provide solutions when real-time and a priori environmental data is available. Through utilizing a cost-evaluation function to experimentally evaluate various sampling path strategies for a wide range of scalar fields and sampling densities, it is found that a systematic spiral sampling path strategy is optimal for high-variance scalar fields for all sampling densities and low-variance scalar fields when sampling is sparse. The random spiral sampling path strategy is found to be optimal for low-variance scalar fields when sampling is dense.",

        "abstract": "Fronts have been recognized as hotspots of intense biological activity and are important targets for observation to understand coastal ecology and transport in a changing ocean. With high spatial and temporal variability, detection and event response for frontal zones is challenging for robotic platforms like autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). These vehicles have shown their versatility and cost-effectiveness in using automated approaches to detect a range of features. Targeting them for in-situ observation and sampling capabilities for frontal zones then provides an important tool for characterizing rapid and episodic changes. We introduce a novel momentum-based front detection (MBFD) algorithm which utilizes a Kalman filter and a momentum accumulator function to identify significant temperature gradients associated with upwelling fronts. MBFD is designed to work at a number of levels including onboard an AUV, on-shore with a sparse real-time data stream and post-experiment on a full resolution data set gathered by a vehicle. Such a multi-layered approach plays an important role in mixed human-robot decision making for oceanographers making coordinated sampling and asset allocation strategies in large multi-robot field experiments in the coastal ocean.",

However, interacting with fast moving soft organs by means of stiff instruments/robots is challenging. This paper concerns comanipulation with a hand-held instrument, the goal being to allow the surgeon to perform low frequency motions that correspond to the surgical task while a distal part of the instrument actively moves in synchronism with the heart motion in order to guarantee that the contact is maintained. This paper explores the difficulties of implementing low-impedance control on a novel hand-held motion compensation instrument. A force feedback control strategy is proposed and evaluated experimentally on a simulated surgical scene. Taking advantage of the sensory capacities of the prototype presented, a successful modulation of the dynamics of interaction is reached. Conclusive results on the performances of the system and possibilities of future improvements are given.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a class of continuous-time, continuous-space stochastic optimal control problems. Building upon recent advances in Markov chain approximation methods and sampling-based algorithms for deterministic path planning, we propose a novel algorithm called the incremental Markov Decision Process (iMDP) to compute incrementally control policies that approximate arbitrarily well an optimal policy in terms of the expected cost. The main idea behind the algorithm is to generate a sequence of finite discretizations of the original problem through random sampling of the state space. At each iteration, the discretized problem is a Markov Decision Process that serves as an incrementally refined model of the original problem. We show that with probability one, (i) the sequence of the optimal value functions for each of the discretized problems converges uniformly to the optimal value function of the original stochastic optimal control problem, and (ii) the original optimal value function can be computed efficiently in an incremental manner using asynchronous value iterations. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides an anytime approach to the computation of optimal control policies of the continuous problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on motion planning and control problems in cluttered environments in the presence of process noise.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many online inference problems in computer vision and robotics are characterized by probability distributions whose factor graph representations are sparse and whose factors are all Gaussian functions of error residuals. Under these conditions, maximum likelihood estimation corresponds to solving a sequence of sparse least-squares minimization problems in which additional summands are added to the objective function over time. In this paper we present Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE), an incrementalized version of the Powell's Dog-Leg trust-region method suitable for use in online sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region method, Powell's Dog-Leg enjoys excellent global convergence properties, and is known to be considerably faster than both Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt when applied to sparse least-squares problems. Consequently, RISE maintains the speed of current state-of-the-art incremental sparse least-squares methods while providing superior robustness to objective function nonlinearities.",

The proposed sensor/positioner system enables terrestrial and aerial robots to observe their surroundings in all directions without blind spots. Using a nut-and-bolt and link mechanism, the proposed positioner driven by a single stepper motor exhibits continuous three dimensional spiral trajectories over the upper hemisphere. This single axis motor driven system helps decrease the size, weight, and structural complexity of the system. Particular attention in this work is placed on how to effectively combine two dimensional and three dimensional measurement functions. We verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed location measurement system through simulations and experiments. It is expected that the proposed system can be incorporated into a wide range of mobile robot platforms.",

This paper presents an online control method for the stair-climbing of a transformable tracked robot, Amoeba-II, and this robot is also an isomerism-modules robot with different mechanism modules. Based on the reasonable compartmentalization and kinematics analysis of the stair-climbing process, the coordination of the rotations of modules can reduce the slippage between tracks and terrain. To ensure that the robot can climb stairs with enough capability and stability, the stair-climbing criterion for the robot has been established based on the force analysis of each stage of the stair-climbing procedure. Meanwhile, the interference-avoiding criterion has been set up to avoid the interference between the non-tracked module of the robot and the stair. The experiment for the stair-climbing of the robot has been implemented to certify the validity of the online stair-climbing control method for a transformable tracked robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a high-accuracy local positioning system (LPS) for an autonomous robotic greens mower. The LPS uses a sensor tower mounted on top of the robot and four active beacons surrounding a target area. The proposed LPS concurrently determines robot location using a lateration technique and calculates orientation using angle measurements. To perform localization, the sensor tower emits an ultrasonic pulse that is received by the beacons. The time of arrival is measured by each beacon and transmitted back to the sensor tower. To determine the robot's orientation, the sensor tower has a circular receiver array that detects infrared signals emitted by each beacon. Using the direction and strength of the received infrared signals, the relative angles to each beacon are obtained and the robot orientation can be determined. Experimental data show that the LPS achieves a position accuracy of 3.1 cm RMS, and an orientation accuracy of 0.23\u00b0 RMS. Several prototype robotic mowers utilizing the proposed LPS have been deployed for field testing, and the mowing results are comparable to an experienced professional human worker.",

        "abstract": "Morphology, perception and locomotion are three key features highly inter-dependent in robotics. This paper gives an overview of an underwater modular robotic platform equipped with a bio-inspired electric sense. The platform is reconfigurable in the sense that it can split into independent rigid modules and vice-versa. Composed of 9 modules, the longer entity can swim like an eel over long distances, while once detached, each of its modules is efficient for small displacements with a high accuracy. Challenges are to mechanically ensure the morphology changes and to do it automatically. Electric sense is used to guide the modules during docking phases and to navigate in unknown scenes. Several aspects of the design of the robot are described and a particular attention is paid to the inter-module docking system. The feasibility of the design is assessed through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Formation control of nonholonomic robots in dynamic unstructured environments is a challenging task yet to be met. This paper presents the unscented model predictive control (UMPC) approach to tackle the formation control of multiple nonholonomic robots in unstructured environments. In unscented predictive control, the uncertainty propagation in the nonholonomic nonlinear motion model is approximated using the unscented transform. The collision avoidance constraints have been introduced as the chance constraints to model predictive control. The UMPC approach enables us to find a closed form of the collision avoidance probabilistic constraints. The desired pose of each robot in the formation is introduced through the local objective function of UMPC of each robot. The simulation results indicate the effective and robust performance of UMPC in unstructured environment in the presence of action disturbance and communication signal noise.",

        "abstract": "Cable robots form a class of parallel architecture robots with significant benefits including simplicity of construction, large workspace, significant payload capacity and end effector stiffness. While conventional cable robots have fixed bases, we seek to explore inclusion of mobility into the bases (in the form of gantries, and/or vehicle bases) which can significantly further enhance the capabilities of cable robots. However, this also introduces redundancy and complexity into the system which needs to be carefully analyzed and resolved. To this end, we propose a generalized modeling framework for systematic design and analysis of cooperative mobile cable robots, building upon knowledge base of multi-fingered grasping, and illustrate it with a case study of four cooperating gantry mounted cable robots transporting a planar payload.",

Giardia parasitizes the small intestine of humans and other animals, and has evolved a robust attachment and swimming mechanism to survive this harsh environment, which provides potential bio-inspiration for microrobot design. In this paper, a 2D dynamic model of flagella-body-fluid interaction was developed to analyze the actuation of the flagellum, energy supply and dissipation, and thrust along the flagellum. We found that to achieve the observed flagella motion, the required actuation bending moment decreases in magnitude from the proximal to the distal end, and that energy only needs to be supplied to the proximal half portion of the flagellum. The supplied energy is dissipated to the fluid continuously along the flagellum, with almost linearly increasing magnitude towards the distal end. Consistently, thrust mainly comes from the posterior portion of the flagellum. We also analyzed the kinematics of the flagella. The characteristics of the forward and turning motion are revealed through simulation. These results may help the gait planning and actuation for energy efficient propulsion in swimming micro-robotic design.",

        "abstract": "Nanoforce sensors based on passive diamagnetic levitation with a macroscopic seismic mass are a possible alternative to classical Atomic Force Microscopes when the force bandwidth to be measured is limited to a few Hertz. When an external unknown force is applied to the levitating seismic mass, this one acts as a transducer that converts this unknown input into a displacement that is the measured output signal. Because the inertia effect due to the mass of such macroscopic transducers can not be neglected for time-varying force measurement, it is necessary to deconvolve the displacement to correctly estimate the unknown input force. A deconvolution approach based on a Kalman filter and controlled by a scalar parameter has been recently proposed. The adjustment of this parameter leads to a trade-off that is analysed in this paper in term of resolution and bandwidth of the estimated force. Associated tools to help the end-user to set this parameter are also described.",

The mathematical model of the vehicle bounds the velocities of the wheels independently. The timeoptimal trajectories can be divided into two categories: singular and generic. An analytical solution method has previously been presented for singular trajectories; this paper completes the work and presents the solution for generic trajectories. The speed and precision of the algorithm allow dense sampling of the configuration space, to determine how the time and structure of time-optimal trajectories change across configurations. Simulation results show that time-optimal trajectories tend to be ten to twenty percent faster than a simple but practical driving strategy: turn until the fastest translation direction faces the goal, drive to the goal, and turn to the current angle.",

As a result, the vehicle has a difficulty in following the path correctly. In this paper, we propose a limit-cycle circle set that applies to the Theta* algorithm. The minimum turning radius of a marine surface vehicle is calculated using a limit-cycle circle set, and circles of this radius is used to generate a configuration space of an occupancy grid map. After applying Theta* to this configuration space, the limit-cycle circle set is also applied to the start and end nodes to find the appropriate path with specified heading angles. The benefit of this algorithm is its fast computation time compared to other 3-D (x;y;\u03b8) path planning algorithms, along with the fact that it can be applied to the 3-D kinematic state of the vehicle. We simulate the proposed algorithm and compare it with 3-D A* and 3-D A* with post smoothing algorithms.",

In this paper we tackle the problem of merging together two or more appearance based maps independently built by robots operating in the same environment. Noticing the lack of well accepted metrics to measure the performance of map merging algorithms, we propose to use algebraic connectivity as a metric to assess the advantage gained by merging multiple maps. Next, based on this criterion, we propose an anytime algorithm aiming to quickly identify the more advantageous parts to merge. The system we proposed has been fully implemented and tested in indoor scenarios and shows that our algorithm achieves a convenient tradeoff between accuracy and speed.",

State-space control methods can be used to improve performance, but may require state estimates. For nonlinear systems, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) provides a computationally efficient way to obtain state estimates. The UKF is applied here to a simulation of a minimially invasive surgical robot, to study the state estimation for a cable driven system with nonlinear dynamics. State estimates from the UKF are compared with the known states available from the simulation. These state estimates are also utilized by two different controllers interacting with the simulation to test the UKF performance under closed loop control. We tested the UKF performance with error perturbations in the system model's cable stiffness parameter.",

        "abstract": "The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), or monopedal runner, is widely used to depict running and hopping in mammalian and human locomotion, which is also serving as a template for running robot design. This classic model describes quite a simple mechanical system. Nevertheless issue of seeking the accurate analytic solution revealing the characteristics of the motion during stance remains unsettled due to the nonintegrable terms contained in the system equations. Moreover, several existing analytic approximations by simply ignoring or linearizing the gravitational force can not reveal the entire dynamical behavior of nonlinear system as well as can be breakdown rapidly when applied to a non-symmetric motion case. In this paper, a novel method with perturbation technique is proposed to obtain analytic approximate solutions to the SLIP dynamics in stance phase with considering the effect of gravity. The perturbation solution achieves higher accuracy in predicting the apex trajectory and stance locomotion by comparing with typical existing analytical approximations. Particularly, our solution is validated for non-symmetric case in a large angle range. Additionally, the prediction for stance trajectory is also verified through numerical evaluation.",

Octopuses use suckers for remarkable tasks and they are capable to obtain a good reversible wet adhesion on different substrates. We investigated the suckers morphology that allow octopus to attach them to different wet surfaces to obtain the benchmarks for new suction cups showing similar performances. The investigation was performed by using non-invasive techniques (i.e. ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging). We acquired images of contiguous sections of octopus suckers, which were used to make a 3D reconstruction aimed to obtain a CAD model perfectly equivalent to the octopus sucker in terms of sizes and anatomical proportion. The 3D information was used to develop the first passive prototypes of the artificial suction cups made in silicone. Then, in accordance with Kier and Smith's octopus adhesion model, we put in tension the water volume in the interior chamber of the artificial suction cup to obtain suction. The characterization of the passive sucker was addressed by measuring both the differential pressure between external and internal water volume of suction cup (~ 105) and the pull-off force applied to detach the substrates from the suction cup (~ 8N).",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges in robotics is the generation of controllers for autonomous, high-level robot behaviors comprising a non-trivial sequence of actions. Recently, formal methods have emerged as a powerful tool for automatically generating autonomous robot controllers that guarantee desired behaviors expressed by a class of temporal logic specifications. However, when there is no controller that fulfills the specification, these approaches do not provide the user with a source of failure, making the troubleshooting of specifications an unstructured and time-consuming process. In this paper, we describe a procedure for analyzing an unsynthesizable specification to identify causes of failure. We also provide an interactive game for exploring possible causes of failure, in which the user attempts to fulfill the robot specification against an adversarial environment. Our approach is implemented within the LTLMoP toolkit for robot mission planning.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of novel nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles and nanofibers, is crucial to the expansion of the nanotechnology field. Of even greater importance, is the identification of nanomaterials that exist in nature and have low environmental toxicity when compared to man-made nanomaterials. In 2008, our group first discovered that ivy secretes nanoparticles for surface affixing. It was further demonstrated that these nanoparticles could be used for biomedical applications. This paper proposes an automated framework for high throughput scalable green nanomanufacturing of these naturally occurring nanoparticles. Several parameters necessary to optimize the growth of the ivy, including temperature, humidity, and light level, were regulated using feedback controls. Since the contact of ivy rootlets with a substrate is necessary to initiate the secretion of ivy adhesive, an electromechanical system was designed to automatically stimulate the rootlets to start the nanoparticle secretion process. The contact of ivy rootlets with a surface was formulated as a linear viscoelastic model and a speed control law was proposed for the actuator of the automated system. The proposed framework was verified through prototype experiments, and demonstrated promise for high throughput production of ivy nanoparticles.",

However, significant variations in sensitivity across devices can result from poor control over device parameters, such as nanowire diameter and the number of electrode-bridging nanowires. This paper presents a fabrication approach that uses wafer-scale nanowire contact printing for throughput and uses automated nanomanipulation for precision control of nanowire number and diameter. The process requires only one photolithography mask. Using nanowire contact printing and post processing (i.e., nanomanipulation inside scanning electron microscope), we are able to produce devices all with a single nanowire and similar diameters at a speed of \u223c1 min/device with a success rate of 95% (n=500). This technology represents a seamless integration of wafer-scale microfabrication and automated nanorobotic manipulation for producing nano-FET sensors with consistent response across devices.",

Image processing technique is used to recognize the target cells based on the cell size or fluorescence label. After recognition, the target cells can be levitated from the microwell, and then assembled by multiple optical traps in parallel.

The throwing robot is capable of throwing cylinder-shaped objects onto a target point with high precision. The capturing robot there smoothly grips the cylinders during flight by means of a rotational movement. In order to synchronize the capturing robot and the cylinder's pose and velocity, its trajectory has to be modeled as well as the motion sequences of both robots.

        "abstract": "Complex manipulation tasks require an accurate interplay of actuation and sensing. This accuracy can only be achieved by calibrating the relevant components beforehand. Typically calibration procedures are time-consuming and often include subsequent calibration steps, involve multiple people and require external tools. In this paper we alleviate these issues by auto-calibrating the different sensors of DLR's humanoid Rollin' Justin in a single, completely automatic and self-contained procedure, i.e. without calibration plate. By observing a single point feature on each wrist while moving the robot's head, the stereo cameras' intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are calibrated together with the arm joint elasticities and joint angle offsets. Additionally, we use the head motion to calibrate an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) extrinsically. Parameters are obtained by formulating the calibration problem as a batch-optimization problem that estimates all parameters jointly. A rough initial guess, as is, e.g., available when re-calibrating, is needed for the estimation and to facilitate marker detection. The procedure is validated on real hardware and reduces the effort considerably allowing rapid (5 min movement time), automatic, and accurate calibration by simply \u201cpushing a button\u201d.",

        "abstract": "As a core robotic and vision problem, camera and range sensor calibration have been researched intensely over the last decades. However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camera-to-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities. Experiments using a variety of sensors such as grayscale and color cameras, the Kinect 3D sensor and the Velodyne HDL-64 laser scanner show the robustness of our method in different indoor and outdoor settings and under various lighting conditions.",

For objects with welldefined surfaces, this approach works well, and traditional 3D scene reconstruction algorithms can be employed to automatically generate the surface models. This approach breaks down, though, for many trees, tall grasses, and other objects with fine-scale geometry: surface models do not easily represent the geometry, and automated reconstruction from real data is difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic volumetric model that better captures the complexities of real lidar data of vegetation and is far better suited for automatic modeling of scenes from field collected lidar data. We also introduce several methods for automatic modeling and for simulating lidar data utilizing the new model. To measure the performance of the stochastic simulation we use histogram comparison metrics to quantify the differences between data produced by the real and simulated lidar. We evaluate our approach on a range of real world datasets and show improved fidelity for simulating geo-specific outdoor, vegetation scenes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroscience and robotics have allowed initial demonstrations of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for controlling wheeled and humanoid robots. However, further advances have proved challenging due to the low throughput of the interfaces and the high degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the robots. In this paper, we build on our previous work on Hierarchical BCIs (HBCIs) which seek to mitigate this problem. We extend HBCIs to allow training of arbitrarily complex tasks, with training no longer restricted to a particular robot state space (such as Cartesian space for a navigation task). We present two algorithms for learning command hierarchies by automatically extracting patterns from a user's command history. The first algorithm builds an arbitrary-level hierarchical structure (a \u201ccontrol grammar\u201d) whose elements can represent skills, whole tasks, collections of tasks, etc. The user \u201cexecutes\u201d single symbols from this grammar, which produce sequences of lower-level commands. The second algorithm, which is probabilistic, also learns sequences which can be executed as high-level commands, but does not build an explicit hierarchical structure. Both algorithms provide a de facto form of dictionary compression, which enhances the effective throughput of the BCI. We present results from two human subjects who successfully used the hierarchical BCI to control a simulated PR2 robot using brain signals recorded non-invasively through electroencephalography (EEG).",

This paper presents an efficient approach to flocking micro particles with robotics and optical tweezers technologies. All particles trapped by optical tweezers can be gradually moved towards a pre-defined region. The main contribution of this paper lies in a solution to achieve the flocking manipulation of particles in micro environments. A local potential function is proposed to avoid collision amongst particles and obstacles. Based on the relationship amongst laser power, particle movement velocity, and trapping force, saturation of velocities is employed to bound particle velocities. In this way, the flocking manipulation can be operated with efficiency and safety. Experiments on yeast cells with a robot-tweezers system are finally performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

When characterizing rock types from drill performance data, the main challenge is that there is not an obvious one-to-one correspondence between the two. In this paper, a hybrid rock recognition approach is proposed which combines Gaussian Process (GP) regression with clustering. Drill performance data is also known as Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data and a rock hardness measure - Adjusted Penetration Rate (APR) is extracted using the raw data in discrete drill holes. GP regression is then applied to create a more dense APR distribution, followed by clustering which produces discrete class labels. No initial labelling is needed. Comparisons are made with alternative measures of rock hardness from MWD data as well as state-of-the-art GP classification. Experimental results from an actual mine site show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Because of their low weight, cost and energy consumption, optic-flow sensors attract growing interest in robotics for tasks such as self-motion estimation or depth measurement. Most applications require a large number of these sensors, which involves a fair amount of calibration work for each setup. In particular, the viewing direction of each sensor has to be measured for proper operation. This task is often cumbersome and prone to errors, and has to be carried out every time the setup is slightly modified. This paper proposes an algorithm for viewing direction calibration relying on rate gyroscope readings and a recursive weighted linear least square estimation of the rotation matrix elements. The method only requires the user to realize random rotational motions of its setup by hand. The algorithm provides hints about the current precision of the estimation and what motions should be performed to improve it. To assess the validity of the method, tests were performed on an experimental setup and the results compared to a precise manual calibration. The repeatability of the gyroscope-based calibration process reached \u00b11.7\u00b0 per axis.",

The robotic lamp is a spherical type parallel mechanism with a unique forward kinematic solution. In order to minimize the dynamic load, three motors are installed at the base frame and a counter balancing design is performed. Using the coordinate transformation between the environment coordinate and the robot coordinate, the position data of the human is converted to three output angles of the robotic lamp. Positions of people are measured by a laser scanner, and in order to track the positions of people accurately by multiple robotic lamps, the Kalman filter algorithm and a data association algorithm were applied. In experiment, three robotic lamps were employed to track three people independently. For each lamp, two tilting angles are controlled for a localized light and the zoom mechanism is employed to control the intensity of the light.",

We are able to address computation, memory, and sensor limitations by considering only the known occupied space in the current map. We determine regions for further exploration based on the evolution of a stochastic differential equation that simulates the expansion of a system of particles with Newtonian dynamics. The regions of most significant particle expansion correlate to unexplored space. After identifying and processing these regions, the autonomous MAV navigates to these locations to enable fully autonomous exploration. The performance of the approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results in single and multi-floor indoor experiments.",

Specifically, we use image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to track the platform in two-dimensional image space and generate a velocity reference command used as the input to an adaptive sliding mode controller. Compared with other vision-based control algorithms that reconstruct a full three-dimensional representation of the target, which requires precise depth estimation, IBVS is computationally cheaper since it is less sensitive to the depth estimation allowing for a faster method to obtain this estimate. To enhance velocity tracking of the sliding mode controller, an adaptive rule is described to account for the ground effect experienced during the maneuver. Finally, the IBVS algorithm integrated with the adaptive sliding mode controller for tracking and landing is validated in an experimental setup using a quadrotor.",

Both the robot and the environment are subjected to behavioral specifications expressed as an assume-guarantee linear temporal logic (LTL) formula. We then consider how to efficiently modify the synthesized controller when the robot encounters unexpected changes in its environment. The crucial insight is that a portion of this problem takes place in a metric space, which provides a notion of nearness. Thus if a nominal plan fails, we need not resynthesize it entirely, but instead can \u201cpatch\u201d it locally. We present an algorithm for doing this, prove soundness (correctness of output), and demonstrate it on an example gridworld.",

This method uses the literature to define a set of mathematical constraints, custom inverse dynamics software to interact with the model and its Jacobian in realtime and then evaluates the models consistency with these constraints. The method's usefulness will be demonstrated by constructing a human hand prototype, performing functional consistency checking, and then comparing the original to the output using data from a pianist motion capture.",

        "abstract": "Three-axis tactile sensing has advantages for grasping an object of unknown mass and hardness. We developed a new three-axis tactile sensor that possesses a simple structure to endure a large applied force from a powerful grasp. Normal force distribution is measured based on grayscale values obtained by image data processing, as with previous three-axis tactile sensors. Tangential force distribution is determined by the linear movement of image data calculated by optical flow. The sensing characteristics of this sensor are dominated by the configuration and material of fine conical feelers formed on a silicon rubber sheet. By UV-LIGA, we obtain a fine mold of a silicon rubber sheet. In evaluation experiments, we applied both normal and tangential force to the sensor and confirmed this tactile sensor's ability to acquire normal and tangential forces. In its design, we utilize a USB microscope that has a CMOS camera and a light source. In a series of experiments, we performed normal and tangential force tests to obtain its basic characteristics. The linear relationship between the grayscale value and the normal force is obtained from the normal force test. If the average optical flow is under 0.2 mm, the tangential force is proportional to the average optical flow. The slope of the relationship between the tangential force and the average optical flow increases with additional normal force. Finally, we derive a series of equations for three-axis force calculation.",

Reservoir computing has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for achieving rapid learning in benchmark tasks and conventional robots. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and capacity of the reservoir computing approach to embedding and switching between multiple behaviors in a on-line manner in a soft robotic arm.

        "abstract": "The language is a symbolic system unique to human being. The acquisition of language, which has its meanings in the real world, is important for robots to understand the environment and communicate with us in our daily life. This paper proposes a novel approach to establish a fundamental framework for the robots which can understand language through their whole body motions. The proposed framework is composed of three modules: \u201cmotion symbol\u201d, \u201cmotion language model\u201d, and \u201cnatural language model\u201d. In the motion symbol module, motion data are symbolized by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Each HMM represents abstract motion patterns. Then the HMMs are defined as motion symbols. The motion language model is stochastically designed for links between motion symbols and words. This model consists of three layers of motion symbols, latent states and words. The connections between the motion symbol and the latent state, and between the latent state and the words are denoted by two kinds of probabilities respectively. One connection is represented by the probability that the motion symbol generates the latent state, and the other connection is represented by the probability that the latent state generates the word. Therefore, the motion language model can connect the motion symbols to the words through the latent state. The natural language model stochastically represents sequences of words. In this paper, a bigram, which is a special case of N-gram model, is adopted as the natural language model. This model has the words as nodes and transitions between two words as edges. Therefore sentence structure is expressed as transitions among words. The integration of the motion language model and natural language model can be implemented by the search computation for sentences corresponding to motions and for motions corresponding to sentences. Especially, the usage of the bigram as the natural language model provides a simple search computation so that appropriate and fast bidirecti... Show More",

Our focus is on analyzing suitable (passive) strategies that allow a stable teloperation of the group despite presence of delays, while still ensuring high flexibility to the group topology (e.g., possibility to autonomously split or join during the motion). The performance and soundness of the approach is validated by means of human/hardware-in-the-loop simulations (HHIL).",

First, the nonlinear operational space dynamical behavior of the complete teleoperation system is derived. Then, under the assumptions that the remote manipulators are rigidly grasping a non-deformable object and that the communications may induce constant time-delays, it is proved that velocities and position-orientation error between the local manipulator end-effector and the object asymptotically converge to zero. Simulations results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The proposed control architecture is composed of high-level and low-level controllers. The high-level controller commands the vehicle to accomplish specific tasks and renders both the state and the environment of the vehicle to the operator through haptic feedback. The low-level controller interprets the command signals from the operator, regulates the dynamics of the vehicle and feeds back its state to the high-level loop. Passivity of the teleoperation loop is always ensured independently of the choice of implementation of the low-level controller and the configuration of the flying hardware by a passivity-enforcing supervisor, which associates every action of the slave with an energy expense that can only be made available from a multi-state energy tank. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with simulations and experimental tests.",

The recent popularity of simple end-effectors and dual-manipulator platforms makes bimanual regrasping an important behavior for service robots to possess. We solve the challenge of bimanual regrasping by casting it as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize execution time. The optimization problem is supplemented by image processing and a unimanual grasping algorithm based on machine learning that jointly identify two good grasping points on the object and the proper orientations for each end-effector. The optimization algorithm exploits this data by finding the proper regrasp location and orientation to minimize execution time. Influenced by human bimanual manipulation, the algorithm only requires a single stereo image as input. The efficacy of the method we propose is demonstrated on a dual manipulator torso equipped with Barrett WAM arms and Barrett Hands.",

We have developed a human-like foot mechanism mimicking the medial longitudinal arch to clarify the function of the foot arch structure. To evaluate the arch function through walking experiments using a robot, a walking stabilization control should also be designed based on gait analysis. Physiologists suggest the ankle, hip and stepping strategies, but these strategies are proposed by measuring human beings who are not \u201cwalking\u201d but \u201cstanding\u201d against force disturbances. Therefore, first we conducted gait analysis in this study, and we modeled human walking strategy enough to be implemented on humanoid robots. We obtained following two findings from gait analysis: i) a foot-landing point exists on the line joining the stance leg and the projected point of CoM on the ground, and ii) the distance between steps is modified to keep mechanical energy at the landing within a certain value. A walking stabilization control is designed based on the gait analysis. Verification of the proposed control is conducted through experiments with a human-sized humanoid robot WABIAN-2R. The experimental videos are supplemented.",

        "abstract": "Studies of decision making in animals suggest a neural mechanism of evidence accumulation for competing percepts according to Bayesian sequential analysis. This model of perception is embodied here in a biomimetic tactile sensing robot based on the rodent whisker system. We implement simultaneous perception of object shape and location using two psychological test paradigms: first, a free-response paradigm in which the agent decides when to respond, implemented with Bayesian sequential analysis; and second an interrogative paradigm in which the agent responds after a fixed interval, implemented with maximum likelihood estimation. A benefit of free-response Bayesian perception is that it allows tuning of reaction speed against accuracy. In addition, we find that large gains in decision performance are achieved with unforced responses that allow null decisions on ambiguous data. Therefore free-response Bayesian perception offers benefits for artificial systems that make them more animal-like in behavior.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for occupancy map building using a mixture of Gaussian processes. We consider occupancy maps as a binary classification problem of positions being occupied or not, and apply Gaussian processes. Particularly, since the computational complexity of Gaussian processes grows as O(n3), where n is the number of data points, we divide the training data into small subsets and apply a mixture of Gaussian processes. The procedure of our map building method consists of three steps. First, we cluster acquired data by grouping laser hit points on the same line into the same cluster. Then, we build local occupancy maps by using Gaussian processes with clustered data. Finally, local occupancy maps are merged into one by using a mixture of Gaussian processes. Simulation results will be compared with previous researches and provided demonstrating the benefits of the approach.",

        "abstract": "While FastSLAM algorithm is a popular solution to SLAM problem, it suffers from two major drawbacks: one is particle set degeneracy due to lack of observation information in proposal distribution; the other is errors accumulation caused by inaccuracy linearization of the robot motion model and the observation model. To overcome the problems, we propose a new Jacobian free CFastSLAM algorithm. The main contribution of this work lies in the utilization of Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), which calculate Gaussian Weight Integral based on Cubature Rule, to design an optimal proposal distribution of the particle filter and to estimate the environment feature landmarks. On the basis of Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, proposed algorithm is comprised by two main parts: in the first part, a Cubature Particle Filter (CPF) is derived to localize the robot; in the second part, a set of CKFs is used to estimate the environment landmarks. The performance of the CFastSLAM is investigated and compared with that of FastSLAM2.0 and UFastSLAM in simulations and experiments. Results verify that the CFastSLAM improves SLAM performance.",

The continuum manipulator was designed for the surgical removal of osteolysis behind total hip arthroplasties. Two independently actuated cables in a pull-pull configuration control the compliant manipulator in a single plane. Using a previously developed kinematic model, we present a method for estimating drive cable displacement for a given manipulator configuration. This calibrated function is then inverted to explore the ability to achieve local manipulator configurations from prescribed drive cable displacements without the use of continuous visual feedback. Results demonstrate an effectiveness in predicting drive cable lengths from manipulator configurations. Preliminary results also show an ability to achieve manipulator configurations from prescribed cable lengths with reasonable accuracy without continuous visual feedback.",

Position-controlled robot hands can capture an object and manipulate it via caging without force sensing or force control. However, the object in caging is freely movable in the closed region, which may not be allowed in some applications. In such cases, grasping is required. In this paper, we propose a new simple approach to grasping by position-controlled robot hands with the advantage of caging: caging-based grasping by a robot hand with rigid and soft parts. In caging-based grasping, we cage an object with the rigid parts of the hand, and construct a complete grasp with the soft parts. We formulate the caging-based grasping, and derive concrete conditions for caging-based grasping in planar and spatial cases, and show some experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Appearance-based localization is increasingly used for loop closure detection in metric SLAM systems. Since it relies only upon the appearance-based similarity between images from two locations, it can perform loop closure regardless of accumulated metric error. However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods scale linearly not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform. These properties impose severe restrictions on longterm autonomy for mobile robots, as loop closure performance will inevitably degrade with increased operation time. We present a set of improvements to the appearance-based SLAM algorithm CAT-SLAM to constrain computation scaling and memory usage with minimal degradation in performance over time. The appearance-based comparison stage is accelerated by exploiting properties of the particle observation update, and nodes in the continuous trajectory map are removed according to minimal information loss criteria. We demonstrate constant time and space loop closure detection in a large urban environment with recall performance exceeding FAB-MAP by a factor of 3 at 100% precision, and investigate the minimum computational and memory requirements for maintaining mapping performance.",

        "abstract": "This article describes the concept of a novel car transportation system including two mobile robots with a lift mechanism for single wheel. The system lifts only two drive wheels of a front-wheel-drive vehicle or a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, and transports them. However, the system has nonholonomic constraints because all wheels of a vehicle are not lifted by the system. This article also describes a motion control method and a vehicle's wheelbase estimate algorithm for the proposed system in order to maneuver the vehicle. The motion control method is based on control theory for a three-wheeled cycle system. On the other hand, the vehicle's wheelbase estimate algorithm includes impedance control, and the system estimates the vehicle's wheelbase from constraint forces during transporting the vehicle. Finally, two experiments show that the proposed system can maneuver the vehicle.",

It is shown how to transform such mechanical systems with driving systems into another systems with the desired mechanical impedance. Also it is proved that the proposed principle achieves a robustness in the presence of parameter perturbations. First, we propose a new state space expression of mechanical systems with driving systems based on a natural Casimir function. Second, we propose an impedance control using an artificial Casimir function as well as the natural Casimir function. Third, we analyze a robustness not on the closed-loop stability but on the closed-loop structure. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by numerical simulations. Remarkably, the closed-loop system keeps the mechanical impedance structure robustly and thus achieves a robust behavior.",

Examples of such robots include continuous manipulators inspired by the octopus arm. However, the control strategies used by an octopus in moving its arms are still not fully understood. Starting from a dynamic model of an octopus arm and a given set of muscle activations, we develop a simulation technique to characterize the stiffness throughout a motion and at multiple points along the arm. By applying this technique to reaching and bending motions, we gain a number of insights that can help a control engineer design a biologically inspired impedance control scheme for a flexible robot arm. The framework developed is a general one that can be applied to any motion for any dynamic model. We also propose a theoretical analysis to efficiently estimate the stiffness analytically given a set of muscle activations. This analysis can be used to quickly evaluate the stiffness for new static configurations and dynamic movements.",

The mirror neuron hypothesis argues that such an overlap between action generation and recognition can provide a shared worldview among individuals and be a key pillar for communication. Inspired by these findings, this paper extends a learning by demonstration method for online recognition of observed actions. The proposed method is shown to recognize and generate different reaching actions demonstrated by a human on a humanoid robot platform. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust to both occlusions during the observed actions as well as variances in the speed of the observed actions. The results are successfully demonstrated in an interactive game with the iCub humanoid robot platform.",

The system is based around an inference engine that can extract high-level information from an observed scene, and generate appropriate commands for a set of pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras. The incorporation of a reliable facial recognition into the high-level feedback is a main novelty of our work, showing how high-level understanding of a scene can be used to deploy PTZ sensing resources effectively. The system comprises a distributed camera system using SQL tables as virtual communication channels, Situation Graph Trees for knowledge representation, inference and high-level camera control, and a variety of visual processing algorithms including an on-line acquisition of facial images, and on-line recognition of faces by comparing image sets using subspace distance. We provide an extensive evaluation of this method using our system for both acquisition of training data, and later recognition. A set of experiments in a surveillance scenario show the effectiveness of our approach and its potential for real applications of cognitive vision.",

        "abstract": "We propose a distributed algorithm for estimating the full 3-D pose (position and orientation) of multiple autonomous vehicles with respect to a common reference frame when GPS is not available. This algorithm does not rely on the use of any maps, or the ability to recognize landmarks in the environment. Instead we assume that noisy measurements of the relative pose between pairs of robots are intermittently available. We utilize the additional information about each robot's pose provided by these measurements to improve over self-localization estimates. The proposed method is based on solving an optimization problem in an underlying product manifold (SO(3)\u00d7R3)n(k). A provably correct explicit gradient descent law is provided. Unlike many previous approaches, the proposed algorithm is applicable to the 3-D case. The method is also capable of handling a fully dynamic scenario where the neighbor relationships are time-varying. Simulations show that the errors in the localization estimates obtained using this algorithm are significantly lower then what is achieved when robots estimate their pose without cooperation. Results from experiments with a pair of ground robots with vision-based sensors reinforce these findings.",

For the commonly used joint multivariate Gaussian distribution over the state space, this can be efficiently found using a Kalman filter. However, in complex environments the state space is often highly constrained. For example, for objects within a refrigerator, they cannot interpenetrate each other or the refrigerator walls. The multivariate Gaussian is unconstrained over the state space and cannot incorporate these constraints. In particular, the state estimate returned by the unconstrained distribution may itself be infeasible. Instead, we solve a related constrained optimization problem to find a good feasible state estimate. We illustrate this for estimating collision-free configurations for objects resting stably on a 2-D surface, and demonstrate its utility in a real robot perception domain.",

        "abstract": "Many manipulation planning problems involve several related sub-problems, such as the selection of grasping points on an object, choice of hand posture, and determination of the arm's configuration and evolving trajectory. Traditionally, these planning sub-problems have been handled separately, potentially leading to sub-optimal, or even infeasible, combinations of the individually determined solutions. This paper formulates the combined problem of grasp contact selection, grasp force optimization, and manipulator arm/hand trajectory planning as a problem in optimal control. That is, the locally optimal trajectory for the manipulator, hand mechanism, and contact locations are determined during the pre-grasping, grasping, and subsequent object transport phase. Additionally, a barrier function approach allows for non-feasible grasps to be optimized, enlarging the region of convergence for the algorithm. A simulation of a simple planar object manipulation task is used to illustrate and validate the approach.",

Using an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), the method combines dense range information (from stereo cameras and 3D ranging sensors) as well as visual appearance features and silhouettes of the object and manipulator to track both an object-fixed frame location as well as a manipulator tool or palm frame location. If available, tactile data is also incorporated. By using these different imaging sensors and different imaging properties, we can leverage the advantages of each sensor and each feature type to realize more accurate and robust object and reference frame tracking. The method is demonstrated using the DARPA ARM-S system, consisting of a Barrett\u2122WAM manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Planning with kinodynamic constraints is often required for mobile robots operating in cluttered, complex environments. A common approach is to use a two-dimensional (2-D) global planner for long range planning, and a short range higher dimensional planner or controller capable of satisfying all of the constraints on motion. However, this approach is incomplete and can result in oscillations and the inability to find a path to the goal. In this paper we present an approach to solving this problem by combining the global and local path planning problem into a single search using a combined 2-D and higher dimensional state-space.",

We present a new climbing robotic platform named \u201cCombot\u201d to achieve both transitioning capability and high payload capacity. The robot is composed of three main modules with flexible magnetic treads, connecting links with torsion springs and torque-controlled motors, and an active tail at the end of the robot. The robot can perform internal and external transitions using compliant torques from the torsion springs and the active tail. The compliant torques are changed according to external structures; thus, a complex feedback controller is not required. The payload capacity of the robot is measured by 10 kg (1.56 times the robot mass) during flat surface vertical climbing. The robot is expected to be used to move heavy materials to high places in the ship building industry.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important tasks for mobile robots is to sense their environment. Further tasks might include the recognition of objects in the surrounding environment. Three dimensional range finders have become the sensors of choice for mapping the environment of a robot. Recognizing objects in point clouds provided by such sensors is a difficult task. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new covariance based point cloud descriptor for such object recognition. Covariance based descriptors have been very successful in image processing. One of the main advantages of these descriptors is their relatively small size. The comparisons between different covariance matrices can also be made very efficient. Experiments with real world and synthetic data will show the superior performance of the covariance descriptors on point clouds compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

We build upon recent work that has developed methods to explicitly represent a robot's knowledge as an element, called an information state, in an appropriately defined information space. The intuition of our new approach is to constrain the I-state to remain in a structured subset of the I-space, and to enforce that constraint using appropriate over-approximation methods. The result is a collection of algorithms that enable mobile robots with extreme limitations in both sensing and computation to maintain simple but provably mean-ingful representations of the incomplete information available to them. We present a simulated implementation of this technique for a sensor-based navigation task, along with experimental results for this task showing that CGA, compared to a high-fidelity representation of the un-approximated I-state, achieves a similar success rate at a small fraction of the computational cost.",

By using high compliant series elastic actuators, the motions of joint and motor are decoupled, which allows the exploitation of natural dynamics. Depending on the cost function, this exploitation varies. Energy is injected at different points of time, the amplitude of actuator action changes significantly, and the optimal gear ratios differ by a factor of two. Variations are, however, comparable over a wide range of hopping heights and running velocities. Purely force-based cost functions prove to be ill-suited for such non-conservative systems, and it is shown that thermal electrical losses, in contrast to common belief, do not dominate energy expenditure. The numerical results are corroborated by detailed analytical considerations which give general insights into optimal excitation with electric actuators.",

To deal with possible packet losses over wireless network, a modified linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller and a disturbance observer (DOB) are applied. The performance of the proposed system and control algorithms is verified by simulation and experiment with an actual knee rehabilitation system. The simulation and experiment results show that the network-based rehabilitation system with the proposed control schemes can generate the desired assistive torque accurately in presence of packet losses.",

        "abstract": "We study an online task assignment problem for multi-robot systems where robots can do multiple tasks during their mission and the tasks arrive dynamically in groups. Each robot can do at most one task from a group and the total number of tasks a robot can do is bounded by its limited battery life. There is a payoff for assigning each robot to a task and the objective is to maximize the total payoff. A special case, where each group has one task and each robot can do one task is the online maximum weighted bipartite matching problem (MWBMP). For online MWBMP, it is known that, under some assumptions on the payoffs, a greedy algorithm has a competitive ratio of 1 over 3. Our key result is to prove that for the general problem, under the same assumptions on the payoff as in MWBMP and an assumption on the number of tasks arising in each group, a repeated auction algorithm, where each group of tasks is (near) optimally allocated to the available group of robots has a guaranteed competitive ratio. We also prove that (a) without the assumptions on the payoffs, it is impossible to design an algorithm with any performance guarantee and (b) without the assumption on the task profile, the algorithms that can guarantee a feasible allocation (if one exists) have arbitrarily bad performance in the worst case. Additionally, we present simulation results depicting the average case performance of the repeated greedy auction algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Precise and reliable estimation of orientation plays crucial role for any mobile robot operating in unknown environment. The most common solution to determination of the three orientation angles: pitch, roll, and yaw, relies on the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) that exploits inertial data fusion (accelerations and angular rates) with magnetic measurements. However, in real world applications strong vibration and disturbances in magnetic field usually cause this approach to provide poor results. Therefore, we have devised a new approach to orientation estimation using inertial sensors only. It is based on modified complementary filtering and was proved by precise laboratory testing using rotational tilt platform as well as by robot field-testing. In the final, the algorithm well outperformed the commercial AHRS solution based on magnetometer aiding.",

        "abstract": "This paper details a novel pressure-sinkage model for small-diameter, rigid wheels on dilative soils. Pressure-sinkage models are fundamental to the prediction of UGV mobility on deformable terrains. The proposed model builds on previous work in which the flat-plate pressure-sinkage assumption of classical terramechanics was shown to yield diminished accuracy for UGVs with wheels less than 50 cm in diameter. It has been shown that classical pressure-sinkage models can be modified by a diameter dependent term, yielding greatly increased accuracy. Here, an investigation into the effect of wheel width on the diameter-dependent model is detailed. Results from over 250 pressure-sinkage tests on three soils using 85 wheel geometries are summarized. The results of this investigation are used to create a comprehensive pressure-sinkage model for dilative soils that includes wheel width and diameter parameters. The physics of the model are visually validated with X-ray images of sub-surface soil deformation during the wheel indentation process. A comparison between the dilative soil pressure-sinkage model and a previously obtained model for compactive soils is also presented. The pressure-sinkage model presented here can be used to improve the accuracy of the terramechanics framework and UGV mobility predictions.",

Our major contributions are: 1) a method for extracting simple geometric features from laser data is developed, where both range images and 3D laser points are analyzed; 2) an object is modeled as a graph used to describe the composition of geometric features; 3) a graph matching based method is developed to locate the objects of interest on laser data. Experimental results on real laser data depicting urban scenes are presented; efficiency as well as limitations of the method are discussed.",

The result is an information map constructed by the environment geometry from a laser range finder and the indoor indicators from visual image. To implement this indicative information map, sensory fusion techniques: batch Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and Covariance Union (CU) are tactically utilized for robust pose and sign estimations in a single SLAM process.

Simultaneous collisions, which are common in robots that walk or climb, do not necessarily have unique outcomes, but we show that for special configurations-e.g. when the surfaces of contact are orthogonal in the appropriate sense-simultaneous impacts have unique outcomes, making them considerably easier to understand and simulate. This uniqueness helps us develop a measure of the unpredictability of the impact outcome based on the state at impact and is used for gait and mechanism design, such that a mechanism's actions are more predictable and hence controllable. As a preliminary example, we explore the configuration space at impact for a model of the RHex running robot and find optimal configurations at which the unpredictability of the impact outcome is minimized.",

Most sidewinding research has focused on straight-line translation of the snake, and less on steering capabilities. Here, we offer a new, geometrically intuitive method for steering this gait: Tapering the core cylinder into a cone, such that one end moves faster than the other, changing the heading of the robot as it drives forward. We present several design tools for working with this cone, along with experimental results on a physical robot turning at different rates.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we focus on the problem of visual odometry, i.e., the task of tracking the pose of a moving platform using visual measurements. In recent years, several VO algorithms have been proposed that employ nonlinear minimization in a sliding window of poses for this task. Through the use of iterative re-linearization, these methods are capable of successfully addressing the nonlinearity of the measurement models, and have become the de-facto standard for high-precision VO. In this work, we conduct an analysis of the properties of marginalization, which is the process through which older states are removed from the sliding window. This analysis shows that the standard way of marginalizing older poses results in an erroneous change in the rank of the measurements' information matrix, and leads to underestimation of the uncertainty of the state estimates. Based on the analytical results, we also propose a simple modification of the way in which the measurement Jacobians are computed. This modification avoids the above problem, and results in an algorithm with superior accuracy, as demonstrated in both simulation tests and real-world experiments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Planning motion for humanoid robots requires obeying simultaneous constraints on balance, collision-avoidance, and end-effector pose, among others. Several algorithms are able to generate configurations that satisfy these constraints given a good initial guess, i.e. a configuration which is already close to satisfying the constraints. However, when selecting goals for a planner a close initial guess is rarely available. Methods that attempt to satisfy all constraints through direct projection from a distant initial guess often fail due to opposing gradients for the various constraints, joint-limits, or singularities. We approach the problem of generating a constrained goal by searching for a configuration in the intersection of all constraint manifolds in configuration space (C-space). Starting with an initial guess, our algorithm, Constellation, builds a graph in C-space whose nodes are configurations that satisfy one or more constraints and whose cycles determine where the algorithm explores next. We compare the performance of our approach to direct projection and a previously-proposed cyclic projection method on reaching tasks for a humanoid robot with 33 DOF. We find that Constellation performs the best in terms of the number of solved queries across a wide range of problem difficulty. However, this success comes at higher computational cost.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel filtering technique that uses contact detection data and environmental stiffness estimates to register and localize a robot with respect to an a priori 3D surface model. The algorithm leverages geometric constraints within a Kalman filter framework and relies on two distinct update procedures: 1) an equality constrained step for when the robot is forcefully contacting the environment, and 2) an inequality constrained step for when the robot lies in the free-space of the environment. This filtering procedure registers the robot by incrementally eliminating probabilistically infeasible state space regions until a high likelihood solution emerges. In addition to registration and localization, the algorithm can estimate the deformation of the surface model and can detect false positives with respect to contact estimation. This method is experimentally evaluated with an experiment involving a continuum robot interacting with a bench-top flexible structure. The presented algorithm produces an experimental error in registration (with respect to the end-effector position) of 1.1 mm, which is less than 0.8 percent of the robot length.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Roboticists often formulate estimation problems in discrete time for the practical reason of keeping the state size tractable. However, the discrete-time approach does not scale well for use with high-rate sensors, such as inertial measurement units or sweeping laser imaging sensors. The difficulty lies in the fact that a pose variable is typically included for every time at which a measurement is acquired, rendering the dimension of the state impractically large for large numbers of measurements. This issue is exacerbated for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, which further augments the state to include landmark variables. To address this tractability issue, we propose to move the full maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem into continuous time and use temporal basis functions to keep the state size manageable. We present a full probabilistic derivation of the continuous-time estimation problem, derive an estimator based on the assumption that the densities and processes involved are Gaussian, and show how coefficients of a relatively small number of basis functions can form the state to be estimated, making the solution efficient. Our derivation is presented in steps of increasingly specific assumptions, opening the door to the development of other novel continuous-time estimation algorithms through the application of different assumptions at any point. We use the SLAM problem as our motivation throughout the paper, although the approach is not specific to this application. Results from a self-calibration experiment involving a camera and a high-rate inertial measurement unit are provided to validate the approach.",

        "abstract": "Conventional rigid body robots typically use few degrees of freedom (DOF). This results in a manipulator that lacks flexibility and maneuverability when compared to continuum robots that utilize a much higher number of DOF. However, due to their continuous nature, the difficulty of measuring and controlling a large number of actuated DOF, and their high degree of nonlinearity, the development of control algorithms for continuum robot manipulators is an ongoing challenge. This paper presents an algorithm inspired by biological solutions from live octopus that utilizes division of functionality to achieve simple and robust control of continuum arm based systems. Simulated results for single and multiple dynamic continuum arms show the controller is capable of producing motions similar to that of octopus. The resulting controller is also computationally efficient enough for real-time implementation. In future this work will be implemented on a prototype robot with multiple continuum arms.",

It is done by 1) driving robot joints directly with the posture-based state machine and 2) controlling tendon-driven compliant actuators. To enlarge gait's basin attraction for stable walking, we also adaptively plan step-to-step motion and compensate stance/swing motion. Final joint input is described by a superposition of state machine control torques and compensation torques of balancers. Various walking styles are easily generated by composing straight and turning gait-primitives and such walking is effectively able to adapt on various environments. Our proposed method is applied to a torque controlled robot platform, Roboray. Experimental results show that gaits are able to traverse inclined and rough terrains with bounded variations, and the result gaits are human-like comparing the conventional knee bent walkers.",

In other words, we try to produce a nano size clock, capsulated into the liposome, made by protein molecules. The circadian clock is a basic cellular system found in almost all organisms. This clock generates self-sustained oscillations under constant conditions with a \u2248 24-hour (circadian) period. In cyanobacteria, circadian clock could be reconstituted in vitro only by mixing the three clock proteins, KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). So we reconstitute these proteins and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into phospholipid-coated microdroplet and confirmed the clock function. The clocks in phospholipids-coated microdroplet indicate long period more than 24 hours. In this case, period length became 35 hour, self-sustaining oscillation was reaming with little dumping. To reveal why the time cycle became long period, we observed localization of Kai proteins in phospholipid-coated microdroplets by using fluorescents labeled Kai proteins under fluorescent (confocal) microscopy. From the observation of localization of Kai proteins, we found KaiB protein was distributed equivalently, on the other hand, KaiC protein was located near membrane of phospholipid-coated microdroplet. These results indicate that different localization between Kai proteins cause long period oscillation and we could control period length depend on calculation data from localization.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new method of center of mass trajectory planning using the zero-phase low pass filter is proposed. This method is based on a table-cart model which simply describes the relationship between center of mass and zero moment point. Generally, zero moment point should be controlled to realize dynamic motion. This method can easily generate the center of mass trajectory which realizes the desired zero moment point. In our study, this method is applied to wheel-legged locomotion. We will show the result that zero moment point can be sufficiently controlled even if quadruped wheel-legged mobile robot is approximated to a table-cart model. The effectiveness of the idea is validated by simulation and experiment.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown that when a magnetic dipole, such as a permanent magnet, is rotated around a fixed axis such that the dipole is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, the magnetic field vector at every point in space also rotates around a fixed axis. In this paper, we reformulate this phenomenon using linear algebraic techniques, which enables us to find the necessary dipole rotation axis to make the magnetic field at any desired point in space rotate about any desired axis. To date, untethered magnetically actuated tools (e.g., capsule endoscopes, rolling spheres, and helical-propeller microswimmers) controlled with a single rotating permanent magnet have been constrained to operate in positions where the rotating field behavior is simple and easy to visualize. We experimentally demonstrate that the results of this paper can be used to control a variety of untethered, rotating magnetic devices in any position even while the rotating permanent magnet follows trajectories independent of the devices themselves. This method constitutes a substantial step toward making a great deal of prior laboratory research regarding rotating magnetic microrobots and capsule endoscopes clinically feasible.",

This paper discusses the positioning of a single cell to a target position inside the micropipette after the cell is aspirated into the micropipette. Due to the small volume of a single cell (pico-liter) and nonlinear dynamics involved, this task has high skill requirements and is labor intensive in manual operation that is solely based on trial and error and has high failure rates. We present automated techniques in this paper for achieving this task. Computer vision algorithm was developed to track a single cell inside a micropipette for automated single-cell positioning. A closed-loop robust controller integrating the dynamics of cell motion was designed to accurately and efficiently position the cell to a target position inside the micropipette. The system achieved high success rates of 97% for cell tracking (n=100) and demonstrated its capability of accurately positioning a cell inside the micropipette within 8 seconds (vs. 25 seconds by highly skilled operators).",

The connector uses electropermanent magnets (EPMs) [1] to establish a continuum of clamping force between the robots, enabling the motion of one robot to slave the other during a variety of maneuvers. The authors design a novel, solid-state EPM arrangement capable of generating up to an estimated 890N of clamping force under environmental loading conditions. A relationship between geometric and environmental variables and connection assembly performance is first modeled and subsequently experimentally characterized. By implementing these connectors in a custom manufactured pair of assembly robots, the authors demonstrate the connection assembly and magnetizing hardware can be compactly fit within an autonomous robot application. We offer this mechanism as a repeatable, easily-automated alternative to robotic systems that depend on mechanic means to regulate clamping force [2].",

        "abstract": "Pushing heavy and large objects in a plane requires generating correct operational forces that compensate for unpredictable ground-object friction forces. This is a challenge because the reaction forces from the heavy object can easily cause a humanoid robot to slip at its feet or lose balance and fall down. Although previous research has addressed humanoid robot balancing problems to prevent falling down while pushing an object, there has been little discussion about the problem of avoiding slipping due to the reaction forces from the object. We extend a full-body balancing controller by simultaneously controlling the reaction forces of both hands using dual-arm force control. The main contribution of this paper is a method to calculate dual-arm reference forces considering the moments around the vertical axis of the humanoid robot and objects. This method involves estimating friction forces based on force measurements and controlling reaction forces to follow the reference forces. We show experimental results on the HRP-2 humanoid robot pushing a 90[kg] wheelchair.",

        "abstract": "Industrial automation tasks typically require a 3D model of the object for robotic manipulation. The ability to reconstruct the 3D model using a sample object is useful when CAD models are not available. For textureless objects, visual hull of the object obtained using silhouette-based reconstruction can avoid expensive 3D scanners for 3D modeling. We propose convex brick (CB), a new 3D primitive for modeling and reconstructing a visual hull from silhouettes. CB's are powerful in modeling arbitrary non-convex 3D shapes. Using CB, we describe an algorithm to generate a polyhedral visual hull from polygonal silhouettes; the visual hull is reconstructed as a combination of 3D convex bricks. Our approach uses well-studied geometric operations such as 2D convex decomposition and intersection of 3D convex cones using linear programming. The shape of CB can adapt to the given silhouettes, thereby significantly reducing the number of primitives required for a volumetric representation. Our framework allows easy control of reconstruction parameters such as accuracy and the number of required primitives. We present an extensive analysis of our algorithm and show visual hull reconstruction on challenging real datasets consisting of highly non-convex shapes. We also show real results on pose estimation of an industrial part in a bin-picking system using the reconstructed visual hull.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the convex hull-based power manipulability analysis of robot manipulators. Since the manipulability analysis is essential for the design and performance evaluation of robot manipulators, many researchers have focused on the well-known manipulability ellipsoid and polytope based on the Jacobian analysis to investigate the corresponding information. In spite of the good reputation of the manipulability ellipsoid, it does not provide the adequate information about how fast the manipulators can move along arbitrary direction, and the manipulability polytope also suffers from a physical inconsistency which arise when position and orientation information are combined into a single scalar performance parameter. To overcome the drawback of the physical inconsistency, the power manipulability ellipsoid has been suggested based on a new parameter which does not depend on the physical unit choice of mechanisms [1]. However, it still has the same drawback as the manipulability ellipsoid. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop the convex hull-based power manipulability in order to provide the adequate information with the physical consistency. The proposed approach is applied to a 2-DOF serial manipulator and a 3-DOF planar parallel manipulator by comparing the ellipsoid approach and the polytope one.",

We present an algorithm that enables the robots to exploit common features, observed over a sliding-window time horizon, in order to improve the localization accuracy of both vehicles. In contrast to existing CL methods, which require robot-to-robot distance and/or bearing measurements to resolve the robots' relative position and orientation (pose), our approach recovers the relative pose through indirect information from the commonly observed features. Moreover, we analyze the system observability properties to determine how many degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of the relative transformation can be computed under different measurement scenarios. Lastly, we present simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

In a light-actuated digital microfluidic system, droplets of chemicals are actuated on a photosensitive chip by moving projected light patterns. Our goal is to perform automated manipulation of multiple droplets in parallel on a microfluidic platform. To achieve collision-free droplet coordination while optimizing completion times, we apply multiple robot coordination techniques. We present a mixed integer linear programming formulation for coordinating droplets given their paths. This approach permits arbitrary droplet formations, and coordination of both individual droplets and batches of droplets. We then present a linear time stepwise approach for batch coordination of droplet matrix layouts.",

We first derive a Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) control law for a Dubins vehicle model. Given a search prior, the SMC control leads to uniform coverage dynamics for the mobile sensors such that the amount of time spent observing a region is proportional to finding a target in it. In order to make the search robust to sensor uncertainties and Automatic Target Detection algorithm errors (i.e. false alarm, missed detections), we combine the SMC control with decision and estimation theoretic techniques. As new targets are discovered we use the Sequential Ratio Probability Test and Recursive Least Squares estimation to quantify the current uncertainty in target detection and location, respectively. This uncertainty is used to update the search prior so as to balance exploitation (reduce uncertainty in state of already discovered potential targets) and exploration (discover new targets). We demonstrate this adaptive search methodology in a high fidelity simulation environment and show an improved performance over lawnmower type search.",

        "abstract": "Fast image recognition and classification is extremely important in various robotics applications such as exploration, rescue, localization, etc. k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers are popular tools used in classification since they involve no explicit training phase, and are simple to implement. However, they often require large amounts of training data to work well in practice. In this paper, we propose a batch-mode active learning algorithm for efficient training of kNN classifiers, that substantially reduces the amount of training required. As opposed to much previous work on iterative single-sample active selection, the proposed system selects samples in batches. We propose a coverage formulation that enforces selected samples to be distributed such that all data points have labeled samples at a bounded maximum distance, given the training budget, so that there are labeled neighbors in a small neighborhood of each point. Using submodular function optimization, the proposed algorithm presents a near-optimal selection strategy for an otherwise intractable problem. Further we employ uncertainty sampling along with coverage to incorporate model information and improve classification. Finally, we use locality sensitive hashing for fast retrieval of nearest neighbors during active selection as well as classification, which provides 1-2 orders of magnitude speedups thus allowing real-time classification with large datasets.",

We devise an unsupervised method that is mostly view-independent, makes no assumptions about the environment, restricts the set of hand-tuned parameters, and builds on sound probabilistic reasoning from the input data to the outcome of the algorithm. In our approach, we construct a piecewise planar model of the environment and determine curbs at plane segment boundaries. Initially, we sense the environment with a nodding laser range-finder and project the 3D measurements into an efficient Digital Elevation Map (DEM). Each cell of the DEM maintains an error model that is propagated throughout the entire algorithm. Plane segments are further estimated with a mixture of linear regression models on the DEM. Here, we propose an original formulation of the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for mixture models. Specifically, in the E-step, responsibilities are computed with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that introduces dependencies between the covariates of the mixture model. A graph-based segmentation of the DEM provides an estimate of the number of planes and initial parameters for the EM. We show promising results of the algorithm on simulated and real-world data.",

An intersection is a junction of two or more roads, appearing where no curb exists. The combination of curb and intersection features and their idiosyncrasies carry significant information about the urban road network that can be exploited to improve a vehicle's localization. This paper introduces a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) method using the curb-intersection features on urban roads. We propose a novel idea of \u201cVirtual LIDAR\u201d to get the measurement models for these features. Under the MCL framework, above road observation is fused with odometry information, which is able to yield precise localization. We implement the system using a single tilted 2D LIDAR on our autonomous test bed and show robust performance in the presence of occlusion from other vehicles and pedestrians.",

        "abstract": "Harmonic and cycloid drives are both compact, high ratio transmissions appropriate for use in anthropomorphic robots, although cycloid drives are rarely used in the field. This paper describes the design parameters for cycloid drives and shows the results of six cycloid models designed to match corresponding harmonic drives. Cycloid drive models were compared with manufacturing data from corresponding harmonic drives with respect to maximum gear ratio, transmission thickness, efficiency, backlash/gear ratio ripple, and reflected inertia. Cycloid drive designs were found to be thinner, more efficient, and to have lower reflected inertia than corresponding harmonic drives. However, the cycloid designs had larger gear ratio ripple and substantial backlash, and they could not meet the maximum gear ratio provided by the corresponding harmonic drives in two out of six models for equal applied torques. Two cycloid drives were manufactured to confirm efficiency predictions and demonstrated moderate to high efficiency across a range of output torques. Cycloid drives should be considered for robotic and prosthetic applications where smaller thickness/higher efficiency requirements dominate over low backlash/gear ratio ripple considerations.",

Next-generation nanoelectronic technologies, for the usage in intelligent implants, intelligent drugs or even ICs for the coupling of destroyed nerves, are sensitive to dimensional change. Therefore, an appropriate packaging is essential to the success or failure of these technologies. In this paper current work to use DNA as a template for bonding at the nanoscale and for novel nanoelectronic components is presented. Moreover, a method is presented, which enables the handling and manipulation of DNA at dry conditions, thus enabling the feasible usage for industrial purposes as well as for science. For this the necessary steps, starting with the immobilization and choice of useable nanowires, followed by the extraction and separation of these wires, the coarse positioning, the immobilization onto the target substrates as well as a proper fine tuning at the target are presented.",

We develop a hierarchical probabilistic model to tackle them using color information. This work is stimulated by our previous work [1] which defined a lightweight descriptor using color and geometry information from segmented panoramic images. Our novel model uses a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model to combine color and geometry features which are extracted from omnidirectional images. The inference of the model is based on an approximation of conditional probabilities of observations given estimated models. It allows online inference of the mixture model in real-time (at 50Hz), which outperforms other existing approaches. A real experiment is carried out on a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera. The results show the competence against the state-of-art.",

This paper presents an approach to control communication for the LQ team problem, namely a team of agents with linear dynamics and quadratic team cost. Communication costs are added to the objective of the LQ optimal control linear matrix inequality formulation, allowing for a well-defined balancing of communication costs and team performance. Results show a reduction in communication consistent with the specified cost and in a manner that upholds team performance relative to the reduced communication footprint. The applicability of the approach has also been extended to information gathering tasks through local LQ approximations along the agents' paths. Simulation testing on a sample two-agent problem shows a 40% reduction in communication with negligible impact on performance.",

The formation is prescribed by shape vectors which dictate the relative separations and bearings between the robots, while the group trajectory is specified as the desired trajectory of a leader or a virtual robot in the group. Each robot plans its trajectory independently based on its local information of neighboring robots which includes both the neighbor's planned trajectory and an estimate of its state. We show that the decentralized trajectory planners (a) result in consensus on the planned trajectory for predefined shapes and (b) achieve safe reconfiguration when changing shapes.",

To address this issue, this paper proposes to decentralize multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDPs) while maintaining cooperation between robots by using POMDP policy auctions. Furthermore, communication models in the multiagent POMDP literature severely mismatch with real inter-robot communication. We address this issue by applying a decentralized data fusion method in order to efficiently maintain a joint belief state among the robots. The paper focuses on a cooperative tracking application, in which several robots have to jointly track a moving target of interest. The proposed ideas are illustrated in real multi-robot experiments, showcasing the flexible and robust cooperation that our techniques can provide.",

        "abstract": "The Sparse Bundle Adjustment (SBA) algorithm is a widely used method to solve multi-view reconstruction problems in vision. The critical cost of SBA depends on the fill in of the reduced camera matrix whose pattern is known as the Secondary structure of the problem. In centered object applications where a large number of images are taken in a small area the camera matrix obtained when points are eliminated is dense. On the contrary, visual mapping systems where long trajectories are traversed yield sparse matrices. In this paper, we propose a Decomposable Bundle Adjustment (DBA) method which naturally adapts to the fill in pattern of the camera matrix improving the performance on visual mapping systems. The proposed algorithm is able to decompose the normal equations into small subsystems which are ordered in a junction tree structure. To solve the original system, local factorizations of the small dense matrices are passed between clusters in the tree. The DBA algorithm has been tested for simulated and real data experiments for different environment configurations showing good performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced locomotion method that produces non-slipping motion in digestive organs and the abdominal cavity. New movement principle of the robot, which has a soft and deformable body that can move through a confined space is proposed. The mechanism of a toy water snake is applied to this principle. Magnetic particles inside the water balloon are affected by the external magnetic field and push the inner side of a balloon to the direction of a magnetic field. We construct an experimental model to verify the proposed principle, the sliding movement is measured using the model. Confirmatory experiments of movement are conducted in the two sheets that imitated internal organs.",

Traditionally, the USBL transceiver is located on the surface, which makes necessary to feed the position fixes back to the AUV by means of an acoustic modem. An Information filter, which maintains a bounded circular buffer of past vehicle poses, is in charge of the sensor data fusion while dealing with the delays induced by the acoustic communication. The method is validated using a data set gathered for a dam inspection task.",

We define this problem as one of task assignment where the UAVs dynamically coordinate over tasks representing the imagery collection requests. To measure the quality of the assignment of one or more UAVs to a task, we propose a novel utility function which encompasses several constraints, such as the task's importance and the UAVs' battery capacity so as to maximise performance. We then solve the resulting optimisation problem using a fully asynchronous and decentralised implementation of the max-sum algorithm, a well known message passing algorithm previously used only in simulated domains. Finally, we evaluate our approach both in simulation and on real hardware. First, we empirically evaluate our utility and show that it yields a better trade off between the quantity and quality of completed tasks than similar utilities that do not take all the constraints into account. Second, we deploy it on two hexacopters and assess its practical viability in the real world.",

        "abstract": "The sheer volume of data generated by depth cameras provides a challenge to process in real time, in particular when used for indoor mobile robot localization and navigation. We introduce the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering (FSPF) algorithm to reduce the volume of the 3D point cloud by sampling points from the depth image, and classifying local grouped sets of points as belonging to planes in 3D (the \u201cplane filtered\u201d points) or points that do not correspond to planes within a specified error margin (the \u201coutlier\u201d points). We then introduce a localization algorithm based on an observation model that down-projects the plane filtered points on to 2D, and assigns correspondences for each point to lines in the 2D map. The full sampled point cloud (consisting of both plane filtered as well as outlier points) is processed for obstacle avoidance for autonomous navigation. All our algorithms process only the depth information, and do not require additional RGB data. The FSPF, localization and obstacle avoidance algorithms run in real time at full camera frame rates (30Hz) with low CPU requirements (16%). We provide experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for indoor mobile robot localization and navigation. We further compare the accuracy and robustness in localization using depth cameras with FSPF vs. alternative approaches that simulate laser rangefinder scans from the 3D data.",

An exemplar human-robot task identified in many previous works is cooperatively carrying a physically large object. An important task objective is to keep the carried object level. In this work, we propose an admittance-based controller that maintains a level orientation of a cooperatively carried object. The controller raises or lowers its end of the object with a human-like behavior in response to perturbations in the height of the other end of the object (e.g., the end supported by the human user). We also propose a novel tuning procedure, and find that most users are in close agreement about preferring a slightly under-damped controller response, even though they vary in their preferences regarding the speed of the controller's response.",

        "abstract": "Hyper-redundant manipulators can be fragile, expensive, and limited in their flexibility due to the distributed and bulky actuators that are typically used to achieve the precision and degrees of freedom (DOFs) required. Here, a manipulator is proposed that is robust, high-force, low-cost, and highly articulated without employing traditional actuators mounted at the manipulator joints. Rather, local tunable stiffness is coupled with off-board spooler motors and tension cables to achieve complex manipulator configurations. Tunable stiffness is achieved by reversible jamming of granular media, which\u2014by applying a vacuum to enclosed grains\u2014causes the grains to transition between solid-like states and liquid-like ones. Experimental studies were conducted to identify grains with high strength-to-weight performance. A prototype of the manipulator is presented with performance analysis, with emphasis on speed, strength, and articulation. This novel design for a manipulator\u2014and use of jamming for robotic applications in general\u2014could greatly benefit applications such as human-safe robotics and systems in which robots need to exhibit high flexibility to conform to their environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and analysis of a handheld manipulator for vitreoretinal microsurgery and other biomedical applications. The design involves a parallel micromanipulator utilizing six piezoelectric linear actuators, combining compactness with a large range of motion and relatively high stiffness. Given the available force of the actuators, the overall dimension of the micromanipulator was optimized considering realistic external loads on a remote center of motion representing the point of expected contact with the sclera of the eye during microsurgery. Based on optimization and workspace analysis, a benchtop version of the micromanipulator was built with a base diameter of 25 mm and a height of 50 mm. It provides a hemispherical workspace of 4.0 mm diameter at the tool tip. The manipulation performance of the constructed manipulator was measured under a lateral load applied at the remote center of motion. The micromanipulator tolerated side loads up to 200 mN.",

Specifically, a central platform lodges six silicone limbs, radially distributed, with cables embedded. A new mechanism-specific gait, invariant regarding the number of limbs, has been implemented. Functionally, some limbs provide stability while others push and pull the robot to locomote in the desired direction. Once the robot is close to a target, one limb is elected to wrap around the object and, thanks to the particular limb structure and the soft material, a friction-based grasping is achieved. The robot is inspired by the octopus and implements the key principles of locomotion in this animal, without coping the full body structure. For this reason it works in water, but it is not restricted to this environment. The experiments show the effectiveness of the original solution in locomotion and grasping.",

        "abstract": "The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms mainly composed of muscles organized in a peculiar structure, named muscular hydrostat, that can change stiffness and that is used as a sort of a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology of the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tissues are such that the interaction with the environment, namely water, is exploited to simplify the control of movements. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a paradigmatic example of embodied intelligence and a good model for soft robotics. In this paper the design and the development of an artificial muscular hydrostat are reported, underling the efforts in the design and development of new technologies for soft robotics, like materials, mechanisms, soft actuators. The first prototype of soft robot arm is presented, with experimental results that show its capability to perform the basic movements of the octopus arm (like elongation, shortening, and bending) and demonstrate how embodiment can be effective in the design of robots.",

The vehicle can change its orientation and direction of travel regardless of its current kinematic configuration and without significantly decreasing its speed. This gives it the advantage of having high mobility in relatively tight and confined spaces compared to vehicles that utilize skid or Ackermann type steering mechanisms. The vehicle described here utilizes conventional wheels, which gives it several advantages over other omnidirectional vehicle designs that use specialized wheels with small, slender rollers that can become clogged with dirt and debris commonly encountered in outdoor environments. The focus of the paper is on how the concept of kinematic isotropy affects the mechanical design of the system and the experimental results used to validate the design.",

The authors are developing an innovative localization algorithm for railway vehicles which integrates inertial sensors with tachometers. The opportunity to set up a testing simulator capable of replicating in a realistic fashion the dynamic effects of the vehicle motion on inertial sensors allows to avoid expensive on board acquisitions and to speed up algorithm tuning. The real-time control architecture featured by the available industrial robot allows to precisely specify and execute motion trajectories with tight path and time law constraints required by the application at hand.",

        "abstract": "Grippers have been shown using jamming of granular media grasp a large range of objects by pushing against them (with an activation force) to conform the gripper to the object's shape before grasping them with the intent to make universal grippers. This paper presents two effective modifications to jamming gripper designs (adding small nubs and fluidizing the granular media) resulting in significantly larger holding forces (typically 60%) and increasing the range of object geometries. The paper presents the design and fabrication of these devices and explores the range of objects and conditions empirically. Experiments also show that the nubs enable the grasping of smaller objects in which the gripper can engage interlocking forces in the granular media.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robust climbing in unstructured environments is a long-standing challenge in robotics research. Recently there has been an increasing interest in using adhesive materials for that purpose. For example, a climbing robot using hot melt adhesives (HMAs) has demonstrated advantages in high attachment strength, reasonable operation costs, and applicability to different surfaces. Despite the advantages, there still remain several problems related to the attachment and detachment operations, which prevent this approach from being used in a broader range of applications. Among others, one of the main problems lies in the fact that the adhesive characteristics of this material were not fully understood fin the context of robotic climbing locomotion. As a result, the previous robot often could not achieve expected locomotion performances and \u201ccontaminated\u201d the environment with HMAs left behind. In order to improve the locomotion performances, this paper focuses on attachment and detachment operations in robot climbing with HMAs. By systematically analyzing the adhesive property and bonding strength of HMAs to different materials, we propose a novel detachment mechanism that substantially improves climbing performances without HMA traces.",

        "abstract": "A high-fidelity attitude estimation technique for wide and irregular movements is proposed, in which heterogeneous inertial sensors are combined in complementary way. Although the working frequency ranges of each sensor are not necessarily complementary, inverse sensor models are utilized in order to restore the original movements. In the case of 3D rotation, the sensor dynamics displays a highly nonlinear property. Even if it is approximated by a linear system, the inverse model of a sensor tends to be non-proper and unstable. An idea is to decouple it into the dynamics compensation part approximated by a linear transfer function and the strictly nonlinear coordinate transformation part. Bandpass filters inserted before the coordinate transformation guarantee that the total transfer function becomes proper and stable. Particularly, the differential operator of a high-pass filter cancels the integral operator included in the dynamics compensation of the rate gyroscope, which causes instability. The proposed method is more beneficial than Kalman filter in terms of the implementation since it facilitates a systematic design of the filter.",

A single-layer diaphragm was constructed and tested to validate the concept, demonstrating up to 10\u00d7 change in stiffness.",

The main objective is to design symmetric periodic gaits in flat ground, that can be exponentially stabilized by feedback control. To this end, we apply recent advances in nonlinear control, to propose a systematic procedure to the problems of gait synthesis and control design. The core of the method lays on a nontrivial coordinate transformation, in order to approach the problem in a state-dependent form. For gait synthesis, such procedure allows a reduction of the search space, with the feasibility of considering energetic performance for optimization. For control design, this allows to apply concepts of transverse linearization, to design a nonlinear feedback control law, which performance is studied by numerical simulations.",

In our conventional research, we proposed a concept for the handling device, which cages an object without letting the object escape from its tips before closing them completely and then grasps the object robustly at a unique position of the tips. In this paper, we propose a method for designing the shape of the device's tips by considering not only the caging and self-alignment of the object but also the gear assembly task. We also develop the robust and agile pick-up device (RAPiD) with tips designed by the new method and present experimental results that illustrate the ability of RAPiD to handle and assemble gears.",

We show the operational space constraints imposed by patient anatomy when performing transrectal prostate procedures in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner bore, as determined by analyzing data from 12 patient procedures with a device. We also describe practical challenges arising in designing a compact actuated MR compatible needle placement robot for MRI-guided transrectal needle intervention in the prostate. We present a preliminary design which aims to improve upon previous un-actuated and partially-actuated devices with the addition of an actuated needle insertion module. Such an enhancement enables needle driving to take place inside the MR scanner bore and thereby may reduce the overall procedure time - thus improving patient comfort and reducing likelyhood of needle targeting errors resulting from patient motion. We show that it is feasible to add such actuation while reducing the footprint of the device in accordance with the anatomical and MR scanner constraints and practical design requirements.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe (GEMS) that mimics the desirable kinematics of a split-belt treadmill except that it does so over ground. Split-belt treadmills, with two separate treads running at different speeds, have been found useful in the rehabilitation of persons with asymmetric walking patterns. Although in preliminary testing, beneficial after-effects have been recorded, various drawbacks include the stationary nature of the split-belt treadmill and the inability to keep a person on the split-belt treadmill for an extended period of time. For this reason, the after-effects for long-term gait training are still unknown. The mobile ability of the GEMS outlined in this paper enables it to be worn in different environments such as in one's own house and also enables it to be worn for a longer period of time since the GEMS is completely passive. Healthy subject testing has demonstrated that wearing this shoe for twenty minutes can alter the wearer's gait and will generate after-effects in a similar manner as a split-belt treadmill does.",

A combination of ecoflex 0030 and 0010 were used as matrix of the composite to obtain the right stiffness for the skin artefacts. Material properties were characterised using static uniaxial tension and scissors cutting tests. Two types of tactile sensors were developed to detect normal contact; one used quantum tunnelling composite materials and the second was fabricated from silicone rubber and a conductive textile. Sensitivities of the sensors were tested by applying different modes of loading and the soft sensors were incorporated into the skin prototype. Passive suckers were developed and tested against squid suckers. An integrated skin prototype with embedded deformable sensors and attached suckers developed for the arm of an octopus inspired robot is also presented.",

        "abstract": "One of the main reasons for using a joint torque sensor in a robot is to measure body forces acting on the system. Especially, the motor actuating torque and the external link torque are important for a flexible joint control. However, it is difficult to measure or estimate those two torques simultaneously with a single joint torque sensor only due to the lack of information. In this paper, Kalman Filter based two-port Body Force OBserver(KF 2-port BFOB) was proposed to estimate two output torques from the motor-side port and the link-side port simultaneously using the two-port system dynamics, the joint angle and the sensor torque from the joint torque sensor based on the Kalman filter. The basic idea of KF 2-port BFOB is illustrated and its performance is verified by implementing the algorithm with disturbance observer(DOB) in the motor actuated one-DOF flexible joint robot. The experiments are executed in the planar situation (under the gravity-free condition) and in the vertical situation(under the gravity condition) respectively to verify the performance of KF 2-port BFOB. The results show something with conclusion.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In open abdominal surgical procedures, many surgical instruments, e.g., knives, cutting shears and clamps, are generally used. Therefore, a haptic interface should display reaction force of a soft biological tissue through such a surgical instrument. Simplest solution for this difficulty is that an actual instrument is mechanically mounted on the traditional haptic interface driven by servomotors. However, operators lose a sense of reality when they change the instrument since they must perform a procedure which is not required in actual surgery for attaching/detaching the instrument to/from the haptic interface. Therefore, a novel haptic interface using MR (Magneto-Rheological) fluid is developed in this research. Rheological property of MR fluid can be changed in a short time by applied magnetic flux density. By cutting the fluid using a surgical instrument, operators can feel resistance force as if they cut tissue. However, MR fluid cannot display large deformation of soft tissues since elastic region of MR fluid is small. Therefore, a container of the fluid is moved by a motion table driven by servomotors. In this paper, concept and design of the haptic interface and performance evaluations are described.",

The system is composed of 3 degrees of freedom using an electrical actuator. This system is mainly controlled by the multi-axis force sensor signals. These are used to generate desired torques for driving the robot system. However, singularities exist when force signals in the Cartesian coordinate system are transformed to torques in the joint coordinate system. So we applied the damped least squares method. In handling loads, torque compensation regarding the weight of the object is required. Therefore, we installed the multi-axis force sensor at the robot end effector. It measures the interaction forces between the exoskeleton and the load. To compensate for the handling object, we used the static model. We performed control stability and load handling experiments to verify the effectiveness of the controller. With these experiments, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "Active Scope Camera (ASC) using a linear inchworm drive, which can run on various road surfaces assumed in disaster sites, have been developed as a snake-like rescue robot. However, it is difficult for the linear inchworm drive to run in crooked narrow pathways, because its rigid body actuator reduces the flexibility of the scope camera and becomes immovable when the scope camera is curved. There are many crooked narrow pathways inside collapsed houses and under rubble. ASC's search range could be vastly expanded if ASC can run in such environments. In this paper, we developed a flexible linear actuator, which has the bellows structure and the hollow structure, for ASC in order to solve these problems. The actuator was able to generate large force more than 6 N from 60 kPa of applied pressure even if it was curved at 200 mm bending radius. Moreover, we developed a flexible linear inchworm drive using this actuator. The flexible linear inchworm drive keeps the running characteristics on the various road surfaces of the conventional linear inchworm drive. The minimum width of 80 deg crooked pathway that the flexible linear inchworm drive could run through was 60 mm, which was one-thirds narrower than that of the conventional inchworm drive.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an automatic system for single cell analysis inside an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was proposed. Single yeast cell was put on an tungsten probe substrate inside ESEM. The endeffector for single cell analysis was fixed to an nanorobotic manipulator, which has three degrees of freedom, i.e. X, Y and Z translation. The real time images during the experiment can be observed by ESEM system in realtime. Therefore, the position of the endeffector and the single cell can be recognized by imaging processing. These position information were used as the feedback signal to control the movement of the nanorobotic manipulator. Finally, a single cell cutting experiment was performed to demonstrate the working mechanism of this system. Two types of cell pattern substrates were also designed and fabricated as the cell analysis chips for the automation single cell analysis in the future.",

        "abstract": "Using large numbers of micro robots to build unique macrostructures has long been a vision in both popular and scientific media. This paper describes a new class of machines, DiaMagnetic Micro Manipulator (DM3) systems, for controlling many small robots. The robots are diamagnetically levitated with zero wear and zero hysteresis and are driven using conventional circuits. System test results have reported unusual motion properties, including exceptional open loop repeatability of motion (200 nm rms) and relative speeds (37.5 cm/s or 217 body lengths/s) [1]. A system using 130 micro robots as small as 1.7 mm with densities up to 12.5 robots/cm2 has been demonstrated. This paper reports initial data on robot trajectories, and shows that open loop trajectory repeatabilities on the order of 0.8 \u00b5m rms or better are feasible in a levitated state compared with 15 \u00b5m rms repeatability in a non-levitated state with surface contact. These results suggest an encouraging path to complex micro-robotic systems with broad capabilities.",

Advanced control methods, such as flexible joint tracking control and passivity observation, are introduced in the direct force reflecting control architecture. A full state feedback controller of the flexible joint slave robot controls the motor position, velocity, the joint torque, and the torque derivative. The pose of the haptic device and the first three derivatives are observed to generate reference states for the robot control using the robot's inverse dynamics model. Interaction forces of the slave and the environment are measured with a force/torque sensor and directly sent back to the master device. Stability is guaranteed with a passivity observer that monitors the energy in the teleoperation system online and disconnects master and slave if the system operates beyond its stable region. The proposed control architecture is implemented with the sigma.7 haptic device and the MIRO robot. It is experimentally shown, that appropriately considering elasticities with full state reference and control of the slave, increases the dynamic range of the system enabling transparent and stable interaction with hard and soft environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a direct teaching method for musculoskeletal robots driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). In order to reproduce motions which are directly taught by a human, it is necessary to reproduce the lengths of PAMs because they geometrically determine the posture assumed by the robot. However, it is difficult to measure the lengths of PAMs because mounting length sensors is space-consuming. Additionally, estimating lengths is also difficult because it is required to know the intrinsic parameters of PAMs which are extremely difficult to measure for each muscle. In order to overcome the above problems, the proposed method calculates the desired internal pressures or the desired axial tensions of the PAMs under a specific constraint, which forces PAM's lengths in the reproducing phase to be similar to the lengths during the teaching phase. In this way, it is possible to reproduce the motion by controlling the internal pressures or the axial tensions instead of the lengths. The validity was confirmed through an experiment using a real musculoskeletal robot arm.",

Different to conventional methods that track a desired yaw rate, the proposed controller stabilizes a vehicle by additionally tracking the heading angle of a vehicle which is more efficient and robust. The heading angle of a vehicle is obtained by a novel method which is based on centripetal force detection. It eliminates the prerequisite knowledge of the characteristics between wheels and road surface which are time varying and difficult to be measured in real time. The proposed system only requires low cost sensing equipment such as wheel speed sensor and accelerometer that makes the system practical to be utilized. The proposed heading angle detection method can be generally applied to any kind of vehicle. The deterministic yaw moment controller is also applicable to any type of four wheel independent drive vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The scan matching is widely used for localization and mapping of mobile robots. In this paper, a direction of data point in the scan is approximated and this is incorporated into the scan matching algorithm to improve the performance. The direction of data point is the normal direction of the least squares fitted line based on neighbors of the data point. Owing to this incorporation, the performance of the scan matching can be improved. The number of iterations decreases, and the tolerance against a large relative-rotation between scans increases. Using real sensor data of a laser range finder, experimental results verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, the direction augmented probabilistic scan matching.",

We adopt a multi-agent systems theory approach and assume that: (i) the manipulators (agents) are capable of sensing the relative position to their neighbors at discrete time instances, (ii) neighboring agents may exchange information at discrete time instances, and (iii) the communication topology is connected. Control of the manipulators is carried out at a kinematic level in continuous time and utilizes inverse kinematics. The mobile platforms are assigned trajectory tracking tasks that adjust the positions of the manipulator bases in order to avoid singular arm configurations. Our main result concerns the stability of the proposed control law.",

The localization aspect is not considered and it is assumed the robots share their positions and have access to a map updated with all explored areas. A key problem is then the coordination of decentralized decision processes: each individual robot must choose appropriate exploration goals so that the team simultaneously explores different locations of the environment. We formalize this problem as a Decentralized Markov Decision Process (Dec-MDP) solved as a set of individual MDPs, where interactions between MDPs are considered in a distributed value function. Thus each robot computes locally a strategy that minimizes the interactions between the robots and maximizes the space coverage of the team. Our technique has been implemented and evaluated in real-world and simulated experiments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates possible sources of variability in the dynamics of legged locomotion, even in its most idealized form. The rimless wheel model is a seemingly deterministic legged dynamic system, popular within the legged locomotion community for understanding basic collision dynamics and energetics during passive phases of walking. Despite the simplicity of this legged model, however, experimental motion capture data recording the passive step-to-step dynamics of a rimless wheel down a constant-slope terrain actually demonstrate significant variability, providing strong evidence that stochasticity is an intrinsic-and thus unavoidable-property of legged locomotion that should be modeled with care when designing reliable walking machines. We present numerical comparisons of several hypotheses as to the dominant source(s) of this variability: 1) the initial distribution of the angular velocity, 2) the uneven profile of the leg lengths and 3) the distribution of the coefficients of friction and restitution across collisions. Our analysis shows that the 3rd hypothesis most accurately predicts the noise characteristics observed in our experimental data while the 1st hypothesis is also valid for certain contexts of terrain friction. These findings suggest that variability due to ground contact dynamics, and not simply due to geometric variations more typically modeled in terrain, is important in determining the stochasticity and resulting stability of walking robots. Although such ground contact variability might be an expected result in field robotics on significantly rough terrain, we again note our experimental data applies seemingly deterministic-looking terrains: our results suggest that stochastic ground collision models should play an important role in the analysis and optimization of dynamic performance and stability in robot walking.",

        "abstract": "Dual-arm robotic systems have been intensively studied in the literature. However, in industrial robotics, the resolution of the kinematic redundancy allowed by the coordinated manipulation task is still an open issue. In fact, typical proprietary industrial robotic controllers do not allow the programmer to modify the inverse kinematics algorithm, and thus to solve redundancy following any specified criterion. In this paper a method to enforce an arbitrary redundancy resolution criterion on top of an industrial robot controller is discussed and applied to the execution of a coordinated manipulation task. The extra degrees of freedom are used to maximize the dynamic manipulability measure in order to reduce the needed torque. Simulations and experimental results achieved on an ABB IRC 5 industrial robot controller are presented.",

In this paper, a closed-loop robotic control method for optical tweezers is formulated and solved. While robotic manipulation has been a key technology driver in factory automation, robotic manipulation of cells or nanoparticles is less well understood. The proposed formulation shall bridge the gap between traditional robot manipulation techniques and optical manipulation techniques of cells. A dynamic region controller is proposed for cell manipulation using optical tweezers. The desired objective can be specified as a dynamic region rather than a position or trajectory, and the desired region can thus be scaled up and down to allow flexibility in the task specifications. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

They need to be both capable of fast dynamic locomotion and precise movements. However, there is a lack of platforms with suitable mechanical properties and adequate controllers to advance the research in this direction. In this paper we are presenting results on the novel research platform HyQ, a torque controlled hydraulic quadruped robot. We identify the requirements for versatile robotic legged locomotion and show that HyQ is fulfilling most of these specifications. We show that HyQ is able to do both static and dynamic movements and is able to cope with the mechanical requirements of dynamic movements and locomotion, such as jumping and trotting. The required control, both on hydraulic level (force/torque control) and whole body level (rigid model based control) is discussed.",

Based on the dynamic model of the suspended robot, a set of algebraic inequalities is obtained that represents the constraints on the cable tensions. Parametric Cartesian trajectories are then defined and substituted into the constraints in order to obtain global conditions on the trajectory parameters which ensure that the trajectories are feasible. Special frequencies arise from the equations that are akin to natural frequencies of pendulum-type systems. An experimental validation is also presented using a two-dof prototype. The proposed trajectory planning approach can be used to plan dynamic trajectories that go beyond the static workspace of the mechanism, thereby opening novel applications and possibilities for cable-suspended robots.",

        "abstract": "Rapid and consistent turning of running legged robots on surfaces with moderate friction is challenging due to leg slip and uncertain dynamics. A tail is proposed as a method to effect turns at higher yaw frequencies than can be obtained by differential velocity drive of alternate sides. Here we introduce a 100 mm scale dynamic robot - OctoRoACH - with differential-drive steering and a low-mass tail to investigate issues of yaw rate control. The robot without tail is underactuated with only 2 drive motors and mass of 35 grams including battery and control electronics. For some surface conditions, OctoRoACH can maintain heading or turning rate using only leg velocity control, and a basic rate-gyro-based heading control system can respond to disturbances, with a closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 1 Hz. Using a modified off-the-shelf servo for the tail drive, the robot responds to turning commands at 4 Hz and up to 400\u00b0/sec.",

The scope of this paper is to investigate the energetic effects of knee locking and addition of torsional springs to different joints of a seven-link fully actuated planar bipedal robot. The focus is on the reduction of energy consumption during walking. The energetic cost of walking is determined without joint stiffness and knee locking as a baseline for the comparison of results. In the first approach, the gait trajectory is optimized by adding springs to different joints and energetic cost of walk is then calculated at different walking speeds. The second approach presented in this paper is to mechanically lock the support knee and then optimize the gait and calculate the walking cost. The energetic cost of walking determined for the above two cases is then compared to the baseline cost. It is observed that addition of torsional springs at both hips reduce the walking cost up to 50%, support hip up to 85% with spring stiffness as an optimization variable for both cases while mechanically locking the support knee reduces the cost of walking up to 25% with gait and knee locking angle optimized.",

Recently, visual odometry priors have been widely used as the process model in the SLAM formulation to improve the SLAM performance. However, modeling the uncertainties of incremental motions estimated by visual odometry is especially difficult under challenging conditions, such as erratic motion. For a particle-based model representation, it can represent the uncertainty of the camera motion well under erratic motion compared to the constant velocity model or a Gaussian noise model, but the manner of representing the proposal distribution and sampling the particles is extremely important, as we can maintain only a limited number of particles in the high-dimensional state space. Hence, we propose an effective sampling approach by exploiting MCMC sampling and the data-driven proposal distribution to propagate the particles. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach for 6-DoF SLAM using both synthetic and real datasets and compare the performance with those of other sampling methods.",

        "abstract": "The ability to detect changes in the environment is an essential trait for robots commissioned to work in several applications. In surveillance, for instance, a robot needs to detect meaningful changes in the environment which is achieved by comparing current sensory data with previously acquired information from the environment. The large amount of sensory data, which are often complex and very noisy, explains the inherent difficulty of this task. As an attempt to tackle this hard problem, we present an efficient method to automatically segment 3D data, corrupted with noise and outliers, into an implicit volume bounded by a surface. The method makes it possible to efficiently apply Boolean operations to 3D data in order to detect changes and to update existing maps. We show that our approach is powerful, albeit simple, with linear time complexity. The method has been validated through several trials using mobile robots operating in real environments and their performance was compared to another state-of-art algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, both in accuracy and computational cost.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Research in humanoid robotics in recent years has led to significant advances in terms of the ability to walk and even run. Yet, despite the general achievements in locomotion and control, energy efficiency is still one important area that requires further attention, especially as it is one of the major steeping stones leading to increased autonomy. This paper examines, and quantifies, the energetic benefits of introducing passive compliance into bipedal locomotion using COMAN, an intrinsically COmpliant huMANoid robot. The novelty of the method proposed consists of: i) the use of a method of gait synthesis based on kinematic Motion Primitives (kMPs) extracted from human, ii) the frequency tuning of the resultant trajectories, to excite the physical elasticity of the system, and the subsequent analysis of the energetic performance of the robot. The motivation is to assess the possible effects of using dynamic human-like, and human derived, trajectories, with significant Center of Mass (CoM) vertical displacement, regulated in frequency around the frequency band of the system resonances, on the excitation of the compliant actuators, and subsequently to measure and verify any energetic benefit. Experimental results show that if the gait frequency is close to one of the main resonant frequencies of the robot, then the total work contribution of the elastic compliant element to the overall motion of the robot is positive (15% of the work required is generated by the springs).",

In this paper, we pose the summarization problem as an instance of the well known k-center problem, where the goal is to identify k observations so that the maximum distance of any observation from a summary sample is minimized. We focus on the online version of the summarization problem, which requires that the decision to add an incoming observation to the summary be made instantaneously. Moreover, we add the constraint that only a finite number of observed samples can be saved at any time, which allows for applications where the selection of a sample is linked to a physical action such as rock sample collection by a planetary rover. We show that the proposed online algorithm has performance comparable to the offline algorithm when used with real world data.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents Kinect Monte Carlo Localization (KMCL), a new method for localization in three dimensional indoor environments using RGB-D cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect. The approach makes use of a low fidelity a priori 3-D model of the area of operation composed of large planar segments, such as walls and ceilings, which are assumed to remain static. Using this map as input, the KMCL algorithm employs feature-based visual odometry as the particle propagation mechanism and utilizes the 3-D map and the underlying sensor image formation model to efficiently simulate RGB-D camera views at the location of particle poses, using a graphical processing unit (GPU). The generated 3D views of the scene are then used to evaluate the likelihood of the particle poses. This GPU implementation provides a factor of ten speedup over a pure distance-based method, yet provides comparable accuracy. Experimental results are presented for five different configurations, including: (1) a robotic wheelchair, (2) a sensor mounted on a person, (3) an Ascending Technologies quadrotor, (4) a Willow Garage PR2, and (5) an RWI B21 wheeled mobile robot platform. The results demonstrate that the system can perform robust localization with 3D information for motions as fast as 1.5 meters per second. The approach is designed to be applicable not just for robotics but other applications such as wearable computing.",

        "abstract": "Computationally efficient task execution is very important for autonomous mobile robots endowed with limited on-board computational capabilities. Most robot control approaches assume fixed state and action representations, and use a single algorithm to map states to actions. However, not all instances of a given task require equally complex algorithms and equally detailed representations. The main motivation for this work is a desire to reduce the computational footprint of performing a task by allowing the robot to run simpler algorithms whenever possible, and resort to more complex algorithms only when needed. We contribute the Multi-Resolution Task Execution (MRTE) algorithm that utilizes human feedback to learn a mapping from a given state to an appropriate detail resolution consisting of a state and action representation, and an algorithm. We then present Model Plus Correction (M+C), an algorithm that complements an existing robot controller with corrective human feedback to further improve the task execution performance. Finally, we introduce Multi-Resolution Model Plus Correction (MRM+C) as a combination of MRTE and M+C. We provide formal definitions of MRTE, M+C, and MRM+C, showing how they relate to general robot control problem and Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods. We present detailed experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed methods on a simulated goal-directed humanoid obstacle avoidance task.",

Previous work has shown that filtering based approaches can achieve accuracy performance comparable to that of optimisation methods providing that large numbers of features are used. However, computational requirements are signicantly increased and frame rates are low. We address this by employing higher level structure - in the form of planes - to efficiently parameterise features and so reduce the filter state size and computational load. Moreover, we extend a 1-point RANSAC outlier rejection method to the case of features lying on planes. Results of experiments with both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the method is effective, achieving comparable accuracy whilst running at significantly higher frame rates.",

Known under the name of \u201celectric-sense\u201d, this ability allows these fish to communicate and navigate in confined surroundings wetted by turbid waters where vision and sonar cannot work. Based on a bio-inspired electric sensor recently proposed in [1], this article presents a first attempt to use electric sense for the navigation in formation of a set of rigid underwater vehicles. The navigation strategy combines some behaviours observed in electric fish as well as a follower-leader strategy well known from multi-robot navigation. Being based one the servoing of the electric measurements, these laws do not require the knowledge of the location of the agents. Sufficient convergence conditions of the resulting control laws are given. Moreover, some limits on the possible motion of the leader are exhibited and the importance of the choice of controlled outputs is discussed too. Finally, simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the approach.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that the Reaction Null Space formulation \u2014 a method developed for motion analysis and reactionless motion generation of free-floating and flexible-base robots \u2014 can be used to fully decouple the end-link dynamics of a kinematically redundant fixed-base robot. Decoupling is achieved thereby via the pseudoinverse of a coupling-inertia submatrix, in quite a different way from the dynamic decoupling achieved via the inertia-weighted generalized inverse of the manipulator Jacobian and known from the Operational Space formulation. The properties of the new formulation are clarified with the help of a comparative study on a representative motion/force control scenario. The simulation results show that the two formulations deliver identical results as far as end-link dynamics are concerned. The new method has an advantage with regard to joint space dynamics, though, which becomes apparent especially in the neighborhood of kinematic singularities, where the inertiaweighted generalized inverse of the manipulator Jacobian is ill-behaved.",

The developed autonomy system uses robot, object, and environment models to identify and localize objects, and well as plan and execute required manipulation tasks. Deliberate interaction with objects and the environment increases system knowledge about the combined robot and environmental state, enabling high precision tasks such as key insertion to be performed in a consistent framework. This approach has been demonstrated across a wide range of manipulation tasks, and in independent DARPA testing archived the most successfully completed tasks with the fastest average task execution of any evaluated team.",

        "abstract": "The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) is considered the simplest model to effectively describe bouncing gaits (such as running and hopping) for many legged animals and robots. For this reason, it is has often been used as a model for robot design. A key challenge in using this model, however, is the lack of a closed-form solution for the equations of motion that define the stance phase of its dynamics. This results in the impossibility of analytically predicting its trajectory. Consequently, developing a practical control strategy to operate on the model is computationally intensive, because accurately predicting the step-to-step dynamics is still an unsolved problem. By adding an actuator in series with the spring, we can develop a control law for actuator displacement which enforces a desired trajectory during stance. In particular, for our specific chosen control law, we can compute an analytical solution for the stance phase trajectory. Furthermore, we give examples of higher level control strategies for foothold placement and for keeping the forward velocity or the apex height constant on rough terrain that employ our low-level control laws, and we illustrate through simulations the performance typical of our strategy.",

        "abstract": "We present an ensemble framework for the design of distributed control and communication strategies for the dynamic allocation of a team of robots to a set of tasks. In this work, we assume individual robot controllers are sequentially composed of individual task controllers. This assumption enables the representation of the robot ensemble dynamics as a class of stochastic hybrid systems that can be modeled as continuous-time Markov jump processes where feedback strategies can be derived to control the team's distribution across the tasks. Since the distributed implementation of these feedback strategy requires the estimation of certain population variables, we show how the ensemble model can be expanded to incorporate the dynamics of the information exchange. This then enables us to optimize the individual robot control policies to ensure overall system robustness given some likelihood of resource failures. We consider the assignment of a team of homogeneous robots to a collection of spatially distributed tasks and validate our approach via high-fidelity simulations.",

In order to ensure tracking accuracy of astronomical observations, firstly the elasticity model of the cable-driven Stewart manipulator is deduced to analyze the terminal error caused by the gravity torque. Newton-Raphson method is adopted to acquire the terminal error range and propose compensation strategy. Then error model considering structural deformation is formulated and the terminal accuracy is analyzed with an improved set theory based method. Finally the sensitivity analysis is also carried out and accuracy synthesis is implemented. Error modeling and analysis method proposed for the support robot in this paper can also be used to other complex hybrid robots with either large dimension or heavy duty.",

Robotic skin is poised to become a crucial interface between the robot embodied intelligence and the external world. The need to fuse and make sense out of data extracted from skin-like sensors is readily apparent. This paper presents a real-time sensor fusion algorithm that can be used to accurately estimate object position, translation and rotation during grasping. When an object being grasped moves across the sensor array, it creates a sliding sensation; the spatial-temporal sensations are estimated by computing localized slid vectors using an optical flow approach. These results were benchmarked against an L\u221e Norm approach using a nominal known object trajectory generated by sliding and rotating an object over the sensor array using a second, high accuracy, industrial robot. Rotation and slid estimation can later be used to improve grasping quality and dexterity.",

Estimating the probability of collision is an integral step in many algorithms for motion planning under uncertainty and is crucial for characterizing the safety of motion plans. Our method is computationally fast, enabling its use in online motion planning, and provides conservative estimates to promote safety. To improve accuracy, we use a novel method to truncate estimated a priori state distributions to account for the fact that the probability of collision at each stage along a plan is conditioned on the previous stages being collision free. Our method can be directly applied within a variety of existing motion planners to improve their performance and the quality of computed plans. We apply our method to a car-like mobile robot with second order dynamics and to a steerable medical needle in 3D and demonstrate that our method for estimating the probability of collision is orders of magnitude faster than na\u00efve Monte Carlo sampling methods and reduces estimation error by more than 25% compared to prior methods.",

To address this issue, we propose the use of electric sensing, with a technique inspired by weakly electric fishes. In particular, the approach relies on one or several of the agents applying an electric field to their environment. Using electric measures, others agents are able to reconstruct their relative position with respect to the emitter, over a range that is function of the geometry of the emitting agent and of the power applied to the environment. Efficacy of the technique is illustrated using a number of numerical examples. The approach is shown to allow coordination of unmanned underwater vehicles, including that of bio-inspired swimming robotic platforms.",

        "abstract": "Robotic motion planning algorithms used for task automation in robotic surgical systems rely on availability of accurate models of target soft tissue's deformation. Relying on generic tissue parameters in constructing the tissue deformation models is problematic because biological tissues are known to have very large (inter- and intra-subject) variability. A priori mechanical characterization (e.g., uniaxial bench test) of the target tissues before a surgical procedure is also not usually practical. In this paper, a method for estimating mechanical parameters of soft tissue from sensory data collected during robotic surgical manipulation is presented. The method uses force data collected from a multiaxial force sensor mounted on the robotic manipulator, and tissue deformation data collected from a stereo camera system. The tissue parameters are then estimated using an inverse finite element method. The effects of measurement and modeling uncertainties on the proposed method are analyzed in simulation. The results of experimental evaluation of the method are also presented.",

        "abstract": "The surfaces of both the Moon and Mars are covered with loose soil, with numerous steep slopes along their crater rims. Therefore, one of the most important requirements imposed on planetary rovers is their ability to minimize slippage while climbing steep slopes, i.e., the ability to generate a drawbar pull with only a small amount of slippage. To this end, the wheels/tracks of planetary rovers typically have parallel fins called lugs (i.e., grousers) on their surface. Recent studies have reported that these lugs can substantially improve the traveling performances of planetary rovers. Therefore, in this study, we conducted experiments using lightweight two-wheeled and mono-tracked rovers to provide a quantitative confirmation regarding the influence of lugs on the traveling performances of planetary rovers. Based on our experimental results, we confirmed that, although an increase in the number of lugs contributes to the high traveling performance of wheeled rovers, it does not contribute much to that of tracked rovers. Furthermore, an increase in lug height improves the traveling performances of both types of rovers.",

Such slippage can be reduced by actively readjusting the attitude of the rovers. By changing attitude, rovers can modify the position of their center of gravity and the wheel-soil contact angle. In this study, we discuss the effects of attitude changes on downhill sideslip based on the slope failure mechanism and experiments on reconfiguring the rover attitude and wheel angles. We conducted slope-traversing experiments using a wheeled rover under various roll angles and wheel angles. The experimental results show that the contact angle between wheels and slopes has a dominant influence on sideslip when compared with that of readjusting the rover's center of gravity.",

        "abstract": "Continuum manipulators, featuring \u201ccontinuous backbone structures\u201d, are promising for deft manipulation of a wide range of objects under uncertain conditions in less-structured and cluttered environments. A multi-section trunk/tentacle robot is such a continuum manipulator. With a continuum robot, manipulation means a continuous whole arm motion, where the arm is often bent into a continuously deforming concave shape. To approximate such an arm with a polygonal mesh for collision detection is expensive not only because a fine mesh is required to approximate concavity but also because each time the manipulator deforms, a new mesh has to be built for the new configuration. However, most generic collision detection algorithms apply to only polygonal meshes or objects of convex primitives. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for Collision Detection between an Exact Continuum Manipulator (CD-ECoM) and its environments, which is applicable to any continuum manipulator featuring multiple constant-curvature sections. Our test results show that using this algorithm is both accurate and more efficient in both time and space to detect collisions than approximating the continuum manipulator as polygonal meshes and applying an existing generic collision detection algorithm. The algorithm is essential for path/trajectory planning of continuum manipulators.",

The anticipated behavior of other vehicles is abstracted to a set of propositions describing the safety of road segments at intersections, and used as the output of high-level sensors for the controller.

Quite a number of studies considered the design and construction of crawling robots, however, very few focused on the interaction between the robots and the flexible environment. In a previous study, we derived the analytical efficiency of worm locomotion as a function of the number of cells, friction coefficients, normal forces and local (contact) tangential compliance. In this paper, we generalize our previous analysis to include dynamic and static coefficients of friction, determine the conditions of locomotion as function of the external resisting forces and experimentally validate our previous and newly obtained theoretical results. Our experimental setup consists of worm robot prototypes, flexible interfaces with known compliance and a Vicon motion capture system to measure the robot positioning. Separate experiments were conducted to measure the tangential compliance of the contact interface which is required for computing the analytical efficiency. The validation experiments are shown to be in clear match with the theoretical predictions. Specifically, the convergence of the tangential deflections to an arithmetic series and the partial and overall loss of locomotion verify the theoretical predictions.",

        "abstract": "While Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms have been successful at aligning 3D point clouds, they do not take into account constraints arising from sensor viewpoints. More recent beam-based models take into account sensor noise and viewpoint, but problems still remain. In particular, good optimization strategies are still lacking for the beam-based model. In situations of occlusion and clutter, both beam-based and ICP approaches can fail to find good solutions. In this paper, we present both an optimization method for beambased models and a novel framework for modeling observation dependencies in beam-based models using over-segmentations. This technique enables reasoning about object extents and works well in heavy clutter. We also make available a ground-truth 3D dataset for testing algorithms in this area.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an algorithm to estimate external forces exerted on the end-effector of a robot manipulator using information from joint torque sensors (JTS). The algorithm is combination of Time Delay Estimation (TDE) and input estimation technique where the external force is considered as an unknown input to the robot manipulator. Based on TDE's idea, the estimator which does not require an accurate dynamics model of the robot manipulator is developed. The simultaneous input and state estimation is used to reject not only nonlinear uncertainties of the robot dynamics but also the noise of measurements. The performance of the proposed estimation algorithm is evaluated through simulation of a two degree-of-freedom manipulator and it demonstrates the stability in estimating the external forces. The estimation results show that this approach allows inexpensive sensors as joint torque sensors to be used instead of expensive ones as F/T sensors in robot application.",

This method, which utilizes a dual-fingered hand of which each soft and hemispheric fingertip owns a torsional joint, has performed novel 3-dimensional dynamic object grasping and manipulation stably without the use of any external sensing device. However, several limitation and weakness have still remained in terms of dexterity and robustness. In order to improve it, firstly a triple-fingered hand is newly introduced instead of the dual-fingered hand to perform regrasping. Next, the previously proposed stable object grasping controller is adequately modified to perform dynamic regrasping during manipulation. Additionally, the virtual object attitude controller is also modified to improve its performance. Finally, several experiments are conducted by using a prototype, and the usefulness of proposed controller is demonstrated through these results.",

Some of the wearable assistive robots have mechanisms that can be adjusted to human kinematics (e.g., adjustable link length). However, since the human body has a complicated joint structure, it is generally difficult to design an assistive robot which mechanically well fits human users. We focus on the development of a control algorithm to generate corresponding movements of wearable assistive robots to that of human users even when the kinematic structures of the assistive robot and the human user are different. We first extract the latent kinematic relationship between a human user and the assistive robot. The extracted relationship is then used to control the assistive robot by converting human behavior into the corresponding joint angle trajectories of the robot. The proposed approach is evaluated by a simulated robot model and our newly developed exoskeleton robot.",

Our library is based on hierarchical representations and designed to perform multiple proximity queries on different model representations. The set of queries includes discrete collision detection, continuous collision detection, separation distance computation and penetration depth estimation. The input models may correspond to triangulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic datasets as well as motion planning and grasping computations performed using a two-armed mobile manipulation robot.",

The deformation mode is analyzed analytically using the bi-laminate theory to explore the actuator performance and further develop analytical model amenable for control strategies. A finite element material model is also developed to couple the applied electric field to the resulting deformation. The model is used to analyze more complex deformation patterns.

The microcoil design is comprised of nine out-of-plane micro-sized windings. Each winding was assembled onto the base substrate orthogonally by a robotic manipulator through microassembly. In contrast to the conventional serial pick-and-place microassembly, this work incorporated the approach of parallel microassembly to grasp and assemble three windings onto the base substrate simultaneously for increased productivity. In addition, a vision-based algorithm was developed to automate the parallel grasping process of three windings. This algorithm utilized well-defined templates to provide high-precision position and orientation evaluations for the micro-sized components. The performance of the microcoil fabrication process was evaluated and discussed. To establish better electrical contact between the windings and the base substrate, conductive adhesive was introduced in the assembly process and the electrical properties of the assembled microcoil structure were examined.",

The device is mainly composed of a flexible flat tube and a gondola probe driven by fluid power using the buckling phenomenon of the tube. The big advantage is the gondola has the potential to traverse rocky terrains that wheeled and crawler-type vehicles have difficulty in crossing over. This is because the drive force of the gondola is not against the ground but against the tube. In this paper, first, how to operate fluid powered ropeway in a disaster site is illustrated. Next, how to increase the drive force, how to enhance the ability of the gondola to travel over obstacles, and an analysis of the performance are discussed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified through an experiment that uses the prototype developed.",

This paper introduces the FastRunner, a bipedal robot based on a new leg architecture. Simulation results of a Planar FastRunner demonstrate that legged robots can run fast, be energy efficient and inherently stable. The simulated FastRunner has a cost of transport of 1.4 and requires only a local feedback of the hip position to reach 35.4 kph from stop in simulation.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenges in designing the next generation of robots operating in non-engineered environments is that there seems to be an infinite amount of causes that make the sensor data unreliable or actuators ineffective. In this paper, we discuss what faults are possible to detect using zero modeling effort: we start from uninterpreted streams of observations and commands, and without a prior knowledge of a model of the world. We show that in sensorimotor cascades it is possible to define static faults independently of a nominal model. We define an information-theoretic usefulness of a sensor reading and we show that it captures several kind of sensorimotor faults frequently encountered in practice. We particularize these ideas to models proposed in previous work as suitable candidates for describing generic sensorimotor cascades. We show several examples with camera and range-finder data, and we discuss a possible way to integrate these techniques in an existing robot software architecture.",

Most previously reported solutions to this alignment calibration problem require the use of absolute navigation fixes of the underwater vehicle, thus requiring additional navigation sensors and/or beacons to be located externally and apart from the underwater vehicle. We briefly review four recently reported alignment calibration methods employing only internal vehicle navigation sensors for velocity, acceleration, attitude, and depth. We report the results of comparative analysis of the performance of these recently reported methods and a previously reported method with navigation data from deep-water survey missions of the Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle conducted in March, 2011 in the Kermadec Arc in the Southern Pacific Ocean. The results reveal consistent differences in performance of the various methods when analyzed on navigation data from several different vehicle dives.",

The proposed sensor utilizes a principle that the volar displacement of tendon under a pulley depends on both of tendon tension and finger posture when a external compressive force is applied on the pulley. A prototype sensor is built for the verification of the proposed method. Experiments with isometric conditions are performed in 9 different finger postures to observe the response of the sensor with regard to the finger flexion force and finger posture. The results show that the output of the proposed sensor has dependency on both of finger force and posture. This implies that the sensor can be used for measuring finger flexion force when the finger posture and the corresponding sensor response is known. A simulation with simplified model is performed to explain the behavior of the sensor output.",

This requires accurate mapping, fast landing zone evaluation algorithms, and motion planning. We report here on the sensing, perception and motion planning integrated onto a full-scale helicopter that flies completely autonomously.

These experiments have demonstrated the first autonomous full-scale helicopter that successfully selects its own landing sites and avoids obstacles.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the first steps toward going from human data to formal controller design to experimental realization in the context of underactuated bipedal robots. Specifically, by studying experimental human walking data, we find that specific outputs of the human, i.e., functions of the kinematics, appear to be canonical to walking and are all characterized by a single function of time, termed a human walking function. Using the human outputs and walking function, we design a human-inspired controller that drives the output of the robot to the output of the human as represented by the walking function. The main result of the paper is an optimization problem that determines the parameters of this controller so as to guarantee stable underactuated walking that is as \u201cclose\u201d as possible to human walking. This result is demonstrated through the simulation of a physical underactuated 2D bipedal robot, AMBER. Experimentally implementing this control on AMBER through \u201cfeed-forward\u201d control, i.e., trajectory tracking, repeatedly results in 5\u201310 steps.",

        "abstract": "Advanced metal matrix composite (MMC) materials combine a metal and at least another part, such as a ceramic, to form a material with enhanced mechanical properties compared to traditional materials. An aluminium silicon carbide metal matrix material is investigated for compliant flexure design for nanopositioning systems. The material is up to 60% stiffer than traditional aluminum alloy with little to no increase in density. It is shown that the dynamic response of flexure-guided stages can be more easily tailored using the MMC. A flexure-based nanopositioner is designed to exhibit low cross-coupling behavior at high frequencies using the MMC. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to guide the design process, and a prototype stage is created and evaluated. The measured dynamic response agrees with the FEA modeling; particularly, by using the MMC the actuation mode of the stage can be designed to occur before the out-of-plane modes. The improvement in performance of using the MMC outweighs the disadvantages that include increase cost of the material and lower manufacturability compared to traditional aluminum alloys. The stage is characterized to demonstrate the advantages of the material.",

Recent tests and results from a prototype rotorcraft have shown that our hybrid structure increases stability during flight and manipulation. Since UAVs require significant setup time, suitable testing locations, and have tendencies to crash, we developed an aerial manipulation test and evaluation environment that provides controllable and repeatable experiments. By using force feedback techniques, we have designed multiple, dexterous, redundant manipulators that can grasp objects such as tools and small objects. These manipulators are controlled in concert with an emulated aerial platform to provide hovering stability. The manipulator and aircraft flight control are tightly coupled to facilitate grasping without large perturbations in the end-effector.",

        "abstract": "The traditional way of controlling an industrial robot is to program it to follow desired trajectories. This approach is sufficient as long as the accuracy of the robot and the calibration of the workcell is good enough. In robotic assembly these conditions are usually not fulfilled, because of uncertainties, e.g., variability in involved parts and objects not gripped accurately. Using force control is one way to handle these difficulties. This paper presents a method of doing force control without a force sensor. The method is based on detuning of the low-level joint control loops, and the force is estimated from the control error. It is experimentally verified in a small part assembly task with a kinematically redundant robotic manipulator.",

        "abstract": "While cable-driven systems offer the advantages of being lightweight with low moving inertia, the unilateral driving property of cables generally require them to have a greater number of actuators than their rigid-linked counterparts. This paper investigates the use of springs in an attempt to reduce the number of cables required. Given an n-DOF spring-loaded cable-driven open chain, several important questions arise: (i) How can force-closure analysis be carried out for a given spring and cable routing configuration? (ii) Are n+1 cables still necessary to fully constrain the entire open chain? (iii) What is the influence of spring placement on force-closure and cable tension required? This paper will address these concerns by proposing a systematic approach based on reciprocal screw theory. The analysis shows that an n-DOF spring-loaded cable-driven open chain still requires a minimum of n+1 cables to fully constrain it. From preliminary analysis, spring placement can have a positive effect on altering the cable tension required and increasing the feasible workspace.",

We explicitly model the slip-traction characteristic and integrate it into the WMR dynamics. Input output linearization technique is applied to each WMR such that the entire formation is subject to stable l - \u03c8 control.",

Individual object hypotheses are first generated, categorized and then used as the input to a grasp generation and transfer system that encodes task, object and action properties. The experimental evaluation compares individual 2D and 3D categorization approaches with the integrated system, and it demonstrates the usefulness of the categorization in task-based grasping and grasp transfer.",

In many computer vision algorithms, artificial markers are used to enable robust tracking; however, markerless tracking methods are more appropriate in surgical applications due to their sterilizability. This paper describes a robust, efficient tracking algorithm capable of estimating the full state parameters of a robotic surgical instrument on the basis of projective contour modeling using a 3-D CAD model of the forceps. Thus, the proposed method does not require any artificial markers. The likelihood of the contour model was measured using edge distance transformation to evaluate the similarity of the projected CAD model to the microscopic image, followed by particle filtering to estimate the full state of the forceps. Experimental results in simulated surgical environments indicate that the proposed method is robust and time-efficient, and fulfills real-time processing requirements.",

In this paper, we demonstrate how our synthesis engine GAVS+ achieves this goal by automatically creating control code for the FESTO Modular Production System. The overall approach is model-driven: we reinterpret planning domain definition language (PDDL) as a design contract to model two-player games played between control and environment, such that users can describe (i) basic abilities of hardware components, including sensors (as environment moves) and actuators (as control moves), (ii) topologies how components are interconnected, and (iii) desired specification under a restricted class of linear temporal logic. The model is processed by our game-based synthesis engine, from which intermediate code is generated. By mapping each behavioral-level action to a sequence of low-level PLC control commands, we transform the intermediate code into an executable program. The efficiency of our engine enables to synthesize every scenario presented in this paper within seconds. When the specification evolves, this implies a huge time-gain compared to manual program modification.",

        "abstract": "Human behaviors are highly affected by implicit human factors such as culture, social conventions, laws and even the mental states of individuals and groups. If robots are to be accepted by humans, they must conform to common social norms and local customs and recognize highly socialized spatial behaviors. This paper aims to extend the Spatial Behavior Cognition Model (SBCM) proposed in [14] by adding the pedestrian velocity as one of the estimated features of SBCM. In this case, robots can understand more spatial behaviors represented mainly on pedestrian velocity. Experiments for several scenarios of human environments are conducted. The results show that the proposed approach enables robots to accumulate the knowledge needed to ensure good behavior in social situations.",

        "abstract": "The paper starts by reviewing the challenges associated to grasp planning, and previous work on robot grasping. Our review emphasizes the importance of agents that generalize grasping strategies across objects, and that are able to transfer these strategies to novel objects. In the rest of the paper, we then devise a novel approach to the grasp transfer problem, where generalization is achieved by learning, from a set of grasp examples, a dictionary of object parts by which objects are often grasped. We detail the application of dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering algorithms to the end of identifying the size and shape of parts that often predict the application of a grasp. The learned dictionary allows our agent to grasp novel objects which share a part with previously seen objects, by matching the learned parts to the current view of the new object, and selecting the grasp associated to the best-fitting part. We present and discuss a proof-of-concept experiment in which a dictionary is learned from a set of synthetic grasp examples. While prior work in this area focused primarily on shape analysis (parts identified, e.g., through visual clustering, or salient structure analysis), the key aspect of this work is the emergence of parts from both object shape and grasp examples. As a result, parts intrinsically encode the intention of executing a grasp.",

Since DDP is a locally optimal feedback controller, the convergence is not guaranteed unless DDP starts with a good reference trajectory for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. The reference trajectory is generated by using the minimum-jerk trajectory method, and then the corresponding torque profile is obtained by using the computed-torque method. This reference trajectory is not optimal because it is solely based on the kinematics of the system. In the proposed method, the rate of torque change is used as control input in DDP to generate the optimal trajectory, which concurrently minimizes the torque variations and considers the dynamics of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulations for generating the optimal trajectory of a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) MyBot humanoid arm in Webots simulator.",

Although several promising approaches have been developed, applications to real-world systems are limited to simple objects or gripper configurations. The paradigm of Independent Contact Regions (ICRs) has been proposed as a way to increase the tolerance to grasp positioning errors. This concept is well established, though only on precise geometric object models. This work is concerned with the application of the ICR paradigm to models reconstructed from real-world range data. We propose a method for increasing the robustness of grasp synthesis on uncertain geometric models. The sensitivity of the ICR algorithm to noisy data is evaluated and a filtering approach is proposed to improve the quality of the final result.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to tracking dynamic objects in 3D range data. Its key contribution lies in the generative object detection algorithm which allows the tracker to robustly extract objects of varying sizes and shapes from the observations. In contrast to tracking methods using discriminative detectors, we are thus able to generalize over a wide range of object classes matching our assumptions. Whilst the generative model underlying our framework inherently scales with the complexity and the noise characteristics of the environment, all parameters involved in the detection process obey a clean probabilistic interpretation. Nevertheless, our unsupervised object detection and tracking algorithm achieves real-time performance, even in highly dynamic scenarios covering a significant amount of moving objects. Through an application to populated urban settings, we are able to show that the tracking performance of the presented approach yields results which are comparable to state-of-the-art discriminative methods.",

A mechanical preloading probe locates a tumor lesion from ultrasound imaging information and reduces lesion displacement during needle insertion by pressing the breast tissue. We validated the insertion accuracy of this method by numerical simulation and experiments both in vitro and in vivo. For further accuracy enhancement, we evaluated the geometry effect of the preloading probe on needle insertion accuracy by experiments in vitro. We compared the insertion accuracy between insertion with preloading using different probe diameters and normal needle insertion. In addition, we compared insertion accuracy at different tumor depths. The data indicated a tendency for adaptation of larger preloading probe diameters with deeper tumors. This suggests the potential for our method to enhance placement accuracy by real-time geometry regulation.",

        "abstract": "Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates the joint forces/torques that are linear in relation to the dynamic parameters, and on the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters (IDIM-LS technique). The joint forces/torques are calculated as the product of the known control signal (the current reference) by the joint drive gains. Then it is essential to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification of inertial parameters. In the previous works, it was proposed to identify each gain separately. This does not allow taking into account the dynamic coupling between the robot axes. In this paper the global joint drive gains parameters of all joints are calculated simultaneously. The method is based on the total least squares solution of an over-determined linear system obtained with the inverse dynamic model calculated with available current reference and position sampled data while the robot is tracking one reference trajectory without load on the robot and one trajectory with a known payload fixed on the robot. The method is experimentally validated on an industrial St\u00e4ubli TX-40 robot.",

        "abstract": "Here we present an approach to estimate the global pose of a vehicle in the face of two distinct problems; first, when using stereo visual odometry for relative motion estimation, a lack of features at close range causes a bias in the motion estimate. The other challenge is localizing in the global coordinate frame using very infrequent GPS measurements. Solving these problems we demonstrate a method to estimate and correct for the bias in visual odometry and a sensor fusion algorithm capable of exploiting sparse global measurements. Our graph-based state estimation framework is capable of inferring global orientation using a unified representation of local and global measurements and recovers from inaccurate initial estimates of the state, as intermittently available GPS information may delay the observability of the entire state. We also demonstrate a reduction of the complexity of the problem to achieve real-time throughput. In our experiments, we show in an outdoor dataset with distant features where our bias corrected visual odometry solution makes a fivefold improvement in the accuracy of the estimated translation compared to a standard approach. For a traverse of 2km we demonstrate the capabilities of our graph-based state estimation approach to successfully infer global orientation with as few as 6 GPS measurements and with two-fold improvement in mean position error using the corrected visual odometry.",

To carefully synthesize inter- and intra-finger couplings a rigorous way to establish grasping and manipulation properties of an underactuated hand is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a general approach to characterize the structural properties of underactuated hands focusing on their kinematic and force analysis. A complete kinostatic characterization of a given grasp (pure squeeze, spurious squeeze, kinematic grasp displacements and so on) is introduced. The analysis is quasi-static but it is not limited to rigid-body motions, encompassing also essential elastic motions, statically indeterminate configurations, and pre-loaded initial conditions. The introduction of generalized compliance at contacts and in the actuation mechanism is included, as it is an essential feature of safe and dependable modern hands. Efficient algorithms to characterize the system behavior are presented and applied in two different numerical examples.",

The basic idea is to initiate a caging manipulation state and then shrink fingers into immobilization to perform a practical grasping. Thanks to flexibility from caging, this procedure is intrinsically safe and gains tolerance towards uncertainty. Besides, we demonstrate that the minimum caging is immobilization and consequently propose using three or four fingers to manipulate planar convex objects in a grasping-by-caging way. Experimental results with physical simulation show the robustness and efficacy of our approach. We expect its leading benefits in saving finger number, conquering low-friction materials and especially, dealing with pose/shape uncertainty.",

However, the direct exposure of cells to focused laser beam may negatively influence their biological functions. In order to overcome this problem, we generate multiple optical traps to grab and move a 3D ensemble of inert particles such as silica microspheres to act as a reconfigurable gripper for a manipulated cell. The relative positions of the microspheres are important in order for the gripper to be robust against external environmental forces and the exposure of high intensity laser on the cell to be minimized. In this paper, we present results of different gripper configurations, experimentally tested using our OT setup, that provide robust gripping as well as minimize laser intensity experienced by the cell. We developed a computational approach that allowed us to perform preliminary modeling and synthesis of the gripper configurations. The gripper synthesis is cast as a multi-objective optimization problem.",

        "abstract": "While machine learning techniques have become popular tools in the design of autonomous systems, the asymptotic nature of their performance guarantees means that they should not be used in scenarios in which safety and robustness are critical for success. By pairing machine learning algorithms with rigorous safety analyses, such as Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability, this limitation can be overcome. Guaranteed Safe Online Learning via Reachability (GSOLR) is a framework which combines HJI reachability with general machine learning techniques, allowing for the design of robotic systems which demonstrate both high performance and guaranteed safety. In this paper we show how the GSOLR framework can be applied to a target tracking problem, in which an observing quadrotor helicopter must keep a target ground vehicle with unknown (but bounded) dynamics inside its field of view at all times, while simultaneously attempting to build a motion model of the target. The resulting algorithm was implemented on board the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control, and was compared to a naive safety-only algorithm and a learning-only algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the success of the GSOLR algorithm, even under scenarios in which the machine learning algorithm performed poorly (and would otherwise lead to unsafe actions), thus demonstrating the power of this technique.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, collision safety between a human and a robot has been increasingly important along with the spread of service robots. Much research has been conducted on how to design a safe manipulator, but it is not applicable to real manipulators yet. To deal with this problem, we propose a guideline to design a safe manipulator, which is composed of two phases, the safety evaluation and design parameter adjustment. To evaluate collision safety, we adopt the effective mass and manipulability and simplify the spatial collision between a human and a multi-DOF manipulator. Moreover, the experimental results from the biomechanical literature are employed for more realistic evaluation of collision safety. The design parameters and proper adjustment strategy can be established based on the safety evaluation results, and the design parameters of a manipulator can be modified to satisfy the collision safety and design requirement. The proposed guideline is implemented in the design of a 3 DOF safe manipulator, and it is shown that this guideline can be used to design a multi-DOF safe manipulator.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Although the fall of a humanoid robot is rare in controlled environments, it cannot be avoided in the real world where the robot may physically interact with the environment. Our earlier work [1], [2] introduced the strategy of direction-changing fall, in which the robot attempts to reduce the chance of human injury by changing its default fall direction in real-time and falling in a safer direction. The current paper reports further theoretical developments culminating in a successful hardware implementation of this fall strategy conducted on the Aldebaran NAO robot[3]. This includes new algorithms for humanoid kinematics and Jacobians involving coupled joints and a complete estimation of the body frame attitude using an additional inertial measurement unit. Simulations and experiments are smoothly handled by our platform independent humanoid control software package called Locomote. We report experiment scenarios where we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in changing humanoid fall direction.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring that an interaction is initiated with a particular and unsuspecting member of a group is a complex task. As a first step the robot must effectively, expediently and reliably recognise the humans as they carry on with their typical behaviours (in situ). A method for constructing a scale and viewing angle robust feature vector (from analysing a 3D pointcloud) designed to encapsulate the inter-person variations in the size and shape of the people's head to shoulder region (Head-to-shoulder signature - HSS) is presented. Furthermore, a method for utilising said feature vector as the basis of person recognition via a Support-Vector Machine is detailed. An empirical study was performed in which person recognition was attempted on in situ data collected from 25 participants over 5 days in a office environment. The results report a mean accuracy over the 5 days of 78.15% and a peak accuracy 100% for 9 participants. Further, the results show a considerably better-than-random (1/23 = 4.5%) result for when the participants were: in motion and unaware they were being scanned (52.11%), in motion and face directly away from the sensor (36.04%), and post variations in their general appearance. Finally, the results show the HSS has considerable ability to accommodate for a person's head, shoulder and body rotation relative to the sensor - even in cases where the person is faced directly away from the robot.",

        "abstract": "Motion planners for autonomous vehicles often involve a two-level hierarchical structure consisting of a high-level, discrete planner and a low-level trajectory generation scheme. To ensure compatibility between these two levels of planning, we previously introduced a motion planning framework based on multiple-edge transition costs in the graph used by the discrete planner. This framework is enabled by a special local trajectory generation problem, which we address in this paper. In particular, we discuss a trajectory planner based on model predictive control for complex vehicle dynamical models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our overall motion planning approach via examples involving non-trivial vehicle models and complex environments, and we offer comparisons of our motion planner with state-of-the-art randomized sampling-based motion planners.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel, efficient and flexible scheme to generate a high quality mesh that approximates the outer boundary of a swept volume. Our approach comes with two guarantees. First, the approximation is conservative, i.e., the swept volume is enclosed by the generated mesh. Second, the one-sided Hausdorff distance of the generated mesh to the swept volume is upper bounded by a user defined tolerance. Exploiting this tolerance the algorithm generates a mesh that is adapted to the local complexity of the swept volume boundary, keeping the overall output complexity remarkably low. The algorithm is two-phased: the actual sweep and the mesh generation. In the sweeping phase we introduce a general framework to compute a compressed voxelization. The phase is tailored for an easy application of parallelization techniques. We show this for our exemplary implementation and provide a multi-core solution as well as a GPU based solution using CUDA. The meshing phase utilizes Delaunay refinement which we carefully modified such that required guarantees are met. The approach is able to handle inputs of very high complexity at desired precision, which we demonstrate on real industrial data sets.",

In this paper, we present methods of forming line pattern of yeast cells by dielectrophoresis (DEP) and immobilizing patterned cells by photo-crosslinkable resin. High speed cell pattering by DEP and on-chip fabrication of microstructure which contains patterned yeast cells is demonstrated. In order to applying DEP force for forming cell pattern, several novel microelectrodes are fabricated by Indium Tin Oxides (ITO) which are coated on the glass. The two kinds of DEP responses of yeast cell (W303) and the precise experimental parameters of them are confirmed. Based on negative DEP phenomenon, cell traps generated by microelectrode are demonstrated. Position control and transportation of yeast cells is performed by using cell traps. Besides, a cell trap matrix is fabricated and high speed cell pattering is performed. The experimental results show that the cell line patterns which contain hundreds of yeast cells can be formed by DEP within 1 second. The on-chip fabrication for arbitrary shapes of microstructures based on Poly Ethylene Glycol Diacrylate (PEG-DA) is reported. With the cell patterning by DEP and immobilizing by on-chip fabrication, microstructure which contains 3 lines of yeast cells is fabricated in the microfluidic channel, inside PEG-DA and NaCl solution.",

The comprehensive analysis of fluid force, the optimum design and its fabrication were conducted and proved the friction reduction by riblet. The Ni and Si composite fabrication was employed to form the optimum riblet shape on the microrobot surface by wet and dry etching. The evaluation experiments show the microrobot can actuate up to 90 Hs, which is 10 times higher than the original microrobot. In addition, it can be applied to cell manipulation without harm since the microrobot is covered by Si, which is bio-compatible. One of the applications of developed microrobot was demonstrated by assembling cell aggregation in high speed.",

        "abstract": "The combination of range sensors with color cameras can be very useful for robot navigation, semantic perception, manipulation, and telepresence. Several methods of combining range- and color-data have been investigated and successfully used in various robotic applications. Most of these systems suffer from the problems of noise in the range-data and resolution mismatch between the range sensor and the color cameras, since the resolution of current range sensors is much less than the resolution of color cameras. High-resolution depth maps can be obtained using stereo matching, but this often fails to construct accurate depth maps of weakly/repetitively textured scenes, or if the scene exhibits complex self-occlusions. Range sensors provide coarse depth information regardless of presence/absence of texture. The use of a calibrated system, composed of a time-of-flight (TOF) camera and of a stereoscopic camera pair, allows data fusion thus overcoming the weaknesses of both individual sensors. We propose a novel TOF-stereo fusion method based on an efficient seed-growing algorithm which uses the TOF data projected onto the stereo image pair as an initial set of correspondences. These initial \u201cseeds\u201d are then propagated based on a Bayesian model which combines an image similarity score with rough depth priors computed from the low-resolution range data. The overall result is a dense and accurate depth map at the resolution of the color cameras at hand. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms 2D image-based stereo algorithms and that the results are of higher resolution than off-the-shelf color-range sensors, e.g., Kinect. Moreover, the algorithm potentially exhibits real-time performance on a single CPU.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by birds flying through cluttered environments such as dense forests, this paper studies the theoretical foundations of high-speed motion through a randomly-generated obstacle field. Assuming that the locations and the sizes of the trees are determined by an ergodic point process, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. In other words, if the bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, with probability one, i.e., the bird will eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm governing its motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for the special case of a Poisson forest considering a simple model for the bird's dynamics. Moreover, results from an extensive Monte-Carlo simulation study are presented. This paper also establishes novel connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory and the theory of percolation, which may be of independent interest.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of fast autonomous mobile robot navigation between obstacles while attempting to maximize velocity subject to safe braking constraints. The paper introduces position-velocity configuration space. Within this space, keeping a uniform braking distance from the obstacles can be modeled as forbidden regions called vc-obstacles. Using Morse Theory, the paper characterizes the critical position-velocity points where two vc-obstacles meet and locally disconnect the free position-velocity space. These points correspond to critical events where the robot's velocity becomes too large to support safe passage between neighboring obstacles. The velocity dependent critical points induce a cellular decomposition of the free position-velocity space into cells. Each cell is associated with a particular range of velocities that can be safely followed by the robot. The paper proposes a practical algorithm that searches the cells' adjacency graph for a maximum velocity path. The algorithm outputs a pseudo time optimal path which maintains safe braking distance from the obstacles throughout the robot motion. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm and highlight the usefulness of taking the path's velocity into account during the path planning process.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach to obtain highly accurate 3D models from range data. The key idea of our method is to jointly optimize the poses of the sensor and the positions of the surface points measured with a range scanning device. Our approach applies a physical model of the underlying range sensor. To solve the optimization task it employs a state-of-the-art graph-based optimizer and iteratively refines the structure of the error function by recomputing the data associations after each optimization. We present our approach and evaluate it on data recorded in different real world environments with a RGBD camera and a laser range scanner. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to substantially improve the accuracy of SLAM results and that it compares favorable over the moving least squares method.",

        "abstract": "It is known that bipedal robots with passive compliant structures have obvious advantages over stiff robots, as they are able to handle the potential energy management. Therefore, this paper is aimed at presenting a jumping pattern generation method that takes advantage of this property via the utilization of the base resonance frequency, which is of special importance. To begin with, the resonance frequency is determined through a system identification procedure on our actual robot. Consequentially, the vertical component of the CoM is generated via a periodic function in which the resonance frequency is employed. The horizontal component of the CoM is obtained using the ZMP criterion to guarantee the dynamic balance. Having obtained the necessary elements of the CoM trajectory within an analytical manner, joint motions are computed with the help of translational and angular momenta constraints. In order to validate the method, two legged jumping experiments are conducted on our actual compliant robot. In conclusion, we observed repetitive, continuous, and dynamically equilibrated jumping cycles with feasible landing phases.",

For this reason, we have been studying an electromagnetic linear actuator. This actuator can emulate the behavior of a human muscle such as the spring-damper characteristics by quick control of the output force (i.e. impedance control) and it is expected to be used as an artificial muscle. In this paper, we develop a monopedal robot possessing bi- and mono-articular muscles implemented by linear actuators. Thanks to the biarticular muscle, the bouncing direction of the robot can be controlled by changing the stiffness ellipse at the endpoint (i.e. foot) of the robot. We confirm that the bouncing direction of the robot can be controlled and hopping can be achieved by changing the stiffness ellipse.",

        "abstract": "Variable stiffness actuators have been developed based on different design solutions which can be arranged into two groups: antagonistic and series design. In both the cases two actuation units are combined with passive elastic elements to adjust both the stiffness and the equilibrium position of the actuated joint. To regulate the stiffness, mechanical work is required to be done which depending on the design principle of the actuator results in certain energy consumption. In this paper different variable stiffness design approaches with different types of springs (linear, quadratic, exponential and cubic) are analyzed and compared with respect to the energy required to regulate the stiffness. The results give some insights about the design parameters which mostly affect the energy consumption for the stiffness adjustment. In this work, it is shown that among different design and spring arrangements, the variable stiffness in series design which uses linear springs with constant pretension, requires the minimum energy consumption to adjust the stiffness.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the extent to which nonlinear dimension reduction techniques from machine learning can be exploited to determine dynamically optimal motions for high degree of freedom systems. Using the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) to learn the low-dimensional embedding, and a density function that provides a nonlinear mapping from the low-dimensional latent space to the full-dimensional pose space, we determine optimal motions by optimizing in the latent space, and mapping the optimal latent space trajectory to the pose space. The notion of variance tubes are developed to ensure that kinematic and other constraints are appropriately satisfied without sacrificing naturalness or richness of the motions. Case studies involving a 62-dof humanoid performing two sports motions\u2014a golf swing and throwing a baseball\u2014demonstrate that our method can be a highly effective and computationally efficient method for generating dynamically optimal motions.",

        "abstract": "In order to implement promising robot applications in our daily lives, robots need to perform manipulation tasks within the human environments. Especially for a humanoid robot, it is essential to manipulate a variety of objects with different shapes and sizes to assist humans in the human environments. This paper presents a method of manipulating objects with humanoid robot's dual arms. The robot is usually asked to control both the motion and force to manipulate the objects. We propose a novel concept of control method based on the virtual dynamics model (VDM), which enables the robot to perform both tasks of reaching to an object and grasping it under the uniform control system. Furthermore, the impedance model based on the VDM controller also enables the robot to safely grasp an object by reducing the impact at the contact point. The proposed algorithm is implemented on the humanoid robot, Mahru, with independent joint controller at each motor. Its performance is demonstrated by manipulating different types of objects.",

        "abstract": "Dextrous object manipulation with multi-fingered robot hands remains one of the key challenges of service robotics. So far, most theoretical approaches and simulators have concentrated on the search for and evaluation of static stable grasps, but with neither a model of the full hand-arm system nor the system dynamics. GraspIt! is probably the best-known simulator of this kind. In this work we present a simulator that uses the JBullet physics engine to realistically model grasps with multi-fingered hands. It supports manipulation tasks based on a complete arm and hand system, with full calculation of hand and object dynamics. A hybrid dynamics and kinematics approach avoids the oscillations introduced by the different size scale of the arm and hand, so that force-closure grasps are possible in addition to form-closure grasps. The software includes detailed models of our 24-DOF Shadow Dextrous hand and the 6-DOF Mitsubishi PA-10 robot arm. A real-time interface allows us to prepare or to replay and analyze grasp experiments performed on our real robots.",

        "abstract": "We consider robotic analogues of the arms of the octopus, a cephalopod exhibiting a wide variety of dexterous movements and complex shapes, moving in an aquatic environment. Although an invertebrate, the octopus can vary the stiffness of its long arms and generate large forces, while also performing rapid motions within its aquatic environment. Previous studies of elongated robotic systems, moving in fluid environments, have mostly oversimplified the effects of flow and the generated hydrodynamic forces, in their dynamical models. The present paper uses computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis to perform high-fidelity numerical simulations of robotic prototypes emulating the morphology of octopus arms. The direction of the flow stream and the arm geometry (e.g., the presence of suckers), were among the parameters that were shown to affect significantly the flow field structure and the resulting hydrodynamic forces, which have a non-uniform distribution along the arm. The CFD results are supported by vortex visualization experiments in a water tank. The results of this investigation are being exploited for the design of soft-bodied robotic systems and the development of related motion control strategies.",

As force torque measurements do not map uniquely to their corresponding contact formations, three steps are performed: Initially, the wrench space for each contact formation is computed automatically. Then, a contact formation graph is augmented with a similarity index that reflects the similarity of contact formations with respect to their spanned wrench spaces. A particle filter is used to represent the likeliness of a contact formation given a force torque measurement. Finally, this probability distribution is resolved taking the similarity index, the transitions of the contact formation graph and the history of identified contact formations into account. This allows the recognition of the order of demonstrated contact formations by a measured set of forces and torques. The approach is verified by experiments.",

The mechanical and friction parameters are identified from measured signals at low velocities, and with the use of a closed loop identification method. The measured signals are very noised. The number of measurement samples available is very low. The friction model depends on position, velocity and acceleration and includes the Coulomb, Stribeck and viscous frictions. A hysteresis effect integrated by an exponential term and the acceleration is added in the model. The identified parameters are validated by applying an efficient precision method based on the sensitivity analysis of nonlinear models and a normalized mean-square-error criterion.",

We present four different ISP techniques and evaluate their performance. In order to take advantage of the afore mentioned maps, we make use of Hierarchical Inverted Files (HIF) which enable efficient hierarchical loop closure. Outdoor experimental results demonstrating the sparsity, efficiency and accuracy achieved by the combination of ISP and HIF in performing loop closure are presented.",

A major problem in image-based planar reconstruction is how to assign planes to non-textured regions. Our method samples seed points from the pixels and generates plane hypotheses using the image edge points surrounding the seed points. After pruning the plane hypotheses using visibility constraints and clustering, the optimal plane is assigned to each seed point using a graph cut algorithm. A seed point graph represents continuity constraints between seed points for the smoothness terms in the graph cut in order to correct false planes generated by occlusions. Our method can be applied to both non-textured and textured environments, and also it can reconstruct planes even from curved edges. Experiments show that our method successfully reconstructed planes in various environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we discuss the use of the infinite Gaussian mixture model and Dirichlet processes for learning robot movements from demonstrations. Starting point of this work is an earlier paper where the authors learn a non-linear dynamic robot movement model from a small number of observations. The model in that work is learned using a classical finite Gaussian mixture model (FGMM) where the Gaussian mixtures are appropriately constrained. The problem with this approach is that one needs to make a good guess for how many mixtures the FGMM should use. In this work, we generalize this approach to use an infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) which does not have this limitation. Instead, the IGMM automatically finds the number of mixtures that are necessary to reflect the data complexity. For use in the context of a non-linear dynamic model, we develop a Constrained IGMM (CIGMM). We validate our algorithm on the same data that was used in [5], where the authors use motion capture devices to record the demonstrations. As further validation we test our approach on novel data acquired on our iCub in a different demonstration scenario in which the robot is physically driven by the human demonstrator.",

However, COR varies according to the colliding condition. In order to apprehend this phenomenon, analysis of impact dynamics is conducted using a 3-DOF finger mechanism. The external impulse exerted on a wall or a cart by the mechanism is a function of the robot's geometry and dynamic parameters. In this paper, we derive an analytical model of COR with the 3DOF finger model colliding to a wall and a cart, and emphasize that the actual motion just after impact is not the same as what we expected unless the variable COR is considered. The effectiveness of proposed COR model is verified through wall and cart impact experiments using the finger mechanism.",

It accomplishes this through automatic paired feature creation and reinforcement learning algorithms. This paper describes an implementation of BECCA on a seven Degree of Freedom (DoF) Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM) undergoing a series of experiments designed to test the reinforcement learner's ability to adapt to the WAM hardware. In the experiments, the following is demonstrated, 1) learning to transition the WAM between states, 2) learning to perform at near optimal levels on one, two and three dimensional navigation tasks, 3) applying learning in simulation to hardware performance, 4) learning under inconsistent, human-generated reward, and 5) combining the reinforcement learner with Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRM) to improve scalability. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate both the scalability of the BECCA reinforcement learning approach using different formulations of the state space and to show the approach in this paper operating on complex physical hardware.",

Given a recorded reference trajectory, we apply non-linear least-squares optimization to accurately approximate the trajectory using a parametric spline. The fitting process is carried out without fixed correspondences between data points and points along the spline, which improves the fit especially in sharp curves. By using a specific path model, our approach requires substantially fewer free parameters than standard approaches to achieve similar residual errors. Thus, the generated paths are ideal for subsequent optimization to reduce the time of travel or for the combination with autonomous planning to evade obstacles blocking the path. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate the advantages of our method in comparison with standard approaches.",

Their flexiblity allows surgeons to reach internal organs through sinuous and constrained ways. Unfortunately these systems are subject to backlash due to their internal mechanism. These non linearities raise many difficulties when robotizing and controlling such systems. In this article we propose an approach to improve the cartesian control of a four ways flexible endoscopic system with strong and unknown backlash-like non linearities. The method is based on an automatic off-line hystereses learning. We show that, despite coupling between degrees of freedom, it is possible to extract information from the hystereses which allow to improve cartesian control. Experiments on a real endoscopic system show the validity and the interest of the approach.",

Specifically, we examine the properties of EKF-based VIO, and show that the standard way of computing Jacobians in the filter inevitably causes inconsistency and loss of accuracy. This result is derived based on an observability analysis of the EKF's linearized system model, which proves that the yaw erroneously appears to be observable. In order to address this problem, we propose modifications to the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) algorithm [1], which ensure the correct observability properties without incurring additional computational cost. Extensive simulation tests and real-world experiments demonstrate that the modified MSCKF algorithm outperforms competing methods, both in terms of consistency and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the task of learning the reward function of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) given knowledge of the transition function and a set of expert demonstrations. While many IRL algorithms exist, Bayesian IRL [1] provides a general and principled method of reward learning by casting the problem in the Bayesian inference framework. However, the algorithm as originally presented suffers from several inefficiencies that prohibit its use for even moderate problem sizes. This paper proposes modifications to the original Bayesian IRL algorithm to improve its efficiency and tractability in situations where the state space is large and the expert demonstrations span only a small portion of it. The key insight is that the inference task should be focused on states that are similar to those encountered by the expert, as opposed to making the naive assumption that the expert demonstrations contain enough information to accurately infer the reward function over the entire state space. A modified algorithm is presented and experimental results show substantially faster convergence while maintaining the solution quality of the original method.",

        "abstract": "Robots need to have knowledge of their environment to be able to successfully complete service tasks. Most knowledge inference mechanisms assume complete and correct knowledge about the environment. Real world environments are often uncertain and only partially observable. Thus, intelligent service robots may have an incomplete knowledge base which includes true positives as well as false negatives and false positives. False negatives and false positives can prevent service robots from completing their service tasks. In the field of logical inference, false positives are a more significant problem compared to false negatives. A weighted ontology and association mechanism was proposed in previous research which recommended improvisational goal-oriented actions that could be applied in the case of false negatives. However, false positives are not usually matched in the existing ontological semantic network. Consequently, the association mechanism does not work. To deal with false positives, the weighted ontology and association mechanism were extended by adding additional nodes which are associated with epistemic actions. The proposed method was successfully evaluated and verified through experiments; results show that almost all problems associated with false positives and false negatives were resolved.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a heading drift correction method and experimental results for position tracking of human movement based on the use of foot-mounted inertial/magnetic sensor modules. A position tracking algorithm was previously developed, which incorporated a zero velocity update technique for correcting accelerometer drift. Previous experiments indicated the presence of a persistent heading drift in the estimated position. In this paper, a simple method for correcting this drift is presented. The method requires the user to walk over a closed loop path with the foot-mounted sensor module. Assuming a constant sensor bias for this initial walk, the resulting position error is then used to accomplish an in situ correction for position estimates during future walks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the drift correction method and show a significant improvement in position tracking accuracy. Accuracy is determined based on the final position estimates following walks of 100 and 400 meters. Estimated distance traveled averages within 0.2% of actual distance traveled and distance from the actual position averages within 0.28% of actual distance traveled.",

Recent technological advances in this area have introduced affordable RGB-D devices in the robotics community. In this paper, we present a real-time technique for 6-DoF camera pose estimation through the incremental registration of RGB-D images. First, a set of edge features are computed from the depth and color images. An initial motion estimation is calculated through aligning the features. This initial guess is refined by applying the Iterative Closest Point algorithm on the dense point cloud data. A rigorous error analysis assesses several sets of RGB-D ground truth data via an error accumulation metric. We show that the proposed two-stage approach significantly reduces error in the pose estimation, compared to a state-of-the-art ICP registration technique.",

        "abstract": "We propose a simple and effective method for visual loop closure detection in appearance-based robot SLAM. Unlike the Bag-of-Words (BoW hereafter) approach in most existing work of the problem, our method uses direct feature matching to detect loop closures and therefore avoid the perceptual aliasing problem caused by the vector quantization process of BoW. We show that a tree structure can be efficient in online loop closure detection. In our method, a KD-tree is built over all the key frame features and an indexing table is kept for retrieving relevant key frames. Due to the efficiency of the tree-based feature matching, loop closure detection can be achieved in real-time. To investigate the scalability of the method, we also apply the scale dependent feature selection in our method and show that the run time can be reduced significantly at the expense of sacrificing the performance to some extent. The proposed method is validated on an indoor SLAM dataset with 7,420 images.",

However, there are numerous challenges in realising autonomous operation in unknown indoor environments. A new autonomous flight methodology is presented using relative positioning sensors in reference to nearby static robots. The entirely decentralised approach relies solely on local sensing without requiring absolute positioning, environment maps, powerful computation or long-range communication. The swarm deploys as a robotic network facilitating navigation and goal directed flight. Initial validation tests with quadrotors demonstrated autonomous flight within a confined indoor environment, indicating that they could traverse a large network of static robots across expansive environments.",

In our proposed approach, a mobile robot has the ability to categorize terrain types simply by driving over them. Classification of terrain is based on measurements obtained from an inertial measurement unit strapped directly to the robot's chassis. In contrast to the previous approaches, we use acceleration and angular velocity measurements in all cardinal directions to extract over 800 features. Sequential Forward Floating Feature Selection is used to narrow down this large group of features to a set of 15 to 20 that are the most useful. The reduced set of features is used by a Linear Bayes Normal Classifier to classify terrain. Furthermore, different feature sets are generated for different velocity conditions, and the classifier switches based on the current robot velocity. Experimental results are presented that show the strong performance of the proposed system, including 90% accuracy over 20 continuous minutes of driving across different terrains.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by large fatality rates due to fires in crowded areas and the increasing presence of robots in dangerous emergency situations, we have implemented a model of information propagation among evacuees. Information about the locations of exits and the relative confidence of the individual in the location of the exit disseminated through a simulated crowd of people during an evacuation modeled after The Station Nightclub fire of 2003. True believers were added to this system as individuals who refused to accept exit information from others, instead preferring to head to their own exit. This system was then tested to find what percentage of true believers most likely existed in the actual fire. Using this true believer percentage, robots were added to the environment to guide evacuees to the nearest exit. The number of people who believed a robot's instructions was varied to find what percentage of people need to trust these robots in order to exploit information propagation and thus increase survivability. As a lower bound, we have found that 30% of the evacuees should believe a robot's instructions to significantly increase survival rates.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Indoor localization and navigation systems for individuals with visual impairments (VI) typically rely upon extensive augmentation of the physical space or heavy, expensive sensors; thus, few systems have been adopted. This work describes a system able to guide people with VI through buildings using inexpensive sensors, such as accelerometers, which are available in portable devices like smart phones. The method takes advantage of feedback from the human user, who confirms the presence of landmarks. The system calculates the user's location in real time and uses it to provide audio instructions on how to reach the desired destination. Previous work suggested that the accuracy of the approach depended on the type of directions and the availability of an appropriate transition model for the user. A critical parameter for the transition model is the user's step length. The current work investigates different schemes for automatically computing the user's step length and reducing the dependency of the approach to the definition of an accurate transition model. Furthermore, the direction provision method is able to use the localization estimate and adapt to failed executions of paths by the users. Experiments are presented that evaluate the accuracy of the overall integrated system, which is executed online on a smart phone. Both people with visual impairments, as well as blindfolded sighted people, participated in the experiments. The experiments included paths along multiple floors, that required the use of stairs and elevators.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents controllers called motion policies that achieve fast, graceful motions in small, collision-free domains of the position space for balancing mobile robots like the ballbot. The motion policies are designed such that their valid compositions will produce overall graceful motions. An automatic instantiation procedure deploys motion policies on a 2D map of the environment to form a library and the validity of their composition is given by a gracefully prepares graph. Dijsktra's algorithm is used to plan in the space of these motion policies to achieve the desired navigation task. A hybrid controller is used to switch between the motion policies. The results of successful experimental testing of two navigation tasks, namely, point-point and surveillance motions on the ballbot platform are presented.",

        "abstract": "Early fire detection is crucial to minimise damage and save lives. Video surveillance smoke detectors do not suffer from transport delays and can cover large areas. The smoke detection on images is, however, a difficult problem due the variability of smoke density, lighting conditions, background clutter, and unstable patterns. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised object classifier. Single visual features are classified using a model that simultaneously creates a codebook and categorises the smoke using a bag-of-words paradigm based on LDA model. Our algorithm can also tell the amount of smoke present on the image. Multiple image sequences from different cameras are used to show the viability of the proposed approach. Our experiments show that the model generalises well for different cameras, perspectives and scales.",

In this paper we consider as objects those physical entities that are comprised of features which move consistently when the robot acts upon them. Among the possible actions that a robot could apply to a hypothetical object, pushing seems to be the most suitable one due to its relative simplicity and general applicability. We propose a methodology to generate and apply pushing actions to hypothetical objects. A probing push causes visual features to move, which enables the robot to either confirm or reject the initial hypothesis about existence of the object. Furthermore, the robot can discriminate the object from the background and accumulate visual features that are useful for training of state of the art statistical classifiers such as bag of features.",

The unique design of the IREP includes planar parallel mechanisms, continuum snake-like arms, wire-actuated wrists, and passive flexible components. While this design has advantages, it presents challenges in terms of modeling, control, and telemanipulation. The complete master-slave resolved-rates telemanipulation framework of the IREP along with its actuation compensation is presented. Experimental evaluation of the capabilities of this new surgical system include bi-manual exchange of rings, pick-and-place tasks, suture passing and knot tying. Results show that the IREP meets the minimal workspace and dexterity requirements specified for laparoscopic surgery, it allows for dual-arm operations such as tool exchange and knot tying in confined spaces. Although it was possible to tie a surgeon's knot with minimal training, suture passing was difficult due to the limited axial rotation of the distal wrists.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a framework for the integration of force feedback information in a NASA NextGen Volumetric Cockpit Situation Display (CSD). With the current CSD, the user retrieves operational information solely through visual displays and interacts with the CSD tools through using a mouse. The advanced capabilities of the CSD may require complex manipulation of information which may be difficult to perform with input devices found in today's cockpits. Performance with the CSD could benefit from a new user input device and enhanced user feedback modalities that can be operated safely, effectively, and intuitively in a cockpit environment. In this work, we investigate the addition of force feedback in two key CSD tasks: object selection and route manipulation. Different force feedback models were applied to communicate guidance commands, such as collision avoidance and target contact. We also discuss the development of a GUI-based software interface to allow the integration of a haptic device for the CSD. A preliminary user study was conducted on a testbed system using the Novint Falcon force-feedback device. A full experiment, assessing the effectiveness and usability of the feedback model in the CSD, will be performed in the next phase of our research.",

The system integrates a commodity range camera, a micro-projector, and a button interface for user input and allows the user to freely move through a building to capture its important architectural elements. The system uses the Manhattan world assumption, which posits that wall layouts are rectilinear. This assumption allows generating floor plans in real time, enabling the operator to interactively guide the reconstruction process and to resolve structural ambiguities and errors during the acquisition. The interactive component aids users with no architectural training in acquiring wall layouts for their residences. We show a number of residential floor plans reconstructed with the system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for generating dynamically-feasible, natural-looking robot motion from freehand sketches. Using trajectory optimization, it handles sketches that are too fast, jerky, or pass out of reach by enforcing the constraints of the robot's dynamic limitations while minimizing the relative temporal differences between the robot's trajectory and the sketch. To make the optimization fast enough for interactive use, a variety of enhancements are employed including decoupling the geometric and temporal optimizations and methods to select good initial trajectories. The technique is also applicable to transferring human motions onto robots with non-human appearance and dynamics, and we use our method to demonstrate a simulated humanoid imitating a golf swing as well as an industrial robot performing the motion of writing a cursive \u201chello\u201d word.",

        "abstract": "Interaction with unstructured groups of objects allows a robot to discover and manipulate novel items in cluttered environments. We present a framework for interactive singulation of individual items from a pile. The proposed framework provides an overall approach for tasks involving operation on multiple objects, such as counting, arranging, or sorting items in a pile. A perception module combined with pushing actions accumulates evidence of singulated items over multiple pile interactions. A decision module scores the likelihood of a single-item pile to a multiple-item pile based on the magnitude of motion and matching determined from the perception module. Three variations of the singulation framework were evaluated on a physical robot for an arrangement task. The proposed interactive singulation method with adaptive pushing reduces the grasp errors on non-singulated piles compared to alternative methods without the perception and decision modules. This work contributes the general pile interaction framework, a specific method for integrating perception and action plans with grasp decisions, and an experimental evaluation of the cost trade-offs for different singulation methods.",

        "abstract": "The success of assembly and manipulation tasks is highly dependent on the precision of robotic positioners employed. In turn, precision metrics for robots depend on the kinematic design, choice of actuators, sensors, and control system. In this paper, we investigate the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robot precision using interval analysis. The advantage of interval analysis is that it provides rigorous bounds on the effects of errors in terms of interval numbers. Two types of errors are considered: geometric errors due to link and joint parameter uncertainties, and sensing errors due to inaccurate measurement of joint positions. We show that modeling and simulation of these uncertainties using intervals can provide useful insight into the evaluation of manipulator precision for a given task. In particular, simulation results are offered to predict the required tolerances in a peg-in-hole microassembly operation. It is illustrated that the presented approach can replace computationally more expensive Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the effect of uncertainties.",

Thus, we propose a method for measuring brain activity to determine intuitive operability in order to design a robot with intuitive operability. The objective of this paper is to clarify the angle between the endoscope and the manipulator that facilitates users perceiving the manipulator as part of their body. In the experiments, while subjects controlled the hand controller to position the tip of the virtual slave manipulator on the target in the surgical simulator, we measured the brain activity through brain imaging devices. We carried out the experiment a number of times with the virtual slave manipulator configured in a variety of ways. The results show that activation of the brain is significant with the slave manipulator configured such that the angles are slanted with respect to the horizontal. We conclude that the body image affects hand-eye coordination, which is related to visual and somatic sense feedback.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development, simulation and experimental testing of a non-linear Kalman filter for attitude estimation. This non-linear filter is able to conserve the invariants of the Kalman filter, i.e., the expectations on state estimates and their covariances, by operating in the Lie algebra of SO(3) and along the trajectory of evolving angular momentum. The main feature of this novel discrete-time filter is that the linearization of the Gaussian uncertainty around these permanent trajectories leads to a locally optimal Kalman gain matrix. Results confirm that this Invariant Momentum-tracking Kalman Filter (IMKF) out-performs state-of-the-art approaches such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF). At very-low sampling rates, EKFs suffer from divergence as the uncertainty propagation is corrupted by the underlying system approximations. The IMKF suffers no such problems according to the theoretical developments and results reported here.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an approach to inverse optimal control for a class of hybrid dynamical system with impacts. As it is usually posed, the problem of inverse optimal control is to find a cost function that is consistent with an observed sequence of decisions, under the assumption that these decisions are optimal. We assume instead that observed decisions are only approximately optimal and find a cost function that minimizes the extent to which these decisions violate first-order necessary conditions for optimality. For the hybrid dynamical system that we consider with a cost function that is a linear combination of known basis functions, this minimization is a convex program. In fact, it reduces to a simple least-squares computation that - unlike most other forms of inverse optimal control - can be solved very efficiently. We apply our approach to a dynamic bipedal climbing robot in simulation, showing that we can recover cost functions from observed trajectories that are consistent with two different modes of locomotion.",

Although the two tasks are complementary in nature, most previous approaches focus on them individually. Here, we resolve the two problems simultaneously by building and inferring a single body model. More specifically, pedestrian segmentation is performed by optimizing body region with constraint of body pose in a Markov Random Field (MRF), and pose parameters are reasoned about through a Bayesian filtering, which takes body silhouette as an observation cue. Since the two processes are inter-related, we resort to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to refine them alternatively. Additionally, a template matching scheme is utilized for initialization. Experimental results on challenging videos verify the framework's robustness to non-rigid human segmentation, cluttered backgrounds and moving cameras.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a joint control method for tendon-driven mechanisms (TDMs) with branching tendons, in which multiple tendons are connected at a point, and which are often found in musculoskeletal systems. TDMs usually require the same number of tendons as actuators, which are one of the heaviest components in a robotic system. The utilization of branching tendons is useful for reducing the number of actuators needed when making lightweight robotic mechanisms, such as prosthetic hands. However, the under-actuation of branching tendons makes it difficult to accurately control the joint motion of TDMs. Therefore, TDMs with branching tendons have been used only for simple adaptive grasping mechanisms. In this paper, we derive the tendon kinematics of TDMs with branching tendons and design a joint PD controller for the mechanisms. We demonstrate the stability of the control system using Lyapunov's direct method. We show that the bias force setting, which does not appear in conventional TDMs, is important in the realization of accurate control in TDMs with branching tendons. Simulations were performed to evaluate the proposed method.",

To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.",

        "abstract": "Although legged locomotion for robots has been studied for many years, the research of autonomous wheellegged robotics is much more recent. Robots of this type, also described as hybrid, can take advantage of the energy efficiency of wheeled locomotion while adapting to more difficult terrain with legged locomotion when necessary. The Micro Hydraulic Toolkit (MHT), developed by engineers at Defence R&D Canada - Suffield, is a good example of such a robot. Investigation into control and optimization techniques for MHT leads to a better understanding of hybrid vehicle control for terrestrial exploration and reconnaissance. Control of hybrid robots has been studied by several researchers during the last decade. The methodology applied in this work uses an inverse kinematics algorithm developed previously for a hybrid robot Hylos, and implements an optimization technique to minimize torques occurring at crucial actuators. As well, some added functionality is incorporated into the control method to implement stepping maneuvers. This paper will present the results obtained via co-simulation using Matlab's Simulink and a high-fidelity model of MHT in LMS Virtual Lab.",

        "abstract": "The thorax of an insect has direct flight muscles that can independently control the flapping amplitude, relative phase, and mean position of its left and right wings. This feature allows insects to modulate lateral dynamics during hovering flight, resulting in high flight maneuverability. This paper introduces the development and characterization of a novel flapping mechanism for MAVs, denoted as AIFM (Asymmetric In-phase Flapping Mechanism), that is capable of achieving controlled, asymmetric in-phase wing flapping as inspired by similar features in insects. The system consists of two 4-bar mechanisms that create basic flapping motions and two RRPR mechanisms that control the asymmetric flapping motion. The kinematics of the mechanism was investigated and optimized in such a way that enables the mechanism to produce reliable, in-phase wing motion during asymmetric flapping flight. The kinematics of the wings was evaluated both computationally and experimentally. It was shown that asymmetric wing flapping can be successfully achieved without affecting the in-phase flapping motion.",

Our inherently cross-modal approach offers robustness to changes in scene lighting and is computationally cheap. At the heart of our approach lies inference of camera motion by minimisation of the Normalised Information Distance (NID) between the appearance of 3D lidar data reprojected into overlapping images. Results are presented which demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the localisation of a camera against a lidar pointcloud using data gathered from a road vehicle.",

Our approach generalizes the concept of Velocity Obstacles [3] to any robotic system with a linear Gaussian dynamics model. We integrate a Kalman filter for state estimation and an LQR feedback controller into a closed-loop dynamics model of which a higher-level control objective is the \u201ccontrol input\u201d. We then define the LQG-Obstacle as the set of control objectives that result in a collision with high probability. Selecting a control objective outside the LQG-Obstacle then produces collision-free motion. We demonstrate the potential of LQG-Obstacles by safely and smoothly navigating a simulated quadrotor helicopter with complex non-linear dynamics and motion and sensing uncertainty through three-dimensional environments with obstacles and narrow passages.",

        "abstract": "The RRT* algorithm has recently been proposed as an optimal extension to the standard RRT algorithm [1]. However, like RRT, RRT* is difficult to apply in problems with complicated or underactuated dynamics because it requires the design of a two domain-specific extension heuristics: a distance metric and node extension method. We propose automatically deriving these two heuristics for RRT* by locally linearizing the domain dynamics and applying linear quadratic regulation (LQR). The resulting algorithm, LQR-RRT*, finds optimal plans in domains with complex or underactuated dynamics without requiring domain-specific design choices. We demonstrate its application in domains that are successively torque-limited, underactuated, and in belief space.",

The robot is required to achieve an optimal surveillance mission, in which a certain request needs to be serviced repeatedly, while the expected time in between consecutive services is minimized. We define a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to describe such a mission and formulate the problem as a temporal logic game. Our approach is based on two main ideas. First, we extend results in automata learning to detect patterns of the partially unknown behavior of the elements in the environment. Second, we employ an automata-theoretic method to generate the control policy.We show that the obtained control policy converges to an optimal one when the unknown behavior patterns are fully learned. We implemented the proposed computational framework in MATLAB. Illustrative case studies are included.",

It abstracts multi-modal sensory information and integrates it with conceptual common-sense knowledge in a fully probabilistic fashion. It relies on the concept of spatial properties which make the semantic map more descriptive, and the system more scalable and better adapted for human interaction. A probabilistic graphical model, a chaingraph, is used to represent the conceptual information and perform spatial reasoning. Experimental results from online system tests in a large unstructured office environment highlight the system's ability to infer semantic room categories, predict existence of objects and values of other spatial properties as well as reason about unexplored space.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal activity detection plays a crucial role in surveillance applications, and a surveillance system that can perform robustly in the extremely crowded area has become an urgent need for public security. In this paper, we propose a novel laser-based system which can simultaneously perform the tracking, semantic scene learning and abnormality detection in the large and crowded environment. In our system, a novel abnormality detection model is proposed, and it considers and combines various factors that will influence human activity. Moreover, this model intensively investigate the relationship between pedestrians' social behaviors and their walking scenarios. We successfully applied the proposed system to the JR subway station of Tokyo, which can cover a 60\u00d735m area, robustly track more than 180 targets at the same time and simultaneously perform the online semantic scene learning and abnormality detection with no human intervention.",

        "abstract": "Object recognition is one of the most important applications of robotics. For object recognition, edge orientation is widely used as a primitive visual feature. However, a classical filter-based approach passes not only edges inside target orientation band but also edges outside. This can thus cause problem in the estimation of the true orientation of edge. This study proposes a filtering scheme to reduce the false-positive responses, i.e. edges outside target orientation band, and investigate a solution inspired by biological vision. Motivated by several psychophysical and neuro-physiological findings, we present a computational framework based on the basic mechanisms of cortical processing, i.e. feed-forward, lateral and feedback stages. In the feed-forward stage, our model uses a classical filter-based method to allow as many true orientation edges to pass through as possible. False responses in orientation channels are then inhibited by lateral interaction. The remaining undesired responses are suppressed through the feedback stage. We evaluated the performance of our model against classical filter-based methods such as Gabor and Neumann filtering using several artificial and natural images. The results validated the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "The problem of bootstrapping consists in designing agents that can learn from scratch the model of their sensorimotor cascade (the series of robot actuators, the external world, and the robot sensors) and use it to achieve useful tasks. In principle, we would want to design agents that can work for any robot dynamics and any robot sensor(s). One of the difficulties of this problem is the fact that the observations are very high dimensional, the dynamics is nonlinear, and there is a wide range of \u201crepresentation nuisances\u201d to which we would want the agent to be robust. In this paper, we model the dynamics of sensorimotor cascades using diffeomorphisms of the sensel space. We show that this model captures the dynamics of camera and range-finder data, that it can be used for long-term predictions, and that it can capture nonlinear phenomena such as a limited field of view. Moreover, by analyzing the learned diffeomorphisms it is possible to recover the \u201clinear structure\u201d of the dynamics independently of the commands representation.",

We first simulated tactile feedback using a soft finger contact model in GraspIt! [1] and computed tactile contacts of thousands of grasps with a robotic hand using the Columbia Grasp Database [2]. We used the K-means clustering method to learn a contact dictionary from the tactile contacts, which is a codebook that models the contact space. The feature vector for a grasp is a histogram computed based on the distribution of its contacts over the contact space defined by the dictionary. An SVM is then trained to predict the stability of a robotic grasp given this feature vector. Experiments indicate that this model which requires low-dimension feature input is useful in predicting the stability of a grasp.",

A demonstration station is designed to measure fingertip force without attaching force sensor on fingertips or objects so that this approach can be used with daily living objects. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based machine learning approach is applied on the fingertip force and position to obtain the motion and force model. Then a force and motion trajectory is generated with Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) from the learning result. The force and motion trajectory is applied to a robotic arm and hand to carry out a grasping and manipulation task. An experiment was designed and carried out to verify the learning framework by teaching a Fanuc robotic arm and a BarrettHand a pick-and-place task with demonstration. Experimental results show that the robot applied proper motions and forces in the pick-and-place task from the learned model.",

        "abstract": "Grasping has been studied from various perspectives including planning, control, and learning. In this paper, we take a learning approach to predict successful grasps for a universal jamming gripper. A jamming gripper is comprised of a flexible membrane filled with granular material, and it can quickly harden or soften to grip objects of varying shape by modulating the air pressure within the membrane. Although this gripper is easy to control, developing a physical model of its gripping mechanism is difficult because it undergoes significant deformation during use. Thus, many grasping approaches based on physical models (such as based on form- and force-closure) would be challenging to apply to a jamming gripper. Here we instead use a supervised learning algorithm and design both visual and shape features for capturing the properties of good grasps. We show that given target object data from an RGBD sensor, our algorithm can predict successful grasps for the jamming gripper without requiring a physical model. It can therefore be applied to both a parallel plate gripper and a jamming gripper without modification. We demonstrate that our learning algorithm enables both grippers to pick up a wide variety of objects, including objects from outside the training set. Through robotic experiments we are then able to define the type of objects each gripper is best suited for handling.",

Humans use a variety of strategies for reaching and grasping anything from the simplest to the most complicated objects, achieving high dexterity and efficiency. This seemingly simple process of reach-to-grasp relies on the complex coordination of the musculoskeletal system of the upper limbs. In this paper, we study the muscular co-activation patterns during a variety of reach-to-grasp motions, and we introduce a learning scheme that can discriminate between different strategies. This scheme can then classify reach-to-grasp strategies based on the muscular co-activations. We consider the arm and hand as a whole system, therefore we use surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) recordings from muscles of both the upper arm and the forearm. The proposed scheme is tested in extensive paradigms proving its efficiency, while it can be used as a switching mechanism for task-specific motion and force estimation models, improving EMG-based control of robotic arm-hand systems.",

The question of where to place objects or where to pick them up from, among other higher-level reasoning tasks, is therefore gaining practical relevance. In this work, we consider the problem of identifying the organizational structure within an environment, i.e. the problem of determining organizational principles that would allow a robot to infer where to best place a particular, previously unseen object or where to reasonably search for a particular type of object given past observations about the allocation of objects to locations in the environment. This problem can be reasonably formulated as a classification task. We claim that organizational principles are governed by the notion of similarity and provide an empirical analysis of the importance of various features in datasets describing the organizational structure of kitchens. For the aforementioned classification tasks, we compare standard classification methods, reaching average accuracies of at least 79% in all scenarios. We thereby show that, in particular, ontology-based similarity measures are well-suited as highly discriminative features. We demonstrate the use of learned models of organizational principles in a kitchen environment on a real robot system, where the robot identifies a newly acquired item, determines a suitable location and then stores the item accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Affordances define the action possibilities on an object in the environment and in robotics they play a role in basic cognitive capabilities. Previous works have focused on affordance models for just one object even though in many scenarios they are defined by configurations of multiple objects that interact with each other. We employ recent advances in statistical relational learning to learn affordance models in such cases. Our models generalize over objects and can deal effectively with uncertainty. Two-object interaction models are learned from robotic interaction with the objects in the world and employed in situations with arbitrary numbers of objects. We illustrate these ideas with experimental results of an action recognition task where a robot manipulates objects on a shelf.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel learning method using activity grammars capable of learning reusable task components from a reasonably small number of samples under noisy conditions. Our linguistic approach aims to extract the hierarchical structure of activities which can be recursively applied to help recognize unforeseen, more complicated tasks that share the same underlying structures. To achieve this goal, our method 1) actively searches for frequently occurring action symbols that are subset of input samples to effectively discover the hierarchy, and 2) explicitly takes into account the uncertainty values associated with input symbols due to the noise inherent in low-level detectors. In addition to experimenting with a synthetic dataset to systematically analyze the algorithm's performance, we apply our method in human-led imitation learning environment where a robot learns reusable components of the task from short demonstrations to correctly imitate more complicated, longer demonstrations of the same task category. The results suggest that under reasonable amount of noise, our method is capable to capture the reusable structures of tasks and generalize to cope with recursions.",

        "abstract": "The ability to place objects in an environment is an important skill for a personal robot. An object should not only be placed stably, but should also be placed in its preferred location/orientation. For instance, it is preferred that a plate be inserted vertically into the slot of a dish-rack as compared to being placed horizontally in it. Unstructured environments such as homes have a large variety of object types as well as of placing areas. Therefore our algorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing areas. These reasons make placing a challenging manipulation task. In this work, we propose using a supervised learning approach for finding good placements given point-clouds of the object and the placing area. Our method combines the features that capture support, stability and preferred configurations, and uses a shared sparsity structure in its the parameters. Even when neither the object nor the placing area is seen previously in the training set, our learning algorithm predicts good placements. In robotic experiments, our method enables the robot to stably place known objects with a 98% success rate and 98% when also considering semantically preferred orientations. In the case of placing a new object into a new placing area, the success rate is 82% and 72%.1",

We formulate the placing task as a learning problem. By computing appearance and shape features from the input (point-clouds) that can capture the stability and semantics, our algorithm can identify good placements for multiple objects.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a set of experiments in which an upper-torso humanoid robot learned to slide a card through a card reader. The small size and the flexibility of the card presented a number of manipulation challenges for the robot. First, because most of the card is occluded by the card reader and the robot's hand during the sliding process, visual feedback is useless for this task. Second, because the card bends easily, it is difficult to distinguish between bending and hitting an obstacle in order to correct the sliding trajectory. To solve these manipulation challenges this paper proposes a method for constraint detection that uses only proprioceptive data. The method uses dynamic joint torque thresholds that are calibrated using the robot's movements in free space. The experimental results show that using this method, the robot can detect when the movement of the card is constrained and modify the sliding trajectory in real time, which makes solving this task possible.",

        "abstract": "Performing task-space tracking control on redundant robot manipulators is a difficult problem. When the physical model of the robot is too complex or not available, standard methods fail and machine learning algorithms can have advantages. We propose an adaptive learning algorithm for tracking control of underactuated or non-rigid robots where the physical model of the robot is unavailable. The control method is based on the fact that forward models are relatively straightforward to learn and local inversions can be obtained via local optimization. We use sparse online Gaussian process inference to obtain a flexible probabilistic forward model and second order optimization to find the inverse mapping. Physical experiments indicate that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art tracking control algorithms in this context.",

When the sensors are static but steerable, each sensor must dynamically choose which target to observe in a decentralised manner. We show that the information exchanged by the sensors to synchronise their beliefs can be exploited to learn a model of the utility function that drives each others' decisions. Instead of communicating utilities to enable negotiation, each sensor regresses on the learnt model to predict the utilities of other team members. This approach bridges the gap between coordinating implicitly, a locally-greedy solution, and negotiating explicitly. We validated our approach in both hardware and simulations, and found that it out-performed implicit coordination by a statistically significant margin with both ideal and limited communications.",

        "abstract": "Vision and range sensing belong to the richest sensory modalities for perception in robotics and related fields. This paper addresses the problem of how to best combine image and range data for the task of object detection. In particular, we propose a novel adaptive fusion approach, hierarchical Gaussian Process mixtures of experts, able to account for missing information and cross-cue data consistency. The hierarchy is a two-tier architecture that for each modality, each frame and each detection computes a weight function using Gaussian Processes that reflects the confidence of the respective information. We further propose a method called cross-cue domain adaptation that makes use of large image data sets to improve the depth-based object detector for which only few training samples exist. In the experiments that include a comparison with alternative sensor fusion schemes, we demonstrate the viability of the proposed methods and achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy.",

The proposed method is based on Structure from Motion utilizing a constraint of parallel lines. In an environment having manmade structures, parallel lines can be extracted from an omnidirectional image easily and constantly, because of its wide field of view. Parallel lines provides a valuable constraint for camera movement estimation. The proposed method can estimate 3-D camera movements by solving one degree of freedom problem three times without regard to the number of viewpoints. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

Time and space are foundational concepts in human language, and to develop a set of words that correspond to human notions of time and space, it is necessary to take into account the way that they are used in natural human conversations, where terms and phrases such as `soon', `in a while', or `near' are often used. We present language learning robots called Lingodroids that can learn and use simple terms for time and space. In previous work, the Lingodroids were able to learn terms for space. In this work we extend their abilities by adding temporal variables which allow them to learn terms for time. The robots build their own maps of the world and interact socially to form a shared lexicon for location and duration terms. The robots successfully use the shared lexicons to communicate places and times to meet again.",

It investigates the use of fuel cells to achieve this objective, and in particular Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. It is shown through a representative case study that, in theory, fuel cell based power supplies will provide much longer range than the best current rechargeable battery technology. It also briefly discusses an important limitation that prevents fuel cells from achieving their ideal performance, namely a practical method to store their fuel (hydrogen) in a form that is compatible with small mobile field robots. A very efficient fuel storage concept based on water activated lithium hydride (LiH) is proposed that releases hydrogen on demand. This concept is very attractive because water vapor from the air is passively extracted or waste water from the fuel cell is recycled and transferred to the lithium hydride where the hydrogen is \u201cstripped\u201d from water and is returned to the fuel cell to form more water. This results in higher hydrogen storage efficiencies than conventional storage methods. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the concept of Local Force Closure. We define a local force closure grasp as a grasp which is capable of resisting some given external wrench as well as (through local variation in contact wrenches) any wrench in some neighborhood of the given wrench, with grasp quality exceeding some given threshold. Local force closure is useful in applications where a grasp only needs to resist some given external wrench, rather than fully constraining object, but where there is some uncertainty regarding the exact external wrench that needs to be resisted, or where there is a possibility of having to cope with some (relatively small) unknown disturbance forces. We show that by allowing disc-shaped fingers in contact with convex vertices of a polygonal object, any given wrench can be resisted by just two frictionless fingers. For a given polygonal object with n vertices and an external wrench wext, we show how to find all pairs of features of P, that admit grasps capable of resisting wext with grasp quality greater or equal to some threshold Q, in O(n3/2+\u03b5 + K) time, where K is the number of pairs in the output and \u03b5 is some arbitrarily small, positive constant. We then show how to adapt our algorithm to guarantee that the features reported, admit local force closure grasps.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we aim to achieve autonomous navigation for robots in environments that they have not previously visited. Many of the existing methods for autonomous navigation require a map to be built beforehand, typically by manually navigating the robot. Navigation without maps, i.e., without any prior information about the environment, is very difficult. We propose to use existing digital street maps for autonomous navigation. Nowadays digital street maps (e.g., those provided by Google Maps) are widely available and used routinely. Reuse of existing maps for robots eliminates extra cost of building maps. One of the difficulties in using existing street maps is data association between a robot's observation and the map, because the physical entities that correspond to the boundary lines in the map are unknown. We address this issue by using region annotations such as roads and buildings and prior knowledge. We introduce a probabilistic framework that simultaneously estimates a robot's position and the road's boundaries.We evaluated our method in complex urban environments. Our method successfully localized in environments that includes both roadways and pedestrian walkways.",

        "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of imagebased localization in indoor environments. The localization is achieved by querying a database of omnidirectional images that constitutes a detailed visual map of the building where the robot operates. Omnidirectional cameras have the advantage, when compared to standard perspectives, of capturing in a single frame the entire visual content of a room. This, not only speeds up the process of acquiring data for creating the map, but also favors scalability by significantly decreasing the size of the database. The problem is that omnidirectional images have strong non-linear distortion, which leads to poor retrieval results when the query images are standard perspectives. This paper reports for the first time thorough experiments in using perspectives to index a database of para-catadioptric images for the purpose of robot localization. We propose modifications to the SIFT algorithm that significantly improve point matching between the two types of images with positive impact in the recognition based in visual words. We also compare the classical bags-of-words against the recent framework of visual-phrases, showing that the latter outperforms the former.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes logical winnowing methods from multiple identification candidates using corresponding appearance identification results with chronological pedestrian tracking results. It is difficult to identify individual using appearance identification, because appearance identification has some properties. This research proposes two methods that logically winnow out the identification candidates as methods that effectively fuse different directional identification results without the directional information. Experiments were made to verify the validity of the proposed methods. A mobile robot equipped with a laser scanner and a camera was used in the experiments. A pedestrian tracking method uses the laser scanner. The appearance identification uses the camera. The experimental results verified the validity of the logical winnowing method taking the logical product of identification candidates determined by each round of identification. In this paper, the appearance identification properties, the proposed methods and the experiments are described.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a vanishing point-based two-step loop closure method in a line-based monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Vanishing points can provide absolute directional landmarks for mobile robots. This guiding ability is important in that the observation of the vanishing points is invariant with respect to the robot pose. In our system, loop closure is performed in two steps: first, the accumulated heading error is reduced using an observation of previously registered vanishing points, and second, the observation of known floor lines allows for further pose correction. In this paper, we apply this method to solve the loop closure problem for a line-based SLAM within a corridor environment where the vanishing points are usually easily detectable. Experimental results show that our method is very efficient in a structured indoor environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel method for determining the extrinsic calibration parameters between 2D and 3D LIDAR sensors with respect to a vehicle base frame. To recover the calibration parameters we attempt to optimize the quality of a 3D point cloud produced by the vehicle as it traverses an unknown, unmodified environment. The point cloud quality metric is derived from R\u00e9nyi Quadratic Entropy and quantifies the compactness of the point distribution using only a single tuning parameter. We also present a fast approximate method to reduce the computational requirements of the entropy evaluation, allowing unsupervised calibration in vast environments with millions of points. The algorithm is analyzed using real world data gathered in many locations, showing robust calibration performance and substantial speed improvements from the approximations.",

In order to efficiently solve the task at hand, the robots often need accurate localization. In this work, we address the localization problem by developing a solution that has low computational and sensing requirements, and that is easily deployed on large robot teams composed of cheap robots. We build upon a real-time, particle-filter based localization algorithm that is completely decentralized and scalable, and accommodates realistic robot assumptions including noisy sensors, and asynchronous and lossy communication. In order to further reduce this algorithm's overall complexity, we propose a low-cost particle clustering method, which is particularly well suited to the collaborative localization problem. Our approach is experimentally validated on a team of ten real robots.",

Extensive use is made of plastic castings, laser cut plastic sheets, and low-cost motors and electronic components. Modules interface with a host PC via Bluetooth\u00ae radio.

The CM decreases the surgical-tool bottleneck experienced by surgeons in state-of-the art Laparoscopic Endoscopic Single-Site (LESS) procedures for minimally invasive abdominal surgery. The system includes: (1) a near-zero latency video wireless communications link, (2) a pan/tilt camera platform, actuated by two motors that provides surgeons a full hemisphere field of view inside the abdominal cavity, (3) a small wireless camera, (4) a wireless illumination control system, and (5) a wireless human-machine interface (HMI) to control the CM. An in-vivo experiment on a porcine subject was carried out to test the performance of the system. The robotic design is a Research Platform for a broad range of experiments in a range of domains for faculty and students in the Colleges of Engineering and Medicine and at Tampa General Hospital. This research is the first step in developing semi-autonomous wirelessly controlled and networked laparoscopic devices to enable a paradigm shift in minimally invasive surgery and other domains such as Wireless Body Area Networks.",

We successfully produced magnetotactic blood clots in vitro and experimentally showed that they can be effectively dragged within a fluidic channel. We also exploited a magnetic force model in order to quantitatively analyze the experimental results, up to obtaining an estimate of the relative efficiency between electrostatic and antibody binding.

        "abstract": "We have developed two technologies for 3D magnetic microstructures, with a wide size range between 5\u03bcm to 2mm. The first technology enables us to obtain density controlled 3D magnetic microstructures. The size of this structure is approximately 500\u03bcm. In this scale, controlling density is vital for magnetic micro actuators, because the effect of gravity is strong. To adjust density, we developed the world's first \u201cdensity controllable magnetically photocurable (DMPC) polymer.\u201d The DMPC polymer is a mixture of hollow microcapsules (density, 0.03 g/cm3), magnetic particles, and photocurable polymer. We can obtain desired relative density between 0.5 to 1.7 by adjusting the concentration of microcapsules. In addition, we succeeded in 3D velocity control of a screw-type magnetic micro actuator with neutral buoyancy in water. The delay time was 32msec, which is smaller than video rate. In addition, the actuator possessed 6 degrees of freedom. The second technology realized a 5\u03bcm magnetic micro actuator, which is a combination of a 3D transparent structure and 2D magnetic structure. Various photocurable polymers can be applied as the 2D structure in this process, although we used magnetically photocurable polymer in this report. Furthermore, we have succeeded in driving a ferromagnetic micro actuator, whose diameter is as small as 1\u03bcm. These two fabrication processes will become key technologies in both the medical field and the field of life sciences, because they can supply a wide variety of 3D micro structures with small effort.",

        "abstract": "The ability to autonomously track a fluid-borne odor has numerous engineering applications and natural occurrences. Engineering systems can use odor-guided navigation in tasks ranging from search and rescue to locating dangerous chemicals. Animals use odors to locate food and mates. For animals in strong unsteady turbulent flow environments where the wind is intermittent and occasionally vanishes, there is an ecological benefit to maintaining wind-driven tracking behavior. This has been shown in experiments performed using moths and cockroaches, where animals that began tracking odor in wind maintained their wind driven tracking behavior and eventually located the source after the wind was shut off during their tracking behavior. Here, we use RoboMoth, a previously developed 3D odor-tracking robot, to replicate these experiments. Our results can aid biologists in understanding how animals track odors in dynamic environments. In engineering, this study provides a first step in a hardware system towards linking odor tracking in strong wind environments to tracking in zero/low flow environments by studying the transition between the two regimes. This can help further engineers' efforts to design odor-tracking systems capable of negotiating diverse and dynamic environments. Our study of the transition from using the wind as a primary directional cue to relying on odor and an established tracking direction appears to be novel in an engineering context and unique to our work.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-task control method to maintain the visibility of an anatomic element of interest while the doctor tele-operates a 2D ultrasound probe held by a medical robot. The prior task consists in automatically maintaining several visual constraints that guarantee an inter-section between the ultrasound image plane and the anatomic object of interest and the second task allows the medical expert to manually apply probe motion through tele-operation. Unlike classical visual servoing technique which continually regulate the current visual features to desired values, our control approach gradually activates the regulation of one or several ultrasound visual features that go close to fixed limits in such a way to keep them in a safe domain. The main advantage of this approach is to give to the clinician the control of all the degrees of freedom of the probe to examine the patient while automatically preserving the visibility of the element of interest if required. Both simulations and experiments performed on an abdominal phantom demonstrate the efficiency of the visibility assistance task.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of controlling a leader-follower (L - F) formation of two unicycle mobile robots moving under visibility constraints in a known obstacle environment. Visibility constraints are realized as inequality state constraints that determine a visibility set K. Maintaining visibility is translated into controlling the robots so that system trajectories starting in K always remain in K. We provide the conditions under which visibility is maintained, as well as a feedback control scheme that forces F to converge and remain into a set of desired configurations w.r.t. L while maintaining visibility. We also propose a cooperative control scheme for the motion of the formation in a known obstacle environment, so that both collision avoidance and maintaining visibility are ensured. The proposed control schemes are decentralized, in the sense that there is no direct communication between the robots. The efficacy of our algorithms is evaluated through simulations.",

In this paper we present a mathematical programming (MP) framework that captures the salient features of the general MVMP problem. To demonstrate the use of this framework for the formulation and solution of MVMP problems, we examine in detail four representative works and summarize several other related works. As MP solution algorithms and associated numerical solvers continue to develop, we anticipate that MP solution techniques will be applied to an increasing number of MVMP problems and that the framework and formulations presented in this paper may serve as a guide for future MVMP research.",

        "abstract": "Human arm muscular stiffness measurement is often a complex procedure which is of great interest for many disciplines from biomechanics to medicine and robotics. Modulation of impedance represents the principal mechanism underlying control of movements and interaction with external environment. Past literature proposed several methods to estimate multijoint hand stiffness while postural maintaining and dynamic tasks, mainly performed by means of planar robotic manipulanda. Despite these approaches are still considered robust and accurate, the computational burden of the robotic controller and hardware limitations make them not easy to implement. In the present paper a novel mechanism conceived for measuring multijoint planar stiffness by in single trial and in a reduced execution time is described and tested in different configurations. The device consisted in a mechanical rotary mechanism which applies cyclic radial perturbation to human arm of a known displacement and the force is acquired by means of a 6-axes commercial load cell. The outcomes suggest that the system is not only reliable in standalone mode but allows obtaining a reliable bi-dimensional estimation of arm stiffness even plugged in a planar manipulandum, dramatically reducing the amount of time for measurement and allowing to decouple the two controllers of the planar manipulator on which is mounted and the device itself.",

The innovation of the prototype lies in the use of a three degrees of freedom Delta robotic manipulator together with a nondestructive testing end-effector, realized by a Cardan gimbal that allows the ultrasonic sensor to compliantly interact with the remote environment. The Cardan gimbal is endowed with a small actuator for the roll motion of the end-effector, a compliant element in the direction of interaction and two passive rotational degrees of freedom with defined equilibria to overcome gravity and to define a stable zero reference. Simulation results of a ducted-fan unmanned aerial vehicle interacting with a wall validate the overall mechanical design.",

We prove that the set of all solutions to this problem is a smooth manifold that can be parameterized by a single chart.

        "abstract": "The concept of gliding robotic fish combines gliding and fin-actuation mechanisms to realize energy-efficient locomotion and high maneuverability, and holds strong promise for mobile sensing in versatile aquatic environments. In this paper we present the modeling and design of a miniature fish-like glider, a key enabling component for gliding robotic fish. The full dynamics of the glider is first derived and then reduced to the sagittal plane, where the lift, drag, and pitch moment coefficients are obtained as linear or quadratic functions of the attack angle based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The model is used to design the glider by accommodating stringent constraints on dimensions yet meeting the desired specification on speed. A fully untethered prototype of underwater glider is developed, with a weight of 4 kg and length of 40 cm. With a net buoyancy of 20 g, it realizes a steady gliding speed of 20 cm/s. The volume and net buoyancy of this glider are less than 10% and 5%, respectively, of those of reported gliders in the literature, and its speed per unit net buoyancy is over 9 times of those other vehicles. Experimental results have shown that the model is able to capture well both the steady glide behavior under different control inputs, and the dynamics during transients.",

In this paper, we propose a minimal persistence control problem on multi-robot systems with underlying graphs being directed and dynamically switching. We develop distributed algorithms based on the rank of the rigidity matrix and the pebble game method. The feasibility of the proposed methods is validated by simulations on the robotic simulator Webots and experiments on e-puck robot platform.",

        "abstract": "A typical unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) mission can be composed of various tasks and several alternative paths. Small UGVs commonly rely on electric rechargeable batteries for their operations. Since each battery has limited energy storage capacity, it is essential to predict the expected mission energy requirement during the mission execution and update this prediction adaptively via real-time performance measurements, e.g., the total battery power required for the mission. We proposed and compared two methods in the paper. One is a linear regression model built upon the UGV longitudinal dynamics model alone. The other is a Bayesian regression model when prior knowledge, e.g., road average grade and operator driving style, is available . In this case, the proposed Bayesian prediction can effectively combine the prior knowledge with real-time performance measurements for adaptively updating the prediction of the mission energy requirement. Our comparative simulation studies show that the Bayesian model can yield more accurate predictions than the linear regression model, particularly during the initial execution stage of a mission.",

The two fingers can move independently in hundreds of microns' range, and can cooperate with each other to realize complex operation for micro objects. The mobility characteristics and the inverse parallel kinematic model of a single finger are analyzed by resorting to screw theory and compliance and stiffness matrix method, which are validated by finite-element analysis (FEA). Both FEA and the theoretical model have well validated the movement of the fingers moving in translational way, the designed micro gripper can realize a lot of complex functions. Properly selecting the amplification ratio and the stroke of the PZT, we can mount the gripper onto a positioning stage to realize a larger motion range, which will make it be widely used in micro parts assembly and bio-operation systems.",

        "abstract": "Robot manipulators are widely used in many industrial automation applications. A robot manipulator moves the end-effector to the configuration instructed by the user. The user input from a master unit is transformed into the desired configuration through forward kinematics. This configuration is communicated to the robot controller, which employs inverse kinematics to transform the configuration into joint angles. The control algorithm is implemented as software and embedded into the robot controller. The software is typically written in traditional programming languages like C or C++. We introduce a Simulink Library ModelRob that provides basic building blocks to model kinematics of a robot manipulator. Availability of such a library enables Model-Based Development (MBD) of robot manipulator software, where the manipulator controller can be modeled using ModelRob library blocks, and production code can be automatically generated using existing code generators for Simulink. We enlist the existing tools that can be useful in the verification and validation stage of the MBD process, and outline the need for tool-support for verification activities specific to building robust robot manipulator software. Using ModelRob library we have modeled Cartesian space motion controller of a robot manipulator in Simulink and successfully generated C code from the model.",

As a consequence, the quadrotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory over time (e.g., it can hover on the spot only when horizontal). In this paper, we propose a novel actuation concept in which the quadrotor propellers are allowed to tilt about their axes w.r.t. the main quadrotor body. This introduces an additional set of 4 control inputs which provides full actuation to the quadrotor position/orientation. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed quadrotor, we formally discuss its controllability properties and propose a nonlinear trajectory tracking controller based on dynamic feedback linearization techniques. The soundness of our approach is validated by means of simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Modeling human motion in complex environments without losing long-range dependencies is difficult due to the large number of combinatorially distinct paths humans may follow. Existing representations avoid this difficulty by limiting the prediction of human motion to a local level. As a result, robot motion planning algorithms that use these representations are reactive in nature, and fail to exploit higher-order dependencies. We present a novel motion model capable of representing the global path behavior of people. Our model compactly encodes higher-order temporal dependencies inherent in human mobility traces on an abstract representation of the environment that lends itself to combinatorial planning. We incorporate uncertainties into the planning process using POMDPs and present a general predictive multi-robot planning algorithm applicable to pedestrian datasets commonly found in the literature. We evaluate our planner by simulating multiple instances of a variant of the visibility-based target-tracking problem inspired by our previous work. We report encouraging results that demonstrate our multi-robot plans exhibit desirable combinatorial structure, e.g. robot re-use.",

Pull-wire steerable catheters are guided to the heart chambers through the vasculature in order to deliver energy to destroy faulty electrical pathways in the heart. The effectiveness of this treatment is dependent on the accuracy of positioning the catheter tip at the target location and also on maintaining contact with the target while the heart is beating. Therefore, it is desirable to perform hybrid force/position control of the catheter tip. We have studied the problem of modeling the distal part of a steerable catheter using beam theory and have developed and validated a static force-deflection model through extensive experiments. It is shown that the model can estimate the shape of the bending section of a catheter using force information and without requiring extensive knowledge of the catheter's internal structure.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a model of needle tissue interaction forces that a rigid suture needle experiences during surgical suturing. The needle-tissue interaction forces are modeled as the sum of lumped parameters. The model has three main components; friction, tissue compression, and cutting forces. The tissue compression force uses the area that the needle sweeps out during a suture to estimate both the force magnitude and force direction. The area that the needle sweeps out is a direct result of driving the needle in a way that does not follow the natural curve of the needle. The friction force is approximated as a static friction force along the shaft of the needle. The cutting force acts only on the needle tip. The resulting force and torque model is experimentally validated using a tissue phantom. These results indicate that the proposed lumped parameter model is capable of accurately modeling the forces experienced during a suture.",

        "abstract": "A large number of studies have been reported on top-down influences of visual attention. However, less progress have been made in understanding and modeling its mechanisms in real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning spatial attention taking into account influences of physical actions on top-down attention. For this purpose, we focus on interactive visual environments (video games) which are modest real-world simulations, where a player has to attend to certain aspects of visual stimuli and perform actions to achieve a goal. The basic idea is to learn a mapping from current mental state of the game player, represented by past actions and observations, to its gaze fixation. A data-driven approach is followed where we train a model from the data of some players and test it over a new subject. In particular, two contributions this paper makes are: 1) employing multi-modal information including mean eye position, gist of a scene, physical actions, bottom-up saliency, and tagged events for state representation and 2) analysis of different methods of combining bottom-up and top-down influences. Comparing with other top-down task-driven and bottom-up spatio-temporal models, our approach shows higher NSS scores in predicting eye positions.",

We consider the case of a continuous search domain, and a robot equipped with a single binary sensor whose ability to recognize the target object varies probabilistically as a function of the distance from the robot to the target (the sensor model). We show that when the object prior and sensor model are taken from the exponential family of distributions, the searcher's posterior probability map for the object location belongs to a finitely parameterizable class of functions, admitting an exact representation of the searcher's evolving belief. Unfortunately, the cost of the representation grows exponentially with the number of stages in the search. For this reason, we develop an approximation scheme that exploits regularized particle filtering methods. We present simulation studies for several scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a simple, greedy search strategy.",

        "abstract": "To be a good helper, grasping and manipulation are the most important abilities of a service robot. It should be able to adapt its manipulation actions to new tasks and environments. During the execution, it is important to rate the success of actions, so that the robot can plan and execute further actions to correct and recover from the failed actions. The successful execution of manipulation actions depends on various factors during the whole execution, such as the position of the robotic hand and forces exerted by the robot. The goal of the manipulation action monitoring is to estimate the success state from the huge amount of data collected during the execution. The main challenge to solve this problem is to identify the success or failure state from the the high dimensional data collection. We propose a method to classify ongoing activities using a set of support vector machines (SVM). After a supervised training process with manually labeled successful or failure results, our system can correctly estimate the resulting state of a manipulation activity. We present experiments on our bimanual manipulation demonstrator and evaluate the results.",

In this paper, we study the motion control of magnetotactic Tetrahymena pyriformis cells. Magnetotactic T. pyriformis is produced by introducing artificial magnetic dipole into the cells. Subsequently, they can be steered by using an external magnetic field. We observe that the external magnetic field can only be used to affect the swimming direction of the cells, while the swimming velocity depends largely on the cells' own propulsion. Feedback information for control is obtained from a computer vision system that tracks the cell. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we construct a discrete-time model for the cell dynamics that is based on first principle. Subsequently, we identify the model parameters using the Least Squares approach. Second, we formulate a model predictive approach for feedback control of magnetotactic T. pyriformis. Both the model fitness and the performance of the feedback controller are verified using experimental data.",

First, using typical stiffness control method, the four legs' behavior is approximated to 3D spring damper systems. By this way, we can easily derive the dynamic equations of motion in Cartesian space. Based on these equations, a control strategy is proposed to obtain the asymptotical stability of the system. In addition, a reflex signal is also introduced to control the rotational disturbance of the robot body. Finally, dynamic simulation of a quadruped walking robot is performed on several unknown rough terrains to verify the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel efficient method addressing the inverse differential kinematics problem for redundant manipulators in the presence of different hard bounds (joint range, velocity, and acceleration limits) on the joint space motion. The proposed SNS (Saturation in the Null Space) iterative algorithm proceeds by successively discarding the use of joints that would exceed their motion bounds when using the minimum norm solution and reintroducing them at a saturated level by means of a projection in a suitable null space. The method is first defined at the velocity level and then moved to the acceleration level, so as to avoid joint velocity discontinuities due to the switching of saturated joints. Moreover, the algorithm includes an optimal task scaling in case the desired task trajectory is unfeasible under the given joint bounds. We also propose the integration of obstacle avoidance in the Cartesian space by properly modifying on line the joint bounds. Simulation and experimental results reported for the 7-dof lightweight KUKA LWR IV robot illustrate the properties and computational efficiency of the method.",

        "abstract": "There are many examples of minimally invasive surgery in which tethered robots are incapable of accurately reaching target locations deep inside the body either because they are too large and result in tissue damage or because the tortuosity of the path leads to loss of tip control. In these situations, small untethered magnetically-powered robots may hold the potential to act as delivery vehicles for therapeutic agents. While MRI scanners provide a means to power, control and image such robots as they move throughout the body, a substantial challenge arises if the clinical application requires more than one such robot. The resulting system is underactuated and thus its controllability is in question. This paper presents a simple motion planning algorithm for two magnetic capsules and demonstrates through simulation and experiment that nonlinear fluid damping can be exploited to independently control the positions of the capsules.",

Using a 3D reconstruction of the tracheobronchial tree, Virtual Bronchoscopy (VB) may help physicians in the exploration of peripheral lung lesions. We are developing a haptic-based navigation system for the VB that allows the navigation within the airways using a haptic device whose permitted motions mimics those done with the real bronchoscope. This paper describes the motion planning module of the system devoted to plan a path from the trachea to small peripheral pulmonary lesions, that takes into account the geometry and the kinematic constraints of the bronchoscope. The motion planner output is used to visually and haptically guide the navigation during the virtual exploration using the haptic device. Moreover, physicians can get useful information of whether the peripheral lesions can effectively be reached with a given bronchoscope or of which is the nearest point to the lesion that can be reached.",

Optimized functions of this form are tracked via feedback linearization in simulations of a planar robotic biped walking on flat ground, upstairs and downstairs \u2014 these three modes of locomotion are termed \u201cmotion primitives.\u201d A second optimization is presented, which yields controllers that evolve the robot from one motion primitive to another \u2014 these modes of locomotion are termed \u201cmotion transitions.\u201d A final simulation is given, which shows the controlled evolution of a robotic biped as it transitions through each mode of locomotion over a pyramidal staircase.",

This paper proposes an incremental motion segmentation system that efficiently segments multiple moving objects and simultaneously build the map of the environment using visual SLAM modules. Multiple cues based on optical flow and two view geometry are integrated to achieve this segmentation. A dense optical flow algorithm is used for dense tracking of features. Motion potentials based on geometry are computed for each of these dense tracks. These geometric potentials along with the optical flow potentials are used to form a graph like structure. A graph based segmentation algorithm then clusters together nodes of similar potentials to form the eventual motion segments. Experimental results of high quality segmentation on different publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

This description is a considerably more fine-grained interface than what has been seen in high-level robot control systems before. It can preserve the 'null space' of the task and make it available to the control level. We demonstrate how a symbolic description can be translated to a control-level description that is executable on the robot. We describe the relation to existing robot knowledge bases and indicate information sources for generating constraints on the symbolic side. On the control side we then show how our approach outperforms a traditional controller, by exploiting the task's null space, leading to a significantly extended work space.",

We extend existing work that has proven reliable in urban environments. To overcome the unavailability of road network information for background separation, we introduce a foreground model that incorporates geometric as well as temporal cues. Local shape estimates successfully guide vehicle localization. Extensive evaluation shows that the system works reliably and efficiently in various outdoor scenarios without any prior knowledge about the road network. Experiments with our own sensor as well as on publicly available data from the DARPA Urban Challenge revealed more than 96% correctly identified vehicles.",

A centralized tree of graph hypotheses is maintained to consider loop-closure, which is deterministically verified when agents observe each other at a common vertex. To achieve efficient mapping, we introduce an active exploration method in which agents dynamically request rendezvous tasks from other available agents to validate graph hypotheses.",

        "abstract": "Teams of robots can utilize formations to accomplish a task, such as maximizing the observability of an environment while maintaining connectivity. In a cluttered space, however, it might be necessary to automatically change formation to avoid obstacles. This work proposes a path planning approach for non-holonomic robots, where a team dynamically switches formations to reach a goal without collisions. The method introduces a multi-level graph, which can be constructed offline. Each level corresponds to a different formation and edges between levels allow for formation transitions. All edges satisfy curvature bounds and clearance requirements from obstacles. During the online phase, the method returns a path for a virtual leader, as well as the points along the path where the team should switch formations. Individual agents can compute their controls using kinematic formation controllers that operate in curvilinear coordinates. The approach guarantees that it is feasible for the agents to follow the trajectory returned. Simulations show that the online cost of the approach is small. The method returns solutions that maximize the maintenance of a desired formation while allowing the team to rearrange its configuration in the presence of obstacles.",

We employ gossip-based incremental SVM to obtain the discriminant function. By gossiping the support vectors with neighboring sensor nodes, the local SVM training results can achieve the agreement of the sub-optimal discriminant planes. After training the local SVM at each node, we can calculate the posterior probability of the existence of the targets using Platt's method. By maximum a posterior (MAP), the target trajectories are estimated. In order to validate the proposed tracking framework in wireless sensor networks, we perform two different target-tracking experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed procedure provides a good estimator, and supports the feasibility of applying the distributed SVM training to the target tracking problems.",

However, existing sensory feedback control schemes are only valid locally in a finite task space within a limited sensing zone where singularity of the Jacobian matrix is avoided. In this paper, the global stability problem of task-space sensory feedback control system is formulated and solved. The proposed method is based on multiple regional feedback information where each feedback information is employed in a local region. The combination of the local feedback covers the entire workspace and thus guarantees the global movement of the robot. In addition, the switching from one feedback information to another is embedded in the controller without using any hard or discontinuous switching. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

It is driven by the hypothesis that each subject's physiology can be reflected to the task dynamics using the operational space acceleration characteristics and that elite performers achieve the optimum transmission from their available muscle induced torque capacity to the desired task in goal oriented dynamic skills. The methodology is presented along with the full body human musculoskeletal model used for the task-based analyzes. The robotics approach for human motion characterization is demonstrated in the biomechanical analysis of an elite golf swing. This approach allows us to trace the acceleration capacities in a given subject's task space. The results of the motion characterization show that humans in fact follow a path of trajectory in line with the maximum available operational space accelerations benefiting from their physiology shaped by the combination of the force generating capacities of the muscles as well as by the joint and limb mechanics.",

        "abstract": "A novel nanotool exchanger system is proposed based on Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM) nanorobotic manipulation system. We proposed to use the E-SEM nanomanipulation system for the analysis of biological specimen using various \u201cnanotools\u201d to realize flexible and complex nano-scale stiffness measurement, adhesion force measurement, cutting, and injection. The E-SEM can use to observe the biological samples in nano-scale and real-time without any drying or dyeing processes. As previous works, we applied the system to manipulate biological specimens, such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and yeast cells. To maintain the livable condition of biological cells, it is important to reduce the exchange time of the nanotools. This is also important to improve the efficiency of biological specimen analysis using various nanotools without break the chamber pressure. This paper presents a novel nanotool exchanger system for exchanging different nanotools within the ESEM chamber. Through the nanotool exchanger system, the following advantages are mainly obtained, 1) it is not needed to open the sample chamber to exchange the nanotools and to evacuate the sample chamber pressure again, 2) it is not needed to operate manually to exchange nanotools, 3) it is possible to recover the nanotools by exchanging new one, 4) it is possible to use different tools continuously. Firstly, the design and fabrication are presented for the proposed nanotool adaptor, nanotool attachment and nanotool holder. Finally, we demonstrate to exchange the different nanotools based on E-SEM nanomanipulation system.",

First, the raw point clouds are segmented by utilizing the circular shape of trees, and segments are grouped into tree sections based on the principle of spatial proximity. Second, circles and axes are extracted from tree sections which are subject to loss of shape information. Third, by clustering and integrating the tree sections resulted from various space inconsistencies, straight tree trunk landmarks are finally formed for future localization. The experimental results from real forested environments are presented.",

The robot, by using only its sensor data, must navigate respecting humans' comfort. To obtain good results in such a dynamic environment, a prediction on humans' movement is also crucial. To solve all the aforementioned problems we introduce a suitable cost function. Its optimization is obtained by using a new stochastic and adaptive optimization algorithm (CAO). This method is very useful in particular when the analytical expression of the optimization function is unknown but numerical values are available for any state configuration. Additionally, the proposed method can easily incorporate any dynamical and environmental constraints. To validate the performance of the proposed solution, several simulation results are provided.",

This is achieved without the need for diffeomorphisms, by direct definition in the geometrically complicated configuration space. Every obstacle boundary point should be partially sufficiently curved. This requires that at least one principal normal curvature be sufficient. A normal curvature is termed sufficient when the tangent sphere with diameter the associated curvature radius is a subset of the obstacle. Examples include ellipses with bounded eccentricity, tori, cylinders, one-sheet hyperboloids and others. Our proof establishes the existence of appropriate tuning for this purpose.

        "abstract": "A robot navigates in a polygonal region populated by a set of partially distinguishable landmarks. The robot's motion primitives consist of actions of the form \u201cdrive toward a landmark of class x\u201d. To effectively navigate, the robot must always be able to see a landmark. Also, if the robot sees two landmarks of the same class, its motion primitives become ambiguous. Finally, if the robot wishes to navigate from landmark s0 to landmark sgoal with a simple graph search algorithm, then there must be a sequence of landmarks [s0, s1, s2, ..., sk = sgoal], in which landmark si is visible from si-1. Given these three conditions, how many landmark classes are required for navigation in a given polygon P? We call this minimum number of landmark classes the connected landmark class number, denoted \u03c7CL(P). We study this problem for the monotone polygons, an important family of polygons that are frequently generated as intermediate steps in other decomposition algorithms. We demonstrate that for all odd k, there exists a monotone polygon Mk with 3 over 4 (k2 + 2k + 1) vertices such that \u03c7CL(P) \u2265 k. We also demonstrate that for any n-vertex monotone polygon P, \u03c7CL(P) \u2264 n/3 + 12.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to construct Navigation Functions (NF) from experimental trajectories in an unknown environment. We want to approximate an unknown obstacle function and then use it within an NF. When navigating the same destinations with the experiments, this NF should produce the same trajectories as the experiments. This requirement is equivalent to a partial differential equation (PDE). Solving the PDE yields the unknown obstacle function, expressed with spline basis functions. We apply this new method to anthropomorphic grasping, producing automatic trajectories similar to the observed ones. The grasping experiments were performed for a set of different objects, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows reduction of the configuration space dimension, where the learning NF method is then applied.",

        "abstract": "Collision-free navigation in cluttered environments is essential for any mobile manipulation system. Traditional navigation systems have relied on a 2D grid map projected from a 3D representation for efficiency. This approach, however, prevents navigation close to objects in situations where projected 3D configurations are in collision within the 2D grid map even if actually no collision occurs in the 3D environment. Accordingly, when using such a 2D representation for planning paths of a mobile manipulation robot, the number of planning problems which can be solved is limited and suboptimal robot paths may result. We present a fast, integrated approach to solve path planning in 3D using a combination of an efficient octree-based representation of the 3D world and an anytime search-based motion planner. Our approach utilizes a combination of multi-layered 2D and 3D representations to improve planning speed, allowing the generation of almost real-time plans with bounded sub-optimality. We present extensive experimental results with the two-armed mobile manipulation robot PR2 carrying large objects in a highly cluttered environment. Using our approach, the robot is able to efficiently plan and execute trajectories while transporting objects, thereby often moving through demanding, narrow passageways.",

        "abstract": "We consider the partially observable control problem where it is potentially necessary to perform complex information-gathering operations in order to localize state. One approach to solving these problems is to create plans in belief-space, the space of probability distributions over the underlying state of the system. The belief-space plan encodes a strategy for performing a task while gaining information as necessary. Unlike most approaches in the literature which rely upon representing belief state as a Gaussian distribution, we have recently proposed an approach to non-Gaussian belief space planning based on solving a non-linear optimization problem defined in terms of a set of state samples [1]. In this paper, we show that even though our approach makes optimistic assumptions about the content of future observations for planning purposes, all low-cost plans are guaranteed to gain information in a specific way under certain conditions. We show that eventually, the algorithm is guaranteed to localize the true state of the system and to reach a goal region with high probability. Although the computational complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the number of samples used to define the optimization problem, our convergence guarantee holds with as few as two samples. Moreover, we show empirically that it is unnecessary to use large numbers of samples in order to obtain good performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "AFM based nanomanipulations have been successfully applied in various areas such as physics, biology and so forth in nano scale. Traditional nanomanipulations always have to approach the problems such as hysteresis, nonlinearity and thermal drift of the scanner, and the noise brought by the position sensor. In this research, a compressive feedbacks based non-vector space control approach is proposed for improving the accuracy of AFM based nanomanipulations. Instead of sensors, the local image was used as the feedback to a non-vector space controller to generate a closed-loop control for manipulation. In this paper, there are four research topics: First, local scan strategy was used to get a local image. Second, since the feedback is an image, a non-vector space controller was designed to deal with the difficulty in vector space such as calibration and coordinate transformation. Third, in order to further decrease the time spent on local scan, compressive sensing was introduced to this system. Finally, to overcome the disadvantage that compressive sensing costs time on reconstructing the original signal, we directly use the compressive data as the feedback. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results have shown that the system has a good performance on AFM tip motion control. Therefore, the non-vector space control method can make visual servoing easier, and the compressive feedback could make a high speed real-time control of nanomanipulation possible. In addition, this new method can be applied to nano-assembly, nano-imaging and nanomanipulation.",

        "abstract": "Building autonomous underwater robots is a challenging problem. Different sensory modalities have been employed successfully, some inspired by human and animal senses. The European ANGELS project uses an electric sense inspired by weakly electric fish. These fish have the unique ability to navigate and orient in complete darkness by using self-produced electrical fields. They emit electric signals into the environment, which in turn they perceive with an array of electroreceptor organs in their skin. The fish's whole body serves as an antenna, which shapes the emitted electrical field. As a result, the animals are able to detect, localize and analyze objects in their vicinity and to perceive a 3-dimensional electrical picture of their surroundings. Here, we review biological experimental results highlighting the animal's perceptual abilities, which allow them to navigate in extreme environments where vision can not be used. In addition, electric fishes use electric signals for communication. Behavioral communication strategies such as synchronization of electric signals and fixed-order-signaling can play a role in group coherence. Because of their unique sensory abilities, electric fish can serve as a model system for roboticists building underwater vehicles that can communicate and navigate in extreme environments where vision is not possible. In ANGELS, the electric sense is used to navigate a robot without knowledge of the surroundings, keep multi robots in formation, reconstruct an image of the environment and communicate between different robots - all inspired by our biological investigations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to measuring the indentation depth of a stiffness sensor in real time during a soft tissue palpation activity. The proposed system is integrated into a stiffness probe and is designed to intra-operatively aid the surgeon to rapidly identify the tissue abnormalities with minimum measurement inaccuracies due to tissue surface profile variations. Stiffness probe and the associated surface profile sensors are pneumatic and the newly designed system can concurrently measure the indentation depth and surface profile variations while sliding over the soft tissues in any direction in a near frictionless manner. With the pneumatic pressure maintained constant, the displacement of the sensing element is a direct function of the stiffness of the tissue under investigation. The sensor has a tunable force range and the indentation force can be adjusted externally to match tissue limitations. The prototype of the new design of stiffness probe was calibrated and tested on silicone blocks simulating soft tissue.

A system of equations describing each singularity type is given. Using a numerical method based on linear relaxations, the configurations in each type are computed independently. The method is general and complete: it can be applied to manipulators with arbitrary geometry; and will isolate singularities with the desired accuracy. As an example, the entire singularity set and its complete classification are computed for a two-degree-of-freedom mechanism. The complex partition of the configuration space by various singularities is illustrated by three-dimensional projections.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Compliance in multifingered hand improves grasp stability and effectiveness of the manipulation tasks. Compliance of robotic hands depends mainly on the joint control parameters, on the mechanical design of the hand, as joint passive springs, and on the contact properties. In object grasping the primary task of the robotic hand is the control of internal forces which allows to satisfy the contact constraints and consequently to guarantee a stable grasp of the object. When compliance is an essential element of the multifingered hand, and the control of the internal forces is not designed to be decoupled from the object motion, it happens that a change in the internal forces causes the object trajectory to deviate from the planned path with consequent performance degradation. This paper studies the structural conditions to design an internal force controller decoupled from object motions. The analysis is constructive and a controller of internal forces is proposed. We will refer to this controller as object motion-decoupled control of internal forces. The force controller has been successfully tested on a realistic model of the DLR Hand II. This controller provides a trajectory interface allowing to vary the internal forces (and to specify object motions) of an underactuated hand, which can be used by higher-level modules, e.g. planning tools.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to recover complete 3D models of articulated objects. Structure-from-motion techniques are used to capture 3D point cloud models of the object in two different configurations. A novel combination of Procrustes analysis and RANSAC facilitates a straightforward geometric approach to recovering the joint axes, as well as classifying them automatically as either revolute or prismatic. With the resulting articulated model, a robotic system is able to manipulate the object along its joint axes at a specified grasp point in order to exercise its degrees of freedom. Because the models capture all sides of the object, they are occluded-aware, enabling the robotic system to plan paths to parts of the object that are not visible in the current view. Our algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the object, nor does it make any assumptions about the planarity of the object or scene. Experiments with a PUMA 500 robotic arm demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of objects with both revolute and prismatic joints.",

Such systems are subject to path dependent Dynamic Singularities (DS) that complicate their path planning. Due to the existence of DS its workspace is restricted. The Cartesian space path planning of free-floating space robots is studied and a novel path planning technique allowing the end-effector to follow a desired path avoiding any DS is proposed. Since the path is predefined, the method yields the appropriate initial system configurations that avoid dynamically singular configurations during the motion. Therefore, it allows effective use of the entire robot workspace. The proposed method is applicable to both planar and spatial systems and it is demonstrated using straight-line paths. The application of the method is illustrated by two examples.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the concept of dense scene flow for visual SLAM applications. Traditional visual SLAM methods assume static features in the environment and that a dominant part of the scene changes only due to camera egomotion. These assumptions make traditional visual SLAM methods prone to failure in crowded real-world dynamic environments with many independently moving objects, such as the typical environments for the visually impaired. By means of a dense scene flow representation, moving objects can be detected. In this way, the visual SLAM process can be improved considerably, by not adding erroneous measurements into the estimation, yielding more consistent and improved localization and mapping results. We show large-scale visual SLAM results in challenging indoor and outdoor crowded environments with real visually impaired users. In particular, we performed experiments inside the Atocha railway station and in the city-center of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, both in Madrid, Spain. Our results show that the combination of visual SLAM and dense scene flow allows to obtain an accurate localization, improving considerably the results of traditional visual SLAM methods and GPS-based approaches.",

However, having an increasing number of degrees of freedom raises the question of how to use them effectively. In turn, establishing manipulators in human environments, e.g., as service robots, calls for the fulfillment of various constraints and tasks at the same time. In the context of torque controlled robotic systems, we provide an approach to simultaneously deal with a multitude of tasks and constraints which are arranged in a hierarchy, utilizing the large number of actuated joints of the manipulator. To this end, we propose a continuous null space projection technique to consider unilateral constraints, singular Jacobian matrices and dynamic variations of the priority order within the hierarchical structure. We show that activating and deactivating tasks as well as crossing singularities does not lead to a discontinuous control law. Simulations and experiments on the humanoid Justin of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) validate our approach. The presented concept is supposed to contribute to whole-body control frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot patrol is a fundamental application of multi-robot systems. While much theoretical work exists providing an understanding of the optimal patrol strategy for teams of coordinated homogeneous robots, little work exists on building and evaluating the performance of such systems for real. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of multirobot patrol in a practical outdoor distributed robotic system, and evaluate the effect of different coordination schemes on the performance of the robotic team. The multi-robot patrol algorithms evaluated vary in the level of robot coordination: no coordination, loose coordination, and tight coordination. In addition, we evaluate versions of these algorithms that distribute state information-either individual state, or entire team state (global-view state). Our experiments show that while tight coordination is theoretically optimal, it is not practical in practice. Instead, uncoordinated patrol performs best in terms of average waypoint visitation frequency, though loosely coordinated patrol that shares only individual state performed best in terms of worst-case frequency. Both are significantly better than a loosely coordinated algorithm based on sharing global-view state. We respond to this discrepancy between theory and practice, caused primarily by robot heterogeneity, by extending the theory to account for such heterogeneity, and find that the new theory accounts for the empirical results.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-goal path planning framework based on a self-organizing map algorithm and a model of the navigation describing evolution of the localization error. The framework combines finding a sequence of goals' visits with a goal-to-goal path planning considering localization uncertainty. The approach is able to deal with local properties of the environment such as expected visible landmarks usable for the navigation. The local properties affect the performance of the navigation, and therefore, the framework can take the full advantage of the local information together with the global sequence of the goals' visits to find a path improving the autonomous navigation. Experimental results in real outdoor and indoor environments indicate that the framework provides paths that effectively decreases the localization uncertainty; thus, increases the reliability of the autonomous goals' visits.",

The great difference between previous stability criteria and ours leads to further questions about the nature of the exact stability condition.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a caging approach which deals with planar boundary clouds collected from a laser scanner. Given the boundary clouds of a target object and two fixed finger positions, our aim is to find potential third finger positions that can prevent target from escaping into infinity. The major challenge in working with boundary clouds lies in their uncertainty in geometric model fitting and the failure of critical orientations. In this paper, we track canonical motions according to the rotational intersection of Configuration space fingers and rasterize Work space with grids to compute the third caging positions. Our approach can generate the capture region with max(O(np),O(h2)) \u2264 O(n2) cost where n denotes the resolution of grid rasterization, p denotes the resolution of canonical rasterization and h denotes the resolution of boundary rasterization or the number of boundary cloud points. Moreover, we propose a rough approximation which measures a subset of the possible positions by contracting rotations, indicating computational complexity of max(O(n),O(h2)). In the experimental part, our proposal is compared with state-of-the-art works and applied to many other objects. The approach makes caging fast and effective.",

The driving principle for such a robot exploits non-holonomic constraints to propel the rolling carrier. The full mathematical model as well as its reduced version are derived, and the inverse dynamics is addressed. It is shown that if the rotors are mounted on three orthogonal axes, any feasible kinematic trajectory of the rolling robot is dynamically realizable. For the case of only two orthogonal axes of the actuation the condition of dynamic realizability of a feasible kinematic trajectory is established. The implication of this condition to motion planning in dynamic formulation is explored under a case study. It is shown there that in maneuvering the robot by tracing circles on the sphere surface the dynamically realizable trajectories are essentially different from those resulted from kinematic models.",

This paper demonstrates that joining of two 2D local maps, formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem has at most two local minima, when the associated uncertainties can be described using spherical covariance matrices. Necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of two minima is derived and it is shown that more than one minimum exists only when the quality of the local maps used for map joining is extremely poor. The analysis explains to some extent why a number of optimization based SLAM algorithms proposed in the recent literature that rely on local search strategies are successful in converging to the globally optimal solution from poor initial conditions, particularly when covariance matrices are spherical. It also demonstrates that the map joining problem has special properties that may be exploited to reliably obtain globally optimal solutions to the SLAM problem.",

        "abstract": "One of the important challenges in robotics is the automatic synthesis of provably correct controllers from high level specifications. One class of such algorithms operates in two steps: (i) high level discrete controller synthesis and (ii) low level continuous controller synthesis. In this class of algorithms, when phase (i) fails, then it is desirable to provide feedback to the designer in the form of revised specifications that can be achieved by the system. In this paper, we address the minimal revision problem for specification automata. That is, we construct automata specifications that are as \u201cclose\u201d as possible to the initial user intent, by removing the minimum number of constraints from the specification that cannot be satisfied. We prove that the problem is computationally hard and we encode it as a satisfiability problem. Then, the minimal revision problem can be solved by utilizing efficient SAT solvers.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a solution to the grasp synthesis problem, which consist of finding the best hand configuration to grasp a given object for a specific manipulation task while satisfying all the necessary constraints. This problem had been divided into sequential sub-problems, including contact region determination, hand inverse kinematics and force distribution, with the particular constraints of each step tackled independently. This may lead to unnecessary effort, such as when one of the problems has no solution given the output of the previous step as input. To overcome this issue, we present a kinestatic formulation of the grasp synthesis problem that introduces compliance both at the joints and the contacts. This provides a proper framework to synthesize a feasible and prehensile grasp by considering simultaneously the necessary grasping constraints, including contact reachability, object restraint, and force controllability. As a consequence, a solution of the proposed model results in a set of hand configurations that allows to execute the grasp using only a position controller. The approach is illustrated with experiments on a simple planar hand using two fingers and an anthropomorphic robotic hand using three fingers.",

While most approaches rely on external ground stations because of the need of high computational power, we will present a full autonomous setup using only on-board hardware. Our work is based on the continuous homography constraint to recover ego-motion from optical flow. Thus we are able to provide an efficient fall back routine for any kind of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) since we rely solely on a monocular camera and on on-board computation. In particular, we devised two variants of the classical continuous 4-point algorithm and provided an extensive experimental evaluation against a known ground truth. The results show that our approach is able to recover the ego-motion of a flying UAV in realistic conditions and by only relying on the limited on-board computational power. Furthermore, we exploited the velocity estimation for closing the loop and controlling the motion of the UAV online.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots working in a household environment need 3D geometric shape models of objects for recognizing and managing them properly. In this paper, we make humanoid robots creating models by themselves with dual-arm re-grasping (Fig.1). When robots create models by themselves, they should know how and where they can grasp objects, how their hands occlude object surfaces, and when they have seen every surface on an object. In addition, to execute efficient observation with less failure, it is important to reduce the number of re-grasping. Of course when the shape of objects is unknown, it is difficult to get a sequence of grasp positions which fulfills these conditions. This determination problem of a sequence of grasp positions can be expressed through a graph search problem. To solve this graph, we propose a heuristic method for selecting the next grasp position. This proposed method can be used for creating object models when 3D shape information is updated on-line. To evaluate it, we compare the result of the re-grasping sequence from this method with the optimal sequence coming out of breadth first search which use 3D shape information. Also, we propose an observation system with dual-arm re-grasping considering the points when humanoid robots execute observation in the real world. Finally, we show the experiment results of construction of 3D shape models in the real world using the heuristic method and the observation system.",

This previously proposed class of algorithms requires constant kinematic motion constraints, and this paper extends the approach by the usage of time-variant motion constraints, such that low-level trajectory parameters can now abruptly be changed, and the system can react instantaneously within the same control cycle (typically one millisecond or less). This feature is important for instantaneous switchings between state spaces and reference frames at sensor-dependent instants of time, and for the usage of the algorithm as a control submodule in a hybrid switched robot motion control system. Real-world experimental results of two sample use-cases highlight the practical relevance of this extension.",

        "abstract": "This research presents a 3-D human arms tracking method with a monocular camera. In our previous work, multiple clues have been integrated by the multiple importance sampling particle filter to track the arms with arbitrary motion on the images. Due to the lack of depth information when using a monocular camera, an online sequential pose estimation based on the structure-from-motion is proposed here to provide the 3D arm posture hypotheses of multiple importance sampling particle filter. In our 3D sequential pose estimating algorithm, the structure of each arm parts is priory assumed to be a volumetric model with the points uniformly distributed on its surface. The 3D motion of arms can be recovered more reliably by visual tracking of the points on the known structure of each arm. In addition, while the objects in view appear larger when they are closer to the camera, the size effect from perspective projection is considered to disambiguate the arm posture. The posture hypotheses from the multiple importance sampling are finally verified by 2D visual features and the 3D posture information augmented with the size effect. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm have been validated in the experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time real-world beat tracking system which runs on a dancing robot. The main problem of such a robot is that, while it is moving, ego noise is generated due to its motors, and this directly degrades the quality of the audio signal features used for beat tracking. Therefore, we propose to incorporate ego noise reduction as a pre-processing stage prior to our tempo induction and beat tracking system. The beat tracking algorithm is based on an online strategy of competing agents sequentially processing a continuous musical input, while considering parallel hypotheses regarding tempo and beats. This system is applied to a humanoid robot processing the audio from its embedded microphones on-the-fly, while performing simplistic dancing motions. A detailed and multi-criteria based evaluation of the system across different music genres and varying stationary/non-stationary noise conditions is presented.

Specifically, we describe the identification of the time constant and delay in a first-order model of the vehicle powertrain, as well as parameters required for pose estimation (including position offsets for the inertial measurement unit, steer angle sensor parameters, and wheel radius). Our approach does not require differentiation of state measurements like classical techniques; making it ideal when only low-frequency measurements are available. Experimental results on the LandTamer and Zo\u00eb rover platforms show online calibration using integrated dynamics to be fast and more accurate than both manual and classical calibration methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a technique to estimate the egomotion of an RGB-D sensor based on rotations of functions defined on the unit sphere. In contrast to traditional approaches, our technique is not based on image features and does not require correspondences to be generated between frames of data. Instead, consecutive functions are correlated using spherical harmonic analysis. An Extended Gaussian Image (EGI), created from the local normal estimates of a point cloud, defines each function. Correlations are efficiently computed using Fourier transformations, resulting in a 3 Degree of Freedom (3-DoF) rotation estimate. An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process then refines the initial rotation estimate and adds a translational component, yielding a full 6-DoF egomotion estimate. The focus of this work is to investigate the merits of using spherical harmonic analysis for egomotion estimation by comparison with alternative 6-DoF methods. We compare the performance of the proposed technique with that of stand-alone ICP and image feature based methods. As with other egomotion techniques, estimation errors accumulate and degrade results, necessitating correction mechanisms for robust localization. For this report, however, we use the raw estimates; no filtering or smoothing processes are applied. In-house and external benchmark data sets are analyzed for both runtime and accuracy. Results show that the algorithm is competitive in terms of both accuracy and runtime, and future work will aim to combine the various techniques into a more robust egomotion estimation framework.",

As a matter of fact, improper and incorrect operations of the teleoperator may decrease the teleoperation efficiency and even result in some serious safety problems even if the stability and telepresence are both guaranteed. Thus, this paper investigates a method to online identify the quality of the teleoperator and then integrate it into the planning and control of the telerobotic system. The method can help improve the performance of the system including efficiency and safety. It is also implemented on a mobile manipulator and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the designed method.",

It also offers an intuitive way to provide corrections and refine teaching during task execution. Previously, mostly position constraints have been taken into account when teaching tasks from demonstrations. In this work, we tackle the problem of teaching tasks that require or can benefit from varying stiffness. This extension is not trivial, as the teacher needs to have a way of communicating to the robot what stiffness it should use. We propose a method by which the teacher can modulate the stiffness of the robot in any direction through physical interaction. The system is incremental and works online, so that the teacher can instantly feel how the robot learns from the interaction. We validate the proposed approach on two experiments on a 7-Dof Barrett WAM arm.",

Yet, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) positioning scenarios can create large biases in the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements, and must be addressed with accurate measurement models in order to avoid significant localization errors. In this work, we first develop an efficient, closed-form TDOA error model and analyze its estimation characteristics by calculating the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We subsequently detail how an online Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted to find an elegant formalism for the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters. We perform real experiments on a mobile robot equipped with an UWB emitter, and show that the online estimation algorithm leads to excellent localization performance due to its ability to adapt to the varying NLOS path conditions over time.",

Defining online patrolling strategies for UAVs presents challenges related both to classical patrolling, as periodic monitoring of the environment, and to search, as accurate localization and identification of the mission-related activities. In this paper, we deal with this problem considering probabilistic intrusions and a variable resolution sensing model that naturally applies to the domain of UAVs. We present three online single-robot patrolling strategies exploiting a variable resolution paradigm to represent the environment that has recently shown promising results for search problems. The approach uses a hierarchical representation based on probabilistic quadtrees that allows UAVs to tradeoff sensing accuracy with sensing area. The model is extended by adding stochastic arrivals of intruders in space and time. Obtained results validate this approach for online patrolling against approaches based on uniform grids.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a twofold, open-loop method to explore, model and calibrate articulated robots equipped with artificial skin. We do so, using a 3-axis accelerometer per artificial sensor skin unit (SU) and special excitation pattern on every actuated degree of freedom (DoF) of the robotic joints. The first algorithm extracts the kinematic dependencies in between segments, equipped with artificial skin units, and joints, featuring one or multiple rotatory DoFs. A second algorithm uses this structural knowledge to automatically build and estimate kinematic models in between a static reference and an end effector segment. We show experimental results for the structural exploration with a KUKA light weight robotic arm equipped with our own SU prototypes. Additional simulation results, supporting our approach on estimating the kinematic parameters of the robot, are also presented.",

The current state-of-the-art in the field is Fast Appearance-Based Mapping (FAB-MAP) having been demonstrated in several seminal robotic mapping experiments. In this paper, we describe OpenFABMAP, a fully open source implementation of the original FAB-MAP algorithm. Beyond the benefits of full user access to the source code, OpenFABMAP provides a number of configurable options including rapid codebook training and interest point feature tuning. We demonstrate the performance of OpenFABMAP on a number of published datasets and demonstrate the advantages of quick algorithm customisation. We present results from OpenFABMAP's application in a highly varied range of robotics research scenarios.",

We refer to known techniques for estimation performance evaluation and probabilistic mobility models, and we bring them together to provide a solid numerical analysis for the considered problem. We perform an extensive simulations in different scenarios, and, as a proof of concept, we show how an AUV, equipped with an upward looking sonar, can improve its localization estimate by detecting a surface vessel.",

This paper presents an optimal, exact, polynomial-time planner for optimal bounded-acceleration trajectories along a fixed, given path with dynamic obstacles. The planner constructs reachable sets in the path-velocity-time (PVT) space by propagating reachable velocity sets between obstacle tangent points in the path-time (PT) space. The terminal velocities attainable by endpoint-constrained trajectories in the same homotopic class are proven to span a convex interval, so the planner merges contributions from individual homotopic classes to find the exact range of reachable velocities and times at the goal. A reachability analysis proves that running time is polynomial given reasonable assumptions, and empirical tests demonstrate that it scales well in practice and can handle hundreds of dynamic obstacles in a fraction of a second on a standard PC.",

        "abstract": "Robots are not typically used for assembly tasks in which positioning requirements exceed robot capabilities. To address this limitation, a significant amount of work has been directed toward identifying desirable mechanical behavior of a robot for force-guided assembly. Most of this work has been directed toward the `standard' peg-in-hole assembly problem. Little has been done to identify the specific behavior necessary for reliable assembly for different types of polygonal parts, and little has been done relating assembly characteristics to classes of part geometries. This paper presents the best passive admittance and associated maximum coefficient of friction for planar force-assembly of a variety of different polygonal parts, specifically pegs with rectangular, trapezoidal, triangular, and pentagonal cross sections. The results show that force-guided assembly can be reliably achieved at higher values of friction when parts are shorter and wider. For all geometries considered, force-guided assembly is ensured for any value of friction less than 0.8 when the optimal admittance is used; and, for some geometries, for any value of friction less than 15.",

        "abstract": "In contrast to common rigid or actively compliant systems, Variable Stiffness Arms are capable of storing potential energy in their joint and convert it into kinetic energy, respectively speed. This capability is well known from humans and is a good example for the outstanding performance of biological systems. However, only since some years intrinsic compliance is considered as a key feature and not a drawback in robot design. Therefore, only very little work has been carried out on exploiting the natural dynamics of elastic arms for such explosive motion sequences. In this paper, we treat the problem of how to optimally achieve maximum link velocity at a given final time for Variable Stiffness Arms. We show that solutions to this problem lead to excitation motions, which enable the robot to move on the link side at much higher speed than on the motor side. In particular, the robot uses the dynamic transfer of elastic joint energy into link side kinetic energy for further acceleration. In our work we consider the practically relevant input and state constraints, and give experimental verification of the developed methods on the new DLR Hand-Arm system.",

In this paper we present a framework for implementing gaits which will allow for smooth transitions. We also present a method to determine the optimal time for each module of the snake to switch between gaits in a decentralized fashion. This will allow for each module to participate in minimizing a cost by communicating with a set of modules in a local neighborhood. Both of these developments will help to maintain desired properties of the gaits during transition.",

Moreover, the varying gear ratio during the jump motion is obtained through a simulation which connects statics-based optimization and robot dynamics.

For instance, the solution of the optimal control problem of maximizing the speed of a VSA for impact maximization at a given position with free final time is achieved by applying a control policy that synchronizes stiffness changes with link speed and acceleration. This problem can be regarded as the formalization of the performance of a soccer player's free kick.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents Optimally Scaled Hip-Force Planning (OSHP), a novel approach to controlling the body dynamics of running robots. Controllers based on OSHP form the high-level component of a hierarchical control scheme in which they direct lower level controllers, each responsible for coordinating the motion of a single leg. An OSHP controller takes in the state of the runner at the apex of its primary aerial phase and returns desired profiles for the vertical and horizontal forces to be exerted at each hip during the subsequent stride. The hip force profiles returned by OSHP are scaled variants of nominal force profiles based on biological ground reaction force data. The OSHP controller determines the scaling parameters for these profiles through constrained nonlinear optimization on an approximate model of the runner's body dynamics. Evaluation of an OSHP controller for a quadruped model in simulation shows that even with very simple leg controllers, the OSHP controller can accelerate the runner from rest to steady-state running without a pre-defined footfall sequence.",

        "abstract": "In earlier work closed-form trajectory bending was shown to provide an efficient and accurate out-of-core solution for loop-closing exactly sparse trajectories. Here we extend it to fuse exactly sparse trajectories, obtained from relative pose estimates, with absolute orientation data. This allows us to close-the-loop using absolute orientation data only. The benefit is that our approach does not rely on the observations from which the trajectory was estimated nor on the probabilistic links between poses in the trajectory. It therefore is highly efficient. The proposed method is compared against regular fusion and an iterative trajectory bending solution using a 5 km long urban trajectory. Proofs concerning optimality of our method are provided.",

We identify a set of requirements that apply to all web-based remote laboratories and focus on solutions to these requirements. Specifically, we present solutions to interface, control and design difficulties in the client and server-side software when implementing a remote laboratory architecture. The combination of shared physical hardware and shared middleware software allows for experiments that build upon and compare against results on the same platform and in the same environment for common tasks. We describe how researchers can interact with the PR2 and its environment remotely through a web interface, as well as develop similar interfaces to visualize and run experiments remotely.",

        "abstract": "Holographic optical tweezers (HOT) has ability to trap and manipulate a few hundred of small particles. Previously the manipulation speed is greatly limited to the calculation speed of holograms. But recent progress in parallel computing made it possible to generate the holograms in real-time. Therefore, HOT is thought to play an important role in dexterous micromanipulation. In practical application, the teleoperation of HOT is thought to improve the manipulability. But, the maximum number of objects which can be manipulated at once is limited by the master devices. In this research, we applied a multi-touch user interface for the master. And we designed and constructed the HOT teleoperation system. In the optical system, we implemented a zero-order beam filtering system to avoid the disturbance. In control system, we applied an Apple iPad2 as a master device. The design and the processing of the interface were proposed and discussed in consideration of the manipulability. And, we discuss the manipulation method making the best use of multi-touch user interface. With the constructed system, we demonstrated the parallel teleoperation of 10 particles. And the time response of manipulation shows the potential of smooth manipulation. Based on these discussions, we concluded that the constructed system is effective for micromanipulation.",

Directional dry adhesives are modeled on gecko setae. The adhesives are comprised of arrays of micro-scale polymer stalks. The geometry of the polymer stalks has a significant effect upon their adhesion properties. A set of parameters including stalk thickness, stalk angle, face angle and stalk curvature have been identified as factors that influence both normal and shear adhesion levels. A new micro-resolution rapid prototyping process is used to create adhesives with varying geometry and advanced features such as curved stalks. A series of experimental tests characterize the significance of each parameter. Tests indicate that the new curved stalk geometry presented here can provide the greatest overall adhesion and robustness to variations in pull-off angle.",

        "abstract": "Limit cycle walking including passive-dynamic walkers is mathematically modeled as a nonlinear hybrid dynamical system with state jumps in general. The generated motion is natural and energy efficient, but it is still pointed out that there are many differences between limit cycle walking and human walking. Non-existence of the period of double-limb support in the former comes from the assumption of instantaneous inelastic collision and is one of the biggest differences from the latter. In human walking, the period of double-limb support accounts for more than 10% of one cycle, and this must have significant effects on the gait stability and efficiency. Also in robot walking, utilizing the effects of double-limb support is essential to achieve more flexible, adaptive and human-like behavior. This paper then develops a novel mathematical model of a passive rimless wheel that emerges double-limb support by using the leg viscoelasticity, and numerically investigates the fundamental properties.",

In the experiment a 4-DOF manipulator arm, built with the VSA-CubeBot platform, is controlled to hold a pen and draw a circle on an uneven surface. The control is designed calculating joint and stiffness trajectories with a Cartesian approach to the problem, thus designing the optimal workspace stiffness at first. Then, the joint stiffness yielding the closest workspace stiffness is searched for. Experimental results are reported, which agree with the theoretical outcomes, showing that the sub-optimal joints stiffness settings allow the arm to follow the circular trajectory on the uneven surface at best.",

        "abstract": "A method to generate an appropriate path for manipulation of a belt object is proposed. It is important for automatic manipulation of a belt object such as a film/flexible circuit board to generate an appropriate path for a manipulator because such object is flexible in a certain direction but fragile in another direction and an inappropriate path which causes deformation in the fragile direction may lead to wiring disconnection. First, deformation of a rectangular belt object is modeled considering its bending and torsional deformation under the force of gravity. Next, a method to generate a path for belt object manipulation with quasi-static and non-excessive deformation is proposed. After that, deformation and loaded condition in the path generated by our proposed method and those in a common path based on linear interpolation are compared. Finally, the validity of our proposed method is verified by measuring the deformed shape of a polyethylene sheet during manipulation with the generated path.",

        "abstract": "We develop and illustrate an efficient but rigorous methodology that predicts the time-optimal paths of ocean vehicles in continuous dynamic flows. The goal is to best utilize or avoid currents, without limitation on these currents or on the number of vehicles. The methodology employs a new modified level set equation to evolve a front from the starting point of a vehicle until it reaches the desired goal location, combining flow advection with nominal vehicle motion. The optimal path of the vehicle is then obtained by solving a particle tracking equation backward in time. The computational cost of this method increases linearly with the number of vehicles and geometrically with spatial dimensions. The methodology is applicable to any continuous flow and in scenarios with multiple vehicles. Present illustrations consist of the crossing of a canonical uniform jet and its validation using a classic optimization solution, as well as swarm formation in more complex time varying 2D flow fields, including jets, eddies and forbidden regions.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a model predictive path-following controller, which incorporates adaptive slip estimation for a tracked vehicle. Tracked vehicles are capable of manoeuvring in highly variable and uneven terrain, but difficulties in their control have traditionally limited their use as autonomous platforms. Attempts to compensate for slip in environments typically require that both the forward and rotational velocities of a platform be determined, but this can be challenging. This paper shows that it is possible to estimate vehicle traction using only a rate gyroscope, by providing a suitable adaptive least squares estimator to do so. An approach to generating slip compensating controls when platform velocity constraints are applied is also presented. The approach is controller independent, but we make use of a model predictive controller, vulnerable to the effects of model-plant mismatch, to highlight the efficacy of the proposed estimation and compensation. Path following results using a mixture model to generate feasible slip values are presented, and show a significant increase in controller performance.",

        "abstract": "The selection of suitable features and their parameters for the classification of three-dimensional laser range data is a crucial issue for high-quality results. In this paper we compare the performance of different histogram descriptors and their parameters on three urban datasets recorded with various sensors-sweeping SICK lasers, tilting SICK lasers and a Velodyne 3D laser range scanner. These descriptors are 1D, 2D, and 3D histograms capturing the distribution of normals or points around a query point. We also propose a novel histogram descriptor, which relies on the spectral values in different scales. We argue that choosing a larger support radius and a z-axis based global reference frame/axis can boost the performance of all kinds of investigated classification models significantly. The 3D histograms relying on the point distribution, normal orientations, or spectral values, turned out to be the best choice for the classification in urban environments.",

Dynamics of the object is incorporated into our grasping simulation to capture the change of its pose and contact points during grasping.

A simple robotic grasping strategy is simulated and the quality score of the resulting grasp is evaluated from the simulation result. The effectiveness of the new quality measures on predicting the actual grasp success rate is shown through a real robot experiment.",

The offline phase generates a set of regions on the object and the environment surfaces and calculates several parameters needed in the online phase. In the online phase, the planner selects a grasping pose of the robot and a putting posture of the object by searching for the regions calculated in the offline phase. By using the proposed method, we can also plan the trajectory of the robot, and the regrasping strategy of the dual-arm. Here, the putting posture of the object can be planned by considering stability of the object placed on the environment. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation and experimental results by using the dual-arm robot NX-HIRO.",

The novelties of this model are two-fold: First, a mathematical formalism that defines bubble space is presented. This formalism extends previously proposed bubble memory to accommodate two new variables - varying robot pose and multiple features. Each bubble surface preserves the local S2-metric relations of the incoming sensory data from the robot's viewpoint. Secondly, for learning and recognition, bubble surfaces can be transformed into bubble descriptors that are compact and rotationally invariant, while being computable in an incremental manner. The proposed model is evaluated with support vector machine based decision making in two different settings: first with a mobile robot placed in a variety of locations and secondly using benchmark visual data.",

These planar surfaces are measured both in 3D point clouds, as well as 2D laser scans. These sensing modalities compliment each other well, as they differ significantly in their measurable fields of view and maximum ranges. We present experiments to evaluate the contributions of each type of sensor.",

Since two generalized contacts suffice for planar grasps, we leverage previous work on caging and immobilization for two contact grasps to construct an algorithm which synthesizes contact configurations for stable grasping. Simulations show that our methodology can be applied to grasp a wide range of planar objects without relying on special-purpose end-effectors. Representative experiments with the PR2 humanoid robot illustrate that this approach is practical.",

We implement our method for multi-person HRI system on the android Actroid-SIT, and conduct two experiments for estimating the precision of gestures and the human impressions about the Actroid. Through these experiments, we confirmed our method gives humans a more sophisticated impressions.",

Achieving desired motions in position space is a challenging task for such systems due to their unstable zero dynamics. This paper presents a novel approach that uses the dynamic constraint equations to plan shape trajectories, which when tracked will result in optimal tracking of desired position trajectories. The ballbot with arms has shape space of higher dimension than its position space and therefore, the procedure uses a user-defined weight matrix to choose between the infinite number of possible combinations of shape trajectories to achieve a particular desired trajectory in position space. Experimental results are shown on the real robot where different motions in position space are achieved by tracking motions of either the body lean angles, or the arm angles or combinations of both.",

The model also facilitates the direct control of pneumatic muscle actuated continuum arms through the use of input pressure. This is achieved without additional intermediary transformations and does not have singularity problems present in previous models. The proposed arm model uses a new pneumatic muscle actuator (PMA) dynamic model with hysteresis that is capable of modelling both extending and contracting PMAs. The proposed hysteric model is simple, easily adaptable, and validated experimentally. The PMA model can be applied to dynamically model any PMA based system as well as PMA actuated continuum arms utilizing different actuator configurations.",

With the recent proliferation of low-cost range sensors, dense 3D point cloud data is readily available at high update rates. Taking a cue from the graphics literature, we propose that point data should be represented as an implicit surface, which can be formulated to be mathematically smooth and efficient for computing interaction forces, and for which haptic constraint algorithms are already well-known. This method is resistant to sensor noise, makes no assumptions about surface connectivity or orientation, and data pre-processing is fast enough for use with streaming data. We compare the performance of two different implicit representations and discuss our strategy for handling time-varying point clouds from a depth camera. Applications of haptic point cloud rendering to remote sensing, as in robot telemanipulation, are also discussed.",

This article proposes a novel registration algorithm, based on the distance between Three-Dimensional Normal Distributions Transforms. 3D-NDT models - a sub-class of Gaussian Mixture Models with uniformly weighted, largely disjoint components, can be quickly computed from range point data. The proposed algorithm constructs 3D-NDT representations of the input point sets and then formulates an objective function based on the L2 distance between the considered models. Analytic first and second order derivatives of the objective function are computed and used in a standard Newton method optimization scheme, to obtain the best-fitting transformation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and shown to be more accurate and faster, compared to a state of the art implementation of the Iterative Closest Point and 3D-NDT Point-to-Distribution algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a planar parallel three-degree-of-freedom underactuated cable-driven robot. The mechanism is first described and a dynamic model is derived. The proposed mechanism does not require any mechanical (e.g. pulleys) or electrical (e.g. actuators) hardware to be mounted on the end-effector. A trajectory planning approach is developed, which is based on the natural frequency of the pendulum-like free motion (unconstrained degree of freedom). Sine-like excitation functions are used and their frequency and phase delay are determined using simulation results. A prototype is then described and experimental results are provided together with a video clip of an example trajectory. The results confirm that the mechanism can be effectively used to perform point-to-point trajectories.",

The new devices, which we call PolyMites as they are derived from our previous MagMites, are simpler, faster and cheaper to fabricate than the MagMite. Like their predecessor, they are capable of moving on planar surfaces in dry and wet environments. Their improved biocompatibility also extends their potential for biological applications. PolyMites are 500 \u03bcm in diameter and 55 \u03bcm in height. In air they have attained a speed of 13 mm/s, approximately 26 body lengths per second. PolyMites are capable of micromanipulation on a surface, which is demonstrated by pushing and releasing micro-objects such as polystyrene beads in water.",

        "abstract": "Grasp quality metrics which analyze the contact wrench space are commonly used to synthesize and analyze preplanned grasps. Preplanned grasping approaches rely on the robustness of stored solutions. Analyzing the robustness of such solutions for large databases of preplanned grasps is a limiting factor for the applicability of data driven approaches to grasping. In this work, we will focus on the stability of the widely used grasp wrench space epsilon quality metric over a large range of poses in simulation. We examine a large number of grasps from the Columbia Grasp Database for the Barrett hand. We find that in most cases the grasp with the most robust force closure with respect to pose error for a particular object is not the grasp with the highest epsilon quality. We demonstrate that grasps can be reranked by an estimate of the stability of their epsilon quality. We find that the grasps ranked best by this method are successful more often in physical experiments than grasps ranked best by the epsilon quality.",

Four markers are placed on the instrument, whose positions are measured in the image. These measurements are compared to a three-dimensional rendered model of the instrument. The pseudo-inverse of the interaction matrix between the state of the model and the marker positions in the image is used to update the state such that the model will track the real instrument. An experiment was performed in which the instrument was moved inside a colon model, while the tip position was simultaneously measured with an electromagnetic tracking system. The root mean square errors of the position estimation were 2.3 mm, 2.2 mm and 1.7 mm in the horizontal (x), vertical (y) and away-from-camera (z) directions, respectively.",

The I-AUV is assumed to be moving in the presence of constant unknown ocean currents, and aims to estimate its position relying on measurements of its range to the ASC and of its depth relatively to the sea level. Two different scenarios are considered: in one, the ASC transmits its position and velocity to the I-AUV, while in the other the ASC transmits only its position, and the I-AUV has access to measurements of its velocity relative to the ASC. A sufficient condition for observability and a method for designing state observers with Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS) error dynamics are presented for both problems. Finally, simulation results are included and discussed to assess the performance of the proposed solutions in the presence of measurement noise.",

        "abstract": "Conventionally, tendon-driven manipulators implement some force-based controller using either tension feedback or dynamic models of the actuator. The force control allows the system to maintain proper tensions on the tendons. In some cases, whether it is due to the lack of tension feedback or actuator torque control, a purely position-based controller is needed. This work compares three position controllers for tendon-driven manipulators that implement a nested actuator position controller. A new controller is introduced that achieves the best overall performance with regards to speed, accuracy, and transient behavior. To compensate for the lack of tension control, the controller nominally maintains the internal tension on the tendons through a range-space constraint on the actuator positions. These control laws are validated experimentally on the Robonaut-2 humanoid hand.",

By utilizing the different characteristics and advantages of these sensors, the system achieves good performance in an everyday environment. Although the tag ID and the position of an object carried by a person is not measurable by static sensors or by mobile sensors, the system can estimate them by using an SIR (Sequential importance resampling) particle filter that integrates the data obtained by the static sensors and the mobile sensors.

        "abstract": "This article introduces a set of novel haptic guidance algorithms intended to provide intuitive and reliable assistance for electric wheelchair navigation through narrow or crowded spaces. The proposed schemes take hereto the non-holonomic nature and a detailed geometry of the wheelchair into consideration. The methods encode the environment as a set of collision-free circular paths and, making use of a model-free impedance controller, `haptically' guide the user along collision-free paths or away from obstructed paths or paths that simply do not coincide with the motion intended by the user. The haptic feedback plays a central role as it establishes a fast bilateral communication channel between user and wheelchair controller and allows a direct negotiation about wheelchair motion. If found unsatisfactory, suggested trajectories can always be overruled by the user. Relying on inputs from user modeling and intention recognition schemes, the system can reduce forces needed to move along intended directions, thereby avoiding unnecessary fatigue of the user. A commercial powered wheelchair was upgraded and feasability tests were conducted to validate the proposed methods. The potential of the proposed approaches was hereby demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about long-term navigation in environments whose appearance changes over time - suddenly or gradually. We describe, implement and validate an approach which allows us to incrementally learn a model whose complexity varies naturally in accordance with variation of scene appearance. It allows us to leverage the state of the art in pose estimation to build over many runs, a world model of sufficient richness to allow simple localisation despite a large variation in conditions. As our robot repeatedly traverses its workspace, it accumulates distinct visual experiences that in concert, implicitly represent the scene variation - each experience captures a visual mode. When operating in a previously visited area, we continually try to localise in these previous experiences while simultaneously running an independent vision based pose estimation system. Failure to localise in a sufficient number of prior experiences indicates an insufficient model of the workspace and instigates the laying down of the live image sequence as a new distinct experience. In this way, over time we can capture the typical time varying appearance of an environment and the number of experiences required tends to a constant. Although we focus on vision as a primary sensor throughout, the ideas we present here are equally applicable to other sensor modalities. We demonstrate our approach working on a road vehicle operating over a three month period at different times of day, in different weather and lighting conditions. In all, we process over 136,000 frames captured from 37km of driving.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate an underactuated finger design and grasping method for precision grasping and manipulation of relatively small objects. Taking a cue from human manipulation, we introduce the flip-and-pinch task, in which the hand picks up thin objects from a table surface by flipping it into a stable configuration. Despite the fact that finger motions are not fully constrained by the hand actuators, we demonstrate that the hand and fingers can be configured with the table surface to produce a set of constraints that result in a repeatable quasi-static motion trajectory. This approach is shown to be robust for a variety of object sizes, even when utilizing identical open-loop kinematic playback. Experimental results suggest that the advantages of underactuated, adaptive robot hands can be carried over to dexterous, precision tasks as well.",

Chained systems can model many common nonholonomic vehicles. We establish a relation between the degree of nonholonomy and the minimum length of the control horizon so as to make the NMPC feasible. A necessary condition on the control horizon of NMPC is given and theoretically proved whatever the dimension of the chained system considered. This relation is used to design a NMPC-based control strategy for chained systems. One of the advantages of NMPC is the capability of taking into account the constraints on state and on control variables. The theoretical results are illustrated through simulations on a (2,5) chained system, describing a car-like vehicle with one trailer. Difficult motion objectives that require a lateral displacement are considered.",

We present experiments in simulation and, for object tracking, with a real robotics setup, the Hoap 3, showing that the system can be successfully applied to gaze stabilization during locomotion, even when the feedback loop is very slow and noisy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Virtual Metrology (VM) is a method to conjecture manufacturing quality of a process tool based on data sensed from the process tool and without physical metrology operations. Historical data is used to produce the initial VM models, and then these models are applied to operate in a process drift/shift environment. The accuracy of VM highly depends on the modeling samples adopted during initial-creating and on-line-refreshing periods. Since design-of-experiments (DOE) may not be performed due to large resources required, how could we guarantee stability of the models and predictions when they move into these unknown environments? Conventionally, static-moving-window (SMW) schemes with a fixed window size are adopted during the on-line-refreshing period. The purpose of this paper is to propose a dynamic-moving-window (DMW) scheme for VM model refreshing. The DMW scheme adds a new sample into the model and applies a clustering technology to do similarity clustering. Next, the number of elements in each cluster is checked. If the largest number of elements is greater than the predefined threshold, then the oldest sample in the cluster with the largest population is deleted. Test results show that the DMW scheme has better on-line conjecture accuracy than that of the SMW scheme.",

This paper considers a mobile robot whose performance is measured by the completion of temporal logic tasks within a certain period of time. In addition to such time constraints, the planning algorithm must also deal with changes in the robot's workspace during task execution. In our case, the robot is deployed in a partitioned environment subjected to structural changes in which doors shift from open to closed and vice-versa. The motion of the robot is modeled as a Continuous Time Markov Decision Process and the robot's mission is expressed as a Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) temporal logic specification. An approximate solution to find a control strategy that satisfies such specifications is derived for a subset of probabilistic CSL formulae. Simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we derive a probabilistic registration algorithm for object modeling and tracking. In many robotics applications, such as manipulation tasks, nonvisual information about the movement of the object is available, which we will combine with the visual information. Furthermore we do not only consider observations of the object, but we also take space into account which has been observed to not be part of the object. Furthermore we are computing a posterior distribution over the relative alignment and not a point estimate as typically done in for example Iterative Closest Point (ICP). To our knowledge no existing algorithm meets these three conditions and we thus derive a novel registration algorithm in a Bayesian framework. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods perform favorably in comparison to PCL [1] implementations of feature mapping and ICP, especially if nonvisual information is available.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic planners such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) are powerful path planning algorithms for high dimensional systems, but even these potent techniques suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as can be seen in multirobot systems. In this paper, we apply a technique called subdimensional expansion in order to enhance the performance of probabilistic planners for multirobot path planning.We accomplish this by exploiting the structure inherent to such problems. Subdimensional expansion initially plans in each individual robot's configuration space separately. It then couples those spaces when robots come into close proximity with one another. In this way, we constrain a probabilistic planner to search a low dimensional space, while dynamically generating a higher dimensional space where necessary. We show in simulation that subdimensional expansion enhanced PRMs can solve problems involving 32 robots and 128 total degrees of freedom in less than 10 minutes. We also demonstrate that enhancing RRTs and PRMs with subdimensional expansion can decrease the time required to find a solution by more than an order of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider a probabilistic method for mapping a spatial process over a distributed multi-agent system and a coordinated level curve tracking algorithm for adaptive sampling. As opposed to assuming the independence of spatial features (e.g. an occupancy grid model), we adopt a novel model of spatial dependence based on the grid-structured Markov random field that exploits spatial structure to enhance mapping. The multi-agent Markov random field framework is utilized to distribute the model over the system and to decompose the problem of global inference into local belief propagation problems coupled with neighbor-wise inter-agent message passing. A Lyapunov stable control law for tracking level curves in the plane is derived and a method of gradient and Hessian estimation is presented for applying the control in a probabilistic map of the process. Simulation results over a real-world dataset with the goal of mapping a plume-like oceanographic process demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. Scalability and complexity results suggest the feasibility of the approach in realistic multi-agent deployments.",

        "abstract": "Recently, autonomous miniature airships have become a growing research field. Whereas airships are attractive as they can move freely in the three-dimensional space, their high-dimensional state space and the restriction to small and lightweight sensors are demanding constraints with respect to self-localization. Furthermore, their complex second-order kinematics makes the estimation of their pose and velocity through dead reckoning odometry difficult and imprecise. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the velocity of a miniature blimp with lightweight air flow sensors. We present a probabilistic sensor model that accurately models the uncertainty of the flow sensors and thus allows for robust state estimation using a particle filter. In experiments carried out with a real airship we demonstrate that our method precisely estimates the velocity of the blimp and outperforms the standard velocity estimates of the motion model as applied in many existent autonomous blimp navigation systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of navigating a mobile robot with a limited field-of-view in a unknown dynamic environment. In such a situation, absolute motion safety, i.e. such that no collision will ever take place whatever happens, is impossible to guarantee. It is therefore settled for a weaker level of motion safety dubbed passive motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision takes place, the robot will be at rest. Passive motion safety is tackled using a variant of the Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS, i.e. states such that, whatever the future braking trajectory of the robot, a collision occurs before it is at rest. Passive motion safety is readily obtained by avoiding Braking ICS at all times. Building upon an existing Braking ICS-Checker, i.e. an algorithm that checks if a given state is a Braking ICS or not, this paper presents a reactive collision avoidance scheme called PASSAVOID. The main contribution of this paper is the formal proof of PASSAVOID's passive motion safety. Experiments in simulation demonstrates how PASSAVOID operates.",

Our method iteratively builds a constructive proof that two configurations lie in disjoint components of the free configuration space. Our algorithm first generates samples that correspond to configurations for which the robot is in collision with an obstacle. These samples are then weighted by their generalized penetration distance, and used to construct alpha shapes. The alpha shape defines a collection of simplices that are fully contained within the configuration space obstacle region. These simplices can be used to quickly solve connectivity queries, which in turn can be used to define termination conditions for sampling-based planners. Such planners, while typically either resolution complete or probabilistically complete, are not able to determine when a path does not exist, and therefore would otherwise rely on heuristics to determine when the search for a free path should be abandoned. An implementation of the algorithm is provided for the case of a 3D Euclidean configuration space, and a proof of correctness is provided.",

At the same time, robot systems typically have real-time performance requirements and performance gains can often be obtained by multi-threading. It is challenging, however, to create correct multi-threaded software, especially when standard mutual exclusion primitives, such as mutexes and semaphores, are eschewed in favor of more efficient, lock-free mechanisms. It is even more difficult to find these errors, as they can remain dormant for years until triggered by just the \u201cright\u201d conditions. Our approach, therefore, is to apply Formal Methods to reason about the correctness of these mechanisms. As a first step, we adopted a recently-developed program logic called History for Local Rely/Guarantee (HLRG) and applied it to prove the correctness (after first finding and fixing an error) of one such mechanism in the open source cisst software package. This strategy is not specific to cisst and can be applied to other packages.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the setup through experiments on Giant danio and compute the success rate in eliciting a response. We also estimate visual startle sensitivity by presenting the stimulus from different directions around the fish head. The aim of this work is to provide the basis for quantifying escape behavior in fish schools.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a quantification method for a comprehensive work flow in construction work for describing work states in more detail on the basis of analyzing state transitions of primitive static states (PSS), which consist of 16 symbolic work states defined by using on-off state of the lever operations and joint loads for the manipulator and end-effector. On the basis of the state transition rules derived from a transition-condition analysis, practical state transitions (PST), which are common and frequent transitions in arbitrary construction work, are defined. PST can be classified into essential (EST) or nonessential state transitions (NST). EST extracts common phases of work progress and estimates positional relations between a manipulator and an object. NST reveals wasted movements that degrade the efficiency and quality of work. To evaluate comprehensive work flows modeled by combing EST and NST, work-analysis experiments using our instrumented setup were conducted. Results indicate that all the PSS definitely changes on the basis of PST under various work conditions, and work analysis using EST and NST easily reveals work characteristics and untrained tasks related to wasted movements.",

Toe joints are used to realize quicker turningmotion, while avoiding excessive motor load due to frictional torque.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Researchers have focused on frameworks and specialized languages that ease the reuse of previously developed software artifacts on new platforms by using domain concepts as a programming API rather than robot specific APIs. This approach relies upon the existence of a customized device driver program that maps the specific device API to the framework-based domain concepts. While this approach works well to isolate device semantics to a generalizable domain model, a customized driver is required to match each device to each framework or language. To that end, it may be worthwhile to explore the science of interfacing devices to frameworks. In this paper, we expand the previously presented RDIS to be more generalizable by redefining RDIS in terms of the robot device and framework domains. We introduce several high-level domain concepts that describe the invariant features of devices while providing parameterization for attributes that vary. We consider relevant threading models and a decomposition that insulates the application interface or framework connection from the robot-specific primitives. In addition to efficiencies that can be gained in providing declarative device to framework connectivity, new approaches in this space could be the basis for more user friendly development environments that use a discovery mechanism for presenting available control and access mechanisms.",

To do this in an efficient manner, we incorporate radio signal strength (RSS) information into the exploration algorithm by locally sampling the RSS and estimating the 2-D RSS gradient. The algorithm exploits the local motion to collect RSS samples for gradient estimation and seeks to explore in a way that brings the robot to the signal source. This strategy avoids random or exhaustive exploration. An indoor experiment demonstrates the exploration algorithm that uses this information to dynamically prioritize candidate frontiers and traverse to a radio source. Simulations, including radio propagation modeling with a ray-tracing algorithm, enable study of control algorithm tradeoffs and statistical performance.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm for learning decision-making tasks that could enable robots to learn and adapt to their situation on-line. For an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks, it must learn in very few samples, while continually taking actions in real-time. Existing model-based RL methods learn in relatively few samples, but typically take too much time between each action for practical on-line learning. In this paper, we present a novel parallel architecture for model-based RL that runs in real-time by 1) taking advantage of sample-based approximate planning methods and 2) parallelizing the acting, model learning, and planning processes in a novel way such that the acting process is sufficiently fast for typical robot control cycles. We demonstrate that algorithms using this architecture perform nearly as well as methods using the typical sequential architecture when both are given unlimited time, and greatly out-perform these methods on tasks that require real-time actions such as controlling an autonomous vehicle.",

Such an effect is, in the majority of studies, ignored or considered as noise and then corrected, based on proprioceptive sensors or localization systems. In this study we consider that distortion contains the information about the vehicle's displacement. We propose to extract this information from distortion without any other information than exteroceptive sensor data. The only sensor used for this work is a panoramic Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar called K2Pi. No odometer, gyrometer or other proprioceptive sensor is used. The idea is to resort to velocimetry by analyzing the distortion of the measurements. As a result, the linear and angular velocities of the mobile robot are estimated and used to build, without any other sensor, the trajectory of the vehicle and then the radar map of outdoor environments. In this paper, radar-only localization and mapping results are presented for a ground vehicle and a riverbank application. This work can easily be extended to other slow rotating range sensors.",

Preceding approaches showed suitable results and vanishing point estimation was used in many robotics tasks, especially in the detection of illstructured roads. The main drawback of such approaches is the computational complexity - the possibilities of hardware accelerations are mentioned in many papers, however, we believe, that the biggest benefit of a vanishing point estimation algorithm is for primarily tele-operated robots in the case of signal loss, etc., that cannot use specialized hardware just for this feature. In this paper, we investigate possibilities of an efficient implementation by the expansion of Gabor wavelets into a linear combination of Haar-like box functions to perform fast filtering via integral image trick and discuss the utilization of superpixels in the voting scheme to provide a significant speed-up (more than 40 times), while we loose only 3-5% in precision.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new method for decoding pixel correspondences in structured light based 3D reconstruction, refer to here as Ray-Tracing codec. The key idea of Ray-Tracing codec is to correctly define the region boundaries in real number, for each layer of the Hierarchical Orthogonal Code (HOC) based on an accurate boundary estimator, and to inherit the correct region boundaries between layers sharing common boundaries. Furthermore, each region in lower layer is traced back to the upper layer for the correct correspondence between regions. This is an improvement over existing HOC decoding algorithms as the wrong decoded pixel correspondences can be greatly reduced. The experimental results have shown that the proposed Ray-Tracing codec significantly enhances the robustness and precision in depth imaging, compare with HOC and other well-known conventional approach. The proposed approach opens a greater feasibility of applying structured light based depth imaging to a 3D modeling of cluttered workspace for home service robots.",

Based on the trajectories of the robots, the framework builds up an internal microscopic representation of the system, which then serves as a blueprint of models at higher abstraction levels. These models are then calibrated using a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm. We illustrate the structure and performance of the framework by performing the online optimization of a bang-bang controller for the stochastic self-assembly of water-floating, magnetically latching, passive modules. The experimental results demonstrate that the generated models can successfully optimize the assembly of desired structures.",

Our proposed compression framework can handle general point cloud streams of arbitrary and varying size, point order and point density. Furthermore, it allows for controlling coding complexity and coding precision. To compress the point clouds, we perform a spatial decomposition based on octree data structures. Additionally, we present a technique for comparing the octree data structures of consecutive point clouds. By encoding their structural differences, we can successively extend the point clouds at the decoder. In this way, we are able to detect and remove temporal redundancy from the point cloud data stream. Our experimental results show a strong compression performance of a ratio of 14 at 1 mm coordinate precision and up to 40 at a coordinate precision of 9 mm.",

Particular attention was given to the kinematic coupling between the master and the slave manipulators, as well as to the inverse kinematics algorithm.

Many multi-agent cooperative approaches disregard the potential hazards between agents, which are an important aspect to many systems and especially for airborne systems. In this work, team negotiation is performed using a decentralized gradient-based optimization approach whereas safety distance constraints are specifically designed and handled using Lagrangian multiplier methods. The novelty of our work is the demonstration of a decentralized form of inter-agent collision avoidance in the loop of the agents' real-time group mission optimization process, where the algorithm inherits the properties of performing its original mission while minimizing the probability of inter-agent collisions. Explicit constraint gradient formulation is derived and used to enhance computational advantage and solution accuracy. The effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm has been verified in a simulated environment by coordinating a team of UAVs searching for targets in a large-scale environment.",

The RTERS first localizes faces in a sequence of images, then features are extracted and passed to a recognition engine that codes facial expressions into one of seven different emotional states: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and neutrality.We propose and develop a distance-based classifier, called Distance-Ratio Classifier, for emotion identification from the feature vectors. The performance of the proposed distance-ratio classifier was compared with support-vector-machine-based classifiers, using different feature extraction and dimensionality reduction approaches, including principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, kernel principal component analysis, greedy kernel principal component analysis, and generalized discriminant analysis. Extensive computer simulations were conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RTERS. Using two widely used databases for performance evaluation, the best performance of the proposed RTERS was 95.8% using the generalized discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction and the proposed distance-ratio classifier.",

We demonstrate that this method is well suited for footstep planning in cluttered environments.",

        "abstract": "The combination of visual and inertial sensors has proved to be very popular in robot navigation and, in particular, Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) navigation due the flexibility in weight, power consumption and low cost it offers. At the same time, coping with the big latency between inertial and visual measurements and processing images in real-time impose great research challenges. Most modern MAV navigation systems avoid to explicitly tackle this by employing a ground station for off-board processing. In this paper, we propose a navigation algorithm for MAVs equipped with a single camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which is able to run onboard and in real-time. The main focus here is on the proposed speed-estimation module which converts the camera into a metric body-speed sensor using IMU data within an EKF framework. We show how this module can be used for full self-calibration of the sensor suite in real-time. The module is then used both during initialization and as a fall-back solution at tracking failures of a keyframe-based VSLAM module. The latter is based on an existing high-performance algorithm, extended such that it achieves scalable 6DoF pose estimation at constant complexity. Fast onboard speed control is ensured by sole reliance on the optical flow of at least two features in two consecutive camera frames and the corresponding IMU readings. Our nonlinear observability analysis and our real experiments demonstrate that this approach can be used to control a MAV in speed, while we also show results of operation at 40Hz on an onboard Atom computer 1.6 GHz.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must be capable of localizing even in GPS denied situations. In this paper, we propose a real-time method to localize a vehicle along a route using visual imagery or range information. Our approach is an implementation of topometric localization, which combines the robustness of topological localization with the geometric accuracy of metric methods. We construct a map by navigating the route using a GPS-equipped vehicle and building a compact database of simple visual and 3D features. We then localize using a Bayesian filter to match sequences of visual or range measurements to the database. The algorithm is reliable across wide environmental changes, including lighting differences, seasonal variations, and occlusions, achieving an average localization accuracy of 1 m over an 8 km route. The method converges correctly even with wrong initial position estimates solving the kidnapped robot problem.",

The proposed algorithm, bicycle reciprocal collision avoidance (B-ORCA), builds on the concept of optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) for holonomic robots but furthermore guarantees collision-free motions under the kinematic constraints of car-like vehicles. The underlying principle of the B-ORCA algorithm applies more generally to other kinematic models, as it combines velocity obstacles with generic tracking control. The theoretical results on collision avoidance are validated by several simulation experiments between multiple car-like robots.",

In this paper, we bring these complementary techniques together by efficiently estimating the mechanical stability of the plane when it makes contact with a vertical surface; the resulting landing funnel can then be used in a feedback motion planning algorithm for the flight controller. We consider a simplified model of the perching dynamics and report an extension of the region of attraction techniques, using sums-of-squares optimization, which combines polynomial approximations of barrier constraints with the traditional Lyapunov methods to achieve tight estimation of the true region of attraction for the model. We demonstrate the new method on a variety of design parameters for the perching system, suggesting a potential use as a mechanical system or controller design tool.",

By regularity properties of a trajectory we mean whether this trajectory, or a function computed from it, belongs to a certain class Cn (the class of functions that are differentiable n times with a continuous nth derivative). We show that, under some generic assumptions about the rotation and steering velocities of the wheels, any non-degenerate wheeled robot belongs to one of the two following classes. Class I comprises those robots whose admissible trajectories in the plane are C1 and piecewise C2; and class II comprises those robots whose admissible trajectories are C1, piecewise C2 and, in addition, curvature-continuous. Second, based on this characterization, we derive new feedback control and gap-filling algorithms for wheeled mobile robots using the recently-developed affine trajectory deformation framework.",

        "abstract": "Although current humanoid controllers can rely on inverse kinematics or dynamics of the full humanoid system, powered prosthetic legs or assistive devices cannot, because they do not have access to the full states of the human system. This limitation creates the need for alternative control strategies. One strategy is to embed fundamental knowledge about legged dynamics and control in local feedback. In a previous paper, we have developed a control model of human locomotion which relies mostly on local feedback. The model can robustly walk at normal walking speeds. Here we extend this model to adapt to a wide range of walking speeds and to generate corresponding speed transitions. We use optimization of the model's control parameters and find key parameters responsible for steady walking between 0.8ms\u22121 and 1.8ms\u22121, covering the range of speed at which humans normally walk. Using these parameters, we demonstrate speed transitions between slow and fast walking. In addition, we discuss how the speed-dependent changes of the identified control parameters connect to biped walking dynamics, and suggest how these changes can be integrated in local feedback control.",

Although such planners are typically based upon a coarse approximation of reality, they are nonetheless valuable due to their ability to reason about the future, and to generalize to previously unseen scenarios. However, encoding the desired behavior of a system into the underlying cost function used by the planner can be a tedious and error-prone task. We introduce Reinforcement Planning, which extends gradient based reinforcement learning algorithms to automatically learn useful surrogate cost functions for optimal planners. Reinforcement Planning presents several advantages over other learning approaches to planning in that it is not limited by the expertise of a human demonstrator, and that it acknowledges the domain of the planner is a simplified model of the world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning to solve a noisy physical simulation of the well-known \u201cmarble maze\u201d toy.",

We highlight the backbone of our system, the relative estimation and control. We depart from the common practice of using a globally referenced map, preferring instead to keep the position and yaw states in the EKF relative to the current map node. This relative navigation approach allows simple application of sensor updates, natural characterization of the transformation between map nodes, and the potential to generate a globally consistent map when desired. The EKF fuses view matching data from a Microsoft Kinect with more frequent IMU data to provide state estimates at rates high enough to control the vehicles fast dynamics. Although an EKF is used, a nodes and edges graph represents the map. Hardware results showing the quality of the estimates and flights with estimates in the loop are provided.",

Our prior work on this problem uses a graph to navigate between the convex vertices of an environment. In this paper, we extend this graph with the addition of a new node type and four new edge types. The new node type allows for more uncertainty in robot position. The presence of one of these new edge types guarantees reliable transitions between these nodes. This enhanced graph enables the algorithm to navigate environment features not solvable by our previous algorithm, including T-junctions and long halls. We also present a heuristic to accelerate the planning process by prioritizing the promising edge tests to perform. Our heuristic effectively focuses the search and qualitative data show that it computes plans with much less computational effort than a na\u00efve approach. We describe a simulated implementation of the algorithm that finds paths not previously possible, and a physical implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of executing those plans in practice.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a 6-RRCRR parallel robot assisted minimally invasive surgery/microsurgery system (PRAMiSS) is introduced. Remote centre-of-motion (RCM) control algorithms of PRAMiSS suitable for minimally invasive surgery and microsurgery are also presented. The programmable RCM approach is implemented in order to achieve manipulation under the constraint of moving through the fixed penetration point. Having minimised the displacements of the mobile platform of the parallel micropositioning robot, the algorithms also apply orientation constraint to the instrument and prevent the tool tip to orient due to the robot movements during the manipulation. Experimental results are provided to verify accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed RCM control algorithms for minimally invasive surgery.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new tactile-force integrated method to localize tumors minimally invasively using robotic assistance. This method relies on using a capacitive sensor at the tip of a Tactile Sensing Instrument (TSI) which can be inserted into a patient's body in a minimally invasive manner. In this work, the operator palpates tissue containing tumors in a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) training box, representing the patient's body, through a master-slave teleoperation system which consists of a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface, used as the master, and a Mitsubishi PA10-7C robot as the slave. Using the proposed method, the operator would be able to palpate the tissue consistently, observe the pressure distribution over the tissue by a color contour map on a screen and feel the tumor on his/her fingers through a grasping mechanism of the haptic interface as a result of higher stiffness of the tumor. The tissue used for the experiments was ex vivo bovine lung and seven participants were asked to locate artificial tumors embedded in the lungs. The results show an accuracy of 93% in tumor localization using the proposed method while the average force applied to the tissue was 3.42N and the force never exceeded 6N.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "According to the seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) human arm model composed of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, positioning of the wrist in space and orientating the palm is a task requiring only six DOFs. Due to this redundancy, a given task can be completed by multiple arm configurations, and there is no unique mathematical solution to the inverse kinematics. The redundancy of a wearable robotic system (exoskeleton) that interacts with the human is expected to be resolved in the same way as that of the human arm. A unique solution to the system's redundancy was introduced by combining both kinematic and dynamic criteria. The redundancy of the arm is expressed mathematically by defining the swivel angle: the rotation angle of the plane including the upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints which are fixed in space. Two different swivel angles were generated based on kinematic and dynamic constraints. The kinematic criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. The dynamic criterion is to minimize the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. These two criteria were then combined linearly with different weight factors for estimating the swivel angle. Post processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted swivel angle and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees. This result outperformed the prediction based on a single criteria.",

We address the difficulties of implementing and outfitting this system on a UAV with limited payload capabilities and develop a controller that maximizes the received power as the UAV moves into and out of range.

        "abstract": "Specialty crops constitute a $45 billion/year industry. As opposed to crops such as wheat, cotton, corn and soybean, they are characterized by the need for intensive cultivation. Specialty crops growers currently face serious labor cost and availability problems, and few technological solutions exist to increase their efficiency given the past history of abundant supply of low-cost labor. This leads to an opportunity to use recent technological advances to not only increase efficiency and reduce labor costs in specialty crops production but also to support a domestic engineering solutions industry for specialty crops. We envision a family of reconfigurable vehicles that can be rapidly tasked to automate or augment pruning, thinning, harvesting, mowing, spraying, etc. They would share a common sensing and computing infrastructure, allowing applications created for one to be easily transferable to others - much like software applications today are transferable from one computer to another. In this paper we describe our work over the last three years designing and deploying a family of such vehicles, the Autonomous Prime Movers (APMs). The five vehicles completed so far have traveled autonomously over 300 km in research and commercial tree fruit orchards; preliminary results in time trials conducted by extension educators indicate efficiency gains of up to 58%.",

Instead of usual force control laws we rely on the well tuned position control loop and just use the force sensor to measure the target pose or to predict the desired trajectory. In combination with a compliant sensor we introduce an inherently stable framework of force control which almost inhibits all control errors. After an unexpected impact the force error is reduced independently from the sensor's bandwidth or delays in signal processing. Thus the (inevitable) impact force is more significant than the measured force control errors. The special case of a sensor that is mounted far away from a vertex-face contact is discussed, too.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hybrid-structured model for the adaptive localization of robots combining a stochastic localization model and a rhythmic action model, for avoiding vacant spaces of landmarks efficiently. In regularly arranged landmark environments, robots may not be able to detect any landmarks for a long time during a straight-like movement. Consequently, locally diverse and smooth movement patterns need to be generated to keep the position estimation stable. Conventional approaches aiming at the probabilistic optimization cannot rapidly generate the detailed movement pattern due to a huge computational cost; therefore a simple but diverse movement structure needs to be introduced as an alternative option. We solve this problem by combining a particle filter as the stochastic localization module and the dynamical action model generating a zig-zagging motion. The validation experiments, where virtual-line-tracing tasks are exhibited on a floor-installed RFID environment, show that introducing the proposed rhythm pattern can improve a minimum error boundary and a velocity performance for arbitrary tolerance errors can be improved by the rhythm amplitude adaptation fed back by the localization deviation.",

The approach is based on risk-sensitive optimal feedback control. The human behavior is modeled using probabilistic learning methods and any unexpected disturbance is considered as a source of noise.

        "abstract": "We present a fast, robust road detection algorithm for aerial images taken from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. A histogram-based adaptive threshold algorithm is used to detect possible road regions in an image. A probabilistic hough transform based line segment detection combined with a clustering method is implemented to further extract the road. The proposed algorithm has been extensively tested on desert and urban images obtained using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Our results indicate that we are able to successfully and accurately detect roads in 97% of the images. We experimentally validated our algorithm on over ten thousand (10,000) aerial images obtained using our UAV. These images consist of intersecting roads, bifurcating roads and roundabouts in various conditions with significant changes in lighting and intensity. Our algorithm is able to successfully detect single roads effectively in almost all the images. It is also able to detect at least one road in over 95% of the images containing bifurcating or intersecting roads.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe and demonstrate a method for precisely localizing a road vehicle using a single push-broom 2D laser scanner while leveraging a prior 3D survey. In contrast to conventional scan matching, our laser is oriented downwards, thus causing continual ground strike. Our method exploits this to produce a small 3D swathe of laser data which can be matched statistically within the 3D survey. This swathe generation is predicated upon time varying estimates of vehicle velocity. While in theory this data could be obtained from vehicle speedometers, in reality these instruments are biased and so we also provide a way to estimate this bias from survey data. We show that our low cost system consistently outperforms a high caliber integrated DGPS/IMU system over 26 km of driven path around a test site.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in robotics have led to an ever-growing repertoire of software capabilities (e.g., recognition, mapping, and object manipulation). However, robotic capabilities grow, the complexity of operating and interacting with such robots increases (such as through speech, gesture, scripting, or programming). Language-based communication can offer users the ability to work with physically and computationally complex robots without diminishing the robot's inherent capability. However, it remains an open question how to build a common ground between natural language and goal-directed robot actions, particularly in a way that scales with the growth of robot capabilities. We examine using semantic frames - a linguistics concept which describes scenes being acted out - as a conceptual stepping stone between natural language and robot action. We examine the scalability of this solution through the development of RoboFrameNet, a generic language-to-action pipeline for ROS (the Robot Operating System) that abstracts verbs and their dependents into semantic frames, then grounds these frames into actions. We demonstrate the framework through experiments with the PR2 and Turtlebot robot platforms and consider the future scalability of the approach.",

However, industrial robots are generally only equipped with motor-side encoders. Accurate estimation of the end-effector position and velocity is thus difficult due to complex joint dynamics. To overcome this problem, this paper presents an optical sensor based on position sensitive detector (PSD), referred as PSD camera, for direct end-effector position sensing. PSD features high precision and fast response while being cost-effective, thus is favorable for real-time feedback applications. In addition, to acquire good velocity estimation, a kinematic Kalman filter (KKF) is applied to fuse the measurement from the PSD camera with that from inertial sensors mounted on the end-effector. The performance of the developed PSD camera and the application of the KKF sensor fusion scheme have been validated through experiments on an industrial robot.",

The simulator incorporates a real-time combat vehicle dynamics simulation module, a graphical presentation module, a robotic seat motion system, and a haptic steering system. The simulation module simulates dynamic motion and interaction with the environment of a combat vehicle in real-time. The graphical presentation module generates driving scenes that are displayed on a screen by a back projection. The robotic system generates seat motion cues by means of a three degree-of-freedom hydraulically driven mechanism. The force feedback steering system built on the basis of a torque controlled induction motor is an interface between the driver and the simulator. The developed driving simulator is validated through comparison of motion and force feedback responses with those measured with real vehicle when performing standard test manoeuvres. The results verify matching in simulated and real driving environments.",

We solve the problem for the case of prior maps which are semantically annotated perhaps even sketched by hand. Data association is achieved not through the detection of visual features but the detection of object classes used in the annotation of the prior maps. To avoid the caveats of general object recognition, we propose a new representation of the query images that consists of a vector of the detection scores for each object class. Given such soft object detections we are able to create hypotheses about pose and to refine them through particle filtering. As opposed to small confined office and kitchen spaces, our experiment takes place in a large open urban rail station with multiple semantically ambiguous places. The success of our approach shows that our new representation is a robust way to exploit the plethora of existing prior maps for GPS-denied environments avoiding the data association problems when matching point clouds or visual features.",

Previous research has shown that custom application-specific-integrated-circuits (ASICs) can be used for robot path planning. However, ASICs are typically fixed circuit designs that require long fabrication times on the order of months. In contrast, our reconfigurable analog circuits called Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs) implement a variety of AVLSI circuits in minutes. We present experimental results of online robot path planning using FPAA circuitry, validating our assertion that FPAA-based AVLSI design is a feasible approach to computing complete motion plans using analog floating-gate resistive grids. We demonstrate the integration of FPAA hardware and software with a real robot platform and hardware in the loop simulations, present the trajectories developed by our planner and provide analysis of the time and space complexity of our proposed approach. The paper concludes by formulating metrics that identify domains where analog solutions to planning may be faster and more efficient than traditional, digital robot planning techniques.",

In order to obtain semantic information efficiently and link it to a metric map, we present a semantic mapping approach through human activity recognition in an indoor human-robot coexisting environment. An intelligent mobile robot platform can create a 2D metric map, while human activity can be recognized using motion data from wearable motion sensors mounted on a human subject. Combined with pre-learned models of activity-to-furniture type association and robot pose estimates, the robot can determine the distribution of the furniture types on the 2D metric map. Simulations and real world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to create a reliable metric map with accurate semantic information.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The capability of extending body structures is one of the most significant challenges in the robotics research and it has been partially explored in self-reconfigurable robotics. By using such a capability, a robot is able to adaptively change its structure from, for example, a wheel like body shape to a legged one to deal with complexity in the environment. Despite their expectations, the existing mechanisms for extending body structures are still highly complex and the flexibility in self-reconfiguration is still very limited. In order to account for the problems, this paper investigates a novel approach to robotic body extension by employing an unconventional material called Hot Melt Adhesives (HMAs). Because of its thermo-plastic and thermo-adhesive characteristics, this material can be used for additive fabrication based on a simple robotic manipulator while the established structures can be integrated into the robot's own body to accomplish a task which could not have been achieved otherwise. This paper first investigates the HMA material properties and its handling techniques, then evaluates performances of the proposed robotic body extension approach through a case study of a \u201cwater scooping\u201d task.",

This is a fundamental task in surgery and includes interaction with a variety of tissues with unknown properties. In addition, due to sterilization and size constraints the use of contact force and position sensors are often avoided in surgical applications. We propose an Adaptive Model Predictive Control approach for execution of given tool trajectories in contact with unknown tissues in the absence of contact measurements. The Unscented Kalman Filter is employed in advance of system operation to identify the dynamics of a cable driven manipulator. These dynamics are then used to estimate contact force and position in free motion and in contact with tissue. An optimal control problem for automating tissue compression is formulated and is solved in real-time using Differential Dynamic Programming with Automatic Differentiation. The proposed methods are evaluated in experiments on an artificial tissue sample with unknown properties.",

The collaborative control strategy is implemented on a team of three robots to track coherent structures and manifolds on static flows as well as a noisy time-dependent model of a wind-driven double-gyre often seen in the ocean. We present simulation and experimental results and discuss theoretical guarantees of the collaborative tracking strategy.",

In the present paper, we consider the multi-arm swimming behavior of the octopus, which is different than their, more usual, jetting behavior, and is often used to achieve higher propulsive speeds, e.g., for chasing prey. A dynamic model of a robot with a pair of articulated arms is employed to study the generation of this mode of propulsion. The model includes fluid drag contributions, which we support by detailed Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis. To capture the basic characteristics of octopus multi-arm swimming a sculling mode is proposed, involving arm oscillations with an asymmetric speed profile. Parametric simulations were used to identify the arm oscillation characteristics that optimize propulsion for sculling, as well as for undulatory arm motions. Tests with a robotic prototype in a water tank provide preliminary validation of our analysis.",

Optimally, robots should learn continuously but this approach often suffers from problems like over-fitting, drifting or dealing with incomplete data. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically validate autonomously acquired perception models. These perception models are used to localize objects in the environment with the intention of manipulating them with the robot. Our approach verifies the learned perception models by moving the robot, trying to re-detect an object and then to grasp it. From observable failures of these actions and highlevel loop-closures to validate the eventual success, we can derive certain qualities of our models and our environment. We evaluate our approach by using two different detection algorithms, one using 2D RGB data and one using 3D point clouds. We show that our system is able to improve the perception performance significantly by learning which of the models is better in a certain situation and a specific context. We show how additional validation allows for successful continuous learning. The strictest precondition for learning such perceptual models is correct segmentation of objects which is evaluated in a second experiment.",

Instead of Euclidean coordinates, the method uses inverse depth coordinates which better conforms to the error characteristics of raw sensor data. Novel inverse depth formulations of point-to-point and point-to-plane error metrics are derived as part of our implementation. The implemented system runs in real time at an average of 28 frames per second (fps) on a standard computer. Extensive experiments were performed to evaluate different combinations of error metrics and parameters. Results show that our system is accurate and robust across a variety of motion trajectories.

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for automatically planning robust optimal paths for a group of robots that satisfy a common high level mission specification. Each robot's motion in the environment is modeled as a weighted transition system, and the mission is given as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set of propositions satisfied by the regions of the environment. In addition, an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be satisfied. The goal is to minimize the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition while ensuring that the LTL formula is satisfied even with uncertainty in the robots' traveling times. We characterize a class of LTL formulas that are robust to robot timing errors, for which we generate optimal paths if no timing errors are present, and we present bounds on the deviation from the optimal values in the presence of errors. We implement and experimentally evaluate our method considering a persistent monitoring task in a road network environment.",

This algorithm is optimal for a particular cost function that is expressed as a sum over Voronoi cells, where the placement of a sensor in its own cell has no effect on cost in other cells. We provide a probabilistic interpretation of this \u201cpartitioned\u201d cost function in the context of a target detection task, where each sensor has a chance of seeing the target that decreases monotonically with distance and where the goal is to minimize the total probability of missed detection. We show that the partitioned cost function is exactly the probability of missed detection given that a sensor can only see a target in its own Voronoi cell. We derive the probability of missed detection in the general case - where each sensor might see the target anywhere - and show that optimal sensor placement changes. Finally, we derive the probability of missed detection given the possibility of sensor failure, producing a robust measure of cost with respect to which optimal sensor placement is different yet again. Our results are illustrated by several examples in simulation.",

Usually, those mismatches come from some certain configuration errors or deviations caused by the change of environments. To reduce those mismatches, in this paper we proposed an angle-TDOA map adaptation method which can achieve the robust sound localization in various robot platforms (i.e., various types of microphone array configuration). Especially, the proposed method can be easily applied to the sound localization system by using only several sound sources which generated from some known directions. As a result, the proposed method not only showed a good localization performance, but also saved processing time.",

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic systems for in vivo microrobot steering have the potential to enable new types of localized and minimally invasive interventions. Accurate control of microrobots in natural fluids requires precise, high-bandwidth localization and accurate knowledge of the steering system's parameters. However, current in vivo imaging methodologies, such as fluoroscopy, must be used at low update rates to minimize radiation exposure. Low frame rates introduce localization uncertainties. Additionally, the parameters of the electromagnetic steering system are estimated with inaccuracies. These uncertainties can be addressed with robust H\u221e control, which is investigated in this paper. The controller is based on a linear uncertain dynamical model of the steering system and microrobot. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme accounts for modeling uncertainties, and that the controller can be used for servoing in low viscosity fluids using low frame rates. Experiments in a prototype electromagnetic steering system support the simulations.",

Firstly, we show the prototype of a six-strut tensegrity robot, which is driven by twenty-four pneumatic McKibben actuators. Second, we formulate the geometry of the tensegrity robot. We categorize contact states between a six-strut tensegrity robot and a flat ground into two; axial symmetric contact and planar symmetric contact. Finally, we experimentally examine if rolling can be performed over a flat ground for individual sets of the actuators and discuss the strategy of rolling.",

First, we succeeded in driving the micro gear in the closed micro channel. Next, to transmit power of rotational movement, we fabricated the open micro channel, and succeeded in driving the gear in the open micro channel similarly. In addition, we revealed that ratchet type gear rotated faster than other type. Finally, we assembled the micro gear with shaft. Therefore, it became possible transmitting the power from rotational movement to outside. Thus, we achieved to construct base of bio-motor.",

        "abstract": "Recent work by Mullane, Vo, and Adams has re-examined the probabilistic foundations of feature-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), casting the problem in terms of filtering with random finite sets. Algorithms were developed based on Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filtering techniques that provided superior performance to leading feature-based SLAM algorithms in challenging measurement scenarios with high false alarm rates, high missed detection rates, and high levels of measurement noise. We investigate this approach further by considering a hierarchical point process, or single-cluster multi-object, model, where we consider the state to consist of a map of landmarks conditioned on a vehicle state. Using Finite Set Statistics, we are able to find tractable formulae to approximate the joint vehicle-landmark state based on a single Poisson multi-object assumption on the predicted density. We describe the single-cluster PHD filter and the practical implementation developed based on a particle-system representation of the vehicle state and a Gaussian mixture approximation of the map for each particle. Synthetic simulation results are presented to compare the novel algorithm against the previous PHD filter SLAM algorithm. Results presented indicate a superior performance in vehicle and map landmark localization, and comparable performance in landmark cardinality estimation.",

We first present a bridge line-test that can identify regions around narrow passages, and then perform an optimization-based retraction operation selectively only at those regions. We also propose a non-colliding line-test, a dual operator to the bridge line-test, as a culling method to avoid generating samples near wide-open free spaces and thus to generate more samples around narrow passages. These two tests are performed with a small computational overhead and are integrated with a retraction-based RRT. In order to demonstrate benefits of our method, we have tested our method with different benchmarks that have varying amounts of narrow passages. Our method achieves up to 21 times and 3.5 times performance improvements over a basic RRT and an optimization-based retraction RRT, respectively. Furthermore, our method consistently improves the performances of other tested methods across all the tested benchmarks that have or do not have narrow passages.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a so-far untapped potential to operate at high speeds through cluttered environments. Many of these systems are limited by their adhoc reactive controllers using simple visual cues like optical flow. Here we consider the problem of formally verifying an output-feedback controller for an aircraft operating in an unknown environment. Using recent advances in sums-of-squares programming that allow for efficient computation of barrier functions, we search for global certificates of safety for the closed-loop system in a given environment. In contrast to previous work, we use rational functions to globally approximate non-smooth dynamics and use multiple barrier functions to guard against more than one obstacle. We expect that these formal verification techniques will allow for the comparison, and ultimately optimization, of reactive controllers for robustness to varying initial conditions and environments.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic manipulations require attaining high velocities at specified configurations, all the while obeying geometric and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a motion planner that constructs a trajectory that passes at an intermediate state through a dynamic objective region, which is comprised of a certain lower dimensional submanifold in the configuration/velocity state space, and then returns to rest. Planning speed and reliability are greatly improved by finding good intermediate states first, because the choice of intermediate state couples the ramp-up and ramp-down subproblems, and moreover very few (often less than 1%) intermediate states yield feasible solution trajectories. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method quickly generates trajectories for a 6-DOF industrial manipulator throwing a small object.",

In this paper, we first formulate three different visual homing problems using uncalibrated omnidirectional camera within the Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) framework; then we propose a novel simplified homing approach, which is inspired by IBVS, based only on the scale information of the SIFT features, with its computational cost linear to the number of features.

A helical nanobelt with a magnetic head was proposed as a microrobot driven by rotating magnetic field in prior works. Magnetically coated tails were already shown in some works. However the control of such surface magnetic tails is not clearly realized yet. This paper aims to obtain control parameters for the modeling and simulation of the influence of surface magnets onto the swimming performances. For this, we created scaled-up helical nanobelts and the experimental testbed to get the control parameters and to prepare future closed-loop control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for pairwise 3D alignment which solves data association by matching scan segments across scans. Generating accurate segment associations allows to run a modified version of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm where the search for point-to-point correspondences is constrained to associated segments. The novelty of the proposed approach is in the segment matching process which takes into account the proximity of segments, their shape, and the consistency of their relative locations in each scan. Scan segmentation is here assumed to be given (recent studies provide various alternatives [10], [19]). The method is tested on seven sequences of Velodyne scans acquired in urban environments. Unlike various other standard versions of ICP, which fail to recover correct alignment when the displacement between scans increases, the proposed method is shown to be robust to displacements of several meters. In addition, it is shown to lead to savings in computational times which are potentially critical in real-time applications.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor manufacturing fabs recently tend to reduce the lot size, that is, the number of identical wafers in a lot, because of small lot orders and increased die throughput per wafer due to wafer size increase. Therefore, cluster tools for wafer processing, which mostly repeat identical work cycles, are subject to frequent lot changes. We therefore examine scheduling problems for transient periods of single-armed cluster tools that are scheduled to repeat identical work cycles for a number of identical wafers. We first develop a Petri net model for the tool's operational behavior including the initial transient periods as well as the steady cycles. We then develop a mixed integer programming model for finding an optimal schedule. We also examine how to adapt the simple backward sequence, which is mostly used for scheduling steady work cycles of single-armed cluster tools, for a transient period. We identify a deadlock-free condition and also propose two efficient heuristic algorithms by modifying the backward sequence. Finally, through computational experiments, we analyze the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Dual-arm manipulation is an increasingly important skill for robots operating in home, retail and industrial environments. Dual-arm manipulation is especially essential for tasks involving large objects which are harder to grasp and manipulate using a single arm. In this work, we address dual-arm manipulation of objects in indoor environments. We are particularly focused on tasks that involve an upright orientation constraint on the grasped object. Such constraints are often present in human environments, e.g. when manipulating a tray of food or a container with fluids. In this paper, we present a search-based approach that is capable of planning dual-arm motions, often within one second, in cluttered environments while adhering to the orientation constraints. Our approach systematically constructs a graph in task space and generates motions that are consistent across runs with similar start/goal configurations and are low-cost. These motions come with guarantees on completeness and bounds on the suboptimality with respect to the graph that encodes the planning problem. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human interacting with the robot.",

However, in large-scale environments, a task-related object might be out of the robot's reach. Hence, the robot first has to search for the object in its environment before it can perform the task. In this paper, we present a decision-theoretic approach for searching objects in large-scale environments using probabilistic environment models and utilities associated with object locations. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by integrating it into a robot system and by conducting experiments where the robot is supposed to search different objects with various strategies in the context of fetch-and-delivery tasks within a multi-level building.",

We propose a segmentation process to extract all the \u201csimple\u201d objects that builds on the fixation-based segmentation framework [1] that segments a region given a point anywhere inside it. In this work, we augment that framework with a fixation strategy to automatically select points inside the \u201csimple\u201d objects and a post-segmentation process to select only the regions corresponding to the \u201csimple\u201d objects in the scene. A novel characteristic of our approach is the incorporation of border ownership, the knowledge about the object side of a boundary pixel. We evaluate the process on a publicly available RGB-D dataset [2] and find that the proposed method successfully extracts 91.4% of all objects in the dataset.",

        "abstract": "Robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery has proved to provide better outcomes over conventional surgery in terms of improved spatial accuracy and more reliable and repeatable results. We present a novel use of robots in orthopaedic surgery - precise anatomic reduction of joints' fractures. The joints of the body are frequently involved in bone breaks, typically classified as intra-articular fractures. If a joint is to function properly again, that is to provide pain-free stability and movement, the broken pieces of the joint must be subjected to an anatomic reduction - being put back together as perfectly as possible. Having minimally invasive, closed anatomic reduction as a starting point, our method involves a rigorous surgical workflow analysis to create a general framework for robotic reduction techniques. Small and lightweight spatial parallel manipulators are utilized in this pilot study to move fragments through pre-calculated trajectories. In this paper, our initial analysis of clinical and functional requirements of a robot-assisted joint surgery is presented, followed by description of a developed physical robotic system for minimally invasive joint surgery. Experimental results show that a simple graphical user interface is sufficient to obtain the transformation parameters to position fragments in space. The fragment manipulating devices can position and align fragments with an accuracy of \u00b11mm and \u00b15degress.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for estimating the motion of a robotic car from image information, a scenario widely known as visual odometry. Most current monocular visual odometry algorithms rely on a calibrated camera model and recover relative rotation and translation by tracking image features and applying geometrical constraints. This approach has some drawbacks: translation is recovered up to a scale, it requires camera calibration which can be tricky under certain conditions, and uncertainty estimates are not directly obtained. We propose an alternative approach that involves the use of semi-parametric statistical models as means to recover scale, infer camera parameters and provide uncertainty estimates given a training dataset. As opposed to conventional non-parametric machine learning procedures, where standard models for egomotion would be neglected, we present a novel framework in which the existing parametric models and powerful non-parametric Bayesian learning procedures are combined. We devise a multiple output Gaussian Process (GP) procedure, named Coupled GP, that uses a parametric model as the mean function and a non-stationary covariance function to map image features directly into vehicle motion. Additionally, this procedure is also able to infer joint uncertainty estimates (full covariance matrices) for rotation and translation. Experiments performed using data collected from a single camera under challenging conditions show that this technique outperforms traditional methods in trajectories of several kilometers.",

        "abstract": "Learning and then recognizing a route, whether travelled during the day or at night, in clear or inclement weather, and in summer or winter is a challenging task for state of the art algorithms in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we present a new approach to visual navigation under changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single location most likely given a current image, our approach calculates the best candidate matching location within every local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by recognizing coherent sequences of these \u201clocal best matches\u201d. This approach removes the need for global matching performance by the vision front-end - instead it must only pick the best match within any short sequence of images. The approach is applicable over environment changes that render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated traverses through environments during the day and then in the middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100% precision with recall rates of up to 60%.",

These specifications form tubular abstractions of the trajectories of a system in different control modes, and are motivated by the techniques available for certifying the performance of low-level controllers. The notion of controller specification provides a rigorous interface for connecting a planner and lower-level controllers that are designed independently. With this approach, the planning layer does not integrate the closed-loop system dynamics and does not require the knowledge of how the controllers operate, but relies only on the specifications of the output tracking performance achieved by these controllers. The control layer aims at satisfying specifications that account quantitatively for robustness to unmodeled dynamics and various sources of disturbance and sensor noise, so that this robustness does not need to be revalidated at the planning level. As an illustrative example, we describe a randomized planner that composes different controller specifications from a given database to guarantee that any corresponding sequence of control modes steers a robot to a given region while avoiding obstacles.",

In contrast to the original system, which was limited to scenes consisting of geometric primitives, such as spheres, cuboids, and cylinders computed from range data, the extended system is capable of dealing with arbitrarily shaped objects computed from range and intensity images. An object model composed of a triangulated geometry and intensity-based SURF features is introduced. The integration of prior object models into the sequential scene parsing framework is described. The extended system is evaluated with respect to pose estimation and its ability to handle complex scene sequences. It is shown that the new object models enable accurate pose estimation and reliable recognition even in highly cluttered scenes.",

This ability is particularly useful for a recently introduced autonomous intersection management protocol, called AIM, which has been shown to lead to lower delays than traffic signals and stop signs. Specifically, we introduce a setpoint scheduling algorithm for generating setpoints for the PID controllers for the brake and throttle actuators of an autonomous vehicle. The algorithm constructs a feasible setpoint schedule such that the vehicle arrives at the position at the correct time and velocity. Our experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms a heuristic-based setpoint scheduler that does not provide any guarantee about the arrival time and velocity.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous decentralized control is a key concept for the realization of highly adaptive behavior. However, universal design of autonomous decentralized control that ensures rich adaptability is still lacking. In this study, we tackle this problem through the development of a two-dimensional sheet-like robot, SheetBot. The SheetBot is a suitable model system for the establishment of universal design principles for autonomous decentralized control, because it can bend reasonably to the circumstances encountered due to its large surface area, and also because its applications are widely expected. To realize highly adaptive locomotion with SheetBot, we are inspired by the decentralized control scheme of the scaffold-based locomotion of snakes. We extend this design scheme to a two-dimensional bodily structure on the basis of a continuum model. Simulation results show that SheetBot can locomote on various kinds of irregular terrain with minimal control inputs by implementing the proposed autonomous decentralized control scheme.",

        "abstract": "Realtime 3D depth sensor technologies, as manifested in several consumers' electronics products, have potential for a technological breakthrough in various robotic applications. Depth sensing of human body motions can promote intuitive gesture inputs for natural HMI (Human Machine Interface) as well as HRI (Human Robot Interaction) for various applications. In today's industry, the dominant trends in 3D depth sensing are shifting from the traditional laser based scanning or TOF (Time of Flight) depth sensing to the intensity based Infrared 3D depth sensing mechanism. However, the majority of 3D depth sensors does not function properly in a short range due to the limit of shutter speed or light speculation resolution. In this paper, we investigate currently available mono-vision based 3D sensor technologies followed by the results of a novel short range 3D depth sensing technology via multiple intensity differentiation. Our approach is to simultaneously calculate the 3D depth and the surface angle of an object to generate high quality 3D surfaces with an illumination intensity matrix from multiply adjacent light sources.",

        "abstract": "Common visual servoing methods use image features to define a signal error in the feedback loops of robot motion controllers. This paper suggests a new visual servo control scheme that uses an on-line trajectory generator as an intermediate layer between image processing algorithms and robot motion controllers. The motion generation algorithm is capable of computing an entire trajectory from an arbitrary initial state of motion within one servo control cycle (typically one millisecond or less). This algorithm is fed with desired pose and velocity signals that are generated by an image processing algorithm. The advantages of this new architecture are: (a) jerk-limited and continuous motions are guaranteed independently of image processing signals, (b) kinematic motion constraints as well as physical and/or artificial workspace limits can be directly considered, and (c) the system can instantaneously and safely react to sensor failures (e.g., if cameras are covered or image processing fails). Real-world experimental results using a seven-joint robot arm are presented to underline the relevance for the field of robust sensor-guided robot motion control.",

Estimating world motion of snake robots is often difficult because of the complex way a robot's cyclic shape changes (gaits) interact with the surrounding environment. By using the virtual chassis to separate the robot's internal shape changes from its external motions through the world, we are able to construct a motion model based on the differential motion of the robot's modules between time steps. In this way, we effectively treat the snake robot like a wheeled robot where the bottom-most modules propel the robot in much the way the bottom of the wheels would propel the chassis of a car. Experimental results using a 16-DOF snake robot are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for a variety of gaits that have been designed to traverse flat ground.",

It is based on a known hefty cable static modeling which seems to have been overlooked in previous works on parallel cable-driven robots. This cable modeling is obtained from a well-known sagging cable modeling, known as the catenary, by assuming that cable sag is relatively small. The use of the catenary has been shown to lead to a non-linear set of equations describing the kinetostatic behavior of parallel robots driven by cables of non-negligible mass. On the contrary, the proposed simplified static analysis yields a linear relationship between (components of) the forces in the cables and the external wrench applied to the robot mobile platform. As a consequence, by means of the simplified static analysis, useful wrench-based analysis and design techniques devised for parallel robots driven by massless cables can now be extended to cases in which cable mass is to be accounted for.",

Often, such tasks may involve handling of items that can have rather large deflections which are important to take into account when doing offline programming. In this paper such a problem is presented, namely robotic assembly of unique concrete reinforcement structures. Reinforcement bars of 3 meters may deflect up to around 50cm. We illustrate experimentally how the reinforcement bar can be precisely modelled by a structure consisting of rigid parts connected by \u201cdeflection joints\u201d. Such a model can be directly integrated into existing physics simulation engines such as the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE). Finally, we discuss how the simulation will be used for automatic offline programming and present a video with a dynamic simulation of the reinforcement assembly process.",

        "abstract": "In the context of robot grasping and manipulation, realistic simulation requires accurate modeling of contacts between bodies and, in a practical level, accurate simulation of touch sensors. This paper addresses the problem of simulating a tactile sensor considering soft contacts and full friction description. The developed model consists of a surface contact patch described by a mesh of contact elements. For each element, a full friction description is built considering stick-slip phenomena. The developed sensor model is implemented using OpenRAVE and used to perform typical tasks related to tactile sensors. The performance of the simulated sensor is then compared to a real one. It is also demonstrated how it can be integrated on the simulation of a complete robot grasping system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an online scene reconstruction algorithm with monocular camera since there are many advantages on modeling and visualization of an environment with physical scene reconstruction instead of resorting to sparse 3D points. The goal of this algorithm is to simultaneously track the camera position and map the 3D environment, which is close to the spirit of visual SLAM. There're plenty of visual SLAM algorithms in the current literature which can provide a high accuracy performance, but many of them rely on stereo cameras. It's true that we'll face many more challenges to accomplish this task with monocular camera. However, the advantages of cheaper and easier deployable hardware setting have made monocular approach more attractive. Specifically, we apply a maximum a posteriori Bayesian approach with optimization technique to simultaneously track the camera and build a dense point cloud. We also propose a feature expansion method to expand the density of points, and then online reconstruct the scene with a delayed approach. Furthermore, we utilize the reconstructed model to accomplish visual localization task without extracting the features. Finally, a number of experiments have been conducted to validate our proposed approach, and promising performance can be observed.",

We propose a method to simultaneously design the trajectory of the robot and the force/torque profiles of the springs for an optimal compensation of the gravity and inertial forces. First, we express the trajectory and force/torque profiles of the springs as a Hermite interpolation of a finite number of nodes, then we derive a closed-form solution of the optimal spring design as a function of the trajectory. As a consequence, the initial optimization problem is reduced to a trajectory optimization problem, solved with a numeric algorithm. We show an example of optimal design for a 3-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) serial manipulator. Finally, we show that the nonlinear springs calculated for this manipulator can be technically realized by a non-circular cable spool mechanism.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for deformation modeling based on a spring-sphere tree representation of deformable objects and a configuration-based constrained optimization method for determining the 6-dimensional configuration of the graphic tool and the contact force/torque response to the tool. This method conducts collision detection, deformation computation, and tool configuration optimization very efficiently based on the spring-sphere tree model, avoids inter-penetration, and maintains stability of haptic display without using virtual coupling. Experiments on typical dental operations are carried out to validate the efficiency and stability of the proposed method. The update rate of the haptic simulation loop is maintained at \u223c1kHz.",

The sensing information is provided by a force/torque sensor and an artificial finger, which has randomly distributed strain gauges and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone resulting in multidimensional time-series data on the finger-object contact. An incipient slip is detected by studying temporal patterns in the data. The data is analysed using probabilistic clustering that transforms the data into a sequence of symbols, which is used to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) classifier. Experimental results show that the classifier can predict a slip, at least 100ms before a slip takes place, with an accuracy of 96% on the validation set.",

Many research works have been done in order to control this interaction. Nowadays, researches are running in force control for helping surgeons in medical procedures such as motion compensation in beating heart surgeries and tele-operation systems with haptic feedback. The viscoelasticity property of the interaction between organ tissue and robotic instrument further complicates the force control design which is much easier in other applications by assuming the interaction model to be elastic (industry, stiff object manipulation, etc.). In order to increase the performance of a model based force control, this work presents a force control scheme using Active Observer (AOB) based on a viscoelastic interaction model. The control scheme has shown to be stable through theoretical analysis and its performance was evaluated and compared with a control scheme based on a classical elastic model through experiments, showing that a more realistic model can increases the performance of the force control.",

        "abstract": "Successful state-of-the-art object recognition techniques from images have been based on powerful methods, such as sparse representation, in order to replace the also popular vector quantization (VQ) approach. Recently, sparse coding, which is characterized by representing a signal in a sparse space, has raised the bar on several object recognition benchmarks. However, one serious drawback of sparse space based methods is that similar local features can be quantized into different visual words. We present in this paper a new method, called Sparse Spatial Coding (SSC), which combines a sparse coding dictionary learning, a spatial constraint coding stage and an online classification method to improve object recognition. An efficient new off-line classification algorithm is also presented. We overcome the problem of techniques which make use of sparse representation alone by generating the final representation with SSC and max pooling, presented for an online learning classifier. Experimental results obtained on the Caltech 101, Caltech 256, Corel 5000 and Corel 10000 databases, show that, to the best of our knowledge, our approach supersedes in accuracy the best published results to date on the same databases. As an extension, we also show high performance results on the MIT-67 indoor scene recognition dataset.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by an emerging theory of robust low-rank matrix representation, in this paper, we introduce a novel solution for online rigid-body motion registration. The goal is to develop algorithmic techniques that enable a robust, real-time motion registration solution suitable for low-cost, portable 3-D camera devices. Assuming 3-D image features are tracked via a standard tracker, the algorithm first utilizes Robust PCA to initialize a low-rank shape representation of the rigid body. Robust PCA finds the global optimal solution of the initialization, while its complexity is comparable to singular value decomposition. In the online update stage, we propose a more efficient algorithm for sparse subspace projection to sequentially project new feature observations onto the shape subspace. The lightweight update stage guarantees the real-time performance of the solution while maintaining good registration even when the image sequence is contaminated by noise, gross data corruption, outlying features, and missing data. The state-of-the-art accuracy of the solution is validated through extensive simulation and a real-world experiment, while the system enjoys one to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to wellestablished RANSAC solutions.",

        "abstract": "Action classification is an important component of human-computer interaction. Trajectory classification is an effective way of performing action recognition with significant success reported in the literature. We compare two different representation schemes, raw multivariate time-series data and the covariance descriptors of the trajectories, and apply sparse representation techniques for classifying the various actions. The features are sparse coded using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm, and the gestures and actions are classified based on the reconstruction residuals. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on standardized datasets such as the Australian Sign Language (AusLan) and UCF Motion Capture datasets, collected using high-quality motion capture systems, as well as motion capture data obtained from a Microsoft Kinect sensor.",

We developed an adaptive pattern generator model that is composed of a two-factor observation model with a style parameter and phase dynamics with a phase variable. The style parameter controls the spatial patterns of the generated trajectories, and the phase variable controls its temporal profiles. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we applied it to a simulated humanoid model to perform biped walking behaviors coordinated with observed walking patterns and the environment. The robot successfully performed stable biped walking behaviors even when the style of the observed walking pattern and the period were suddenly changed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper two different approaches to guarantee stability of bilateral telemanipulation systems are discussed. Both approaches inject damping into the system to guarantee passivity of the interaction with the device in the presence of time delays in the communication channel. The first approach derives tuning rules for a fixed viscous damper, whereas the second approach employs modulated dampers based upon the measured energy exchange with the device and enforces passivity in the time domain. Furthermore, a theoretical minimum damping injection scheme is sketched that shows that the fixed damping approach is inherently conservative with respect to guaranteeing stability. Experimental results show that both the theoretical minimum damping scheme and a time domain passivity algorithm are successful in stabilizing the telemanipulation system for large time delays with lower gains of the damping elements than derived by the fixed damping injection approach. However, as damping is inherently present in the system, the fixed damping tuning rules can be used to identify if a time domain passivity algorithm is needed given boundary conditions on the actual time delays.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The work presents the standing stabilization of a compliant humanoid robot against external force disturbances and variations of the terrain inclination. The novel contribution is the proposed control scheme which consists of three strategies named compliance control in the transversal plane, body attitude control, and potential energy control, all combined with the intrinsic passive compliance in the robot. The physical compliant elements of the robot are exploited to react at the first instance of the impact while the active compliance control is applied to further absorb the impact and dissipate the elastic energy stored in springs preventing the high rate of spring recoil. The body attitude controller meanwhile regulates the spin angular momentum to provide more agile reactions by changing body inclination. The potential energy control module constrains the robot center of mass (COM) in a virtual slope to convert the excessive kinetic energy into potential energy to prevent falling. Experiments were carried out with the proposed balance stabilization control demonstrating superior balance performance. The compliant humanoid was capable of recovering from external force disturbances and moderate or even abrupt variations of the terrain inclination. Experimental data such as the impulse forces, real COM, center of pressure (COP) and the spring elastic energy are presented and analyzed.",

We focus on one particular gait, continuous-contact brachiation, which always has one handhold in contact with the wall. We use zero-cost, unstable solutions corresponding to horizontal brachiation, originally found by Gomes and Ruina, as templates to generate open-loop stable gaits in arbitrary directions. The first case considered is passive brachiation down a shallow slope, roughly corresponding to upside-down locomotion of the well-studied compass-gait biped. We then consider underactuated brachiation with a constant forcing term at the elbow to produce open-loop stable descending and ascending gaits.",

In detail, we propose a new robotic manipulator that uses stackable 4-BAR mechanisms for mobile manipulation robot. The proposed mechanism provides a clear advantage in which all the actuators can be separated from the working joints. Thus, the mechanism is able to select the Center of Mass (CoM) and the Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) in arbitrary points without any support from ZMP controller or ZMP compensation method. To confirm efficiency of the new manipulator, this paper addresses a design method using the simplified beam theory, based on the well-known Finite Element Method (FEM) for structural stiffness analysis of linkages. The reason behind this is that the CoM and ZMP are dependent on the weight of the motors and the linkages. Ultimately, we show the efficiency of the proposed stackable manipulator through simulations and experiments.",

The algorithm is capable of maintaing accurate state estimates during aggressive flight in unstructured 3D environments without the use of an external positioning system. Our localization algorithm is based on an extension of the Gaussian Particle Filter. We partition the state according to measurement independence relationships and then calculate a pseudo-linear update which allows us to use 20x fewer particles than a naive implementation to achieve similar accuracy in the state estimate. We also propose a multi-step forward fitting method to identify the noise parameters of the IMU and compare results with and without accurate position measurements. Our process and measurement models integrate naturally with an exponential coordinates representation of the attitude uncertainty. We demonstrate our algorithms experimentally on a fixed-wing vehicle flying in a challenging indoor environment.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the multi-robot exploration task of an unknown environment, human operators often need to control the robots remotely and obtain the sensed information by real-time bandwidth-consuming multimedia streams. The task has military and civilian applications, such as reconnaissance, search and rescue missions in earthquake, radioactive, and other dangerous or hostile regions. Due to the nature of such applications, infrastructure networks or pre-deployed relays are often not available to support the stream transmission. To address this issue, we present a novel exploration scheme called Bandwidth-aware Exploration with a Steiner Traveler (BEST). BEST has a heterogeneous robot team with a fixed number of frontier nodes (FNs) to sense the area iteratively. In addition, a relay-deployment node (RDN) tracks the FNs movement and places relays when necessary to support the video/audio streams aggregation to the base station. Therefore, the main problem is to find a minimum path for the relay-deployment robot to travel and the positions to deploy necessary relays to support the stream aggregation in each movement iteration. This problem inherits characteristics of both the Steiner minimum tree and traveling salesman problems. We model the novel problem as the minimum velocity Flow constrained Steiner Traveler problem (FST). Extensive simulations show BEST improves exploration efficiency by 62% on average compared to the state-of-the-art homogeneous robot exploration strategies. BEST also saves cost by using only half the number of robots compared to the counterpart, while still achieving a 24% exploration time reduction.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a quasi-static step climbing behaviour for a minimal sensing wheel-legged quadruped robot called PAW. In the quasi-static climbing maneuver, the robot benefits from wheel traction and uses its legs to reconfigure itself with respect to the step during the climb. The control methodology with the corresponding controller parameters is determined and the state machine for the maneuver is developed. With this controller, PAW is able to climb steps higher than its body clearance. Furthermore, any step height up to this maximum achievable height can be negotiated autonomously with a single set of controller parameters, without knowledge of the step height or distance to the step.",

We suggest a distributed method to find paths for multiple agents by introducing a probabilistic path choice achieving global goals such as the social optimum. This approach, which shows that the global goals can be achieved by local processing using only local information, can be parallelized and sped-up using massive parallel processing. The probabilistic assignment reliably copes with the case of random choices of unidentified agents or random route changes of agents who ignore our path guidance. We provide the analytical result on convergence and running time. We demonstrate and evaluate our algorithm by an implementation using asynchronous computation on multi-core computers.",

Though much research has been done in stochastic shortest path algorithms, the existing algorithms focus on the single-origin single-destination problem for one agent. This paper formulates a general framework for the stochastic shortest path problem with visit node constraints designed to achieve a specific goal with multiple agents, multiple resources, and multiple destinations. The constraints are defined by a set of sequences of nodes to be visited. Given predetermined constraints, our motion planning problem consists of finding the best agents, resources, and destinations, and the path through a sequence of nodes representing them. The technique in this paper solves the problem at the same level of complexity as solving the single-origin single-destination problem by parallelization. We demonstrate the algorithm by a Web-based traffic navigation guide system and evaluate the algorithm's performance.",

Instead of minimizing the expectation of a cost functional while ensuring satisfaction of probabilistic state constraints, we propose a two-stage solution where the path that minimizes the cost functional is planned deterministically, and a local stochastic optimal controller with exit constraints ensures satisfaction of probabilistic state constraints while following the planned path. This control design strategy ensures boundedness of errors around the reference path and collision-free convergence to the goal with probability one under the assumption of unbounded inputs. We show that explicit expressions for the control law are possible for certain cases. We provide simulation results for a point robot moving in a constrained two-dimensional environment under Brownian noise. The method can be extended to systems with bounded inputs, if a small nonzero probability of failure can be accepted.",

This paper proposes a strategy for source seeking in a noisy signal field using a mobile robot and based on a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Our scheme does not require a prior map of the environment or a model of the signal field and is simple enough to be implemented on platforms with limited computational power. We discuss the asymptotic convergence guarantees of algorithm and give specific guidelines for its application to mobile robots in unknown indoor environments with obstacles. Both simulations and real-world experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results suggest that the algorithm has good finite time performance in complex environments.",

In this research we propose epoxy resin as photoelastic material for vasculature modeling as it has a larger photoelastic coefficient than previously studied materials and it has a young modulus similar to human vasculature. A model of a saccular aneurysm with bleb was built with the purpose of measuring stress overshoots that enable to differentiate embolization techniques according to the respect for tissue integrity. During embolization using a coil with smaller size than the aneurysm dome diameter, an average area of 0.72 mm2 with stress above 90 kPa was measured. This area increased to 0.77 mm2 when the dome was touched with the release mechanism of the coil, and to 0.74 mm2 for embolization with larger size coil. The presented modeling material and measurement technique is useful for tissue respect quantification for micro-mechanisms evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Detecting objects in shadows is a challenging task in computer vision. For example, in clear path detection application, strong shadows on the road confound the detection of the boundary between clear path and obstacles, making clear path detection algorithms less robust. Shadow removal, relies on the classification of edges as shadow edges or non-shadow edges. We present an algorithm to detect strong shadow edges, which enables us to remove shadows. By analyzing the patch-based characteristics of shadow edges and non-shadow edges (e.g., object edges), the proposed detector can discriminate strong shadow edges from other edges in images by learning the distinguishing characteristics. In addition, spatial smoothing is used to further improve shadow edge detection. Numerical experiments show convincing results that shadows on the road are either removed or attenuated with few visual artifacts, which benefits the clear path detection. In addition, we show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms in different conditions.",

In this paper, we discuss the long-standing exploration-exploration dilemma in context of designing a learning controller for stunt-style driving with scarce samples. By making an efficient use of a single demonstration by an expert, our algorithm leverages our intuitive understanding of driving to extract a coarse dynamics model from the collected driving data, then formulate the policy search in a setting of gradient update with a specially designed cost function. Both theoretical and empirical results are detailed and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Super resolution (SR) image reconstruction is used to obtain a high resolution (HR) image from multiple low resolution (LR) images. In this paper, we propose a new method to solve the SR reconstruction problem. The LR images are modeled as downsampled images of the original scene shifted by sub-pixel distances. In addition, we model the downsampling process as averaging light intensity on the corresponding pixel area. Based on this downsampling model, the average of multiple LR images with appropriate registration can be thought of as a blurred version of the HR image. After the point spread function (PSF) for this blur is identified, the HR image is obtained by regularized deconvolution method. The regularization factor can be determined by line search of a cost function. Two distinct cases are considered: (1) only translational motion among LR images is assumed, (2) both translational and rotational motions among LR images are considered. For the second case, the rigid body group representation is used.",

        "abstract": "The ability to perceive possible interactions with the environment is a key capability of task-guided robotic agents. An important subset of possible interactions depends solely on the objects of interest and their position and orientation in the scene. We call these object-based interactions 0-order affordances and divide them among non-hidden and hidden whether the current configuration of an object in the scene renders its affordance directly usable or not. Conversely to other works, we propose that detecting affordances that are not directly perceivable increase the usefulness of robotic agents with manipulation capabilities, so that by appropriate manipulation they can modify the object configuration until the seeked affordance becomes available. In this paper we show how 0-order affordances depending on the geometry of the objects and their pose can be learned using a supervised learning strategy on 3D mesh representations of the objects allowing the use of the whole object geometry. Moreover, we show how the learned affordances can be detected in real scenes obtained with a low-cost depth sensor like the Microsoft Kinect through object recognition and 6D0F pose estimation and present results for both learning on meshes and detection on real scenes to demonstrate the practical application of the presented approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a feedback controller that allows MABEL, a kneed, planar bipedal robot, with 1 m-long legs, to accommodate an abrupt 20 cm decrease in ground height. The robot is provided information on neither where the step down occurs, nor by how much. After the robot has stepped off a raised platform, however, the height of the platform can be estimated from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot's joints. A real-time control strategy is implemented that uses this on-line estimate of step-down height to switch from a baseline controller, that is designed for flat-ground walking, to a second controller, that is designed to attenuate torso oscillation resulting from the step-down disturbance. After one step, the baseline controller is re-applied. The control strategy is developed on a simplified-design model of the robot and then verified on a more realistic model before being evaluated experimentally. The paper concludes with experimental results showing MABEL (blindly) stepping off a 20 cm high platform.",

It has a novel gripper consisting of two parallel wheels that can grip continuously and stably on various kinds of clothes. Clothbot also has an omni-directional tail of two DOFs so that it can change its center of gravity to control the moving direction on complex and undeterminate clothes. Consequently, Clothbot is able to access most positions of the clothes by moving straight and turning around with only four motors. It is compact, small and light-weighted but has a load capacity six times its own weight. A series of experiments validate its high performance on flexible clothes.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for controlling a neuroprosthesis for a paralyzed human arm using functional electrical stimulation (FES). The subject has surgically implanted electrodes for stimulating muscles in her shoulder and arm. Using input/output data, a model is identified that describes the mapping from muscle stimulations to the endpoint force measured at the subject's hand. To compute the muscle stimulations given a target endpoint force the model is inverted. Because the system is redundant, we compute the inverse by minimizing muscle activations and use this inverse for feedforward control. This is the first published demonstration with a human subject with a high spinal cord injury of an FES controller that treats the arm with shoulder and elbow as a multiple-input multiple-output system and can achieve arbitrary goals.",

We present the first results in grid based simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) with biomimetic whisker sensors, and show how multi-whisker features coupled with priors about straight edges in the world can boost its performance. Our results are from a simple, small environment but are intended as a first baseline to measure future algorithms against.",

        "abstract": "This paper extends the novel research for event localization and target-directed navigation using a deployed wireless sensor network (WSN) [4]. The goal is to have an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) navigate to a target-location by: (i) producing an artificial magnitude distribution within the WSN-covered region, and (ii) having the AMR use the pseudo-gradient from the interpolated distribution in its neighborhood, as it moves towards the target location. Implicit surfaces are used to interpolate the artificial distribution. This scheme only uses the topology of the WSN and received signal strength (RSS) to estimate an efficient navigation path for the AMR. Here, the AMR does not require global coordinates for the region, as it relies on local, neighborhood information alone to navigate. The performance of the scheme is analyzed with hardware experiments and in simulation, using a variety of node-densities and with increasing levels of noise to ensure robustness.",

        "abstract": "In our prior work, we proposed the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture with a measure of information quality to reason about forming coalitions in multirobot tasks. The formed coalitions are guaranteed to be executable, given the current configurations of the robots and environment. A cost and a quality measure are associated with each coalition to further determine its utility for the task. In this paper, we show that IQ-ASyMTRe-like architectures can be utilized to significantly reduce the overall complexity of task allocation by considering only executable coalitions. For implementation, we apply a layering technique such that most existing methods for task allocation can be easily incorporated. Furthermore, we introduce a general process to address situations in which no executable coalitions are available for certain tasks, and integrate it with IQ-ASyMTRe to achieve more autonomy. Such an approach is able to autonomously decompose unsatisfied preconditions of the required task behaviors into satisfiable components, in order to generate partial order plans for them accordingly. We show how this process can be implemented using a market-based approach. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate these techniques.",

We present an approach utilizing the physical interaction capabilities of compliant robots with data-driven and model-free learning in a coherent system in order to make fast reconfiguration of redundant robots feasible. Users with no particular robotics knowledge can perform this task in physical interaction with the compliant robot, for example to reconfigure a work cell due to changes in the environment. For fast and efficient learning of the respective null-space constraints, a reservoir neural network is employed. It is embedded in the motion controller of the system, hence allowing for execution of arbitrary motions in task space. We describe the training, exploration and the control architecture of the systems as well as present an evaluation on the KUKA Light-Weight Robot. Our results show that the learned model solves the redundancy resolution problem under the given constraints with sufficient accuracy and generalizes to generate valid joint-space trajectories even in untrained areas of the workspace.",

        "abstract": "This work presents the novel concept of Tele-Impedance as a method for controlling/teleoperating a robotic arm while performing tasks which require significant dynamics variation. As an alternative method to bilateral force-reflecting teleoperation control approach, which uses a position/velocity command combined with force feedback from the robot side, Tele-Impedance enriches the command sent to the slave robot by combining the position reference with a stiffness (or full impedance) reference estimated from the arm of the human operator. We propose a new method to estimate the stiffness of the human arm based on the agonist-antagonist muscular co activations. The concept of the Tele-Impedance is demonstrated using the KUKA light weight robotic arm as the slave manipulator in a ball reception experiment. The performance of Tele-Impedance control method is assessed by comparing the results obtained while receiving the ball, with the slave arm under i) constant low stiffness, ii) constant high stiffness or iii) under Tele-Impedance control. Performance indexes are defined and used for the comparative study of the ball reception performances under the different endpoint elastic profiles. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the task-related Tele-Impedance control method and highlight its potential use to execute tasks which require significant dynamics variation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The ability to grasp unknown objects is an important skill for personal robots, which has been addressed by many present and past research projects, but still remains an open problem. A crucial aspect of grasping is choosing an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e. the 6d pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. Finding feasible grasp configurations for novel objects, however, is challenging because of the huge variety in shape and size of these objects. Moreover, possible configurations also depend on the specific kinematics of the robotic arm and hand in use. In this paper, we introduce a new grasp selection algorithm able to find object grasp poses based on previously demonstrated grasps. Assuming that objects with similar shapes can be grasped in a similar way, we associate to each demonstrated grasp a grasp template. The template is a local shape descriptor for a possible grasp pose and is constructed using 3d information from depth sensors. For each new object to grasp, the algorithm then finds the best grasp candidate in the library of templates. The grasp selection is also able to improve over time using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates. We tested the algorithm on two different platforms, the Willow Garage PR2 and the Barrett WAM arm which have very different hands. Our results show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does indeed improve its performance over time.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of deploying a robot from a specification given as a temporal logic statement about some properties satisfied by the regions of a large, partitioned environment. We assume that the robot has noisy sensors and actuators and model its motion through the regions of the environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The robot control problem becomes finding the control policy maximizing the probability of satisfying the temporal logic task on the MDP. For a large environment, obtaining transition probabilities for each state-action pair, as well as solving the necessary optimization problem for the optimal policy are usually not computationally feasible. To address these issues, we propose an approximate dynamic programming framework based on a least-square temporal difference learning method of the actor-critic type. This framework operates on sample paths of the robot and optimizes a randomized control policy with respect to a small set of parameters. The transition probabilities are obtained only when needed. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations confirm that convergence of the parameters translates to an approximately optimal policy.",

This method is based on sampling variations in control, executing them in the real world, and minimizing a cost function on the resulting performance. Iteratively improving the control policy based on real-world performance requires no direct modeling of tendon network nonlinearities and contact transitions, allowing improved task performance.",

        "abstract": "While robotic hands have been developed for manipulation and grasping, their potential as tools for performance evaluation of engineered products - particularly compliant garments that are not easily modeled - has not been broadly studied. In this research, the development of a low-cost anthropomorphic robotic hand is introduced that is designed to characterize glove stiffness in a pressurized environment. The anthropomorphic robotic hand was designed to mimic a human hand in a neutral posture corresponding to the naturally relaxed position in zero gravity, and includes the transverse arch, longitudinal arch, and oblique flexion of the rays. The resulting model also allows for realistic donning and doffing of the prototype spacesuit glove, its pressurization, and torque testing of individual joints. Solid models and 3D printing enabled the rapid design iterations necessary to successfully work with the compliant pressure garment. The performance of the robotic hand is experimentally demonstrated with a spacesuit glove for different levels of pressures, and a unique data processing method is used to calculate the required actuator torque at each finger's knuckle joint. The reliable measurement method confirmed that glove finger torque increases as the internal pressure increases. The proposed robotic design and method provide an objective and systematic way of evaluating the performance of compliant gloves.",

An operator can communicate with remote people through the robot. The robot acts as an avatar of the operator. To date, four prototypes of the wearable telecommunicator T1, T2, T3 and MH-1, have been developed as research platforms. MH-1 is also a miniature humanoid robot with 11-DOF for mutual telexistence. Although human-like appearance might be important for such communication systems, it is unable to achieve sophisticated gestures due to the lack of both wrist and body motions. In this paper, to tackle this problem, a 3-DOF parallel wire mechanism with novel wire arrangement for the wrist is introduced, while 3-DOF body motions are also adopted. Consequently, a 20-DOF miniature humanoid with dual 7-DOF arms has been designed and developed. Details of the concept and design are discussed, while fundamental experiments with a developed 7-DOF arm are also executed to confirm the mechanical properties.",

This mechatronic device is more dexterous and has improved force control and sensing giving it the capability to grasp and actuate a wider range of tools. It can achieve higher peak forces at higher speeds than the original. Developed as part of a partnership between General Motors and NASA, the hand is designed to more closely approximate a human hand. Having a more anthropomorphic design allows the hand to attain a larger set of useful grasps for working with human interfaces. Key to the hand's improved performance is the use of lower friction drive elements and a redistribution of components from the hand to the forearm, permitting more sensing in the fingers and palm where it is most important. The following describes the design, mechanical/electrical integration, and control features of the hand. Lessons learned during the development and initial operations along with planned refinements to make it more effective are presented.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based solutions to the motion planning problem, such as the probabilistic roadmap method (PRM), have become commonplace in robotics applications. These solutions are the norm as the dimensionality of the planning space grows, i.e., d >; 5. An important primitive of these methods is the local planner, which is used for validation of simple paths between two configurations. The most common is the straight-line local planner which interpolates along the straight line between the two configurations. In this paper, we introduce a new local planner, Toggle Local Planner (Toggle LP), which extends local planning to a two-dimensional subspace of the overall planning space. If no path exists between the two configurations in the subspace, then Toggle LP is guaranteed to correctly return false. Intuitively, more connections could be found by Toggle LP than by the straight-line planner, resulting in better connected roadmaps. As shown in our results, this is the case, and additionally, the extra cost, in terms of time or storage, for Toggle LP is minimal. Additionally, our experimental analysis of the planner shows the benefit for a wide array of robots, with DOF as high as 70.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Advanced grasp control algorithms could benefit greatly from accurate tracking of the object as well as an accurate all-around knowledge of the system when the robot attempts a grasp. This motivates our study of the G-SL(AM)2 problem, in which two goals are simultaneously pursued: object tracking relative to the hand and estimation of parameters of the dynamic model. We view the G-SL(AM)2 problem as a filtering problem. Because of stick-slip friction and collisions between the object and hand, suitable dynamic models exhibit strong nonlinearities and jump discontinuities. This fact makes Kalman filters (which assume linearity) and extended Kalman filters (which assume differentiability) inapplicable, and leads us to develop a particle filter. An important practical problem that arises during grasping is occlusion of the view of the object by the robot's hand. To combat the resulting loss of visual tracking fidelity, we designed a particle filter that incorporates tactile sensor data. The filter is evaluated off-line with data gathered in advance from grasp acquisition experiments conducted with a planar test rig. The results show that our particle filter performs quite well, especially during periods of visual occlusion, in which it is much better than the same filter without tactile data.",

        "abstract": "An analysis of stability and transparency of a force feedback teleoperation system for cutting-edge robotic surgery is presented. Previous works in teleoperated robotic surgery do not consider the real behavior of the environment, which was supposed to be only elastic. However, new surgical procedures in which the environment dynamics plays a crucial role start emerging as a result of technological progress. In robotic assisted beating-heart surgery, for instance, the dynamics of the contact between surgical tools and soft tissues has an impact not only in the performance of the force control task but also in the performance of the teleoperation control scheme in terms of transparency and stability. Therefore, a more realistic description of the environment has to be adopted in order to safely operate during robot-patient interaction. For this purpose, a viscoelastic contact model is introduced into the bilateral teleoperation scheme, and a performance study is provided. The obtained results show the advantages of the selected approach when targeting teleoperated surgical interventions in which the interaction dynamics has become a significant issue.",

We present our multi-pronged strategy for object recognition and localization based on the integrated geometric and visual information available from the Kinect sensor. Firstly, the range image is over-segmented using an edge-detection algorithm and regions of interest are extracted based on a simple shape-analysis per segment. Then, these selected regions of the scene are matched with known objects using visual features and their distribution in 3D space. Finally, generated hypotheses about the positions of the objects are tested by back-projecting learned 3D models to the scene using estimated transformations and sensor model. Our method won the second place among eight competing algorithms, only marginally losing to the winner.",

The redundancy allows one to increase the workspace size. But we show, both theoretically and experimentally that if the wires are not elastic, then the redundancy cannot be used to control the wire tensions. Indeed we show that whatever are the number of wires there will always be only at most 3 wires in tension, while the other N - 3 wires will be slack. We then show that if the wires are elastic, then the platform positioning will be very sensitive to stiffness identification and wire lengths control. Hence classical redundant control schemes are difficult to use for such robot and alternate use of the geometry of redundant wires have to be considered.",

        "abstract": "In most practical implementations of the Gough-Stewart platform, the octahedral form is either taken as it stands or is approximated. The kinematics of this particular instance of the Gough-Stewart platform, commonly known as the octahedral manipulator, has been thoughtfully studied. It is well-known, for example, that its forward kinematics can be solved by computing the roots of an octic polynomial and its singularities have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of the intersection of four planes in a single point. In this paper, using a distance-based formulation, it is shown how these properties can be derived without relying neither on variable eliminations nor trigonometric substitutions. Moreover, thanks to this formulation, a family of platforms kinematically equivalent to the octahedral manipulator is obtained. Herein, two Gough-Stewart parallel platforms are said to be kinematically equivalent if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their squared leg lengths for the same configuration of their moving platforms with respect to their bases. If this condition is satisfied, it can be shown that both platforms have the same assembly modes and their singularities, in the configuration space of the moving platform, are located in the same place.",

In manufacturing environments, optimal solution may not be applicable due to uncertainty and variation in system parameters. Therefore, in this paper, in addition to comparing the system throughput under different policies, we introduce the notion of robustness of scheduling policies. Specifically, a policy that can deliver good and stable performance resilient to variations in system parameters (such as buffer sizes, processing rates, setup times, etc.) is viewed as a \u201crobust\u201d policy. Numerical studies indicate that the cyclic and longest queue policies exhibit robustness in subject to parameter changes. This can provide production engineers a guideline in operation management.",

The problem is assigning a speed profile to each aerial vehicle in real time such that the separation between them is greater than a minimum safety value and the total deviation from the initial planned trajectories is minimized. Also, the arrival time of each aerial vehicle at the end waypoint of the trajectory is taken into account to solve the conflicts. The proposed method involves the use of appropriate airspace discretization. The method consists of two steps: a search tree step, which finds if it exists a solution; and an optimization step by solving a QP-problem, which minimizes a cost function. The paper also presents simulations for several scenarios and experiments that have been carried out in the multivehicle aerial testbed of the Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies (CATEC).",

As the other designs in this class of actuation systems, the vsaUT-II is characterized by the property that the output stiffness can be changed independently of the output position. It consists of two internal elastic elements and two internal actuated degrees of freedom. The mechanical design of the vsaUT-II is such that the apparent output stiffness can be varied by changing the transmission ratio between the elastic elements and the output. This kinematic structure guarantees that the output stiffness can be changed without changing the potential energy stored internally in the elastic elements. This property is validated in simulations with the port-based model of the system and in experiments, through a proper control law design, on the prototype.",

Since the magnetic fields exerted by electromagnets are relatively uniform in the working space, the magnetite exerts only torque, without translational force, which enabled us to guide the cell's swimming direction while the swimming force is exerted only by the cell's motile organelles. A stronger magnetic force was necessary to steer cells to the z-axis, and, as a result, a single electromagnet placed just below our sample area is utilized for vertical motion. To track the cell's positions in the z-axis, intensity profiles of non-motile cells at varying distances from the focal plane are used. During vertical motion along the z-axis, the intensity difference from the background decreases while the cell size increases. Since the cell is pear-shaped, the eccentricity is high during planar motion, but lowers during vertical motion due to the change in orientation. The three-dimensional control of the live organism T. pyriformis as a cellular robot shows great potential to be utilized for practical applications in microscale tasks, such as target transport and cell therapy.",

Superficial palpation and deep palpation pseudo-haptic simulation methods are presented. Although without expensive haptic interfaces users receive only visual feedback (pseudo-haptics) when maneuvering a cursor over the surface of a virtual soft-tissue organ by means of an input device such as a mouse, a joystick, or a touch-sensitive tablet, the alterations to the cursor behavior induced by the method creates the experience of actual interaction with a tumor in the users' minds. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated for tissue abnormality identification. It is shown that users can recognize tumors with these two methods and the rate of correctly recognized tumors in deep palpation pseudo-haptic simulation is higher than superficial palpation simulation.",

Here, we present a new time-varying model for the torsional dynamics of a steerable needle, along with a new controller that takes advantage of the model. The torsional model incorporates time-varying mode shapes to capture the changing boundary conditions caused during insertion of the needle into the tissue. Extensive simulations demonstrate the improvement over a model that neglects torsional dynamics and illustrates the possible effect of torsional model order on efficacy. Pilot feedback control experiments, conducted in artificial tissue (plastisol) under stereo image guidance, validate the overall approach: our results substantially out-perform previously reported experimental results on controlling tip-steerable needles.",

We consider the most common robot gripper: a pair of thin parallel jaws, and a class of objects that can be modeled as extruded polygons. We model a conservative class of push-grasps that can enhance object alignment. The grasp planning algorithm takes as input an approximate object outline and Gaussian uncertainty around each vertex and center of mass. We define a grasp quality metric based on a lower bound on the probability of achieving force closure. We present a highly-parallelizable algorithm to compute this metric using Monte Carlo sampling. The algorithm uses Coulomb frictional grasp mechanics and a fast geometric test for conservative conditions for force closure. We run the algorithm on a set of sample shapes and compare the grasps with those from a planner that does not model shape uncertainty. We report computation times with single and multi-core computers and sensitivity analysis on algorithm parameters. We also describe physical grasp experiments using the Willow Garage PR2 robot.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Navigation (MRN) relies on Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs) embedded in microcarriers or microrobots to allow the induction of a directional propelling force by 3-D magnetic gradients. These magnetic gradients are superposed on a sufficiently high homogeneous magnetic field (e.g. the Bo field of a MR scanner) to achieve maximum propelling force through magnetization saturation of the MNPs. As previously demonstrated by our group, such technique was successful at maintaining microcarriers along a planned trajectory in the blood vessels based on tracking information gathered using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences from artifacts caused by the same MNPs. Besides propulsion and tracking, the same MNPs can be synthesized with characteristics that can allow for the diffusion of therapeutic cargo carried by these MR-navigable carriers through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) using localized hyperthermia without compromising the MRN capabilities. In the present study, localized hyperthermia induced by an alternating magnetic field (AC field) is investigated for the purpose of transient controlled disruption of the BBB and hence local delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain. Here, an external heating apparatus was used to impose a regional heat shock on the skull of a living mouse model. The effect of heat on the permeability of the BBB was assessed using histological observation and tissue staining by Evans blue dye. Results show direct correlation between hyperthermia and BBB leakage as well as its recovery from thermal damage. Therefore, in addition to on-command propulsion and remote tracking, the proposed navigable agents could be suitable for controlled opening of the BBB by hyperthermia and selective brain drug delivery.",

Such reasoning is only possible when the robot has knowledge of how the World functions, which must either be learned or hard-coded. In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits language as an important resource of high-level knowledge that a robot can use, akin to IBM's Watson in Jeopardy!. In particular, we show how language can be leveraged to reduce the ambiguity that arises from recognizing actions involving hand-tools from video data. Starting from the premise that tools and actions are intrinsically linked, with one explaining the existence of the other, we trained a language model over a large corpus of English newswire text so that we can extract this relationship directly. This model is then used as a prior to select the best tool and action that explains the video. We formalize the approach in the context of 1) an unsupervised recognition and 2) a supervised classification scenario by an EM formulation for the former and integrating language features for the latter. Results are validated over a new hand-tool action dataset, and comparisons with state of the art STIP features showed significantly improved results when language is used. In addition, we discuss the implications of these results and how it provides a framework for integrating language into vision on other robotic applications.",

We present the design of an improved screw-spline drive mechanism based on a profiled threaded shaft and nut that reduces the part count and simplifies manufacturing and assembly. To determine the optimal parameters for the profile shape, an analytical expression was derived that relates the tolerance between the nut and shaft to the angular backlash, which was validated using SolidWorks. We outline the forward kinematics of a steering mechanism that is based on the concept of substantially straightening a pre-curved Nitinol stylet by retracting it into a concentric outer cannula, and re-deploying it at a different position. This model was compared to data collected during targeting experiments performed in ex-vivo tissue samples where the distal tip of the stylet was repositioned in ex-vivo bovine tissue and the location of its distal tip was recorded with CT imaging. Results demonstrated that the drive mechanism operated robustly and targeting errors of less than 2mm were achieved.",

        "abstract": "Underactuated compliant robotic hands exploit passive mechanics and joint coupling to reduce the number of actuators required to achieve grasp robustness in unstructured environments. Reduced actuation requirements generally serve to decrease design cost and improve grasp planning efficiency, but overzealous simplification of an actuation topology, coupled with insufficient tuning of mechanical compliance and hand kinematics, can adversely affect grasp quality and adaptability. This paper presents a computational framework for reducing the mechanical complexity of robotic hand actuation topologies without significantly decreasing grasp robustness. Open-source grasp planning software and well-established grasp quality metrics are used to simulate a fully-actuated, 24 DOF anthropomorphic robotic hand grasping a set of daily living objects. DOFs are systematically demoted or removed from the hand actuation topology according to their contribution to grasp quality. The resulting actuation topology contained 22% fewer DOFs, 51% less aggregate joint motion, and required 82% less grasp planning time than the fully-actuated design, but decreased average grasp quality by only 11%.",

        "abstract": "Several percutaneous needle-based and intravascular procedures require guidance of the diagnostic or therapeutic tool to the target location by maneuvering the needle or catheter to correct for the error in reaching the target location. Hence, in this paper we present our work towards developing a discretely actuated steerable needle/cannula with multiple degrees-of-freedom to `steer' the cannula by discrete actuation along the cannula length. We are interested in using the cannula to introduce both diagnostic and therapeutic tools, which may otherwise be difficult to deliver to the appropriate location. We use two antagonistic SMA wires as actuators to generate the required bending forces at each joint. SMA wires were annealed through a customized training process to an arc shape and mounted in the machined grooves on the outer surface of the cannula to generate local bending upon thermal actuation. We propose to use temperature feedback to control the position of the SMA actuators. To use temperature feedback as the feedback signal for enabling individual joint actuation, we had to fully characterize the SMA actuator. Classical uniaxial testing devices and experimental setup used in characterizing straight annealed SMA wires are not applicable in this work since the SMA wire is annealed in an arbitrary shape. Hence, we also present an experimental setup and a procedure for characterizing an SMA actuator that transforms into an arc shape upon thermal actuation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current state of the art solutions of the SLAM problem are based on efficient sparse optimization techniques and represent the problem as probabilistic constraint graphs. For example in pose graphs the nodes represent poses and the edges between them express spatial information (e.g. obtained from odometry) and information on loop closures. The task of constructing the graph is delegated to a front-end that has access to the available sensor information. The optimizer, the so called back-end of the system, relies heavily on the topological correctness of the graph structure and is not robust against misplaced constraint edges. Especially edges representing false positive loop closures will lead to the divergence of current solvers. We propose a novel formulation that allows the back-end to change parts of the topological structure of the graph during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby discard loop closures and converge towards correct solutions even in the presence of false positive loop closures. This largely increases the overall robustness of the SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers. We demonstrate the approach and present results both on large scale synthetic and real-world datasets.",

Current approaches to gait planning and control are slow, lack formal guarantees on correctness, and are generally not reactive to changes in object geometry. To address these issues, we apply advances in formal methods to model a gait subject to external perturbations as a two-player game between a finger controller and its adversarial environment. High-level specifications are expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and low-level control primitives are designed for continuous kinematics. Simulations of planar manipulation with our synthesized correct-by-construction gait controller demonstrate the benefits of this approach.",

Given a set of waypoints that define a planned path and a dicretization of the ocean currents from a regional ocean model, we present an approach to determine the time interval at which the glider should surface to maintain a prescribed tracking error, while also limiting its time on the ocean surface. We assume practical mission parameters provided from previous field trials for the problem set up, and provide the simulated results of the Kalman filter mission planning approach. The results are initially compared to data from prior field experiments in which an autonomous glider executed the same path without pre-planning. Then, the results are validated through field trials with multiple autonomous gliders implementing different surfacing intervals simultaneously while following the same path.",

        "abstract": "An exciting recent development is the definition of sampling-based motion planners which guarantee asymptotic optimality. Nevertheless, roadmaps with this property may grow too large and lead to longer query resolution times. If optimality requirements are relaxed, existing asymptotically near-optimal solutions produce sparser graphs by removing redundant edges. Even these alternatives, however, include all sampled configurations as nodes in the roadmap. This work proposes a method, which can reject redundant samples but does provide asymptotic coverage and connectivity guarantees, while keeping local path costs low. Not adding every sample can significantly reduce the size of the final roadmap. An additional advantage is that it is possible to define a reasonable stopping criterion for the approach inspired by previous methods. To achieve these objectives, the proposed method maintains a dense graph that is used for evaluating the performance of the roadmap with regards to local path costs. Experimental results show that the method indeed provides small roadmaps, allowing for shorter query resolution times. Furthermore, smoothing the final paths results in an even more advantageous comparison against alternatives with regards to path quality.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and development of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible tendon-driven robot to overcome the limitations of our previous minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranaial robot (MINIR). In this prototype, the robot is made of plastic and the MRI-compatible shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are placed away from the robot. The robot has four revolute joints which are placed orthogonally to have out-of-plane motion capability. Each joint is connected to a pair of antagonistic SMA spring actuators through the tendon-sheath mechanism. Each SMA spring actuator can be controlled independently to actuate the corresponding joint. A theoretical model and experimental setup have been developed to evaluate the recovery force of the SMA spring at different displacement and temperatures. The experimental results closely match the theoretical model and it shows significant promise for future development in this area. A series of MRI compatibility tests have also been performed to evaluate the MRI compatibility of the device and to assess the degradation in image quality, if any, during actuation. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the robot is MRI-compatible and it creates no significant distortion in the MR images during actuation.",

        "abstract": "Presented is a method for estimating the 2D planar position, velocity, and orientation states of a tagged shark. The method is designed for implementation on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with a stereo-hydrophone and receiver system that detects acoustic signals transmitted by a tag. The particular hydrophone system used here provides a measurement of relative bearing angle to the tag, but does not provide the sign (+ or -) of the bearing angle. A Particle Filter was used for fusing these measurements over time to produce a state estimate of the tag location. The Particle Filter combined with an active control system allowed the system to overcome the ambiguity in the sign of the bearing angle. This state estimator was validated by tracking both a stationary tag and moving tag with known positions. These experiments revealed state estimate errors were on par with those obtained by manually driven boat based tracking systems, the current method used for tracking fish and sharks over long distances. Final experiments involved the catching, releasing, and an autonomous AUV tracking of a 1 meter Leopard Shark (Triakis semifasciata) in SeaPlane Lagoon, Los Angeles, California.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of agile swing-free trajectory tracking of a quadrotor with a suspended load. This problem has great practical significance in many UAV applications. However, it has received little attention in the literature so far. Flying with a suspended load can be a very challenging and sometimes hazardous task as the suspended load significantly alters the flight characteristics of the quadrotor. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a technique based on dynamic programming which ensures swing-free trajectory tracking. We start by presenting the mathematical model of a quadrotor with suspended load dynamics and kinematics. A high-level planner is used to provide desired waypoints, and then a dynamic programming approach is used to generate the swing-free trajectory for the quadrotor carrying a suspended load. Effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "The underactuated system under consideration is a magnetically-suspended, differential drive robot utilizing a winch system to articulate a suspended mass. A dynamic model of the system is first constructed, and then a nonlinear, infinite-dimensional optimization algorithm is presented. The system model uses the principles of kinematic reduction to produce a mixed kinematic-dynamic model that isolates the modeling of the system actuators from the modeling of the rest of the system. In this framework, the inputs become generalized velocities instead of generalized forces facilitating real-world implementation with an embedded system. The optimization algorithm automatically deals with the complexities introduced by the nonlinear dynamics and underactuation to synthesize dynamically feasible system trajectories for a wide array of trajectory generation problems. Applying this algorithm to the mixed kinematic-dynamic model, several example problems are solved and the results are tested experimentally. The experimental results agree quite well with the theoretical showing promise in extending the capabilities of the system to utilize more advanced feedback techniques and to handle more complex, three-dimensional problems.",

These observations come from crossing binary detection beams. A binary detection beam is a sensing abstraction arising from physical sensor beams or virtual beams that are derived from several sensing modalities, such as actual detection beams in the environment, changes in the angular order of landmarks around the robot, or recognizable markings in the plane. We solve the filtering problem from a geometric perspective and present its relation to linear recursive filters in control theory. Subsequently, we develop the acceleration control of the robot to track a given input trajectory, with a finite control set consisting on moving toward landmarks naturally modeling the robot as a switched dynamical system. We present experiments using an e-puck differential-drive robot, in which a useful estimate of the state for tracking is produced regardless of nontrivial uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "The novel concept of Trans-abdominal Active Magnetic Linkage for laparoendoscopic single site surgery has the potential to enable the deployment of a bimanual robotic platform trough a single laparoscopic incision. The main advantage of this approach consists in shifting the actuators outside the body of the patient, while transmitting a controlled robotic motion by magnetic field across the abdomen without the need for dedicated incisions. An actuation mechanism based on this approach can be comprised of multiple anchoring and actuation units, mixed depending upon the specific needs. A static model providing anchoring and actuation forces and torques available at the internal side of the magnetic link was developed to provide a tool to navigate among the many possibilities of such an open ended design approach. The model was assessed through bench top experiments, showing a maximum relative error of 4% on force predictions. An example of a single degree of freedom manipulator actuated with the proposed concept and compatible with a 12-mm access port is able to provide an anchoring force of 3.82 N and an actuation force of 2.95 N.",

        "abstract": "Rehabilitation robotic devices have been actively explored for training patients with impaired neural functions or assisting those with weak limbs due to aging or diseases. In recent years, the authors have proposed light-weight exoskeleton designs for the upper arm, in which rigid links of the exoskeleton are replaced by lightweight cuffs attached to the moving limb segments of the human arm. Cables, driven by motors, are routed through these cuffs to move the limb segments. However, a scientific limitation of a cable driven system is that cables can only pull but not push. Previously, the authors have demonstrated by experiments with CAREX mounted on a robotic arm that it is possible to achieve forces in all directions at the wrist. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate via experiments that CAREX is able to apply similar forces at the end-effector with healthy subjects in the device. In this research, CAREX was rigidly attached to an arm orthosis which can be tightly strapped on the human arm. The cable routing points were optimized for large \u201ctensioned\u201d workspace of the arm for typical Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). An orientation sensor was used to measure shoulder joint angles. Experiments are presented to validate the new sensor implementation and show the performance of CAREX on healthy subjects.",

        "abstract": "Three dimensional ultrasound is a promising imaging modality for minimally invasive robotic surgery. As the robots are typically metallic, they interact strongly with the sound waves in ways that are not modeled by the ultrasound system's signal processing algorithms. Consequently, they produce substantial imaging artifacts that can make image guidance difficult, even for experienced surgeons. This paper introduces a new approach for detecting curved continuum robots in 3D ultrasound images. The proposed approach combines geodesic active contours with a speed function that is based on enhancing the \u201ctubularity\u201d of the continuum robot. In particular, it takes advantage of the known robot diameter along its length. It also takes advantage of the fact that the robot surface facing the ultrasound probe provides the most accurate image. This method, termed Tubular Enhanced Geodesic Active Contours (TEGAC), is demonstrated through ex vivo intracardiac experiments to offer superior performance compared to conventional active contours.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Research on insect-inspired flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (FWMAV) has grown steadily in the past decade, aiming to address unique challenges in morphological construction, force production, and control strategy. In particular, effective methods for motion control still remain an open problem. This paper analyzes the mechanical impedance properties of the joint and their role in rotation of the wing and force production. The results suggest that in addition to previously observed relationship between set point and drag [1], the average lift force is also related to the stiffness of the joint. Furthermore, as long as changes in impedance properties are small, net lift and drag production are almost independent. These relationships are the basis of `tunable impedance' technique, a new approach to force/motion control in FWMAVs. A simple controller designed based on this method is used to simulate various flight maneuvers. The simulated MAV demonstrates exceptional performance, even in presence of measurement noise. This technique requires a fixed stroke profile for both wings, thus allowing to use a single stroke actuator - in a real MAV - with a bandwidth as low as the frequency of flapping. Impedance actuators also prove to have low bandwidth requirements.",

        "abstract": "In scenarios in which new robots and tasks are added to a network of already deployed, interchangeable robots, a trade-off arises in minimizing the cost to execute the tasks and the level of disruption to the system. This paper considers a navigation-oriented variant of this problem and proposes a parametrizable method to adjust the optimization criterion: from minimizing global travel time (or energy, or distance), to minimizing interruption (i.e., obtaining the fewest number of robot reassignments), and mixtures in-between. Paths are computed by a task-allocation formulation in which the destinations of newly deployed robots are added to an existing allocation. We adapt the graph matching variant of the Hungarian algorithm-originally designed to solve the optimal assignment problem in complete graphs-to construct routing paths by showing that there is an interpretation of the sparse Hungarian bipartite graph in three dimensions. When new agent-task pairs are inserted, the assignment is reallocated in an incremental fashion in linear time (assuming traversal choices are limited in number). The algorithm is studied systematically in simulation and also validated with physical robots.",

        "abstract": "Humans can perform fast and skillful manipulations using various parts of the body by effectively utilizing the dynamics of the targets. Visual sensation is the most important human sense used for such manipulations. Juggling is one such example involving skillful and dynamic manipulations, and visual information is essential for it to be successful. Previously, there have been several studies about robotic juggling. However, none of these studies have considered cases in which a human-like multifingered hand-arm is used for the robotic juggling. The purpose of this study is to achieve two-ball juggling using our robotic hand-arm, which has three general purpose fingers, and stereo vision. Image processing is executed at 500 fps using a high-speed vision system and graphics processing unit (GPU). The trajectory of the robotic hand-arm is generated based on the ball's estimated dropping position and moment, and the robot catches the ball. The juggling motion is achieved by repeating this cycle. Therefore, the results show that the robot successfully juggles two balls using our hand-arm system.",

We show that the caging problem has several useful properties in contact space. First, the critical points of the cage representation in the hand's configuration space appear as critical points of an inter-finger distance function in contact space. Second, the critical points of this distance function can be simply characterized. Third, the contact space admits a rectangular decomposition where the distance function is convex in each rectangle, and all critical points lie on the rectangle boundaries. This property leads to a natural \u201ccaging graph,\u201d which can be readily searched to construct the caging sets. An example, constructed from real-world data illustrates and validates the method.",

We address both these problems within the framework of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that now has a rich tradition of usage in computer vision and robotics applications. We solve the first of the two problems by frame-to-frame propagation of the computed pose estimates for the purpose of the initializations needed by ICP. The second problem is solved by terminating the iterative estimation process at the expiration of the available time for each image frame. We show that when frame-to-frame homography is factored into the iterative calculations, the accuracy of the position calculated at the time of bailing out of the iterations is nearly always sufficient for the goals of UAV vision.",

A frequent complication occurring during this operation is injury of underlying soft tissue structures, which can even result in death of the patient. To improve safety, the proposed robotic instrument automatically adjusts the cutting depth on the basis of the related local bone thickness. To obtain anatomical information, most systems available are based on optical tracking and computed tomography. However, a combination of these modalities is not yet common in heart- and thoracic surgery. In this context, two different concepts for acquiring anatomical information and realizing real-time cutting depth adjustment are presented, using ultrasound and optical bone surface characteristics. Both approaches were evaluated in an experimental setup with phantom sternums demonstrating feasibility of the approach. Future work will include a combination of different sensors to improve robustness of the system and cadaver trials.",

        "abstract": "An uncertainty estimation method for 6 degree of freedom (6-DoF) spectral registration is introduced here. The underlying 6-DoF registration method based on Phase Only Matched Filtering (POMF) is capable of dealing with very noisy sensor data. It is hence well suited for 3D underwater mapping, where relatively inaccurate sonar imaging devices have to be employed. An uncertainty estimation method is required to use this registration method in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework. To our knowledge, the first such method for 6-DoF spectral registration is presented here. This new uncertainty estimation method treats the POMF results as probability mass functions (PMF). Due to the decoupling in the underlying method, yaw is computed by a one-dimensional POMF leading hence to a 1D PMF; roll and pitch are simultaneously computed and hence encoded in a 2D PMF. Furthermore, a 3D PMF is generated for the translation as it is determined by a 3D POMF. A normal distribution is fitted on each of the PMF to get the uncertainty estimate. The method is experimentally evaluated with simulated as well as real world sonar data. It is shown that it indeed can be used for SLAM, which significantly improves the map quality.",

        "abstract": "We discuss the problem of inspecting an underwater structure, such as a submerged ship hull, with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In such scenarios, the goal is to construct an accurate 3D model of the structure and to detect any anomalies (e.g., foreign objects or deformations). We propose a method for constructing 3D meshes from sonar-derived point clouds that provides watertight surfaces, and we introduce uncertainty modeling through non-parametric Bayesian regression. Uncertainty modeling provides novel cost functions for planning the path of the AUV to minimize a metric of inspection performance. We draw connections between the resulting cost functions and submodular optimization, which provides insight into the formal properties of active perception problems. In addition, we present experimental trials that utilize profiling sonar data from ship hull inspection.",

The strategy is based on planning in the belief space of probability distribution over states. Our planning approach is based on hierarchical symbolic regression (pre-image back-chaining). We develop a vocabulary of fluents that describe sets of belief states, which are goals and subgoals in the planning process. We show that a relatively small set of symbolic operators lead to task-oriented perception in support of the manipulation goals.",

In this paper, we perform detection and recognition of unstructured human activity in unstructured environments. We use a RGBD sensor (Microsoft Kinect) as the input sensor, and compute a set of features based on human pose and motion, as well as based on image and point-cloud information. Our algorithm is based on a hierarchical maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM), which considers a person's activity as composed of a set of sub-activities. We infer the two-layered graph structure using a dynamic programming approach. We test our algorithm on detecting and recognizing twelve different activities performed by four people in different environments, such as a kitchen, a living room, an office, etc., and achieve good performance even when the person was not seen before in the training set.1",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to automatically learn the visual appearance of an environment in terms of object classes. The procedure is totally unsupervised, incremental, and can be executed in real time. The traversability property of an unseen object is also learnt without human supervision by the interaction between the robot and the environment. An incremental version of affinity propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering procedure, is used to cluster image patches into groups of similar visual appearance. For each of these clusters, we obtain the probability of representing an obstacle through the interaction of the robot with the environment. This information then allows the robot to navigate safely through the environment based solely on visual information. Experimental results show that our method extracts meaningful clusters from the images and learns the appearance of objects efficiently. We show that the approach generalises well to both indoor and outdoor environments and that the amount of learning reduces as the robot explores the environment. This is a fundamental property for autonomous adaptation and long-term autonomy.",

Based on the fact that in most applications it is the pointed object rather than the actual pointing direction which is important, we formulate a novel approach which takes into account prior information about the location of possible pointed targets. To decide about the pointed object, the proposed approach uses the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to fuse information from two different input streams: head pose, estimated by visually tracking the off-plane rotations of the face, and hand pointing orientation. Detailed experimental results are presented that validate the effectiveness of the method in realistic application setups.",

        "abstract": "Disturbance rejection is one of the most important abilities required for biped walkers. In this study, we propose a method for dynamic programming of biped walking and apply it to a simple passive dynamic walker (PDW) on an irregular slope. The key of the proposed approach is to employ the transient dynamics of the walker just before approaching the falling state in the absence of any controlling input, and to derive the optimal control policy in the low-dimensional latent space. In recent our study, we found that such transient dynamics deeply relates to the basin of attraction for a stable gait. By patching latent coordinates to such a structures in each Poincar\u00e9 section and defining the reward function according to the survive time of the transient dynamics, so-called escape-times, we construct a Markov decision process (MDP) for the PDW and obtain an optimal policy using a dynamic programming (DP). We will show that the proposed method actually succeeds in controlling the PDW even if the degree of disturbance is relatively large and the dimensionality of coordinates is reduced to lower ones.",

Most current approaches follow a multiple re-grasp strategy for this purpose, in which clothes are sequentially grasped from different points until one of them yields to a desired configuration. In this paper, by contrast, we circumvent the need for multiple re-graspings by building a robust detector that identifies the grasping points, generally in one single step, even when clothes are highly wrinkled. In order to handle the large variability a deformed cloth may have, we build a Bag of Features based detector that combines appearance and 3D geometry features. An image is scanned using a sliding window with a linear classifier, and the candidate windows are refined using a non-linear SVM and a \u201cgrasp goodness\u201d criterion to select the best grasping point. We demonstrate our approach detecting collars in deformed polo shirts, using a Kinect camera. Experimental results show a good performance of the proposed method not only in identifying the same trained textile object part under severe deformations and occlusions, but also the corresponding part in other clothes, exhibiting a degree of generalization.",

We present a robust pipeline that combines perception and manipulation to accurately sort Duplo bricks by color and size. The pipeline uses two simple motion primitives to manipulate the scene in ways that help the robot to improve its perception. This results in the ability to sort cluttered piles of Duplo bricks accurately. We present experimental results on the PR2 robot comparing brick sorting without the aid of manipulation to sorting with manipulation primitives that show the benefits of the latter, particularly as the degree of clutter in the environment increases.",

        "abstract": "Robots that operate in complex physical environments can improve the accuracy of their perception systems by fusing data from complementary sensing modalities. Furthermore, robots capable of motion can physically interact with these environments, and then leverage the sensory information they receive from these interactions. This paper explores the use of sound data as a new type of sensing modality to classify vehicle-terrain interactions from mobile robots operating outdoors, which can complement more typical non-contact sensors that are used for terrain classification. Acoustic data from microphones was recorded on a mobile robot interacting with different types of terrains and objects in outdoor environments. This data was then labeled and used offline to train a supervised multiclass classifier that can distinguish between these interactions based on acoustic data alone. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first time that acoustics has been used to classify a variety of interactions that a vehicle can have with its environment, so part of our contribution is to survey acoustic techniques from other domains and explore their efficacy for this application. The feature extraction methods we implement are derived from this survey, which then serve as inputs to our classifier. The multiclass classifier is then built from Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The results presented show an average of 92% accuracy across all classes, which suggest strong potential for acoustics to enhance perception systems on mobile robots.",

The proposed variable admittance law is based on the inference of human intentions using desired velocity and acceleration. Stability issues are discussed and a controller design example is given. Finally, experimental results obtained with a full-scale prototype of an intelligent assist device are presented in order to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a versatile framework to enable autonomous flights of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which has only slow, noisy, delayed and possibly arbitrarily scaled measurements available. Using such measurements directly for position control would be practically impossible as MAVs exhibit great agility in motion. In addition, these measurements often come from a selection of different onboard sensors, hence accurate calibration is crucial to the robustness of the estimation processes. Here, we address these problems using an EKF formulation which fuses these measurements with inertial sensors. We do not only estimate pose and velocity of the MAV, but also estimate sensor biases, scale of the position measurement and self (inter-sensor) calibration in real-time. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to obtain a yaw estimate from position measurements only. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of running entirely onboard a MAV performing state prediction at the rate of 1 kHz. Our results illustrate that this approach is able to handle measurement delays (up to 500ms), noise (std. deviation up to 20 cm) and slow update rates (as low as 1 Hz) while dynamic maneuvers are still possible. We present a detailed quantitative performance evaluation of the real system under the influence of different disturbance parameters and different sensor setups to highlight the versatility of our approach.",

The robot can travel over 45 cm*s\u22121 on flat ground, and turn in place. The Durable Reconnaissance and Observation Platform, D.R.O.P., is manufactured using a combination of selective laser sintering (SLS) and shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) techniques. The enabling feature of DROP is the use of microspines in a rotary configuration, increasing climbing and walking speed over previous microspine-based robots by more than 5x. The robot uses a 180mAh LiPo battery, Baby Orangutan microprocessor, and two brushed DC motors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the actuator's intrinsic backdrivability is important in realizing a force sensitive behavior. It is desirable to realize such actuator with electric motor that is advantageous from power-to-weight ratio and controllability point of view. Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator is a type of hydraulic actuators that can realize high backdrivability by reducing transmission friction and by providing dynamics decoupling with an implicit serial damper. To farther enhance the backdrivability of a EHA, a pump with minimum static and Coulomb friction is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an EHA with viscous screw pump that minimizes static and Coulomb friction by eliminating the mechanical contact between pump components. Viscous screw pumps also have the advantage that there is no pulsation in pressure due to the continuity of the force transmission from the rotor to the fluid. The property of the actuator, including pulsation performance and impedance control performance were evaluated on a prototype of EHA with a viscous screw pump.",

        "abstract": "Peeling delicate retinal membranes, which are often less than five microns thick, is one of the most challenging retinal surgeries. Preventing rips and tears caused by tremor and excessive force can decrease injury and reduce the need for follow up surgeries. We propose the use of a fully handheld microsurgical robot and vision-based virtual fixtures to enforce helpful constraints on the motion of the tool. Our key contribution is using only visual information to reduce and limit forces during vitreoretinal surgery: no force feedback is used in the control system. Utilizing stereo vision and tracking algorithms, the robot activates motion-scaled behavior as the tip nears the surface, providing finer control during the critical step of engaging the membrane edge. A hard virtual fixture just below the surface bounds the total downward force that can be applied. Furthermore, velocity limiting during the peeling helps the surgeon maintain a smooth, constant force while lifting and delaminating the membrane. On a retinal phantom consisting of plastic wrap stretched on top a rubber slide, we demonstrate a reduction of maximum force by 40\u201370%.",

        "abstract": "Visual Teach and Repeat (VT&R) has proven to be an effective method to allow a vehicle to autonomously repeat any previously driven route without the need for a global positioning system. One of the major challenges for a method that relies on visual input to recognize previously visited places is lighting change, as this can make the appearance of a scene look drastically different. For this reason, passive sensors, such as cameras, are not ideal for outdoor environments with inconsistent/inadequate light. However, camera-based systems have been very successful for localization and mapping in outdoor, unstructured terrain, which can be largely attributed to the use of sparse, appearance-based computer vision techniques. Thus, in an effort to achieve lighting invariance and to continue to exploit the heritage of the appearance-based vision techniques traditionally used with cameras, this paper presents the first VT&R system that uses appearance-based techniques with laser scanners for motion estimation. The system has been field tested in a planetary analogue environment for an entire diurnal cycle, covering more than 11km with an autonomy rate of 99.7% of the distance traveled.",

Integration of an imaging modality intraoperatively further strengthens these procedures by incorporating the information pertaining to the area of intervention. Such information needs to be effectively rendered to the operator as a human-in-the-loop requirement. In this work, we propose a guidance approach that uses real-time MRI to assist the operator in performing robot-assisted procedure in a beating heart. Specifically, this approach provides both real-time visualization and force-feedback based guidance for maneuvering an interventional tool safely inside the dynamic environment of a heart's left ventricle. Experimental evaluation of the functionality of this approach was tested on a simulated scenario of transapical aortic valve replacement and it demonstrated improvement in control and manipulation by providing effective and accurate assistance to the operator in real-time.",

A quadrocopter fitted with a single camera is flown over different terrains to take images of the ground below. Each image is divided into a grid and SURF features are calculated at grid intersections. A classifier is then used to learn to differentiate between different terrain types. Classification results of the SURF descriptor are compared with results from other texture descriptors like Local Binary Patterns and Local Ternary Patterns. Six different terrain types are considered in this approach. Random forests are used for classification on each descriptor.

        "abstract": "We propose a voting-based pose estimation algorithm applicable to 3D sensors, which are fast replacing their 2D counterparts in many robotics, computer vision, and gaming applications. It was recently shown that a pair of oriented 3D points, which are points on the object surface with normals, in a voting framework enables fast and robust pose estimation. Although oriented surface points are discriminative for objects with sufficient curvature changes, they are not compact and discriminative enough for many industrial and real-world objects that are mostly planar. As edges play the key role in 2D registration, depth discontinuities are crucial in 3D. In this paper, we investigate and develop a family of pose estimation algorithms that better exploit this boundary information. In addition to oriented surface points, we use two other primitives: boundary points with directions and boundary line segments. Our experiments show that these carefully chosen primitives encode more information compactly and thereby provide higher accuracy for a wide class of industrial parts and enable faster computation. We demonstrate a practical robotic bin-picking system using the proposed algorithm and a 3D sensor.",

However, due to the high-dimensional configuration space of many robots, reasoning about possible physical motion is often intractable. In this paper, we propose a novel method for creating a reachability grid, a voxel-based representation that estimates the minimum time needed for a manipulator to reach any physical location within its workspace. We use up to second-degree constraints on joint motion to model motion limits for each joint independently, followed by successive voxel approximations to map these limits on to the robot's physical workspace. Results using a simulated manipulator indicate that our method can produce accurate reachability grids in real-time, even for robots with many degrees of freedom. Furthermore, errors are almost exclusively biased towards producing more optimistic reachability estimates, which is a desirable characteristic for many applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents WISS, a speaker identification system for mobile robots integrated to ManyEars, a sound source localization, tracking and separation system. Speaker identification consists in recognizing an individual among a group of known speakers. For mobile robots, performing speaker identification in presence of noise that changes over time is one important challenge. To deal with this issue, WISS uses Parallel Model Combination (PMC) and masks to update in real-time the speaker models (obtained in clean conditions) to both additive and convolutive noises. The results show that the weighted rate of good speaker identifications is 96% on average for a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 16 dB, whereas it only decreases to 84% when the SNR drops to 2 dB.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to generate and stabilize a periodic walking motion for a five degrees of freedom planar robot. First of all we will consider a biped version of the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which shows openloop stable behavior. Then we will control the robot behavior as close as possible to the simple model. In this way we take advantage of the open-loop stability of the walking pattern related to the SLIP, and additional control actions are used to increase the robustness of the system and reject external disturbances. To this end an upper level controller will deal with the stabilization of the SLIP model, while a lower level controller will map the simple virtual model onto the real robot dynamics. Two different approaches are implemented for the lower level: in the first one, we aim at exactly reproducing the same acceleration that a SLIP would have when put in the same condition, while in the second one, we aim at a simpler control law without exactly reproducing the aforementioned acceleration. The latter case is equivalent to considering a SLIP with additional external disturbances, which have to be handled by the upper level controller. Both approaches can successfully reproduce a periodic walking pattern for the robot.",

The proposed walking pattern generator computes the desired center of mass (COM) references on-line based on the COM state feedback. The position and velocity of the COM are the feedback variables, and the constraint ground reaction force (GRF), which is limited by the support polygon, is the control effort to drive the COM states to track the desired ones. The zero moment point (ZMP) is obtained naturally as a result of GRF interaction with robot feet. The proposed COM tracking scheme demands a lower bandwidth from the controller compared to the ZMP tracking schemes. Experimental data of the real compliant humanoid, such as ZMP, COM motion, and GRF are presented to demonstrate the validation of the proposed gait generation method.",

        "abstract": "Stable grasp is the result of sensorimotor regulation of forces, ensuring sufficient grip force and the integrity of the held object. Grasping with a prosthesis introduces the challenge of finding the appropriate forces given the engineered sensorimotor prosthetic interface. Excessive force leads to unnecessary energy use and possible damage to the object. In contrast, low grip forces lead to slippage. In order for a prosthetic hand to achieve a stable grasp, the haptic information provided to the prosthesis wearer needs to display these two antagonistic grasp metrics (force and slip) in a quantified way. We present the design and evaluation of a wearable single-actuator haptic device that relays multi-modal haptic information, such as grip force and slip speed. Two belts that are activated in a mutually exclusive manner by the rotation direction of a single motor exert normal force and tangential motion on the skin surface, respectively. The wearable haptic device is able to display normal forces as a tap frequency in the range of approximately 1.5\u20135.0 Hz and slip speed in the range of 50\u2013200 mm/s. Within these values, users are able to identify at least four stimulation levels for each feedback modality, with short-term training.",

In particular, we wish to detect instances of classes of interest in autonomous driving applications - cars, pedestrians and bicyclists - amongst significant background clutter. Our aim is to provide the layout of an end-to-end pipeline which, when fed by a raw stream of 3D data, produces distinct groups of points which can be fed to downstream classifiers for categorisation. We postulate that, for the specific classes considered in this work, solving a binary classification task (i.e. separating the data into foreground and background first) outperforms approaches that tackle the multi-class problem directly. This is confirmed using custom and third-party datasets gathered of urban street scenes. While our system is agnostic to the specific clustering algorithm deployed we explore the use of a Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree for an end-to-end segmentation pipeline and devise a RANSAC-based edge selection criterion.",

        "abstract": "In this work we present principled methods for the coordination of a robot's oculomotor system with the rest of its body motor systems. The problem is to decide which physical actions to perform next and where the robot's gaze should be directed in order to gain information that is relevant to the success of its physical actions. Previous work on this problem has shown that a reward-based coordination mechanism provides an efficient solution. However, that approach does not allow the robot to move its gaze to different parts of the scene, it considers the robot to have only one motor system, and assumes that the actions have the same duration. The main contributions of our work are to extend that previous reward-based approach by making decisions about where to fixate the robot's gaze, handling multiple motor systems, and handling actions of variable duration. We compare our approach against two common baselines: random and round robin gaze allocation. We show how our method provides a more effective strategy to allocate gaze where it is needed the most.",

        "abstract": "A method for distributed parameter estimation of a previously unknown wind field is described. The application is dynamic soaring for small unmanned air vehicles, which severely constrains available computing while simultaneously requiring updates that are fast compared with a typical dynamic soaring cycle. A polynomial parameterization of the wind field is used, allowing implementation of a linear Kalman filter for parameter estimation. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show the effectiveness of the approach. In addition, in-flight measurements of wind speeds are compared with data obtained from video tracking of balloon launches to assess the accuracy of wind field estimates obtained using commercial autopilot modules.",

The system consists of: a near-spherical soft and buoyant magnetic microrobot (with a diameter of about 500 \u00b5m) conceived for operation in liquid; a wireless magnetic steering system, including a compact magnetic field generator based on two pairs of Helmholtz and Maxwell coils; an electronic system for their driving; a control software; a joypad physical user interface; and, the micro-arena as working environment. The platform design fulfills the requirements for the \u201cMobility Task\u201d of the 2011 NIST Mobile Microrobotics Challenge. The results obtained from preliminary validation experiments confirm that the microrobots can move in a fully controlled way, successfully accomplishing an intricate eight-shape path, as required, in the water filled micro-arena. In particular we achieved a maximum average speed of 0.71 mm/s and an exceptionally smooth motion.",

A novelty of this language is that behaviors are treated as first class objects in the language and thus they can be passed as arguments to other parameterized behaviors. The language has template behaviors which allow generalized behaviors to be customized and instantiated. This makes the language quite flexible in terms of programming styles. An example of its flexibility are presented, followed by a description of the challenges in the language design.",

Preliminarily, we analyzed the contact constraint to formulate a dynamically decoupled model in the task space. Then, inequality constraints were determined to restrict the dynamic behavior of the system within the given bounds for the dynamic stability and the actuator saturation. The inequality constraints were applied to the reference control input that was designed for the mechanism to traverse the desired trajectories without the constraints. To find the constrained control input, a quadratic objective function was proposed to minimize the modification error of the control inputs. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing simulation results with our previous research.",

Mating connectors by robot, as an experimental case in this paper, is studied to evaluate the performance of i-Hand. A simple new model is proposed to describe the process of mating connectors, within which the distance between the connector and deformable Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is detected by i-Hand. An online Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) algorithm is proposed. Various possible situations during assembly are considered and handled according to an event driven work flow. The effectiveness of proposed model and algorithm is proved by the experiments.",

        "abstract": "We present a new bounding volume structure, k-IOS that is an intersection of k spheres, for accelerating proximity query including collision detection and Euclidean distance computation between arbitrary polygon-soup models that undergo rigid motion. Our new bounding volume is easy to implement and highly efficient both for its construction and runtime query. In our experiments, we have observed up to 4.0 times performance improvement of proximity query compared to an existing well-known algorithm based on swept sphere volume (SSV) [1]. Moreover, k-IOS is strictly convex that can guarantee a continuous gradient of distance function with respect to object's configuration parameter.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to bounded optimal planning and flexible execution for a robot team performing a set of spatially distributed tasks related by temporal ordering constraints such as precedence or synchronization. Furthermore, the manner in which the temporal constraints are satisfied impacts the overall utility of the team, due to the existence of both routing and delay costs. We present a bounded optimal offline planner for task allocation and scheduling in the presence of such cross-schedule dependencies, and a flexible, distributed online plan execution strategy. The integrated system performs task allocation and scheduling, executes the plans smoothly in the face of real-world variations in operation speed and task execution time, and ensures graceful degradation in the event of task failure. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on a team of three pioneer robots operating in an indoor environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach is effective for constrained planning and execution in the face of real-world variations.",

By reciprocating a cell across the throat of a micro channel repeatedly, the dynamic deformation behavior of the cell is measured. We define a new index of fatigue characteristics of cells as the number of reciprocatory motion leading to a prescribed recovery ratio. The test system is composed of a piezoelectric (PZT) actuator, a high speed vision sensor and a micro channel with a throat. Preliminary experiments were conducted by using Red Blood Cells (RBCs). The result suggested that the activation level of a cell can be evaluated based on its fatigue characteristics.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an unsupervised graph cut based object segmentation algorithm, ShadowCut, for robotic aerial surveillance applications. By exploiting the spatial setting of the aerial imagery, ShadowCut algorithm differs from state-of-the-art object segmentation algorithms ([1] [2] [3] [4] [5]) by not requiring a large number of labelled training data set, nor constant user interaction ([6] [7] [8]). In this paper it is shown that, by combining robotic navigation data and a shadow model, it is possible to provide these seed labels with a probabilistic sampling model for object segmentation in aerial imagery. Experiments were performed on aerial data sets consisting of data collected in outback Australia with an aerial robotic platform during an ecological surveillance mission, and aerial images with various natural targets from Google Earth. The segmentation results from the unsupervised ShadowCut algorithm are shown to be comparable with those from supervised graph cut algorithms.",
