        "abstract": "We propose a polynomial force-motion model for planar sliding. The set of generalized friction loads is the 1-sublevel set of a polynomial whose gradient directions correspond to generalized velocities. Additionally, the polynomial is confined to be convex even-degree homogeneous in order to obey the maximum work inequality, symmetry, shape invariance in scale, and fast invertibility. We present a simple and statistically-efficient model identification procedure using a sum-of-squares convex relaxation. Simulation and robotic experiments validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach. We also show practical applications of our model including stable pushing of objects and free sliding dynamic simulations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a highly sensitive dual mode tactile and proximity sensor for robotic applications that uses Carbon Microcoils (CMCs). The sensor consists of multiple electrode layers printed on a Flexible Printed Circuit Board (FPCB) and a dielectric substrate into which the CMCs are dispersed. The dielectric layer is simply put on the top of the FPCB. Thus, the sensor provides ease of fabrication and robustness against repetitive external contacts because the dielectric layer protects the electrodes. The electrical properties of the sensor are changed when an object approaches or touches the sensor. The sensor uses a capacitive sensing mode for tactile sensing and an inductive sensing mode for proximity sensing. CMCs amplify the change of the sensor signal because of electrical impedance formed by the CMCs, and thus, the sensitivity of the sensor increases. We fabricate the prptotype sensor with the dimensions of 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 0.6 mm3, and with 3 mm spatial-resolution. The sensor detects the applied pressure up to 330 kPa and the distance of an object as much as 150 mm away.",

        "abstract": "While designing robot hands based on grasping data is more common, fewer previous works have used details of human manipulation kinematics to improve robot hand design. The current work involves an underactuated, tendon driven, anthropomorphic manipulator with two flexor tendons and an abduction-adduction tendon, and describes its design based on experimental human precision manipulation data. Link lengths, joint axis alignment, and moment arms were derived from human subject data and values in the literature. The spring ratios, determining the torque relationships between joints, were then selected to maximize the achievable manipulation workspace from the human trial without requiring large forces, which are likely to lead to instability and object ejection. This is done by minimizing the stored spring energy in the robotic fingers across the range of precision manipulation workspace positions achieved by a representative human subject. After fabricating the hand, the energy characteristics of the resulting prototype are analyzed, and the robotic workspace is compared against the original human one. Despite only having three actuators, the hand is able to manipulate the test object within a 2.7 cm3 workspace volume, compared to an average human workspace of 5.4 cm3 for the same object. Future work could include adding antagonist actuators to achieve a larger motion range along the palmar-dorsal axis, which is currently the most limited axis of motion in comparison to the original human workspace.",

Our objective is to plan motions for a team of homogeneous micro air vehicles (MAVs) toward a set of goals, such that each MAV at any state at any moment follows an action policy toward a unique goal, while considering action uncertainty. We pursue an efficient formulation by first considering a deterministic abstraction of the stochastic system based on approximate initial paths. These deterministic and decoupled sub-problems are converted to the stochastic domain and improved by individual agents or a subset of agents. The resulting decoupled formulation requires processing of a partial state space and enables online operation given applications with emerging tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis on flexible formations of nonholonomic mobile robots from the perspectives of motion planning and control. The formations are flexible in the sense that their formation configurations are defined based on curvilinear longitudinal and lateral relative separations instead of the commonly used rectilinear relative separations. And the mobile robots' motions considered here are kinodynamically constrained. In this work, we relate the formation maneuverability with the mobile robots' limited motion capabilities and the formation's configuration which in turn provides a measure on the formation's motion capabilities. In addition, useful findings pertaining to fundamental formations are also derived, which are advantageous for efficient and effective formation motion planning and control. These results lay a foundation to address the problems of planning kinodynamically feasible formation leader's trajectories to connect flexible formations between different locations such that every robot of the formation can follow its assigned formation point without violating it's kinodynamical motion constraints.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the problem of rendezvous of synchronous multi-robot systems. Each robot has its own unique, bounded yet controllable sensing range which can be adjusted. The state of those robots within the sensing range can be estimated, which induces the directed network topology of the multi-robot systems. In particular, we consider multi-robot systems containing faulty robots which can behave arbitrarily. Our recent work [1] has addressed the problem of achieving rendezvous in the presence of faulty robots under a restrictive class of conditions on network topology. In this work, we presented a theoretically correct, but computationally intractable algorithm. We extend our past work by proposing a new approximate algorithm that is computationally efficient, and by showing that the proposed algorithm solves our problem given faulty robots in general configurations under mild assumptions on the network topology. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is to provide an efficient computational framework and analysis of robust rendezvous algorithm in the presence of faulty robots. Several simulation results are provided to demonstrate that our algorithm performs well in the face of both stationary and dynamic faults.",

Based on reasoning in wrench space, we address the question of how well analytic grasp success prediction works if tactile feedback is incorporated. Tactile information can alleviate contact placement uncertainties and facilitates contact modeling. We introduce a wrench-based classifier and evaluate it on a large set of real grasps. The key finding of this work is that exploiting tactile information allows wrench-based reasoning to perform on a level with existing methods based on learning or simulation. Different from these methods, the suggested approach has no need for training data, requires little modeling effort and is computationally efficient. Furthermore, our method affords task generalization by considering the capabilities of the grasping device and expected disturbance forces/moments in a physically meaningful way.",

With this framework, an initial set of controller gains is automatically improved according to a pre-defined performance objective evaluated from experimental data. The underlying Bayesian optimization algorithm is Entropy Search, which represents the latent objective as a Gaussian process and constructs an explicit belief over the location of the objective minimum. This is used to maximize the information gain from each experimental evaluation. Thus, this framework shall yield improved controllers with fewer evaluations compared to alternative approaches. A seven-degree-of-freedom robot arm balancing an inverted pole is used as the experimental demonstrator. Results of two- and four-dimensional tuning problems highlight the method's potential for automatic controller tuning on robotic platforms.",

This structure builds upon the so-called bubble, which is a local volume of free C-space, easily computed using the distance information in the workspace. We show how the same distance information can be used to compute the bur that can reach substantially beyond the boundary of the bubble. It is shown how burs can be used to form a rapidly exploring bur tree (RBT): a space-filling tree that resembles RRT. Such a structure can easily be used within a suitably tailored path planning algorithm. Simulation study shows how the RBT-based algorithm outperforms the classical RRT-based method.",

        "abstract": "We present an automatic method for interactive control of physical humanoid robots based on high-level tasks that does not require manual specification of motion trajectories or specially-designed control policies. The method is based on the combination of a model-based policy that is trained off-line in simulation and sends high-level commands to a model-free controller that executes these commands on the physical robot. This low-level controller simultaneously learns and adapts a local model of dynamics on-line and computes optimal controls under the learned model. The high-level policy is trained using a combination of trajectory optimization and neural network learning, while considering physical limitations such as limited sensors and communication delays. The entire system runs in real-time on the robot's computer and uses only on-board sensors. We demonstrate successful policy execution on a range of tasks such as leaning, hand reaching, and robust balancing behaviors atop a tilting base on the physical robot and in simulation.",

To fully realize this benefit, tactile systems must support real-time data acquisition over a massive number of tactile sensor elements. We present a novel approach for scalable tactile data acquisition using compressed sensing. We first demonstrate that the tactile data is amenable to compressed sensing techniques. We then develop a solution for fast data sampling, compression, and reconstruction that is suited for tactile system hardware and has potential for reducing the wiring complexity. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our technique on simulated tactile sensor networks. Our evaluations show that compressed sensing, with a compression ratio of 3 to 1, can achieve higher signal acquisition accuracy than full data acquisition of noisy sensor data.",

While the pursuers cannot enter into no-fly zones, the evader may freely move through zones to avoid capture. Once the evader enters a no-fly zone, the pursuers calculate a reachable set of evader positions. Using tools from Voronoi-based coverage control applied to the evader's reachable set, we provide an algorithm that distributes the pursuers around the zone's boundary and minimizes the capture time once the evader leaves the no-fly zone. Robust model predictive control (RMPC) tools are used to control the quadrotors and to ensure that they always remain in free space. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms through a series of experiments on KMEL Nano+ quadrotors.",

        "abstract": "Muscle activity monitoring or Electromyography (EMG) is useful in gait analysis, injury prevention, computer or robot interfaces and assisting patients with communication difficulties. However, EMG is typically invasive or obtrusive, expensive and difficult to use for untrained users. A possible solution is textile-based surface EMG (sEMG) integrated into clothing and used as a wearable device. This is, however, challenging due to (i) uncertainties in the electrical properties of conductive threads used to construct electrodes, (ii) imprecise fabrication technologies (e.g., embroidery, sewing), and (iii) a lack of standardisation in the choice of design variables. This paper, for the first time, provides a design guide for such sensors by performing a thorough examination of the effect of design variables on sEMG quality. Electrical characterisation and sEMG measurements are performed, considering the effects of manufacturing imprecision. Results show that the imprecisions in digital embroidery lead to a trade-off between low electrode resistance and high consistency. An optimum set of variables for this trade-off is identified and tested with sEMG during a variable force isometric grip exercise with n=6 participants and compared with traditional gel-based electrodes. Results show that thread-based electrodes provide a similar level of sensitivity to force variation as gel-based electrodes with about 90% correlation with expected linear behaviour.",

        "abstract": "Computationally efficient online learning of non-stationary models remains a difficult challenge. A robust and reliable algorithm could have great impact on problems in learning control. Recent work on combining the worlds of computationally efficient and locally adaptive learning algorithms with robust learning frameworks such as Gaussian process regression has taken a step towards both robust and real-time capable learning systems. However, online learning of model parameters on streaming data - that is strongly correlated, such as data arriving along a trajectory - can still create serious issues for many learning systems. Here we investigate the idea of drifting Gaussian processes which explicitly exploit the fact that data is generated along trajectories. A drifting Gaussian process keeps a history of a constant number of recently observed data points and updates its hyper-parameters at each time step. Instead of optimizing the neighborhood size on which the GP is trained on, we propose to use several - in parallel - drifting GPs whose predictions are combined for query points. We illustrate our approach on synthetically generated data and successfully evaluate on inverse dynamics learning tasks.",

We use power diagrams, generalized Voronoi diagrams with additive weights, to identify the robot's collision free convex neighborhood, and to generate the value of our proposed candidate solution vector field at any free configuration via evaluation of an associated convex optimization problem.

This paper presents a machine learning approach for estimating forces when no force sensors are present on the robot platform. In the training phase, the robot executes the desired manipulation tasks under controlled conditions with systematically varied parameter sets. All internal sensor data, in the presented case from more than 100 sensors, as well as the force exerted by the robot are recorded. Using Transfer Entropy, a statistical model is learned that identifies the subset of sensors relevant for torque estimation in the given task. At runtime, the model is used to accurately estimate the torques exerted during manipulations of the demonstrated kind. The feasibility of the approach is shown in a setting where a robotic manipulator operates a torque wrench to fasten a screw nut. Torque estimates with an accuracy of well below \u00b11Nm are achieved. A strength of the presented model is that no prior knowledge of the robot's kinematics, mass distribution or sensor instrumentation is required.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach to motion planning using Gaussian processes. In contrast to most existing trajectory optimization algorithms, which rely on a discrete state parameterization in practice, we represent the continuous-time trajectory as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP) generated by a linear time-varying stochastic differential equation. We then provide a gradient-based optimization technique that optimizes continuous-time trajectories with respect to a cost functional. By exploiting GP interpolation, we develop the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP), that finds optimal trajectories parameterized by a small number of states. We benchmark our algorithm against recent trajectory optimization algorithms by solving 7-DOF robotic arm planning problems in simulation and validate our approach on a real 7-DOF WAM arm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In programming by demonstration, generalization is necessary to apply demonstrated motions in novel situations. Many existing trajectory representations have poor generalization capabilities since they are built on trajectory coordinates that depend on the context in which the motion is recorded. In order to generalize, the user is typically required to perform a large number of varied demonstrations. This paper instead emphasizes the usefulness of an invariant trajectory representation to separate essential motion information from context-specific information of the recorded demonstrations. The invariants are interpreted as the control inputs of a dynamical system describing the evolution of the trajectory. New trajectories are generated for novel situations as the solution of a constrained optimal control problem in which context-specific information of the novel situation is encoded in the constraints. Results indicate how, starting from only a single demonstration, new trajectories can be generated in novel situations while maintaining similarity with the original demonstration. Invariance in trajectory representations therefore proves useful to reduce the number of necessary demonstrations to learn and apply new motions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Learning by demonstration methods have gained considerable interest in human-coupled robot control. It aims at modeling the goal motion trajectories through human demonstration. However, in lower exoskeleton control, the physical human-robot interaction is changing from pilot to pilot or even for one pilot in different walking patterns. This characteristic requires that the exoskeletons should have the ability to learn and adapt the motion trajectories as well as controllers online. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Interactive Learning (HIL) strategy which reduces the complexity of the exoskeleton sensory system and is able to handle varying interaction dynamics. The proposed HIL strategy is composed of two learning hierarchies, namely, high-level motion learning and low-level controller learning. The Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) combined with Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) are employed to model and learn the motion trajectories, while reinforcement learning (RL) is used to learn the model-based controller. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed HIL strategy on a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) platform as well as a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed HIL strategy is able to handle the varying interaction dynamics with less interaction force between the pilot and the exoskeleton when compared to traditional model-based control algorithms.",

        "abstract": "We present hierarchical rejection sampling (HRS) to improve the efficiency of asymptotically optimal sampling-based planners for high-dimensional problems with differential constraints. Pruning nodes and rejecting samples that cannot improve the currently best solution have been shown to improve performance for certain problems. We show that in high-dimensional domains this improvement can be so large that rejecting samples becomes the bottleneck of the algorithm because almost all samples are rejected. This contradicts general wisdom that collision checking is always the bottleneck of sampling-based planners. Only samples in the informed subset of the state space can potentially improve the current solution. For systems without differential constraints the informed subset forms an ellipsoid, which can be parameterized and sampled directly. For systems with differential constraints the informed subset is more complicated and no such direct sampling methods exist. HRS improves the efficiency of finding samples within the informed subset without parameterizing it explicitly. Thus, it can also be applied to systems with differential constraints for which a steering method is available. In our experiments we demonstrate efficiency improvements of an RRT* planner of up to two orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in motion planning has made it possible to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories between an initial and terminal configuration in a robot configuration space. Current approaches have however either assumed the knowledge of differential one-forms related to a skeletonization of the collision space, or have relied on a simplicial representation of the free space. Both of these approaches are currently however not yet practical for higher dimensional configuration spaces. We propose 2D topological task projections (TTPs): mappings from the configuration space to 2-dimensional spaces where simplicial complex filtrations and persistent homology can identify topological properties of the high-dimensional free configuration space. Our approach only requires the availability of collision free samples to identify winding centers that can be used to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories. We propose the Winding Augmented RRT and RRT* (WA-RRT/RRT*) algorithms using which homotopy inequivalent trajectories can be found. We evaluate our approach in experiments with configuration spaces of planar linkages with 2\u201310 degrees of freedom. Results indicate that our approach can reliably identify suitable topological task projections and our proposed WA-RRT and WA-RRT* algorithms were able to identify a collection of homotopy inequivalent trajectories in each considered configuration space dimension.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to the characterization of tactile array sensors that aims to reduce the computational time needed for convergence to obtain a useful estimator for normal and shear forces. This is achieved by breaking up the sensor characterization into two parts: a linear regression portion using multivariate least squares regression, and a nonlinear regression portion using a neural network as a multi-input, multi-output function approximator. This procedure has been termed Least Squares Artificial Neural Network (LSANN). By applying LSANN on the 2nd generation MIT Cheetah footpad, the convergence speed for the estimator of the normal and shear forces is improved by 59.2% compared to using only the neural network alone. The normalized root mean squared error between the two methods are nearly identical at 1.17% in the normal direction, and 8.30% and 10.14% in the shear directions. This approach could have broader implications in greatly reducing the amount of time needed to train a contact force estimator for a large number of tactile sensor arrays (i.e. in robotic hands and skin).",

The proposed method is based upon Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that are learned using an incremental Expectation Maximization clustering algorithm trained online using exemplars provided by a slow, conventional kinematic-based collision detection routine. The number of collision checks needed can be drastically reduced using a biased random sampling from the learned GMM distribution, and the learned models are continually refined and improved as the RRT planning algorithm proceeds. Our proposed method is demonstrated on several example applications and experimental results show marked improvement in computational efficiency over previous approaches.",

Always following the human at a close distance might hereby result in inefficient trajectories, since people regularly do not move on the shortest path to their destination (e.g., they move to grab the phone or make a note). Therefore, a service robot should infer the human's intended navigation goal and compute its own motion based on that prediction. We developed an approach that applies reinforcement learning to get a Q-function that determines for each pair of the robot's and human's relative positions the best navigation action for the robot. Our approach applies a prediction of the human's motion based on a softened Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP is independent from the navigation learning framework and is learned beforehand on previously observed trajectories. We thoroughly evaluated our method in simulation and on a real robot. As the experimental results show, our approach leads to foresighted navigation behavior and significantly reduces the path length and completion time compared to naive following strategies.",

In this paper, we propose to leverage machine learning techniques to learn the temporal profiles of the task priorities, represented as parametrized weight functions: we automatically determine their parameters through a stochastic optimization procedure. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method on a simulated 7 DOF Kuka LWR and both a simulated and a real Kinova Jaco arm.

        "abstract": "There is growing interest in applying machine learning to motion planning. Potential applications are predicting an initial seed for trajectory optimization, predicting an effective heuristic for search based planning, and even predicting a planning algorithm for adaptive motion planning systems. In these situations, providing only a single prediction is unsatisfactory. It leads to many scenarios where the prediction suffers a high loss. In this paper, we advocate list prediction. Each predictor in a list focusses on different regions in the space of environments. This overcomes the shortcoming of a single predictor, and improves overall performance. A framework for list prediction, ConseqOpt, already exists. Our contribution is an extensive domain-specific treatment. We provide a rigorous and clear exposition of the procedure for training a list of predictors. We provide experimental results on a spectrum of motion planning applications. Each application contributes to understanding the behavior of list prediction. We observe that the benefit of list prediction over a single prediction is significant, irrespective of the application.",

To tackle this challenge, two main problems can be identified: i) creating on-line maps of the relevant variables, based on sparse local measurements; ii) designing a planning algorithm which exploits the obtained map to generate trajectories that optimize the adaptive data sampling process, minimizing the uncertainty in the map, while steering the vehicles within the air flows to generate energetic-efficient flights. Our approach is based on Gaussian Processes (GP) for the mapping, combined with a stochastic optimization scheme for the trajectories generation. The system is tested in simulations carried out using a realistic three-dimensional current field. Results for a single UAV as well as for a fleet of multiple UAVs, sharing information to cooperatively achieve the mission, are provided.",

The speed modulation mechanisms proposed so far are limited though, allowing only for uniform speed modulation or coupling changes in speed to local measurements of forces, torques or other quantities. Those approaches are not enough when dealing with general velocity constraints. We present a movement primitive formulation that can be used to non-uniformly adapt the speed of execution of a movement in order to satisfy a given constraint, while maintaining similarity in shape to the original trajectory.

        "abstract": "Nanoforce sensors using passive magnetic springs associated to a macroscopic seismic mass are known to be a possible alternative to force sensors based on elastic microstructures like Atomic Force Microscopes if the nanoforces that have to be measured are characterized by a bandwidth limited to a few Hertz. The estimation of the unknown force applied to the seismic mass is based on the deconvolution of the noisy measurement of the mass displacement which has an under-damped dynamic. Despite their high performances in terms of linearity, resolution and measurement range, such force sensors are extremely sensitive to low frequency environmental mechanical disturbances. They are also sensitive to the temperature evolution of the ambient air. The evaluation, modeling and compensation of such environmental disturbances have to be specifically studied in the context of magnetic springs associated to a macroscopic seismic mass. This article presents an estimation and a passive compensation strategy of the low frequency and non-stationary mechanical disturbances that is based on a differential principle. This approach is applied to a nanoforce sensor based on diamagnetic levitation developed in the last decade and gives an uncertainty below the nanonewton level.",

A sequential Monte Carlo observation algorithm is proposed, which uses a fast and accurate collision detection algorithm as a reference model for the contacts between complex shaped parts. The main contribution of the paper is the extension of the classic random motion model in the propagation step with sampling methods known from the domain of probabilistic roadmap planning in order to increase the sample density in narrow passages of the configuration space. As a result, the observation performance can be improved and a risk of sample impoverishment reduced. Experimental validation is provided for a peg-in-hole task executed by a lightweight-robot arm equipped with joint torque sensors.",

The method combines iteratively refitted time-varying linear models with trajectory optimization, and can be seen as an instance of model-based reinforcement learning or as adaptive optimal control. Its appeal lies in the ability to handle challenging problems with surprisingly little data. We show that we can achieve sample-efficient learning of tasks that involve intermittent contact dynamics and under-actuation. Furthermore, we can control the hand directly at the level of the pneumatic valves, without the use of a prior model that describes the relationship between valve commands and joint torques. We compare results from learning in simulation and on the physical system. Even though the learned policies are local, they are able to control the system in the face of substantial variability in initial state.",

In particular, we propose an expanded version of the bubble, which enables even more efficient exploration. The method is validated and compared to other planning algorithms within a simulation study that includes several types of manipulators and obstacle scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Robots are increasingly being used in situations such as search and rescue that require robust navigation capabilities, potentially in areas with little or no GPS or other high-quality localization information. As more robots are used in these scenarios, it becomes viable to collaborate between heterogeneous types of robots to leverage their individual strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. More specifically, in a scenario involving unmanned ground and aerial vehicles (UGV, UAV), the ground robot can contribute its high payload capacity to provide computational resources and high accuracy sensors while the aerial robot can bring its high mobility and capability to traverse obstacles to the team. However, in order for the team to benefit from these capabilities, it must be capable of generating a plan for both robots that allows them to collaboratively localize when necessary. Our approach to this problem is to combine a recently developed state lattice planner using controller-based motion primitives (SLC) with planning using adaptive dimensionality (PAD). The SLC planner allows for robust navigation using a wide variety of sensors including in areas with no or limited high-quality localization information while the PAD planner allows us to expand beyond a single robot and generate plans for a team of robots operating in a high dimensional space. We present our results to this combined approach for a UGV/UAV team operating indoors in areas with limited visual features.",

Our non-linear probabilistic latent variable model encodes relationships between grasp-related parameters, learns the importance of features, and expresses confidence in estimates. The model learns associations between stable and unstable grasps that it experiences during an exploration phase. We demonstrate the applicability of the model for estimating grasp stability, correcting grasps, identifying objects based on tactile imprints and predicting tactile imprints from object-relative gripper poses. We performed experiments on a real platform with both known and novel objects, i.e., objects the robot trained with, and previously unseen objects. Grasp correction had a 75% success rate on known objects, and 73% on new objects. We compared our model to a traditional regression model that succeeded in correcting grasps in only 38% of cases.",

In addition to generating collision-free trajectories for each agent, our approach is able to simulate macroscopic group movements and proxemic behaviors that result in coherent navigation. Our approach is general, makes no assumptions about the size or shape of the group, and can generate smooth trajectories for the agents. Furthermore, it can dynamically adapt to obstacles or the behavior of other agents. The additional overhead of generating proxemic group behaviors is relatively small and our approach can simulate hundreds of agents in real-time. We highlight its benefits on different benchmarks.",

We extend the reciprocal velocity obstacle formulation by using conservative linear approximations of ellipses and derive sufficient conditions for collision-free motion based on low-dimensional linear programming. We use precomputed Minkowski Sum approximations for real-time and conservative collision avoidance in large multi-agent environments. Finally, we present efficient techniques to update the orientation to compute collision-free trajectories. Our algorithm can handle thousands of elliptical agents in real-time on a single core and provides significant speedups over prior algorithms for elliptical agents.

We first present a new method to compute the graph neighbors in order to reduce the complexity of each iteration, from O(|V|2) to O(|V| log |V|). We then show how to delay expensive intermediate computations until we know that new information will be required, hence saving time by not operating on information that is never used during the search. Finally, we present a way to remove the very expensive need to calculate a full multi-scale map with the use of sampling and derive an upper bound on the probability of failure as a function of the number of samples.",

Risk averse policies are needed when large deviations from the expected behavior may have detrimental effects, and conventional MDP algorithms usually ignore this aspect. We provide conditions for the structure of the underlying MDP ensuring that approximations for the exact problem can be derived and solved efficiently. Our findings are novel inasmuch as average value at risk has not previously been considered in association with the total cost criterion. Our method is demonstrated in a rapid deployment scenario, whereby a robot is tasked with the objective of reaching a target location within a temporal deadline where increased speed is associated with increased probability of failure. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only produces a risk averse policy reducing the probability of exceeding the expected temporal deadline, but also provides the statistical distribution of costs, thus offering a valuable analysis tool.",

The proposed device provides both tactile and proximity information with high spatial resolution on the same scale of coordinates, that is necessary while grasping small and complicated-shaped objects using a robotic hand. In our proposed device, tactile information is obtained as infrared image through a light conductive plate, which allows the capture of a tactile image of high spatial resolution using a camera. Proximity information is detected based on stereo matching of a pair of images obtained by two cameras. By using a compound-eye camera, we constructed a compact device so that the sensor can be mounted on the robotic hand. Through experiments with 6 DoF robotic arm and robotic hand equipped with the proposed sensing device, we show that the robotic motion for searching, approaching and grasping can be controlled based on sensor information obtained from only the proposed device. In addition, our combined sensing approach enables an adaptive grasping motion of the robotic hand.",

        "abstract": "We present a new Active Learning approach for classifying objects from streams of 3D point cloud data. The major problems here are the non-uniform occurrence of class instances and the unbalanced numbers of samples per class. We show that standard online learning methods based on decision trees perform comparably bad for such data streams, which are however particularly relevant for mobile robots that need to learn semantics persistently. To address this, we use Mondrian forests (MF), a recent online learning algorithm that is independent on the data order. We present an extension of that algorithm and show that MF are less overconfident than standard Random Forests. In experiments on the KITTI benchmark, we show that this leads to a substantially improved classification performance for data streams, rendering our approach very attractive for lifelong robot learning applications.",

        "abstract": "Tactile manipulation is the ability to control objects in real-time using the sense of touch. Here we examine tactile manipulation from the perspective of active touch with a biomimetic tactile sensor, which combines tactile perception with control of sensor location. Experiments are performed with the tactile fingertip mounted as end effector to a robot arm, to manipulate (roll) a cylinder in contact with the fingertip. Performance is validated with offline (cross-validation) and online (real-time operation) assessments. Location perception is finer than the sensor resolution, leading to superresolved tactile manipulation along a complex trajectory. However, the original methods were non-robust to large unknown disturbances of object location, necessitating modification of the perceptual process to diminish prior beliefs relative to past posterior beliefs. In consequence robust and accurate tactile manipulation was attained. In general, it appears there is a trade-off between the responsiveness to unknown change and manipulation accuracy, which must be set appropriately for each task.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for estimating the contact event between sensor-free active subtracks, named flippers, of an articulated tracked vehicle (ATV) and the terrain surface. The main idea is to consider both the moving base link and unexpected collisions dynamics as disturbances of the flipper dynamics. On this basis we extend the generalized momenta fault detection and isolation (FDI) method to compute the residual dynamics of the flippers, without resorting to additional sensory information. Under the hypothesis that the residual signal presents disturbance patterns that can be discriminated by those generated by unexpected collisions of the flippers with the ground, we apply a classification method to recover the contact event. The wavelet packet transform is used to decompose the signal and to generate a feature space for the residual, from the different subbands. Finally, sparse SVM, based on feature selection discriminates the contact signal.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Cloud Robotics techniques based on Learning from Demonstrations suggest promising alternatives to manual programming of robots and autonomous vehicles. One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Fr\u00e9chet distance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The dynamics of many large-scale robotic formation systems, including structured systems as well as some random scale-free networks of agents, can be accurately described using fractional-order differential equations. A fractional-order differential equation can contain derivative terms with non-integer order, e.g., the one-half derivative. This paper demonstrates that the fractional order of the dynamics of a system may be a potentially powerful new way to monitor the operational status of such systems. When the order of the system changes, it can indicate an important change in the status of the system. Integer-order models will never exhibit a change in order because the order is dictated by a natural first principle and the structure of the system. For this reason, traditional health monitoring tools essentially focus on identifying parameter variations in a mathematical description of the system, but not changes in order. When fractional-order models are considered, the infinite number of possible real-valued orders between any two integer orders may capture essential changes in the system's dynamics. This paper provides an example of such changes, provides a theoretical justification for the approach, and explores possible limitations to the approach.",

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires grasping a wide range of objects. Tactile sensing is presumed to provide essential information in this context, but there has been little work examining the tactile sensor signals produced during realistic manipulation tasks. This paper presents tactile sensor data from grasping a generic object in thousands of trials. Position error between the hand and object was varied to model the uncertainty in real-world grasping, and a grasp outcome prediction was done using only tactile sensors. Results show that tactile signals are highly variable despite good repeatability in grasping conditions. The observed variability appears to be intrinsic to the grasping process, due to the mechanical coupling between fingers as they contact the object in parallel, as well as numerous factors such as frictional effects and inaccuracies in the robot hand. Using a simple machine learning algorithm, grasp outcome prediction based purely on tactile sensors is not reliable enough for real-world responsibilities. These results have implications for improved tactile sensor system and controller design, as well as signal processing and machine learning methods.",
