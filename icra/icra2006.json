        "abstract": "We consider the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) for the class of indoor mobile robots equipped only with stereo vision. Our goal is to construct dense metric maps of natural 3D point landmarks for large cyclic environments in the absence of accurate landmark position measurements and motion estimates. Our work differs from other approaches because landmark estimates are derived from stereo vision and motion estimates are based on sparse optical flow. We distinguish between landmarks using the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT). This is in contrast to current popular approaches that rely on reliable motion models derived from odometric hardware and accurate landmark measurements obtained with laser sensors. Since our approach depends on a particle filter whose main component is the proposal distribution, we develop and evaluate a novel mixture proposal distribution that allows us to robustly close large loops. We validate our approach experimentally for long camera trajectories processing thousands of images at reasonable frame rates",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 99 g finger joint that can exert a very strong fingertip force of more than 100 N. We have shown that a simple five-bar linkage can be used as a load-sensitive continuously variable transmission (CVT) for a finger joint. The maximum fingertip force of our previous finger was limited by the mechanical strength of its links and bearings, not by the power of its DC motor. If the machine strength can be improved, a much greater fingertip force can be expected. To design a lightweight CVT with sufficient mechanical strength, we analyze the internal force of the CVT and select light plain bearings. We also analyze the stress by using the finite element method and select the materials of its links. Experimental results verify that the maximum fingertip force is more than 100 N near the singular configuration of the CVT and the maximum angular velocity is more than 550 deg/s. These motions are impossible without the CVT. We also developed a very light shape memory alloy brake of 0.56 g. The CVT with the brake can hold a fingertip force of more than 100 N not only near the singular configuration. The electric energy consumed by the brake is much less than that by the DC motor",

Single cell manipulation is important for biological research, and 3D 6DOF manipulation (position control and orientation control) is useful technique in many biological experiments. In this paper we propose 3D synchronized laser manipulation system that can manipulate multiple micro-objects along separate trajectories in 3D space. The position as well as the orientation of microbeads can be controlled using this system. We succeeded in achieving orientation control of the microbead by using the laser trapped microtools.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the design of a control law for vision-based robot navigation. The method proposed is based on a topological representation of the environment. Within this context, a learning stage enables a graph to be built in which nodes represent views acquired by the camera, and edges denote the possibility for the robotic system to move from one image to an other. A path finding algorithm then gives the robot a collection of views describing the environment it has to go through in order to reach its desired position. This article focuses on the control law used for controlling the robot motion's online. The particularity of this control law is that it does not require any reconstruction of the environment, and does not force the robot to converge towards each intermediary position in the path. Landmarks matched between each consecutive views of the path are considered as successive features that the camera has to observe within its field of view. An original visual servoing control law, using specific features, ensures that the robot navigates within the visibility path. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach",

        "abstract": "For robust 3D object recognition in the environment having diverse variances, it is necessary to increase the certainty by using consecutive scenes rather than using a single scene and combining different features. This paper proposes a novel 3D object recognition and pose estimation approach based on combining photometric feature (SIFT) and geometric feature (3D lines) in a sequence of scenes. In order to utilize the consecutive scenes, we use the particle filtering method and all particles which represent the possible pose of object are generated by each feature. These particles are to be spread out where the object is considered to exist, and the probability of each particle is obtained through matching test with each feature in the scene. Then the particle sets derived from SIFT and 3D lines are fused and it gives a pose of the object estimated. For the sake of computational efficiency, this recognition system is performed in a hierarchical process. In this paper, we also introduce a simple method to decide the next best view position based on results of recognition. Lastly we have proved through experiments that the proposed methods are feasible",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and validate an entropy minimization algorithm for solving the SLAM problem in the 6DOF case with semi-sparse (stereo) data. The proposed SLAM solution relies on both an efficient and robust strategy for egomotion estimation and an effective global rectification strategy. Our global rectification method is scalable because it relies on dynamically compressing actions, in order to reduce the number of variables to optimize, and thus on integrating/fusing observations. We have implemented a wearable stereo device that runs the SLAM algorithm in real time and we have tested such implementation both in indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our experiments show that action compression is a critical element for yielding acceptable and efficient solutions to the global optimization problem in the 6DOF case",

        "abstract": "The present paper proposes an electrostatic actuator that realizes two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion of various sheet-like objects. The actuator utilizes electrostatic actuation technology based on induced charges. The technology can directly handle sheet objects, such as papers and plastic films with a particular surface resistance. The structure of the actuator is flat and thin, and thus it can be easily embedded on any desktop so that the desktop can have a function to physically interact with users. With the function, the desktop can be automated in such a way that it drives various objects on it to help users perform various desktop tasks. The prototype actuator presented here uses wire mesh as its electrode panel to realize two-DOF motion. The structure of the wire mesh and basic driving principle of two-DOF actuation are described. The challenge that arises when utilizing wire mesh panel is that actuations for objects can be sometimes coupled if there are multiple objects on the panel; for example, if we try to move only one object, the other objects nearby would move together unexpectedly. To solve this problem, the paper proposes a selective actuation technique that realizes handling of any one object with keeping other objects at rest",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a two-degrees-of-freedom haptic interface to investigate the brain mechanisms of human motor control, which is capable of safely and gently interacting with human arm motion during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A hydrostatic transmission separates the interface into a master and an MR compatible slave system, allowing the placement of all interfering components outside the electromagnetic shield of the MR room. The transmission mirrors force and motion of the master actuators on the slave system placed close to the MR scanner. The parallel architecture takes advantage of the linear MR compatible actuators and allows human subjects to perform reaching movements comfortably in the small workspace limited by the dimensions of the MR scanner and the biomechanics of the arm. The kinematic structure of the slave interface was optimized with respect to the available space and types of movements to be investigated. Materials were chosen based on their MR compatibility, their stiffness and weight. The interaction force with the subject is measured over two optical force sensors, located close to the output of the interface. Two shielded optoelectronic encoders measure the extension of the slave hydraulic pistons. Detailed tests demonstrated the fMRI compatibility even during movement of the interface",

A generalized Bayesian formulation is proposed to construct a joint probabilistic representation of the current situation is used as a basis in conjunction with predefined priority information in the decision making process. To cope with the computational intractability of a full probabilistic solution, two methods of approximation were studied. Instead of maintaining the full probabilistic representation of the environment, the first method utilizes a utility function created from the initial joint probability density. The utility function is then evolved according to sensor observations taken of the environment. The second method samples the initial density and track its evolution via a particle filter. It is shown that the second method out performs the first",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "muUAVs have found increasing utility as a platform for visual data collection about an area of interest. One user-friendly way of presenting visual data about the area of interest is to create a mosaick of all data observed by the muUAV, absolving the user from having to watch the entire flight video. In addition, because multiple frames in the video sequence will in general observe an area of interest, super-resolution techniques can be applied to yield a mosaick with higher resolution than the camera on-board the muUAV. While super-resolution and mosaicking are both well studied problems, muUAVs present some interesting challenges in combining the two capabilities. Most super-resolution algorithms work within a constrained environment where the size of the superresolved image is fixed and known a priori. Mosaicking, however, is the process of creating a dynamically-sized image from multiple fixed-sized images, where each input image could contain visual data on previously unobserved areas. In this paper, we present a system that can do both: construct a mosaick, incorporating data on previously unobserved areas, while super-resolving the mosaick for areas that are observed by multiple input images",

        "abstract": "We present a particle filtering algorithm to construct topological maps of an uninstrument environment. The algorithm presented here constructs the posterior on the space of all possible topologies given measurements, and is based on our previous work on a Bayesian inference framework for topological maps (A. Ranganathan and F. Dellaert, 2004). Constructing the posterior solves the perceptual aliasing problem in a general, robust manner. The use of a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) for this purpose makes the inference in the space of topologies incremental and run in real-time. The RBPF maintains the joint posterior on topological maps and locations of landmarks. We demonstrate that, using the landmark locations thus obtained, the global metric map can be obtained from the topological map generated by our algorithm through a simple post-processing step. A data-driven proposal is provided to overcome the degeneracy problem inherent in particle filters. The use of a Dirichlet process prior on landmark labels is also a novel aspect of this work. We use laser range scan and odometry measurements to present experimental results on a robot",

Besides the well-known difficulty of large state space and large action space, the pervasive application of digital computers forces us to consider the new constraint of limited memory space. The given memory space restricts what strategies can be explored during the optimization procedure. By explicitly quantifying the minimal memory space to store a strategy using support vector machine, we propose to describe simple strategies exactly and only approximate complex strategies. This selective approximation can best utilize the given memory space for any description mechanism. We use numerical results on illustrative examples to show how the selective approximation improves the solution quality.

Behaviors at different level of resolution are not only coordinated by the motor schema layers but also through units called \"evaluators\" which fuses state and activity of behaviors according to priorities and cross-couplings in runtime. Concurrent, sequential, asynchronous multi-robot task allocation is based on \"market based auction algorithm\" with a novel efficient non-linear time varying fitness calculation enhancing fairness and fault tolerance. A 3D simulation environment is developed to test the proposed architecture for fairness, fault tolerance, mission accomplishment rates, and coverage",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a bioinspired concept of locomotion for small autonomous robots. Scale effects in locomotion highly influence gait efficiency and in lightweight micro-robots jumping can be more energetically efficient than just walking or climbing. In addition, a jump can make the robot overcome obstacles and uneven terrains. Inspired by nature, the actuation of the proposed robot is entrusted to loaded springs. During the flight phase, energy from an electric micro-motor is collected in springs, while it is released by a click mechanism during take-off. In this way instant power delivered by rear legs (about 5 W) is much higher than the one provided by the motor (0.3 W). Passive compliant legs and low-power actuation result in light, efficient micro-robot, designed to have long autonomy for environment exploration and monitoring. In order to verify these assumptions, a quadruped prototype was developed, with two active rear limbs and passive elastic forelegs. Robot Grillo is 50 mm long and weighs about 10 grams. In conservative simulations the microrobot reaches a forward speed of 1.5 m/s, which corresponds to about 30 body length s-1",

The robot and the bipedal gait are underactuated, using only one actuated degree of freedom per compliant leg. We doubled up RHex's hind legs by attaching a duplicate set of hind legs at 180deg, forming 'S' shaped legs. This reduces the actuator speed requirements during non-contact, while preserving the bipedal dynamics and control challenges. Stable running at average speeds between 0.67 and 1.07 m/s with a success rate of 100% over thirty runs is obtained with only leg angle and body orientation feedback",

Convergence guarantees are provided in both cases using tools form algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov analysis. The results are verified through computer simulations.

Tongue movements within the human oral cavity create unique, subtle pressure signals in the ear that can be processed to produce command signals in response to that movement. The strategy developed for the human machine interface architecture includes energy-based signal detection and segmentation to extract ear pressure signals due to tongue movements, signal normalization to decrease the trial-to-trial variations in the signals, and pairwise cross-correlation signal averaging to obtain accurate estimates from ensembles of pressure signals. A new decision fusion classification algorithm is formulated to assign the pressure signals to their respective tongue-movement classes. The complete strategy of signal detection and segmentation, estimation, and classification is tested on 4 tongue movements of 4 subjects. Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that the ear pressure signals due to the tongue movements are distinct and that the 4 pressure signals can be classified with over 96% classification accuracies across the 4 subjects using the decision fusion classification algorithm",

        "abstract": "A device for robot-assisted brachytherapy has been designed for use with a minimally-invasive surgical robot such as the ZEUStrade It may be loaded with a standard brachytherapy needle allowing the robot to position its tip at a specified location within cancerous tissue. The device accurately retracts a hollow needle loaded with radioactive seeds while a stationary plunger pushes the seeds out into the tissue. The position error when retracting the needle is less than 0.05 mm. The use of this device, together with image-guidance for needle placement, can improve radiation dose delivery when treating certain types of lung cancer. The incorporation of this device into robotic systems that are already approved for clinical use can potentially allow it to be commercialized much sooner than competitive technology",

Accordingly, we are developing an inverse of this type of mobile robot that is the height, width, and weight of a person, having a high center of gravity, that balances dynamically on a single spherical wheel. Unlike balancing 2-wheel platforms which must turn before driving in some direction, the single-wheel robot can move directly in any direction. We present the overall design, actuator mechanism based on an inverse mouse-ball drive, control system, and initial results including dynamic balancing, station keeping, and point-to-point motion",

        "abstract": "A legged robot walking on uneven terrain can avoid falling only by applying contact forces with its feet on the ground that compensate for gravity without causing slip. To plan safe motions, it is necessary to test this constraint at every posture explored at each set of foot placements. Since a huge number of postures may be explored, this test must be as fast as possible. Existing approaches either search explicitly for contact forces at each posture, or precompute the support polygon and check that the robot's center of mass lies above it. This paper presents a new algorithm that is faster than either existing approach. This algorithm is an incremental method of projection, that computes only enough of the support polygon to decide whether static equilibrium is possible at each posture. It takes advantage of information gained testing previous postures in order to test subsequent postures more quickly",

An evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the defined objectives optimization is applied to evolve a set of non-dominated alternative solutions, known as the Pareto-optimal set. For convergence improvement of the evolutionary algorithm, the DD-MCMC method is used to generate a set of good initial solutions. Evaluating solutions by using relative dominant relation rather than quantitative absolute difference in value makes the solution exploration not dominated by the poor cue and result in more effective solutions for further decision making. Experimental results to the images obtained from different scene are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework",

The focus in is on the management of the features to achieve real-time performance in extraction, matching and loop detection. For matching image features to map landmarks a modified, rotationally variant SIFT descriptor is used in combination with a Harris-Laplace detector. To reduce the complexity in the map estimation while maintaining matching performance only a few, high quality, image features are used for map landmarks. The rest of the features are used for matching. The framework has been combined with an EKF implementation for SLAM. Experiments performed in indoor environments are presented. These experiments demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the approach. In particular they show how the robot is able to successfully match current image features to the map when revisiting an area",

The system consists of a new light-weight (<10 kg), kinematically redundant, and fully torque controlled robot. Additionally, the pose of the robot tool-center point is tracked by an optical navigation system, serving as an external reference source. Therefore, it is possible to measure and to compensate deviations between the intraoperative and the preoperatively planned pose. The robotic arm itself is impedance controlled. This allows for a new intuitive man-machine-interface as the joint units are equipped with torque sensors: the robot can be moved just by pulling/pushing its structure. The surgeon has full control of the robot at every step of the intervention. The hand-eye-coordination problems known from manual pedicle screw placement can be omitted",

The proposed approach takes advantage of the cascade structure of the system to design a hierarchical controller. The idea is to separate the controller in a high level controller devoted to position control and a low level controller devoted to stabilization and attitude control. Both controllers are designed by means of backstepping techniques that allow the stabilization of the vehicle's position while on-line estimation of the unknown aerodynamic forces. The global stability of the connected system is proven, and simulations as well as experimental results are presented",

First of all, a hybrid system is established to characterize different behaviours of an agent. From the well designed feedback linearization control law, the autonomous agent which is composed by wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM) switches well-depicted behaviours such as obstacle avoid, target approach, cruise, grasp etc. from the feedback signals. Next, a two-level control architecture is devised for the WMM system, where the first level mainly handles sensor feedback subject to sensor fusion, whereas the second level is responsible for providing a well performed supervisory control that can manipulate all available surrounding resources to successfully accomplish the aforementioned mission. An actual WMM is developed, named The Treasure Hunter (TTH), which is able to hunt treasures in an unknown environment whereby the effectiveness of the proposed approach is satisfactorily demonstrated",

The vision component uses Gabor wavelet filters for texture analysis to find ruts and tracks from which the road vanishing point can be inferred via Hough-style voting, yielding a direction estimate for steering control. The ladar component projects detected obstacles along the road direction onto the plane of the front of the vehicle and tracks the 1-D obstacle \"gap\" due to the road to yield a lateral offset estimate. Several image- and state-based tests to detect failure conditions such as off-road poses (i.e., there is no road to follow) and poor lighting due to sun glare or distracting shadows are also explained. The system's efficacy is demonstrated with full control of a vehicle over 10+ miles of difficult roads at up to 25 mph, as well as analysis of logged data in diverse situations",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel design and analysis of a hyper-redundant continuous robot (biological continuum style manipulator), actuation system, and control strategy. The robot includes 8 flexible segments, though it can be extended to more segments as necessary. In this study the gravity of the springs is neglected due to the manipulation force is much larger than these gravity forces. This mechanism exhibits a wide range of maneuverability and has a large number of degrees of freedom. Each segment is designed using a novel flexible mechanism based on the loading of a compression spring in both transverse and axial directions and using cable-conduit systems. The forward kinematics of the mechanism is also presented and lends itself well to computer control. It is shown that the solution of the transverse deflection of each segment is obtained in a general form, while the stiffness coefficients are obtained in closed form. A prototype robot segment is experimentally tested, the results are verified. A bench-top actuation system has been developed and a control scheme used in prosthetic hand control has been implemented to control the mechanism",

Previous anthropomorphic robot hands have thumbs that are biologically-inspired but kinematically-simplified. In order to study the biomechanics and neuromuscular control of hand function, an anatomical robotic model of the human thumb is constructed for the anatomically-correct testbed (ACT) hand. This paper presents our ACT thumb kinematic model that unifies a number of studies from biomechanical literature. We also validate the functional consistency (i.e. the nonlinear moment arm values) between the cadaveric data and the ACT thumb. This functional consistency preserves the geometric relationship between muscle length and joint angles, which allows robotic actuators to imitate human muscle functionality",

The testbed system consists of a set of load motors whose shafts are connected to those of the joint prototypes through some torque transducers. A controller modifies the dynamics of the load motors to match the nonlinear and coupled dynamics of a manipulator links. This is made possible by incorporating the measurement of joint angles, velocities, and joint torques as well as dynamics model of the manipulator links in a composite feedforward/feedback loop. The testbed system also permits thermal-vacuum testing in order to simulate a space-like hostile environment. This makes the facility particularly useful for development and validation of new joints for space manipulators. The system is experimentally validated by comparing trajectories of the joint angles, velocities, and torques of a set of joint prototypes obtained by installing them first on a real robot and then on the mechatronics testbed",

In order to produce a seamless and nonredundant model, we integrate the data, and represent the overlapping area with triangular patches. However, few conventional methods have paid attention to integrating images with different resolutions. We propose a new integration method in which geometric and topological information are used. Experimental results show that our proposed method is efficient for integrating multiple range images",

While this allows for provable stability, there are performance costs associated with the lack of long-distance information. We introduce the acute angle switching algorithm, which allows a small number of long-range interactions in addition to interactions with nearby neighbors, without sacrificing provable stability. We prove several formal properties of the acute angle switching algorithm, including system-wide connectivity. Further, we show simulation results demonstrating the efficacy and robustness of multi-robot systems based on the acute angle switching algorithm",

        "abstract": "A new generation of inexpensive robotic pan-tilt cameras can maintain high-resolution panoramic displays of natural environments. However, the pan-tilt mechanisms are imprecise: small errors can produce large errors in the panoramic display. It is thus important to accurately estimate pan-tilt values. We present a new calibration algorithm that does not rely on calibration markers or fixed orthogonal edges which are rarely available in natural scenes. Our calibration algorithm uses image variance density to optimally estimate camera pan and tilt values by incrementally refining image registration using overlapping images from prior frames. Experiments suggest that the new calibration algorithm can reduce calibration error by 81%. In a companion paper, we present a new image registration algorithm based on spherical projection that optimally aligns the resulting frames",

        "abstract": "Motion planning algorithms enable us to find feasible paths for moving objects. These algorithms utilize feasibility checks to differentiate valid paths from invalid ones. Unfortunately, the computationally expensive nature of such checks reduces the effectiveness of motion planning algorithms. However, by using hardware acceleration to speed up the feasibility checks, we can greatly enhance the performance of the motion planning algorithms. Of course, such acceleration is not limited to feasibility checks; other components of motion planning algorithms can also be accelerated using specially designed hardware. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a great platform to support such an acceleration. An FPGA is a collection of digital gates which can be reprogrammed at run time, i.e., it can be used as a CPU that reconfigures itself for a given task. In this paper, we study the feasibility of an FPGA based motion planning processor and evaluate its performance. In order to leverage its highly parallel nature and its modular structure, our processor utilizes the probabilistic roadmap method at its core. The modularity enables us to replace the feasibility criteria with other ones. The reconfigurability lets us run our processor in different roles, such as a motion planning co-processor, an autonomous motion planning processor or dedicated collision detection chip. Our experiments show that such a processor is not only feasible but also can greatly increase the performance of current algorithms",

        "abstract": "As mobile robots become increasingly autonomous over extended periods of time, opportunities arise for their use on repetitive tasks. We define and implement behaviors for a class of such tasks that we call continuous area sweeping tasks. A continuous area sweeping task is one in which a group of robots must repeatedly visit all points in a fixed area, possibly with nonuniform frequency, as specified by a task-dependent cost function. Examples of problems that need continuous area sweeping are trash removal in a large building and routine surveillance. In our previous work we have introduced a single-robot approach to this problem. In this paper, we extend that approach to multi-robot scenarios. The focus of this paper is adaptive and decentralized task assignment in continuous area sweeping problems, with the aim of ensuring stability in environments with dynamic factors, such as robot malfunctions or the addition of new robots to the team. Our proposed negotiation-based approach is fully implemented and tested both in simulation and on physical robots",

In this league each team consists of both a human player, mounted on a Segway HT scooter, and a robotic version of the Segway; both human and robot players must cooperate to score goals. This paper details the design of our robotic Segway soccer brain-based device (SS-BBD). The SS-BBD control system is based on a large scale neural simulation, whose design is dictated by details from the published literature on vertebrate neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and psychophysics. The physical device is completely autonomous, and possesses special manipulators for kicking and capturing a full-sized soccer ball. The SS-BBD uses visual and laser rangefinder information to recognize a variety of game related objects, which enables it to perform actions such as capturing the ball, kicking the ball to another player, shooting a goal, and maneuvering safely across the field. The SS-BBD can act autonomously or obey voice commands from the human player. This is an unprecedented level of human-robot teamwork on a soccer field, in that our players are not merely acting autonomously, but also communicate with each other and support each other on the field",

In this paper, we propose a simple and elegant solution to these issues. To enlarge the field of view of the cameras, we use omnidirectional cameras. And to overcome the model dependency problem, we propose a new visual servoing method for omnidirectional cameras that does not need any measure of the 3D structure of the observed target with respect to which the visual servoing is performed. Only visual information measured from the reference and the current images are needed in order to compute a task function isomorphic to the camera pose and to compute the control law to be applied to the robot. We provide the theoretical proof of the existence of the isomorphism and the theoretical proof of the local stability of the control law",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a new motion control hardware architecture is proposed for improved motion performance of robotic manipulators during high speed motion. The main idea is to remove the servo control loop from the DSP (digital signal processor) to a FPGA (field programmable gate array), and utilize the high speed hardwired logic of the FPGA to enhance the computation capability and relieve the computing load on the DSP. The control algorithm is partitioned into a linear portion and a nonlinear portion. The linear portion with position/velocity feedback represents the major control loop and is implemented in the FPGA. The nonlinear portion acts as dynamic compensation to the linear portion to perform complex modeling related calculations, and is implemented in the DSP. A new FPGA-based motion control IC is designed to realize this new control hardware structure. Experiments were conducted on a Yamaha robot manipulator to compare new control architecture and the existing one, when the same control algorithm was used. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed new control architecture exhibits much improved motion performance especially during high-speed motions",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis relative to the experimental performances of an asymptotically fast and incremental algorithm, recently developed to compute collision translations for pairs of convex polyhedra. The algorithm may be worth considering because it solves a proximity problem which is less widely addressed than distance, as well as because of its peculiar computation strategy, well suited to work without initialization, but also endowed with an inherently embedded mechanism to exploit spatial coherence. Numerical data characterizing the behavior of the algorithm with respect to the complexity of the polyhedra have already been discussed elsewhere, thus here the main focus is on contrasting its performances with those of two popular algorithms designed to compute distances between polyhedra. Although the considered \"yardsticks\" answer different proximity queries, and although one of the techniques is meant to deal with general polyhedra, the results presented in this paper should help to assess the efficacy and potential of the approach under analysis. All the three algorithms, indeed, share the same kind of application context; moreover, on the basis of the asymptotic bounds discussed in the literature, distances and collision translations require similar computational efforts. A thorough comparison of the reported query times and, more significantly, of the corresponding trends seems to show that the behavior of the novel algorithm is quite interesting, especially when used without initialization, what should encourage further work on its peculiar approach",

Though the passive walker is mechanically simple, it is a sort of hybrid system that combines the continuous dynamics of leg-swing motion and the discrete event of leg-exchange. In this paper, we focus on the mechanism of fixed point. We demonstrate a physical principle of gait generation and its stabilization derived from the mechanism of fixed point. Based on the principle, we made a simple improvement on passive walker with knees. The passive walker could have high stability, and could walk on treadmill for 4010 steps",

In this paper we present a Monte Carlo expectation maximization algorithm for recovering the connectivity information (i.e. topological map) of a network using only detection events from deployed sensors. The technique is based on stochastically reconstructing samples of plausible agent trajectories allowing for the possibility of transitions to and from sources and sinks in the environment. We demonstrate robustness to sensor error and non-trivial patterns of agent motion. The result of the algorithm is a probabilistic model of the sensor network connectivity graph and the underlying traffic trends. We conclude with results from numerical simulations and an experiment conducted with a heterogeneous sensor network",

        "abstract": "We present a real-time 3D camera based on IR (infrared) structured light suitable for robots working in home environment. First, we implemented a HOC (hierarchical orthogonal coding) based FPGA board. The HOC gives robust depth images because the signal separation coding provides not only the separation of overlapped codes, but also a robust decision on pixel correspondence with error correction. The FPGA module can handle high computational cost of HOC based signal separation coding. Second, we implemented a compact optic system of the camera to project and receive IR structured light. The invisible IR pattern light provides users inconvenient in the home environment. Various objects and workspaces which has continuous and/or non-continuous surface are tested and, sensitivity to illumination change and processing time are analyzed. The experiment results show the robust performance for surface smoothness, color, and materials of objects used in home environment. The proposed approach opens a greater feasibility of applying structured light based depth imaging to a 3D modeling of cluttered workspace for home service robots",

Reinforcement learning approach is proposed which is inspired from \"how\" the learning is achieved in real insects in nature.

The connection strategy identifies components of motion during the roadmap construction and plans the roadmap edges on a sequence of configuration slices approximating the configuration spaces of the components. The goal of the approach is to extend the dimensionality of the problems PRM planners can solve, and the strategy it deploys is dimensional subdivision. We report experimental results on serpentine robots with up to 150 degrees-of-freedom and multi-robot systems with up to 144 degrees-of-freedom. The test problems are beyond the capability of a representative state-of-the-art PRM based planner, and the approach presented in this paper enables the use of motion planning methods in solving new high-dimensional problems",

In applying periodic inputs with appropriate frequency and phase shift, the snake-like robot is capable of smooth propulsion.

By using the sensor function into the snake-like robot, it is considered that autonomous propulsive motion can be realized by feedback of the sensor signal. In this paper, we consider the autonomous locomotion of the snakelike swimming robot with IPMC actuator/sensor, and verify the realization of swimming motion by feedback of the sensor signal. Furthermore, the efficiency of the autonomous locomotion is investigated",

We compare the robot used to a semi-robotic toy whose use initially suggested to us the benefits of social community models in the presentation of robotics to the elderly. We find that even where individual encounters are significant, sensitivity to social dimensions improve the benefits of these encounters",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method that enable a domestic robot to show emotions with its facial expressions. The previous methods using built-in facial expressions were able to show only scanty face. To express faces showing various emotion, (e.g. mixed emotions and different strengths of emotions) more facial expressions are needed. We have therefore developed a system that converts emotions into robot's facial expressions automatically. They are created from emotion parameters, which represent its emotions. We show that the system can generate facial expressions reasonably",

This method has as the main advantage to be systematic and it also can be applied to hyper-static PKM stiffness analysis. The implementation of the proposed method is fast and convenient and it can easily be involved during PKM design optimization. Moreover, as the stiffness matrix is obtained in a close form, it can be implemented directly on the robot controller. In other words, the proposed method could be used to reduce the gap existing between actual PKM and those that have to meet the high accuracy specifications required for machining applications. At first this paper presents the proposed analytical method that is applied to calculate the stiffness matrix of a delta parallel structure. Then the experimental results that have been done to evaluate and validate its efficiency are presented",

Many efficient algorithms have been proposed to solve the collision-detection problem, and most of them use some sort of hierarchical bounding volume to speed up the time-consuming process. In this research, we focus on a special situation for applications such as interactive virtual environment, where accuracy may not be crucial but the available time for performing the check is limited. We describe our findings on the inherencies of bounding volume traverse trees (BVTT). Based on this observation, we propose a time-budgeted collision detection method that can traverse the critical regions of BVTT earlier if the time budget is limited. Preliminary experimental results are also reported, and a new strategy is suggested based on the concept of confidence value",

        "abstract": "Artificial skin research has focused on three primary characteristics: high density, flexible sensing arrays, and the ability to decompose all three components of an applied force vector. Previous research has accomplished some but not all of these characteristics. In this paper, we present a new flexible, high density sensor array and a triaxial force discernment algorithm that can be used with commercially available flexible high density sensor arrays. Together, the sensing array and algorithm achieve all three of the critical skin characteristics. With an addition of thin silicone pillar arrays, the triaxial force discernment algorithm provides a direct solution for nearly all possible force directions. Where the solution is ambiguous, our algorithm is able to reduce the uncertainty to a small range of known values. To confirm the validity of the algorithm, a testbed for a single sensing element was developed. Initial results show a resolution of less than 0.01 radians and calculated force components within the uncertainty of the ground truth for most situations. Our approach opens doors for many applications including robotic manipulation, haptic interfaces, human-robot interaction, and medical diagnoses",

It is well-known that force/position control for manipulators is a challenging task, because of strong nonlinearities exhibited by both the manipulator itself and by its environment. Despite the complexity inherent in manipulation processes, the classic single-loop feedback system with its advantages and disadvantages is still preferred in industrial use for force/position control. As interesting alternative we suggest the MFC-p (model-following control) two-loop control structure, which is based on a simple linear 2nd order model. The theoretical as well as the practical properties of this new control scheme are discussed in detail. It is shown that with our approach it is possible to achieve a much better control performance than that provided by a classic PID system. To prove the superiority of the concept, results with industrial manipulators under force control are shown",

Differently from conventional control methods previously proposed for arm-hand systems that adopt a separate design to control each robotic part, such as an arm and a hand, the proposed method designs a unified single control scheme for movements of the whole robotic arm-fingers system. It is assumed that finger-tips are rigid and there are rolling constraints between the finger-tips and a target object, and whole motion of the system is confined to the horizontal plane. The results of numerical computer simulation demonstrate that the proposed method is sufficiently effective in control of such a whole robotic arm-fingers system, and in particular is applicable to superimposed tasks, grasping, regulating, and replacing a target object through composition of the control signal based on the principal of superposition. It is concluded that special attentions in design of control signals should be paid to the wrist that combines the finger parts to the arm",

Commonly, the position of map features is estimated along with the robot pose. However, consistent initialization of these positions is a difficult problem in bearing-only SLAM, in particular for distant landmarks. In previous approaches, measurements to remote landmarks often had to be discarded, thus losing valuable orientation information. In this paper, we present for the first time a unifying framework allowing for non-delayed initialization of both nearby and distant features. This is made possible by a four-element landmark parametrization, combined with a constraint-based inferred measurement",

The proposed method checks if the sum of the gravity and the inertia wrench applied to the COG of the robot, which is proposed to be the stability criterion, is inside the polyhedral convex cone of the contact wrench between the feet of a robot and its environment. The criterion can be used to determine the strong stability of the foot contact when a robot walks on an arbitrary terrain and/or when the hands of the robot are in contact with it under the sufficient friction assumption. The determination is equivalent to check if the ZMP is inside the support polygon of the feet when the robot walks on a horizontal plane with sufficient friction. The criterion can also be used to determine if the foot contact is sufficiently weakly stable when the friction follows a physical law. Therefore, the proposed criterion can be used to judge what the ZMP can, and it can be used in more universal cases",

        "abstract": "For maintaining high stability and production yield of production equipment in a semiconductor fab, on-line quality monitoring of wafers is required. In current practice, physical metrology is performed only on monitoring wafers that are periodically added in production equipment for processing with production wafers. Hence, equipment performance drift happening in-between the scheduled monitoring cannot be detected promptly. This may cause defects of production wafers and the production cost. In this paper, a novel virtual metrology scheme (VMS) that is based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFN) is proposed for overcoming this problem. The VMS is capable of predicting quality of production wafers using real-time sensor data from production equipment. Consequently, equipment performance abnormality or drift can be detected timely. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed VMS is validated by tests on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes in practical semiconductor manufacturing. It is therefore proved that RBFN can be effectively used to construct prediction models for CVD processes",

The key point of the algorithm is that it only requires knowledge of the leader-follower relative distance and bearing. The approach is based on an output feedback controller that uses a high-gain observer to estimate derivatives of UVs relative positions. Both data are measured using a pan-controlled camera on-board the following robot which eliminates sensitivity to information flow among vehicles. A Lyapunov stability analysis guarantees that the closed-loop system is stable and the formation error can be made arbitrarily small. A virtual environment and a vision system are used to validate the proposed methodology",

We present a simultaneous sensor location and mapping method that uses a purely rotating camera as sensor and distant points, ideally at infinity, as features. A smooth constant angular velocity pure rotation motion model codifies the camera location. Because of the sequential EKF approach used, and the number of features in the map, about a hundred, the proposed method has been implemented in real time at standard video rates. Experimental results with real images show that the system is able to close loops with 360deg pan and 360deg cyclotorsion rotations.

        "abstract": "Tomorrow's humanoids will operate in human environments, where efficient manipulation and locomotion skills, and safe contact interactions are critical design factors. We report here our recent efforts into these issues, materialized into a whole-body control framework. This framework integrates task-oriented dynamic control and control prioritization allowing to control multiple task primitives while complying with physical and movement-related constraints. Prioritization establishes a hierarchy between control spaces, assigning top priority to constraint-handling tasks, while projecting operational tasks in the null space of the constraints, and controlling the posture within the residual redundancy. This hierarchy is directly integrated at the kinematic level, allowing the program to monitor behavior feasibility at runtime. In addition, prioritization allows us to characterize the dynamic behavior of the individual control primitives subject to the constraints, and to synthesize operational space controllers at multiple levels. To complete this framework, we have developed free-floating models of the humanoid and incorporate the associated dynamics and the effects of the resulting support contacts into the control hierarchy. As part of a long term collaboration with Honda, we are currently implementing this framework into the humanoid robot Asimo",

        "abstract": "Frequently, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) must operate in turbulent ocean environments with complex spatio-temporal variability. Energetic flows, instabilities and currents can strongly perturb safety conditions and development of AUVs operations. A priori knowledge of this ocean variability would allow to adequately plan AUV missions, minimizing the possible negative effects of the environment on its operation. Unfortunately, present oceanographic technology is only capable to forecast large and slow components of the ocean variability, being fast and small scales of variability still unpredictable. This partial knowledge about future environmental conditions degrades AUV robustness, reducing its autonomy and safety. In this article, we propose a class of real-time algorithm to support AUVs navigation in strong turbulent ocean environments characterized by unpredictable small scale variability. The algorithm infers the two-dimensional structure of the current field in a limited region in front of the AUV, using the one-dimensional information obtained from an horizontal acoustic doppler current profiler (H-ADCP). Then, a planner locally optimizes the performance of the AUV in the inferred field. In this work reducing travelling time was of interest. The proposed procedure has been tested on simulated turbulent environments. Results indicate that, although sub-optimals, solutions provided by the algorithm required significantly less travelling time than straight line paths. An example where the proposed methodology increases AUV safety and autonomy is also provided",

Through examples, it is shown that the previous force reflection methods are not applicable to the kinematically dissimilar BTSs. Two kinds of RSP methods using a novel concept, instantaneous restriction space (IRS), are implemented for impedance and admittance type of BTSs. Especially, new developed obstacle avoidance algorithm using the redundancy of the slave manipulator makes the RSP method applicable to all kinds of kinematically dissimilar BTSs. Experiments verify that the RSP method is powerful to describe the restriction space at the slave side without force sensors",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we consider a single hand-held camera performing SLAM at video rate with generic 6DOF motion. The aim is to optimise both the localisation of the sensor and building of the feature map by computing the most appropriate control actions or movements. The actions belong to a discrete set (e.g. go forward, go left, go up, turn right, etc), and are chosen so as to maximise the mutual information gain between posterior states and measurements. Maximising the mutual information helps the camera avoid making ill-conditioned measurements appropriate to bearing-only SLAM. Moreover, orientation changes are determined by maximising the trace of the Fisher information matrix. In this way, we allow the camera to continue looking at those landmarks with large uncertainty, but from better-posed directions. Various position and gaze control strategies are first tested in a simulated environment, and then validated in a video-rate implementation. Given that our system is capable of producing motion commands for a real-time 6DOF visual SLAM, it could be used with any type of mobile platform, without the need of other sensors",

        "abstract": "Functional brain exploration methodologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are critical tools to study perceptual and cognitive processes. In order to develop complex and well-controlled fMRI paradigms, researchers are interested in using active interfaces with electrically powered actuators and sensors. Due to the particularity of the MR environment, safety and compatibility criteria have to be strictly followed to avoid risks to the subject under test, the operators or the environment, as well as to prevent artifacts in the images. This paper describes the design of an fMRI compatible mechatronic interface based on MR compatibility tests of materials and actuators. In particular, a statistical test is introduced to evaluate the presence of artifacts in the image sequences that could negatively affect the fMRI studies. The device with two degrees of freedom, allowing one translation with position-feedback along a horizontal axis and one rotation about a vertical axis linked to the translation, was realized to investigate the brain mechanisms of dynamic tactile perception tasks. It can be used to move and orient various objects below the finger for controlled tactile stimulation. The MR compatibility of the complete interface is shown using the statistical test as well as a functional study with a human subject",

This snake-like robot is designed for distal dexterity enhancement in MIS surgery of the throat. Actuation compensation is required to account for the flexibility of the actuation lines that connect this snake-like robot with its remote actuation units. The paper presents both a naive model-based compensation approach and a combined model-based recursive linear-estimation approach that uses data gathered from external measurements of the snake-like unit configuration such as vision. The kinematic and static model of this multi-backbone snake-like unit is reviewed and a simplified redundancy resolution is implemented in the error compensation model. The results show that the performance of the snake-like unit is significantly improved when compensation is implemented. The combined model-based recursive linear estimation method showed 1deg accuracy in path tracking. Finally, an updated Jacobian that accounts for the required compensation is presented. All the work done here strides the crucial step towards a successful clinical task such as suturing in the throat",

Once weighted by their normalized likelihood scores, these particles estimate a posterior distribution over the possible poses of the robot. This paper 1) introduces a new action model (the system of equations used to determine the proposal distribution at each time step) that can run on any differential drive robot, even from log file data, 2) investigates the results of different algorithms that modify the proposal distribution at each time step in order to obtain more accurate localization, 3) investigates the results of incrementally adapting the action model parameters based on recent localization results in order to obtain proposal distributions that better approximate the true posteriors. The results show that by adapting the action model over time and, when necessary, modifying the resulting proposal distributions at each time step, localization improves-the maximum likelihood score increases and, when possible, the percentage of wasted particles decreases",

We derive a linear formulation of the visuomotor function, which captures this relationship for three dimensional translations. The resulting expression defines how the origin of the world coordinate frame shifts in stereo images as the robot translates. The parameters of the visuomotor function are estimated online by using incremental least squares and are generalized to other coordinate frames origins by using a function approximation method. It follows that the system is able to estimate the three dimensional translations between pairs of stereo points without performing 3D reconstruction or requiring a specific coordinate system and is fully adaptive",

Difficulties are introduced by occlusions, scale changes, as well as disappearance of features with the rotation of targets. In this work, we describe an adaptive geometric template-based method for robust motion recovery from features. A geometric template consists of nodes containing salient features (e.g., corner features). The spatial configuration of the features is modeled using a spanning tree. This paper makes the following two contributions: (i) an adaptive geometric template to model the varying number of features on a target, and (U) an iterative data association method for the features based on the uncertainties in the estimated template structure in conjunction with its individual features. We present experimental results for tracking multiple targets over long outdoor image sequences with multiple persistent occlusions. A comparison of the results of the data association method with a standard Mahalanobis distance gating applied to individual features is also presented",

        "abstract": "A procedure for the calibration of the force-moment sensor of a space robot is reported. In terrestrial applications, such sensors can be calibrated by measuring the sensor output while under known static loads, which are most easily applied using known weights. In zero-g environment, such an approach does not work. A viable alternative is to use the dynamic effects of the motion of a carried payload to load the sensor. For a rigid robot, the displacement of the payload can be inferred from joint-angle measurements using the robot kinematics. However, major space robots are structurally flexible, in which case establishing a similar inference is difficult. Therefore, it is assumed here that a payload with known mass properties is handled by the end-effector, and that the payload displacement is measured directly using a laser vision system. Then, considering the end-effector and the payload to be one rigid-body, their dynamics equations, which are the Newton-Euler equations, are used to design an adaptive observer that simultaneously generates estimates of the motion of the body and identities the calibration matrix of the sensor. In this paper, as a first step, the problem would be solved for planar robots. The performance of the adaptive observer would then be evaluated through simulations",

This paper discusses a new microscope design, called the adaptive scanning optical microscope (ASOM), that is particularly suitable for observing robotic activities at the micron scale. The ASOM combines a custom designed scanner lens, high speed steering mirror, and MEMS deformable mirror to offer the advantages of a greatly expanded field of view, rapid image acquisition, and no agitation to the workspace or specimen. After briefly discussing the challenges of micro assembly and micro manipulation, we present the ASOM theory of operation and include simulated performance results. A low cost proof-of-concept experimental prototype of the ASOM is then described and used to demonstrate shape optimization of the MEMS deformable mirror for different field positions. Realtime tracking of multiple micromanipulators in a workspace and full area coverage are experimentally demonstrated. These results validate the ASOM concept and serve as a crucial step towards realizing a fully operational and high performance ASOM to enable the observation of micro-robotic activities over a large workspace",

The research work on control of rigid-link flexible-joint (RLFJ) robot in the literature has assumed that the kinematics of the robot is known exactly. There have been no results so far that can deal with the kinematics uncertainty in RLFJ robot. In this paper, we present the first study on this problem and propose an adaptive regulation method which can deal with the kinematics uncertainty and uncertainties in both link and motor dynamics of the RLFJ robot system. An observer is designed to avoid the use of acceleration due to the fourth-order overall dynamics. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.

The response of ERF brake systems to this non-linear PI torque control, that utilizes an inverse model, is enhanced through the addition of two key components, a step logic function and an adaptable B-spline based algorithm. The description of each is provided along with tests verifying their effectiveness. In addition, the controller's response to disturbances is provided. The effectiveness of the control is validated through testing on two different electro-rheological fluid based brakes",

At steady state the vehicle needs to compensate for two dynamic effects, the ocean current and the restoring forces; the appropriateness of the adaptive/integral action designed with respect to those persistent effects is discussed. Moreover, for each controller an adaptive/integral PD+gravity-compensation-like version is derived and eventually modified so as to achieve null steady state error under modeling uncertainty and presence of ocean current.

To provide spatial context for human observers, it is desirable to insert the resulting live video into a large spherical panoramic display representing the entire viewing field. Accurate alignment of the video stream within the panoramic display is difficult due to small errors in the robot pan-tilt values and image distortion due to nonlinear projection. Existing image alignment algorithms cannot keep up with rapid changes in camera position. In this paper, we present a constant-time image alignment algorithm based on spherical projection and projection-invariant selective sampling that accurately registers paired images at 25 frames per second on a standard PC. Experiments suggest that the new alignment algorithm is faster than previous algorithms by a factor four or more. In a companion paper, we present a new calibration algorithm based on image variance density that optimally estimates camera pan-tilt parameters",

        "abstract": "To make a mobile robot with real-time vision system adapt to the highly dynamic environments and emergencies under the real-time constraints, a significant account of processing power is needed. Instead of pushing the limit of software development and computational resources, and to reduce the system computation time and improve system fault-tolerance, this paper presents an embedded platform which can dynamically reconfigure a mobile robot system on the fly by integrating field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and embedded processors in a system-on-chip (SOC) environment. The BDI agent model is adopted as the unified agent structure, which significantly simplify the HW/SW partitioning and communication. A self-reconfigurable platform is also proposed to improve the hardware flexibility. This proposed embedded framework has been applied to a real-world mobile robot, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency",

These systems can be susceptible to rollover, particularly during severe maneuvers. This paper presents an analysis of rollover stability measurement for mobile robots operating at high speeds. The analysis examines the accuracy of a commonly accepted rollover stability metric during operation on sloped and rough terrain. The effects of sensor placement, center-of-gravity position estimation error, and wheel dynamics are examined. It is shown that these effects can have a significant impact on stability measurement during high speed operation",

The proposed algorithm is motivated by recent work in image-based visual servoing control for under-actuated dynamic systems. In this paper, we show that the placement of the camera significantly affects the zero-dynamics of an under-actuated rigid body in a closed-loop image based visual servo control loop. We show that the zero-dynamics due to mechanical coupling of actuator forces can be cancelled in closed-loop by correct placement of the camera. This leads to improved robustness and performance of image based visual servo control design for small flying robots. The results are simulated on a model of ducted fan UAV to demonstrate the potential advantages",

        "abstract": "Although below-knee prostheses have been commercially available for some time, today's devices are completely passive, and consequently, their mechanical properties remain fixed with walking speed and terrain. A lack of understanding of the ankle-foot biomechanics and the dynamic interaction between an amputee and a prosthesis is one of the main obstacles in the development of a biomimetic ankle-foot prosthesis. In this paper, we present a novel ankle-foot emulator system for the study of human walking biomechanics. The emulator system is comprised of a high performance, force-controllable, robotic ankle-foot worn by an amputee interfaced to a mobile computing unit secured around his waist. We show that the system is capable of mimicking normal ankle-foot walking behaviour. An initial pilot study supports the hypothesis that the emulator may provide a more natural gait than a conventional passive prosthesis",

        "abstract": "This paper explores a cooperative manipulation method for orienting and translating convex objects in the plane. The manipulation task is performed by two agents using the concept of \"virtual fence\". During the manipulation, each agent makes a point contact with the object, and two agents push together along a straight-line. One advantage of a virtual fence over physical fence is that virtual fence can manipulate non-polygonal parts, and reduce the position and orientation uncertainties simultaneously. Moreover, the coordination between agents increases the flexibility of the manipulation system. We first identify two manipulation primitives, equilibrium and non-equilibrium pushes, and characterize the motion of the object under these two pushing actions. Then, we study the planning problem in the framework of switched system, and develop a fully analytical solution to the planning problem. Finally, manipulation examples and experiments are provided to demonstrate the proposed manipulation method",

        "abstract": "Positioning a robot with respect to objects by using data provided by a camera is a well known technique called visual servoing. In order to perform a task, the object must exhibit visual features which can be extracted from different points of view. Then, visual servoing is object-dependent as it depends on the object appearance. Therefore, performing the positioning task is not possible in presence of non-textured objects or objects for which extracting visual features is too complex or too costly. This paper proposes a solution to tackle this limitation inherent to the current visual servoing techniques. Our proposal is based on the coded structured light approach as a reliable and fast way to solve the correspondence problem. In this case, a coded light pattern is projected providing robust visual features independently of the object appearance",

CAMX Frameworks implement Publish/Subscribe of XML messages through an entity called the Message Broker (MSB). In order to create scalable frameworks, distributed MSB systems need to be deployed. In the distributed case, the topology optimization problem arises, as clients need to be assigned to one of several available MSB nodes. The problem is a variation of the graph partitioning problem, known to be NP-complete. The problem is augmented with weighted directed edges, multiple levels of cluster capacity, complex weight functions, and multiple optimization criteria. A solution was developed based on an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm. The developed algorithm was tested for optimizing two flexible electronics assembly systems used as case scenarios. Robust convergence time was bounded to a few seconds, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed algorithm for rapid topology reconfiguration in response to changes in the system",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an improved method for the geometrical calibration of parallel robots for which the structure is based upon some parallelogram mechanisms. Its originality is to identify the complete geometry of the mechanism's parallelograms, and to compensate the positioning error of the TCP (tool centre point), due to the infinitesimal rotation of the traveling plate, induced by the parallelogram geometrical errors. The main difficulties are: (i) to derive the calibration model relative to all geometrical parameters, and (ii) to reuse the identified errors in a control model in order to compensate the positioning errors. In fact, the position relationship taking into account the full geometry of the parallelograms is difficult, not to say impossible, to derive in a close form; therefore a linear approximation of the model is proposed. The formulas necessary to run the method on a Delta robot are given. Then a simple mechanism is used to illustrate the benefits of this method compared to classical ones",

We unify the calculation of the goal configuration with searching for a path in order to avoid the uncertainties inherent to selecting goal configurations which may be unreachable because they currently lie in components of the free configuration space disconnected from the initial configuration. We adopt workspace heuristic functions that implicitly define goal regions of the configuration space and guide the extension of rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), which are used to search for these regions. The algorithm has successfully been used to efficiently plan reaching and grasping motions for a humanoid robot equipped with redundant manipulator arms",

An additional challenge in multiple-robot systems is to coordinate robot activity to best track targets with limited visibility. We describe a novel technique that combines a particle filter target model with a potential field robot controller. Robots are attracted to points sampled from the particle cloud that models the probability distribution over the target's position, subject to environmental constraints. We show how this method can be used as a coordination strategy whereby a team of robots cooperatively minimize the uncertainty in the pose of a tracked target. Simulation results are presented",

The method includes many ways to grow the tree, some taking into account the obstacles in the environment. This planner works best in difficult areas when planning for free flying rigid or articulated robots.

        "abstract": "This paper deals with mechanical stiffness control of multi-DOF joint. It fundamentally mimics the skeleto-muscular system of human articulation, in which at least two muscles cooperatively handle one DOF under their antagonistic action. In the first part of the paper one describes a novel actuator called ANLES (actuator with non-linear elastic system) that mimics a skeletal muscle in the sense of having a non-linear elasticity. Next one introduces a basic formula for controlling stiffness of the joint as well as its angles using multiple ANLESes. A new mechanism for the wrist joint having three DOF is proposed on the practical feasibility base, in which only four ANLESes with one additional DC-motor are used to control the stiffness of the three DOF wrist. It follows the simulation analysis for evaluating the controllability of the stiffness. It also shows the one DOF wrist joint controlled by two ANLESes",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) have been demonstrated to be very promising for planning paths for robots with high degrees of freedom in complex 3D workspaces. In this paper we describe a PRM path-planning method presenting three novel features that are useful in various real-world applications. First, it handles zones in the robot workspace with different degrees of desirability. Given the random quality of paths that are calculated by traditional PRM approaches, this provides a mean to specify a sampling strategy that controls the search process to generate better paths by simply annotating regions in the free workspace with degrees of desirability. Second, our approach can efficiently re-compute paths in dynamic environments where obstacles and zones can change shape or move concurrently with the robot. Third, it can incrementally improve the quality of a generated path, so that a suboptimal solution is available when required for immediate action, but get improved as more planning time is affordable",

This research studied pre-movement EEG from shoulder-elbow movement in stroke survivors to identify signal characteristics potentially useful for robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation. Pre-movement event-related desynchronization (ERD) was examined in the alpha band mu rhythm for control (n = 7) and stroke subjects (n = 11). Subjects were all right-hand dominant; stroke subjects used their impaired arm and controls were assigned a side to match stroke subjects. Both non-dominant-arm-tested stroke and control subjects exhibited greater ERD intensity vs. those using their dominant arm (p < 0.05). Also, pre-movement ERD was detected in stroke survivors, which suggests at the possibility of using ERD as a BCI system control signal. However, the peak ERD of stroke survivors was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects (p < 0.05), which brings doubt to whether the intensity of ERD in stroke survivors is large enough to be used as a BCI system control signal",

The algorithms for calculation of hinge joint axis of rotation and ball joint center of rotation were employed. The joint angles were obtained in two ways, from known centers of joint rotation and by solving inverse kinematics for finger from given positions of fingertips. The lengths of finger segments, calculated by using data from statistical anthropometry, do not differ notably from the lengths obtained from calculated centers of rotation of joints. The angles obtained by inverse kinematics are comparable to the angles obtained from estimated centers of rotation. Minimalistic approach makes the method suitable for calibration of a sensor glove",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new \"assist-as-needed\" (AAN) training paradigm for rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries via robotic training devices. In the pilot study reported in this paper, nine female adult Swiss-Webster mice were divided into three groups, each experiencing a different robotic training control strategy: a fixed training trajectory (fixed group, A), an AAN training method without interlimb coordination (Band Group, B), and an AAN training method with bilateral hind-limb coordination (Window Group, C). Fourteen days after complete transection at the mid-thoracic level, the mice were robotically trained to step in the presence of an acutely administered serotonin agonist, quipazine, for a period of six weeks. The mice that received AAN training (Groups B and C) show higher levels of recovery than Group A mice, as measured by the number, consistency, and periodicity of steps realized during testing sessions. Group C displays a higher incidence of alternating stepping than Group B. These results indicate that this training approach may be more effective than fixed trajectory paradigms in promoting robust post-injury stepping behavior. Furthermore, the constraint of interlimb coordination appears to be an important contribution to successful training",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For real-time stereo vision systems, the standard method for estimating sub-pixel stereo disparity given an initial integer disparity map involves fitting parabolas to a matching cost function aggregated over rectangular windows. This results in a phenomenon known as pixel-locking, which produces artificially-peaked histograms of sub-pixel disparity. These peaks correspond to the introduction of erroneous ripples or waves in the 3D reconstruction of truly flat surfaces. Since stereo vision is a common input modality for autonomous vehicles, these inaccuracies can pose a problem for safe, reliable navigation. This paper proposes a new method for sub-pixel stereo disparity estimation, based on ideas from Lucas-Kanade tracking and optical flow, which substantially reduces the pixel-locking effect. In addition, it has the ability to correct much larger initial disparity errors than previous approaches and is more general as it applies not only to the ground plane. We demonstrate the method on synthetic imagery as well as real stereo data from an autonomous outdoor vehicle",

A nonlinear complimentary filter exploiting the structure of special orthogonal group S0(3) is proposed. The filter is expressed explicitly in terms of direct and untreated measurements. For a typical low cost inertial measurement where two inertial directions are measured (gravitational and magnetic fields) along with angular velocity, it is shown that the filter is well conditioned. If only a single direction is available (typically the gravitational field) along with angular velocity, it is shown that the full gyro bias vector is correctly estimated and that the estimated orientation converges to a set consistent with the measurements. Experimental results, for flight data from the HoverEyecopy UAV, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed filter",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot systems have to manage their energy wisely in order to complete their missions. Typical approaches seek to conserve energy by energy-efficient motion or sensor planning. This paper puts forth a distributed systems approach to power management. Specifically, it develops and presents AutoPower, which is a model that characterizes robot software systems' computation and communication energy behaviors. With AutoPower, it is possible to make principled decisions about (1) where to deploy software components across the distributed computing resources of autonomous robotic systems, and (2) how the different systems involved should communicate to best meet overall mission objectives. We showcase AutoPower by using a multi-robot search-and-rescue mission as a guiding application. For this scenario, application of the model shows that there are counter-intuitive energy trade-offs in configuring such application software. Further, by using AutoPower to guide deployment and interconnects at runtime, for certain configurations, overall computing system lifetimes can be increased by up to 57% over a base-line configuration",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional free-hand ultrasound imaging consists of capturing a set of ultrasound images with a 2D ultrasound system and their respective locations in order to position them in a 3D reference frame. Usually the clinician performs the acquisition manually through the use of an optical or magnetic localization system attached to the ultrasound probe. To assist the clinician, we propose to use a robotic system to automatically move the ultrasound probe and measure its position. As for manual 3D ultrasound imaging, it is crucial to know precisely the spatial calibration parameters of the ultrasound system in order to perform accurate 3D imaging. Therefore, we propose to automate the spatial calibration procedure. A robotic task is developed to automatically position the ultrasound image on the intersection point of a cross-wire phantom used for spatial calibration. To perform this task, a new visual servoing technique based on 2D ultrasound images is used to control automatically the motion of the ultrasound probe held by a medical robot",

More in general, this technique can be adopted to calibrate any robot bearing sensor. It is based on the extended Kalman filter. It is very simple and allows an automatic self-calibration during the robot motion. It only requires a source of light in the environment and an odometry system on the robot. The strategy is theoretically validated through an observability analysis which takes into account the system nonlinearities. This analysis shows that the system contains all the necessary information to perform the self-calibration. Furthermore, many accurate simulations and experiments performed on a real platform equipped with encoder sensors and an omnidirectional conic vision sensor, show the exceptional performance of the strategy",

Snake-like robot is one of typical example of them. However, to control the robot in the unpredictable environment is very difficult problem, because to model the environment is impossible and much information should be measured to move the robot at the complex unknown environment. In addition, many computational costs are required to calculate control law for many degrees of freedom. In this paper, for the first step, we consider autonomous control of the snake-like robot which moves to a light source on a horizontal plane that has many unknown obstacles. To solve the problems, we show importance of passive mechanism, and realize an autonomous control for a snake-like robot by utilizing the passive mechanism. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, we have developed a snake-like robot and experiments have been carried out. As a result effective behaviors have been realized",

In the following we present the use of mobile robots to address the novel and challenging problem of providing disruption tolerant network service. In disruption tolerant networks, all messages are transported by the physical motion of participants in the network. When these movements do not meet the service demands of the network, network performance can only be improved by adding robots that provide additional network service. The task of controlling such robots is a problem that is NP-hard. To develop an approximate solution, we propose a nullspace-based algorithm for controlling the motion of the added robots. This controller simultaneously optimizes multiple network performance metrics. Experiments that simulate the addition of robots to a real-world disruption tolerant network show that the introduction of mobile robots running our control scheme can significantly improve the performance and service guarantees of a disruption tolerant network",

An inertial measurement sensor and an onboard processing and control unit, used to achieve autonomous hovering, are also described.

        "abstract": "Mobile robots do not adequately represent the objects in their environment; this weakness hinders a robot's ability to utilize past experience. In this paper, we describe a simple and novel approach to create object shape models from range sensors. We propose an algorithm that defines angular constraints between multiple sensor scans of an object. These constraints are used to align the scans, creating a maximally coherent object shape model. We demonstrate the utility of this shape model, consisting of scans and poses, for both object recognition and localization. The results are accurate to within sensor precision",

The difficulty lies on how to absorb the difference of duration between them. This problem is solved through the introduction of a timestep-dependent variable damper for a micro contact model and of error-norm minimization for a macro contact model",

When initial uncertainty is high, estimation of all six parameters precisely is computationally expensive. We propose an efficient Bayesian approach that is able to estimate all six parameters in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios. The approach is termed scaling series sampling as it estimates the solution region by samples. It performs the search using a series of successive refinements, gradually scaling the precision from low to high. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of manipulation tasks. We demonstrate its portability on two applications: (1) manipulating a box and (2) grasping a door handle",

Then, the parameter identification technique for SS-LD model is developed based on the EM algorithm. Finally, we apply the proposed behavior model to a typical man-machine cooperative system, and the usefulness of the proposed model is verified through some experiments",

However the results are not specific, with the odour source only restricted to a broad area. This paper presents a solution to the problem by introducing a second search stage using visual sensing. It therefore comprises a bi-modal, two-stage search, with each stage exploiting complementary sensing modalities. This paper presents details of the method and experimental results",

Our main objective is to enable humans to control the mobile robot much as they drive a car: i.e. by operating a master haptic joystick, they can control the linear velocity and heading angle of the mobile robot, much like they do so with the gas pedal and steering wheel. Passivity of the closed-loop system is also enforced so that, even with communication delays, humans can stably and safely teleoperate the wheeled mobile robot with force-reflection. A semi-experiment (i.e. real master/simulated slave) is performed to validate the proposed framework",

Such prostheses must be endowed with artificial proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensory systems as well as appropriate neural interfaces able to exchange sensory-motor signals between the body and the nervous system of an amputee. Based on consideration of available neurophysiological and behavioral data in humans and on the specific sensory needs to control a prototypical grasp-and-lift task, two kinds of sensors were developed: on-off contact sensor arrays and triaxial force sensors. Both sensor types were characterized and compared with their biological counterparts. Their ability to convey critical information during a lift task was evaluated with the sensors integrated in a biomechatronic cybernetic hand",

Firstly, we illustrate the kinematics and the dynamics of the overall system, which consider not only the fingers and an object, but also three muscles for each finger to actuate the finger links. Secondly, we consider nonlinear muscle property based on several physiological studies, and propose sensory-motor control rule to the muscles in order to realize stable pinching simultaneously with posture regulation by introducing internal force term induced by co-activation between flexor digitorums and extensor digitorums to modulate the damping factor in joint space. We verify our study by numerical simulations and conclude that this dual fingers system can realize human-like stable pinching and posture regulation",

        "abstract": "A new estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) with spline kernel function (EDA_S) is proposed to optimize biped gait for a nine-link humanoid robot. Gait synthesis of the biped locomotion is firstly formulated as a multi-constraint optimization problem with consideration of two objectives, including zero-moment point (ZMP) for dynamically stable locomotion and driving torque for energy efficiency. The parameters to be optimized are joint coordinates at transition poses between three successive phases. Rather than searching in joint angle permutation space directly, the proposed method approximates the probability distribution by Catmull-Rom (CR) cubic spline function and updates them with gradient descent learning strategy. The effectiveness of EDA_S for biped gait optimization has been successfully tested on the simulated model of a humanoid soccer robot. It is shown that the flexible kernel with the updating rule is able to remarkably accelerate the learning speed with comparison to the traditional EDA",

However, the control algorithms are difficult to be used for human-carrying biped walking robots because of modeling errors. In this paper, a landing pattern modification method is proposed which based on nonlinear compliance control. Theoretical compliance displacements calculated from a walking pattern are compared with the actual compliance displacements, while a robot's foot touches slightly uneven terrain. In result, the height of landing terrain is detected, and the preset walking pattern is modified. Using this method, a human-carrying biped robot would be able to walk stably on uneven terrain. This pattern modification method does not need any special sensors except force sensors. Through various walking experiments, the effectiveness of the method is confirmed",

We study the algorithmic design of devices on the bowl feeder track that filter out all but one orientation of a given polyhedral part. In this context, we propose a simple new primitive, consisting of one horizontally mounted convex polygonal metal \"blade\", that can feed a broad class of three-dimensional parts by reorienting and rejecting all but those in a desired orientation. This powerful new 3D geometric feeding primitive combines the reorientation functionality of fences with the rejection functionality of traps. Due to its simplicity, the proposed primitive allows for the development of methods to automate its design process. We present a complete procedure that takes as input any polyhedral part along with its center of mass. Given this input, the procedure identifies all single blade solutions that feed the part. The output is either the set of all valid blade designs or a notification that the part cannot be fed using a single blade",

The control objectives are achieved by exploiting the passivity properties of the system and utilizing barrier function ideas to reshape the control Lyapunov function. The structure of the modified control Lyapunov function is reminiscent of those used in the artificial potential field method. The resulting controllers are modified proportional-derivative controllers which are simple, intuitive, and can easily be implemented in practice. In addition, asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed, all joint velocity constraints are strictly satisfied for all time, and the demanded torque input is bounded in norm, irrespective of the initial condition. The effectiveness of the proposed control design is demonstrated through simulations on a 2-link planar manipulator",

Linearization of the inherent nonlinearities of both the motion and the sensor models frequently drives the solution of the EKF-SLAM out of consistency specially in those situations where location uncertainty surpasses a certain threshold. This paper proposes a robocentric local map sequencing algorithm which: (a) bounds location uncertainty within each local map, (b) reduces the computational cost up to constant time in the majority of updates and (c) improves linearization accuracy by updating the map with sensor uncertainty level constraints. Simulation and large-scale outdoor experiments validate the proposed approach",

Our efforts begin with motivating high-school students to study engineering sciences by increasing their interest in technical issues. This is achieved by a national robotics contest. Besides our work with high-school students, we also focus on projects for undergraduate university students. Several robotics projects and competitions are included into the curriculum of electrical and mechanical engineering and computer science. These projects offer chances to do special assignments and student research projects. It may be important to point out that most of the work described in this paper, including inventing and specifying the projects and organizing the events, has been done by undergraduate and graduate students",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a 1,000 Hz visual feedback using the CMOS+FPGA vision. It is required to obtain positional and angular signals around 1,000 Hz to control a mechanical system. A vision sensor must obtain visual features of a target object, synchronizing its sampling rate to the sampling rate of the control. Thus, we need 1) image capturing over 1,000 Hz with high resolution, 2) visual feature computation at the capturing rate, and 3) visual feature transmission to a control system with little delay. We propose the CMOS+FPGA vision system to realize 1,000 Hz visual feedback. This system consists of a CMOS image detector to capture images at 1,000 Hz and an FPGA to compute image features at this sampling rate. First we introduce the CMOS+FPGA vision system. Second, we show the implementation of the computation of the image gravity center. Then, we show the implementation of matched filter. Finally, we apply the image gravity center circuit to the visual control of a flexible link",

Precise calibration of multi-axis micro force sensors is difficult for several reasons, including the need to apply many known force vectors at precise orientations at the micro force scale, and the risk of damaging the small, fragile MEMS device. In this paper the shape from motion method is introduced for micro force sensors resulting in a rapid and effective calibration technique. Structural-electrostatic coupled field simulations are conducted in order to optimize the sensor design, which is calibrated with the shape from motion method as well as the least squares method for comparison purposes. Calibration results demonstrate that the shape from motion method is an effective, practical, and accurate method for calibrating multiaxis micro force sensors",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Viscoelastic contact is a type of contact which includes, in addition to linear or nonlinear elastic responses, time-dependent relaxation function that governs the contact behavior. The characteristic of the time-dependent relaxation of such viscoelastic contact is typically an exponentially decaying function. Such contacts can be found in anthropomorphic soft fingers, viscoelastic skin with rigid core, and human fingers. In this paper, the nature of viscoelastic contact is investigated, as well as the resulting limit surfaces. Two cases commonly found in robotic grasping and manipulation are discussed: (i) maintaining constant area of contact after the application of normal force, and (ii) maintaining constant normal contact force after the initial contact is made. A significant yet not so intuitive result was that the two important parameters describing viscoelastic contacts can seemingly be specified independently based on theory; however, they generally follow exponentially decaying patterns. In this paper, coherent assumptions are made to correlate the two parameters. It is also found that the nature of contact interface with limit surface has a profound effect on the stability of grasping and manipulation using viscoelastic fingertips. The results can be applied to the design of fingertips and the analysis of robotic grasping and manipulation involving viscoelastic fingers",

We simulated the restoring forces involved under various external mechanical stress to predict the type of force spectra, reversibility, degrees of freedom and irreversible work that may be expected from single-molecule protein manipulation experiments.

The flexions of knees with different pathologies are tracked using an optical tracking system. The screw parameters which describe the transformation of the tibia with respect to the femur in each two successive observation are represented as the instantaneous screw axis of the motion given in its Plucker line coordinate, along with its corresponding pitch. The set of screw parameters associated with a particular knee with a given pathology is then identified and clustered in R6 to form a \"signature\" of the motion for the given pathology. Bone model and two cadaver knees with different pathologies were tracked, and the resulting screws were used to train a classifier system. The system was then tested successfully with new, never trained before data. The classifier demonstrated a very high success rate in identifying the knee pathology",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a controller for a multi-fingered underactuated prosthetic hand based on tendon transmission. The control architecture is implemented in two subsequent and different phases. The first one is the pre-shaping of the hand, based on the grasp type is implemented by stand-alone motion controllers using PID position control algorithms. The desired force closure value is calculated according to the pre-shape measured tendons tension and to the grasping force. In the second phase, the involved fingers rapidly close around the object to perform a balanced distribution of the forces within the hand, as it happens in the human hand. The controller is thus able to perform successfully many stable grasps. An overview of the hardware architecture and the results in terms of grasping capabilities based on Cutkosky grasp taxonomy are also presented",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting collisions of cylindrically shaped rigid bodies moving in three dimensions. This algorithm uses line geometry and dual number algebra to exploit the geometry of right circular cylindrical objects to facilitate the detection of collisions. First, the rigid bodies are modelled with infinite cylinders and an efficient necessary condition for collision is evaluated. If the necessary condition is not satisfied then the two bodies do not collide. If the necessary condition is satisfied then a collision between the bodies may occur and we proceed to the next stage of the algorithm. In the second stage the bodies are modelled with finite cylinders and a definitive necessary and sufficient collision detection algorithm is employed. The result is a straight-forward and efficient means of detecting collisions of cylindrically shaped bodies moving in three dimensions. This methodology has applications in robot motion planning, spatial mechanism design, and workspace analysis of parallel kinematic machines such as Stewart-Gough platforms. A case study of motion planning for an industrial robot is included",

In this paper we present a color classification algorithm that is adaptive to continuous variable lighting.

The GMM is derived from the classified color pixels using the standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and the color model is iteratively updated over time. The novel contribution of this work is the theoretical analysis supported by experiments - that a GMM of two components is an accurate and complete representation of the color distribution of a dichromatic surface",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a method to reduce the landing impact force is proposed for a stable dynamic walking of a humanoid robot. To measure the meaningful landing impact force, a novel foot mechanism, which uses FSRs (force sensing resistors), is introduced as well. Humanoid robot might become unstable during the walking due to the impulsive contact force from the sudden landing of its foot. Therefore a new control method to decrease the landing impact force has been required. In this paper, time domain passivity control approach is applied for this purpose. Ground and the foot of the robot are modeled as two one-port network systems which are connected and exchanging energy each other. And, the time domain passivity controller which has the landing impact force as input and foot's position to trim off the force as output, is implemented. Unlike previous works, the proposed controller can guarantee the stability of the robot system without any dynamic model information at all. The small sized humanoid robot, HanSaRam-VI which has 25 DOFs, with the proposed foot mechanism is developed to verify the proposed approach through dynamic walking experiments",

Smooth trajectory is developed using parametric polynomial approximation, and continuous steering control is designed to track the trajectory exactly. The algorithm works for car-like robots which have nonholonomic motion constraints, and the control inputs are represented by analytic functions of trajectory parameters. The design is finally extended to cooperative sweeping of multiple robots. Satisfactory performances are observed in simulations",

        "abstract": "Quasistatic multi-legged locomotion consists of a sequence of equilibrium postures where the mechanism supports itself against gravity while moving free limbs to new positions. A posture maintains equilibrium if the contacts can passively support the mechanism against gravity. This paper is concerned with identifying and computing equilibrium postures for mechanisms supported by frictional contacts in a three-dimensional gravitational field. The complex kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body B having the same contacts with the environment and a variable center of mass. The identification of equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts is reduced to the identification of center-of-mass locations of B that maintain equilibrium stances while all nonlinear frictional constraints are satisfied. Focusing on 3-contact stances, this paper provides an exact formulation for the boundary of the center-of-mass feasible region R as a solution of implicit polynomials. The paper also provides a conservative polyhedral approximation of R by using techniques for projection of convex polytopes. The exact and approximate computations of R are demonstrated with graphical examples",

By adding or removing modules it is possible to adjust the area covered by the skin as well as the number (and density) of tactile elements. The skin is therefore highly modular and thus intrinsically scalable. Moreover, because the substrate on which the modules are mounted is sufficiently pliable to be folded and stiff enough to be cut, it is possible to freely distribute the individual tactile elements. A tactile skin composed of multiple modules can also be installed on curved surfaces. Due to their easy configurability we call our sensors \"cut-and-paste tactile sensors.\" We describe a prototype implementation of the skin on a humanoid robot",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to evaluate the mapping error present in point cloud terrain maps created using robotic vehicles and range sensors. This work focuses on mapping environments where no a priori ground truth is available and self consistency is the only available check against false artifacts and errors. The proposed error measure is based on a disparity measurement between common sections of the environment that have been imaged multiple times. This disparity measure highlights inconsistency in the terrain map by showing regions where multiple overlapping point clouds do not fit together well. This error measure provides the map interpreter with a localized error measurement to help judge the validity of the final point cloud or gridded surface. It is shown that the proposed method highlights mapping errors more clearly than a principle component based measure used in the 3D modelling community. Results are presented for bathymetric mapping over natural terrain in the deep ocean using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) outfitted with navigation sensors and a multibeam sonar system",

It shows that the algorithm degenerates with time, regardless of the number of particles used or the density of landmarks within the environment, and would always produce optimistic estimates of uncertainty in the long-term. In essence, FastSLAM behaves like a non-optimal local search algorithm; in the short-term it may produce consistent uncertainty estimates but, in the long-term, it is unable to adequately explore the state-space to be a reasonable Bayesian estimator. However, the number of particles and landmarks does affect the accuracy of the estimated mean and, given sufficient particles, FastSLAM can produce good non-stochastic estimates in practice. FastSLAM also has several practical advantages, particularly with regard to data association, and would probably work well in combination with other versions of stochastic SLAM, such as EKF-based SLAM",

Among others, these maps are of special interest for efficiently managing large-scale environments, and for accurate localization. For achieving that, local geometric maps are stored in the nodes of a graph-based global map. In this paper we present a novel approach for automatically obtaining those local maps from observations. The method considers the space sensed in each observation as a node of a graph with arcs representing the space overlap between observations. The recursive partition (cut) of this graph produces groups of strongly connected nodes from which consistent local maps for accurate localization are derived. The proposed partition technique is well-grounded in the spectral graph theory of, and it is formulated for any type of sensor observation. We depict an implementation for grouping 2D laser scans, and show experimental results with real data that demonstrate the performance of the method",

This paper provides an expressive language for specifying system constraints. We also describe a coordination architecture capable of quickly finding an optimal or near optimal solution to the combined problems of task allocation, scheduling, and path planning subject to system constraints. We address a perceived lack of benchmarks for this research area by establishing a repository open to the research community which includes a set of benchmarks we designed to illustrate some of the complexities of the problem space. Finally, we evaluate various algorithms on these benchmarks",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of building efficient coverage paths for a team of robots. An efficient multirobot coverage algorithm should result in a coverage path for every robot, such that the union of all paths generates a full coverage of the terrain and the total coverage time is minimized. A method, underlying several coverage algorithms, suggests the use of spanning trees as base for creating coverage paths. Current studies assume that the spanning tree is given, and try to make the most out of the given configuration. However, overall performance of the coverage is heavily dependent on the given spanning tree. This paper tackles the open challenge of constructing a coverage spanning tree that minimizes the time to complete coverage. We argue that the choice of the initial spanning tree has far reaching consequences concerning the coverage time, and if the tree is constructed appropriately, it could considerably reduce the coverage time of the terrain. Therefore the problem studied here is finding spanning trees that would decrease the coverage time of the terrain when used as base for multi-robot coverage algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it provides initial sound discussion and results concerning the construction of the tree as a crucial base for any efficient coverage algorithm. Second, it describes a polynomial-time tree construction algorithm that, as shown in extensive simulations, dramatically improves the coverage time even when used as a basis for a simple, inefficient, coverage algorithm",

The dorsoventral movement of the tail produces the thrust, and bending of the body in the horizontal plane enables turning maneuvers. A dual-microcontroller structure is proposed to drive the oscillating multi-link rear body and the mechanical flippers. Swimming performance of the prototype robotic dolphin is tested, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the dolphin-like movement in propulsion and maneuvering",

A control structure is implemented for both motion and contact forces that accounts for under-actuation due to the virtual joints. A strategy is also implemented to address transitions between different contact states. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate this overall framework for many behaviors such as standing, walking, jumping, and hand manipulation with walking",

The robot is modeled as a switched system. A position controller is used for the free motion and a force controller for the contact task. The goal is to stabilize the robot in contact with the environment and exert a desired force. The surface is modeled by an unknown, nonlinear elasticity function. By considering typical candidate Lyapunov functions for each of the two discrete system states, conditions on feedback gains are derived that guarantee Lyapunov asymptotic stability of the hybrid task. A sufficient condition that ensures that the robot will remain in contact with the surface is derived involving the system's velocity at the time of contact",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a technique for creating 2 1/2D grid maps of unstructured, outdoor environments, while traveling at high speeds, using an inexpensive nodding 2-D laser rangefinder. The nodding mechanism allows the acquisition of multiple range data sets for terrain in front of the robot. While these multiple data sets alleviate some of the problems traditionally associated with laser rangefinders, they also introduce a new set of problems. The paper investigates and quantifies factors that determine the accuracy of a map generated using a nodding laser rangefinder and derives an optimal basis for minimizing these errors. This research has determined that the most significant source of errors, for a nodding laser rangefinder configuration, are the roll, pitch and yaw accuracy for the laser beam. A variance weighted statistical approach was implemented to optimally fuse the range data into the 2 1/2D grid map. Simulations and experiments were conducted, demonstrating the performance of the variance weighted technique as superior to classical statistical methods",

Furthermore this control scheme requires adjustment of certain parameters in order to prevent saturation of the manipulator's actuators, and therefore the robot has been studied in terms of manipulability. The proposed movement control scheme has been implanted in the ERM robot used to carry out trials on thirty two patients",

        "abstract": "The Berkeley lower extremity exoskeleton (BLEEX) is a load-carrying and energetically autonomous human exoskeleton that, in this first generation prototype, carries up to a 34 kg (75 Ib) payload for the pilot and allows the pilot to walk at up to 1.3 m/s (2.9 mph). This article focuses on the human-in-the-loop control scheme and the novel ring-based networked control architecture (ExoNET) that together enable BLEEX to support payload while safely moving in concert with the human pilot. The BLEEX sensitivity amplification control algorithm proposed here increases the closed loop system sensitivity to its wearer's forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The tradeoffs between not having sensors to measure human variables, the need for dynamic model accuracy, and robustness to parameter uncertainty are described. ExoNET provides the physical network on which the BLEEX control algorithm runs. The ExoNET control network guarantees strict determinism, optimized data transfer for small data sizes, and flexibility in configuration. Its features and application on BLEEX are described",

We define a nine-dimensional abstraction of the swarm that has a product structure of the six-dimensional Euclidean group and a three-dimensional shape, and is independent of the number of robots. The group captures the pose of an ellipsoid spanning the swarm with semiaxes given by the shape variables. The overall abstract description is invariant to robot permutations. In addition, the shape is also invariant to left actions of the group. This description allows one to define and control the behavior of the swarm at a high level, with automatic generation of individual robot control laws. We present simulation results for controlling swarms of rotorcrafts",

        "abstract": "In this paper, in order to improve tracking accuracy and satisfy multiple closed-loop performance specifications simultaneously during high-speed, high-acceleration trajectory tracking for a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar parallel manipulator, we propose a new control approach, termed convex synchronized (C-S) control. The C-S control is base on the so-called convex combination method and synchronized control. To implement the synchronized control scheme, a feedback signal, termed the synchronization error, is employed, which represents the degree of coordination of the active joints in the parallel manipulator based on the kinematics of the parallel manipulator, and thus tracking accuracy is improved. On the other hand, the convex combination method utilizes the convex property of the required closed-loop performance specifications. Through combining multiple linear controllers, so-called sample controllers, each of which satisfies at least one closed-loop performance specification, a C-S controller is algebraically calculated, which satisfies all closed-loop performance specifications simultaneously. Compared with traditional trial-and-error method, the convex combination method is more straightforward and efficient. Hence, possessing advantages of the synchronized control and the convex combination method, the proposed C-S control method can both improve tracking accuracy and satisfy multiple closed-loop performance specifications simultaneously (MSS). Experiments conducted on a 3-DOF P-R-R type planar parallel manipulator demonstrate the above claims",

A new sampled-data predictive cooperative control is proposed by only using the delayed output feedback information and a set of less restrictive conditions on the connectivity of time varying sensor/communication networks are established. No fixed leader or time invariant sensor/communication networks are assumed. In particular, through the elaborated switching between the decoupled control and the proposed predictive cooperative control, the convergence of the overall system is rigorously proved under a mild condition on the choice of sampling period. Simulation results on the cooperative consensus for a group of mobile robots are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

The strategy first finds the pursuers' capture states at which their FRSs cover the evader's entire FRS so as to improve the possibility of capture. The pursuers approach these capture states from their initial states in feed-forward control at a low sampling rate. Upon reaching the capture states, the pursuers approach and capture the evader in a feedback manner. The proposed strategy was applied to two pursuit-evasion scenarios and compared to the generic motion tracking algorithm. Results show the efficacy of the proposed strategy and its superiority to the motion tracking algorithm",

The key feature of the mechanical design is the use of two decoupled mechanisms for each axle, one used to negotiate steps, and the other to position the axle with respect to the chair to accommodate the overall slope. This decoupling makes many different climbing strategies possible, the overall mechanism becoming extraordinarily versatile from a control point of view. A control system is necessary to synchronize the movements of all the actuators of the wheelchair so that its centre of mass can follow arbitrary spatial trajectories. Different trajectories have been designed in order to keep the seat as erect as possible to guarantee passenger comfort. Experimental results with the real prototype are reported which show the efficiency of our mechanism, the accuracy of the developed kinematic models for control, and the comparison of comfort for two different spatial trajectories",

If we wish to influence their motion, we may be able to take advantage of their local navigation ability and provide only some simple imposed constraints rather than computing and enforcing a detailed path. In this work, we consider the problem of generating a set of constraints, or \"corridor\", under which such an agent (or group of agents) produce an appropriate trajectory. The set of constraints should be both small in number and efficient in terms of length. When producing the corridor, we explicitly consider two different types of obstacles - those which the agents themselves would naturally avoid, such as dense vegetation, and those which they must be forced to avoid, such as sensitive stream environments. This allows both for simplification of the corridor and more natural use of the underlying navigation ability. An implementation and several examples of planned corridors are also presented",

        "abstract": "Bio-material cutting, such as meat deboning, is one the most common operations in food processing. Automating this process using robotic devices with closed-loop force control has shown some promise. The control of the force trajectory directly relates to the internal stress in the material being cut, and must provide enough force to initiate the cut. The ability to model the stress distribution in the bio-materials being cut would provide a better understanding of the influencing factors and help predict the required cutting force for the design of the cutting mechanism and for automating the cutting operations. This research is presented in two parts: part I models the stress distribution when a blade acts on the bio-material and part II discusses the principles of biomaterial cutting. Starting with modeling a point force in the normal and tangential direction on the boundary of a semi-infinite body, an analytical expression for the stress tensor has been obtained and simulated using direct integral method. This paper provides the theoretical basis for explaining the cutting phenomena and predicting the cutting forces, a topic to be presented in part II",

The first component is a quadruped walking robot with reduced-DOF. Since lightweight is an important feature for wall-climbing robots, the DOF of this robot were reduced until three, without hampering its ability as a walking robot. The second one is a sucker using a blower. The adhesion force with a blower is weaker than with a vacuum pump, but the blower can deal better with air leakage. The sucker developed in this research can adhere to walls with many slits and uneven ceiling. Finally, the last component is an ankle joint with wide movable range. This mechanism is indispensable for walking freely in any environment and transferring from wall to wall, wall to ceiling and ground to wall. Moreover, the appropriate compensated motion for wall climbing is considered. The structure of the wall climbing robot has been deformed by the gravity effects. Therefore, the compensated motion should be indispensable for its smooth climbing motion. Wall climbing experiments using the walker developed in this research have been performed with the proposed compensated motion",

        "abstract": "In the eyes of many species, the optical nodal points of the cornea and lens do not lie on the axes of rotation of the eye. During eye movements, this lack of alignment produces depth information in the form of an oculomotor parallax. That is, a redirection of gaze shifts the projection of an object on the retina by an amount that depends not only on the amplitude of the rotation of the eye, but also on the distance of the object with respect to the observer. Species as diverse as the chameleon and the sandlance critically rely on this depth cue to estimate distance. An oculomotor parallax is present also in the human eye and, during natural eye movements, it produces retinal shifts that are well within the range of sensitivity of the human visual system. We have developed an anthropomorphic robot equipped with a pan/tilt head specifically designed to reproduce the oculomotor parallax present in the human eye. We show that replication of sequences of human eye movements with this robot produces accurate estimation of distance. In robotic vision it is often debated whether the dynamic analysis of a visual scene by means of a mobile camera presents advantages with respect to the static analysis provided by a stationary camera with a wide field of view. This study shows that by generating depth information, replication of the dynamic strategy by which humans scan a visual scene greatly facilitates the processes of figure/ground segregation and image segmentation, two of the hardest tasks of machine vision",

        "abstract": "This research aims to develop a portable haptic master hand with 20 degrees of freedom (DOF). Master hands are used as haptic interfaces in master-slave systems. A masterslave system consists of a haptic interface that communicates with a virtual world or an end-effector for tele-operation, such as a robot hand. The thumb and fingers are usually modeled as a serial linkage mechanism with 4 DOF. So far, no 20 DOF master hands are developed that can exert perpendicular forces on the finger phalanges during the complete flexion and extension motion. In this paper, the design and development of a portable 4 DOF haptic interface for the index finger is presented. The concept utilizes a mechanical tape brake at the rolling-link mechanism (RLM) for passive force feedback. The systematic Pahl and Beitz design approach is used as an iterative design method. Important design requirements are; perpendicular forces on the finger phalanges, low friction mechanism, easy to control, no backlash, high backdrivability and lightweight",

        "abstract": "The motion of a free-floating space robot is characterized by the principle of conservation of angular momentum. It is well known that these angular momentum equations are nonholonomic, i.e., are nonintegrable rate equations. If the base of the free-floating robot is partially actuated, it is difficult to attain trajectories of the joints that result in point-to-point motion of the entire robot system in its configuration space. However, if the drift-less system associated with the angular momentum conservation equations is shown to be differentially flat, point-to-point maneuvers of the free-floating robot in its configuration space can be constructed. However, an open research problem in the current literature is to show the property of differential flatness for a general space robot. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) study systematically the structure of the nonholonomic rate constraint equations of a free-floating open-chain space robot with arbitrarily oriented joints and two momentum wheels; (ii) establish the design conditions under which the system exhibits differential flatness; (iii) exploit these design conditions for point-to-point trajectory planning and control of the space robot",

The classifier is designed by binary decision tree and its classification sequence is decided in descending order of classification accuracy. Furthermore, for applying to automated crystallization system, some functions reducing mis-classification are appended to the classifier. The performance of this method has been evaluated by comparing classification result by using proposed method with the result by manual classification",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a problem of reconstructing characters and words. As the basic tool for generating characters, we employ the method of dynamic font, where designing characters and words reduces to the design of 3-dimensional motions of a virtual writing pen. Assuming that some standard characters and words are already designed, we propose a method for transforming their typefaces to the omitted running styles as seen in Japanese calligraphy. Since this is viewed as the problem of redesigning motions of the pen, we introduce a robotic arm with the pen in its hand and plan the hand motion by employing minimum torque change model. By using a velocity linearized model of arm dynamics, we solve the associated optimization problem completely. The solution is given in compact form and the computational process is straightforward as well as stable numerically. Design examples show usefulness of the proposed method",

The mechanisms simulate transverse bending effect of insect wings to achieve high flapping amplitudes. Different configurations of flapping mechanism are studied using dynamic simulations and quasi-steady aerodynamics. Apart from high amplitude, the results show that higher lift can be generated using these designs",

For its size, the iCub is the most complete humanoid robot currently being designed, in terms of kinematic complexity. The eyes can also move, as opposed to similarly sized humanoid platforms. Specifications are made based on biological anatomical and behavioral data, as well as tasks constraints. Different concepts for the neck design (flexible, parallel and serial solutions) are analyzed and compared with respect to the specifications.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a cellular actuator design for a robotic hand. Although the motions of robotic hands are complex, a design of cellular actuator segmentation can be simplified by extracting the features of given postures and using them to design and control the actuator. A method of using captured hand posture data to design the actuator segmentation is proposed. Data from the eight most frequently used hand grips in a daily living, as defined in the sollerman hand function test, is used in this design. The gathered joint angle data is transformed into actuator displacement data and used to generate a segmentation design of the actuator. For segmentation design, feature extraction method, called non-negative matrix factorization with constraints is proposed. The actuator system has 12 SMA actuators each with eight segments, resulting in 96 configurable segments before the coupled segmentation design is applied. The coupling segmentation design effectively groups the segments into clusters which are simultaneously controlled. The segmentation design reduces 96 separately controlled segments to 8, while maintaining the ability to accomplish all desired postures. A robotic hand with five fingers, designed and fabricated using the FDM process, is driven with this actuator system, and eight hand postures are reproduced with the robotic hand",

The mechanical design incorporates DC servo drive, with actuator hardware at each individual joint, allowing reconfigurable link lengths. It has seven degrees of freedom and uses a side mount on a power wheelchair. The control system allows coordinated Cartesian control, and offers expandability for future research, such as coordinated motion with the wheelchair itself. This paper discusses the current state of the art in WMRAs; describes the design goals and user requirements for this device; explains the component selection process; discusses details of the mechanical design, electrical system and low-level controller; covers manufacturing concerns; and describes the testing of the completed arm. Further improvements are also suggested",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study on the development and control of a micro biped walking robot using shape memory alloys (SMAs). We propose a flexible flat plate (FFP) consisting of a polyethylene plate and SMAs. Based on a detailed investigation of the properties of the SMA-based FFP structure, we develop a lightweight micro walking robot incorporating multiple SMA-based FFPs. The walking robot has four degrees of freedom and is controlled by switching the ON-OFF current signals to the SMA-based FFPs. The switching timing, central to the control strategy to achieve walking behavior, is determined through experiments. The micro robot realizes biped walking by transferring the elastic potential energy (generated by deflections of the SMA-based FFPs) to kinematic energy. The resulting micro biped walking robot weighs a mere 2.8 g (with a height of 70 mm). Our experimental results demonstrate the viability and utility of the micro walking robot with the proposed SMA-based FFPs and the control strategy to achieve walking behavior",

In order to transfer more realistic face information, we propose the face shape robot WD-1 (Waseda-Docomo face robot No.1), which can express various face shapes by morphing an average mask (made of SEPTON) through 19 facial control-points. In this study, an average face mask is made in order to express a wide range of shapes with few control points. The position, number and movement range of the control-points are optimized. In addition, we introduce 3-DOFs drive units and control each control-point on a plane, not at a point. In order to evaluate the performance of WD-1, we measure the shape error between the faces of three subjects and the WD-1 equivalents. We elucidate the weaknesses of the current WD-1 implementation: a paucity of control points on the face line and wrinkling of the mask due to excessive local stress",

In this paper, we proposed a master-slave system for laparoscopic surgery, which can provide force feedback to the surgeon without using force sensors. Pneumatic cylinders were used as the actuator of the manipulators to achieve this. First, we developed two forceps manipulators to construct a master-slave system which have 4-DOFs at the tip. A bilateral dynamic control system was then designed using a neural network for acquisition of the inverse dynamics. The obtained inverse dynamics was used as a feedforward controller and to estimate the external force from the differential pressure of the cylinders. Experimental results showed that the developed system successfully display the contact force on the slave side to the operator on the master side",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and development of a 6 degree of freedom robotic manipulator used in the assembly of three-dimensional MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) microstructures. The robot employs a highly innovative mechanical design for the rotational axes to provide unprecedented access to a microchip substrate for microassembly operations. The first three axes of the robotic manipulator are orthogonally mounted linear stages providing Cartesian positioning of the chips beneath the end effector (microgripper). A rotational stage (alpha) mounted on the distal end of these three Cartesian axes allows the MEMS chip to be rotated. Two more degrees of freedom (beta and gamma) are serially mounted to the base frame, allowing for two degrees of rotation of the end effector. This configuration permits assembly of micro-parts on the surface of a MEMS chip at any orientation angle to the surface, within the limits of the workspace of the manipulator and the resolution of the motors. The end effector employs a standard tungsten probe with a passive microgripper bonded to it, which is used for grasping micro-parts. A software system has been developed to allow automatic operation of the manipulator. Preliminary assembly tests confirm the usefulness of the proposed design",

Several leg exoskeletons have been developed by various groups in an attempt to augment the load carrying capability of the human. Previous research efforts have not fully exploited the passive dynamics of walking and have largely focused on fully actuated exoskeletons that are heavy with large energy requirements. In this paper, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton design is presented that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload. Two exoskeleton architectures are pursued based on examining human walking data. A first architecture consists of springs at the hip, a variable impedance device at the knee, and springs at the ankle. A second architecture replaces the springs at the hip with a non-conservative actuator to examine the effect of adding power at desired instances throughout the gait cycle. Preliminary studies show that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle",

        "abstract": "Intraoral radiography is one of the effective diagnosis method for dental clinic, which is used to examine dental caries and gum disease. A patient needs to have a small film inserted in their mouth. The position and orientation of the film are properly adjusted by the dentist. An indicator cone which directs X-ray is set up outside the patient's mouth. The intraoral radiograph provide a dental perspective projection image of the patient's teeth, thus the individual differences of patients make it more difficult to take an appropriate radiograph regardless of the experience of dentist. Recently, the skills of intraoral radiography of Japanese dental students and intern doctors are declining. A conventional education method for intraoral radiography currently conducted does not provide enough time to master intraoral radiographic technique for the dental students, because much time to develop the roentgenogram is necessary. This paper describes the development of a training system for intraoral radiography. The system is composed of a notebook computer, two PHANToM Omni devices, and a dental arch model, where the PHANToM Omni devices are used to measure the position and orientation of a indicator cone and film of the system. We applied the computer graphics technique to draw an intraoral radiograph on the computer display, thus the system enables trainees to practice the intraoral radiography without a X-ray machine, lots of film sheets, and time for the development of roentgenogram. In this paper, we present the system structure, a simulation method for generating an intraoral radiography, and simulation results",

To solve these problems, a feedback based dynamic view planning system is proposed, which not only generate viewpoints from a CAD model of a part, but also recursively add viewpoints according to the measured information. The planning process stops only if the obtained point clouds meet the pre-determined requirements. General framework of the system is introduced, and the experimental results are also presented",

        "abstract": "A wearable sensory system for human lower extremity motion analysis is proposed, and an intelligent computation method for this sensory system is presented. The standard method for human motion analysis is the optical motion analysis using high-speed cameras to record human 3D motion, but this method is only limited in the laboratory research, because it requires expensive devices, large space and time-exhausted calibration experiments. In this study, two low-cost human motion analysis systems are constructed, deferent from the conventional 3D motion analysis system based on high-speed camera. These wearable systems incorporate gyroscopes (ENC-05EB) to measure angular velocities of body segments, and two-axis accelerometers (ADXL202) are used to measure the accelerations for the purpose of leg (foot, shank and thigh) motion analysis in every human motion cycle. The first wearable sensor system is designed for only foot motion analysis and the second system can be used for a leg (foot, shank and thigh) motion analysis. Then based on the two sensor systems, a fuzzy inference system (FIS) is developed for the calculation of the gait phases fed by sensors outputs. A digital filter is also designed to eliminate noises from of the output of the fuzzy inference system, which enhances robustness of the system. Finally, experimental study is conducted to validate the wearable sensor systems using an optical motion analysis system (Hi-DCam)",

        "abstract": "In manipulation, workpieces have to be placed in an exact relationship to other objects that usually constrain the possible motions of the workpiece. Thus, control of a manipulation task can often be done by detecting the changes in the set of constraints acting on the workpiece. In the case of hard positional constraints on rigid objects, the detection can be done using simple thresholds on measured forces and/or moments. When some of these constraints are non-rigid (i. e. elastic), forces and moments vary during motions even if there is no change in the constraints, making it difficult if not impossible to find appropriate thresholds for forces and moments. In such situations changes in the constraints mostly lead to discontinuities (L e. jumps and corners) in the measured force and moment signals. This paper presents a constant time algorithm for jump and corner detection in 1-dimensional sensor signals",

Rather than taking a least-squares approach, we require that the endpoints of the line segments lie on the continuous curve. We show that under these assumptions a single rotational degree of freedom remains. An algorithm is derived to determine the set of angles characterizing the relative orientation of each consecutive pair of line segments as a function of this rotational degree of freedom. Two examples are given to illustrate the procedure. The motivating application for this work is the control of a snake-like robot using a set of gaits designed from shape primitives",

Due to dynamic interaction among slave manipulators as well as communication latency, the control of such systems can be particularly challenging. This paper presents a multimodel discrete-time controller for teleoperation in cooperative environments subject to a known constant communication delay. Discrete-time state-space models that explicitly incorporate signal delays are developed for free motion/soft contact and rigid contact phases of teleoperation. Mode-based linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers are proposed that can deliver a stable transparent response for each phase of operation. Switching among these controllers occur according to the identified phase of contact. The robustness of the controllers with respect to parametric uncertainty is examined via the Nyquist analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

        "abstract": "It has been found that the sensor nodes dissipate a significant proportion of their energy in redundant sensing and idle listening. The former occurs when multiple sensor nodes perform their sensing activity in the same region. The latter occurs when sensor nodes have their radios switched on awaiting incoming communication from other sensor nodes, but none is received since no sensor node is wanting to communicate with it. Researchers have proposed putting the sensors and/or the radios of sensor nodes to sleep (switch them off) so as to conserve energy. The task of scheduling when the sensors and/or radios need to be in sleep/active mode is referred to as sleep scheduling. Sensor sleeping may result in interesting events being missed by the network or may lead to a lower quality of data being sensed. Radio sleeping may lead to communication delays in the network. In this work we propose several distributed algorithms to perform sensor and radio sleep scheduling in wireless sensor networks while trying to minimize its negative impact",

Added block capabilities increase the availability of nonlocal structural knowledge, thereby increasing robustness and significantly speeding construction. In this way we extend the principle of stigmergy (storing information in the environment) used by social insects, by increasing the capabilities of the blocks that represent that environmental information. Finally, we describe hardware experiments using a prototype capable of building arbitrary solid 2-D structures",

Real world applications such as lawn mowing, chemical spill clean-up, and humanitarian de-mining can be automated by the employment of a team of autonomous mobile robots. Our approach builds on a single robot coverage algorithm, Boustrophedon decomposition. The robots are initially distributed through space and each robot is allocated a virtually bounded area to cover. The area is decomposed into cells where each cell width is fixed. The decomposed area is represented using an adjacency graph, which is incrementally constructed and shared among all the robots. Communication between the robots is available without any restrictions. Experiments on both simulated and physical hardware demonstrated the viability of employing the algorithm to perform distributed coverage of a given unknown area with multiple robots",

As computational complexity increases with the number of measurements, centralized algorithms become inefficient. This paper presents a distributed approach for qualitative fault diagnosis of coupled mobile robots. The approach is based on a bond graph modeling framework which incorporates local and distributed control algorithms, multiple sensor types, and both actuator and sensor faults. Relative measurement orderings are introduced to discriminate faults by exploiting the temporal order of the measurement deviations. This increases the discriminatory power of a set of measurements and results in a more efficient qualitative diagnosis algorithm. Distributed diagnosers are designed and applied to coupled mobile robots. Experimental results for a system consisting of two robots pushing a box demonstrate the improvement in both discriminatory power of the measurements and efficiency of the distributed diagnosis approach",

Two measures are developed: the impulsive disturbance robustness measure and the static disturbance robustness measure. It is then shown that these two measures can be expressed as a single disturbance robustness measure, R. This single measure enables underconstrained cable robots to be designed for maximum robustness to both impulsive and static disturbances",

        "abstract": "Distributed robotic teams have long been touted as potential means to avoid sending humans into harmful situations. The ability of robotic teams to operate for extended periods without the fatigue human teams can experience, coupled with the ability to transport a variety of sensing and manipulation equipment and reducing costs of operation make them an attractive solution. Limited sensing capabilities, power, and mobility of individual robotic platforms can be overcome by forming teams of heterogeneous robots. This work addresses the power limitations associated with individual robots, which have finite amounts of power, and thus limited operational lifetimes. This work presents a method by which mobile docking stations can optimize their locations in order to maximize the power available to the deployed robots. Simulated results are presented in which teams of docking stations continuously recover and recharge a much larger team of deployed robots. It is assumed that the deployed robots are able to maintain a communication link between themselves and the docking station. This communication link is used to provide position information and available power to the docking stations. The communication link may be direct from the robot to docking station or it may require the use of ad hoc routing through other deployed robots",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for precise parking for nonholonomic mobile robots: the docking task. It consists in following a planned trajectory and reaching a docking configuration, defined relatively to the environment. The trajectory is deformed in order to reach the docking configuration, to avoid obstacles and to keep the nonholonomic constraints satisfied. A generic framework to compute the docking configuration is presented. Then we give the principle of a nonholonomic path deformation method that was used to deform the planned trajectory towards the docking configuration. This framework has been tested on a real robot with a trailer in a realistic scenario",

There are several research topics related to soft robots such as soft structures or artificial skins, compliance control, soft actuators or artificial muscles, and so on. For the natural muscle potentially has great flexibility, the authors believe the artificial muscle actuator must have a great potential in soft robots. Hence in this study we develop a new type of micro artificial muscle cell, which is an element of an integrated artificial muscle, using electro-conjugate fluid and measure its driving performances. In addition, position control characteristics are also clarified by experiments. As a result, the micro artificial muscle cell using electro-conjugate fluid shows quite good control performances",

        "abstract": "A newly designed lightweight planar parallel manipulator is designed to improve operational speed of electronic manufacturing processes and implement a \"smart parallel manipulator\" through the integration of a parallel mechanism architecture and active control of linkage vibration using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers. Boundary conditions and mode shapes of intermediate linkage are not conventional due to linkages undergoes constrained rigid body motion. Through numerical simulations using a substructuring dynamic model developed for the parallel manipulator, the boundary condition is determined close to a pinned-pinned boundary condition. This conclusion is confirmed using experimental modal analysis (EMA) using a random motion input. However, it is observed that linkage vibration exhibits configuration-dependency. Based on experimental observations, an assumption is taken to simplify the transfer function from the motor input to linkage vibration. Based on this simplification, a dual-mode modal controller is designed and implemented. Experimental results show that linkage vibration is reduced by over 50%",

In order to achieve high-speed regrasping, we propose a new strategy which we call dynamic regrasping. In this strategy, the regrasping task is achieved by throwing a target up and by catching it. In this paper, a regrasping strategy based on visual feedback is presented and experimental results using a high-speed multifingered robot hand and a high-speed vision system are shown. A cylinder is chosen as a specific example of target for dynamic regrasping, with which successful dynamic regrasping tasks are experimentally achieved",

It is determined from the set of admissible speeds and tangential accelerations of the center of mass along the path, subject to the ground force constraints and the geometric path constraints. This paper presents a geometric procedure for computing the set of admissible speeds and accelerations of a planar all-wheel drive vehicle. It first determines the boundaries of the set of resultant forces at the center of mass that satisfy the ground force constraints and the equations of motion along the path. This set is then mapped to the set of feasible speeds and accelerations along the path, from which the dynamic stability margin (DSM) is determined. A byproduct of this procedure is a static stability margin (SSM) that reflects the vehicle's ability to accelerate, or decelerate, at zero speed. Both stability margins are useful as cost measures for physics-based motion planning over rough terrain. The approach is demonstrated for a planar vehicle moving on a sinusoidal track",

A new adaptive algorithm is developed to estimate the unknown parameters on-line based on three original ideas. First, we use the pseudo-inverse of the depth-independent interaction matrix, proposed in our earlier work, to map the image errors onto the joint space so that we can linearly parameterize the closed-loop dynamics of the system. Second, to guarantee existence of the pseudo-inverse, we introduce a potential force to drive the estimated parameters away from the values resulting in singular image interaction matrix. Third, to ensure that the estimated parameters are convergent to their true values up to a scale, we combine the Slotine-Li method with an on-line algorithm for minimizing the errors between the estimated projections and real image coordinates of the feature points. We have proved asymptotic convergence of the image errors by Lyapunov method and demonstrated the performance by experiments",

Successful solutions to forming pickup teams would enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel concept for the actuation of a hyper-articulated robot arm for assembly operations inside an aircraft wing-box. Traditional electromechanical actuators powering individual joints are unsuitable for our purpose, because of limited space and large payload requirements. We propose an underactuated system which uses a single actuator at the base for the deployment of a multi d.o.f. serial linkage structure. Our proposed system exploits gravitational and gyroscopic torques in the system dynamics to rapidly deploy the system. There are no general techniques for the control of such underactuated systems. We develop and compare two approaches for determining the input required for a desired output trajectory and verify the results through simulation and experiments",

        "abstract": "The design of a tiny swimming robot, which is composed of a spiral-type head and an elastic tail, is proposed in this paper. The microrobot is designed for controlled drug delivery as well as a wide range of biomedical applications. It is at the millimeter scale and suitable for swimming under low Reynolds number (Re) environment. The head part of the swimming robot is driven by external rotating magnetic fields, which enables it to be operated wirelessly. The spiral-type head accommodates communication and control units and serves as the base for the elastic tail. When a rotating magnetic field is applied, the head rotates synchronously with the field, generating and propagating driving torque to the straight elastic tail. When the driving torque reaches a threshold, dramatic deformation takes place on the elastic tail. The tail then transforms into a helix and generates helpful propulsive thrust. The entire tail also serves as a drug reservoir in controlled drug delivery operations. This paper's focus is to analyze the dynamics of the microrobot using resistive force theory (RFT), and compare the propulsion performance with other rigid-body microrobots",

The gene transfer process is a highly dynamics process. To achieve effective treatment, the gene transfer process needs to be well understood and controlled. Unfortunately, no dynamics model is available to analyze the process in the literature. In this paper, a dynamics model of the gene gun is proposed. Based on the mathematical model, simulation studies have been conducted. Relations of penetration depth with helium pressure, acceleration distance, macro-carrier mass, and micro-carrier radius are discussed. The results agree well with experimental results in the literature",

In this paper a detailed and a reduced simulation of the biped robot JOHNNIE are presented and results are compared with experimental data. The comparison shows that results for both models correctly predict global dynamics of the system, while some phenomena are only captured by the more complex model",

EMG signals from the flexor and extensor muscles of the elbow joint are used to predict the human elbow joint angle, using an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous output (ARMAX) model. A position tracker is attached in the user upper arm, before the elbow joint. It has been identified from previous works on human physiology that the trajectory of the human hand during planar catching tasks lays on a straight line. This motion law is used in order to monitor and refine the trajectory of the human hand that is predicted through EMG and the ARMAX model. The experimental results show that the ARMAX model estimation for the elbow angle, in conjunction with the trajectory monitoring technique, is able to predict the user motion with high accuracy, within different target points unknown to the system, and various hand velocities",

        "abstract": "A novel approach to real-time tracking of three-finger planar grasp points for deforming objects is proposed. The search space of possible grasping configurations is reduced in two stages - firstly, by fixing one finger at the boundary point nearest to the object centroid and secondly, through a heuristic partitioning of the object boundary where the remaining two fingers are localized. The potential grasping configurations satisfying force closure conditions are evaluated through an objective function that maximizes the grasping span while minimizing the distance between the object centroid and the intersection of the contour normals at the finger contact points. A population based stochastic search strategy is adopted for computing the optimal grasping configurations and re-localizing them as the shape undergoes drastic translations, rotations, scaling and local deformations. Experimental results of grasp point tracking are presented for deforming planar shapes extracted from both real and synthetic image sequences. The current implementation of the proposed scheme operates at 10 Hz for grasp point tracking on shapes extracted through visual feedback",

We first use stereo images to estimate regions which correspond to the road plane and can be considered as static areas. Subsequently, we propose a virtual projection plane (VPP) image that is equivalent to the top view of the road scene. A vehicle's ego-motion is obtained by matching the sequential VPP images of the road patterns in the extracted regions. We use a vehicle-motion model and consider a matching method to easily and accurately determine the ego-motion. Finally, we present experimental results obtained using our method",

The image processing LSI has a dedicated systolic array processor consisting of 64 processing elements to accelerate basic block operations for image feature calculation and correlation-based image matching. The power consumption is only 10 W, about one-seventh that of a typical Pentium 4 personal computer, but the processing speed for correlation matching is roughly three times faster than such a system. With this vision system, we implemented a stereo-vision based navigation algorithm on our mobile service robot and performed a visual navigation experiment in a building hallway",

The robot plans the path between the current position to the next target in an energy-efficient way. Our method reduces repeated coverage, a common problem for most existing utility-based target selecting methods. We conduct simulations for both random and structured environments, and compare our method with a utility-based method that chooses the middle cell from the widest opening. Results show that our method can reduce energy consumption by 42% and traveling distance by 41%",

Thus, visual distortion may be a helpful addition to robotic rehabilitation for brain-injured and stroke patients. In this work, we investigated the effects of distortion on unimpaired subjects learning a two-finger coordinated pinch task. Rather than distorting the subject's goal, we enhanced the apparent error attributable to one or both fingers. Distortion affected the distribution of attention between the two fingers; when the error enhancement was given to one finger, the performance of that finger improved relative to the other. This result indicates that enhanced visual error could be used to manipulate the performance and the coordination pattern between fingers to achieve desired movements during rehabilitation",

Vehicles travel through an environment that possesses a measurable scalar field, with the goal of moving in a desired spatial pattern about a desired constant value contour in the field. Each vehicle measures the local value of the field along its trajectory and shares information about its measurements and trajectory with other vehicles in the platoon. Platoon control involves estimation of a virtual leader trajectory coinciding with the target contour and about which vehicles form. Two approaches to leader estimation are considered. The first involves the synthesis of a common leader trajectory, whereas the second involves decentralized estimation of the leader trajectory by individual vehicles. Under the second approach, platoon control is posed as a two-level consensus problem, where vehicles reach agreement on the leader trajectory at one level and reach formation about the leader at the other level. The decentralized approach is effective even when communication among vehicles is limited. A target application involving an underwater vehicle platoon is considered",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a new error-driven active learning approach to self-growing radial basis function networks for early robot learning. There are several mappings that need to be set up for an autonomous robot system for sensorimotor coordination and transformation of sensory information from one modality to another, and these mappings are usually highly nonlinear. Traditional passive learning approaches usually cause both large mapping errors and nonuniform mapping error distribution compared to active learning. A hierarchical clustering technique is introduced to group large mapping errors and these error clusters drive the system to actively explore details of these clusters. Higher level local growing radial basis function subnetworks are used to approximate the residual errors from previous mapping levels. Plastic radial basis function networks construct the substrate of the learning system and a simplified node-decoupled extended Kalman filter algorithm is presented to train these radial basis function networks. Experimental results are given to compare the performance between active learning and passive learning",

        "abstract": "Group elevator scheduling is important for transportation efficiency in mid-rise and high-rise buildings, and incessant efforts have been made to improve the service efficiency of elevators. Although these efforts have achieved performance improvements, the performance limit remains an open issue. This paper tries to address that goal by estimating the optimal performance of group elevator scheduling with complete knowledge of future traffic information. A two-level minimization formulation is presented, with passenger-to-car at the high level, and single car dispatching at the low level. The low level is formulated as a passenger-to-trip assignment problem by using a concept trip to facilitate the description of single car dispatching strategies. In view of the difficulty to obtain the absolute optimal performance, our goal turns into its upper and lower bounds. The upper bound is obtained by finding a good feasible solution to this problem. The lower bound is obtained by finding the lower bound for a newly constructed problem whose optimal performance is less than or equal to that of the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of our method",

First, we show that the path computed by the network is useful for a simple mobile robot. The robot uses a network of 156 nodes to navigate through a complex, dynamic, environment. This is the largest embedded network used for navigation we are aware of. In our approach, the network nodes do not need to know their absolute or relative positions and the mobile robots do not build any kind of map. Second, the impact of specific network deployments on path quality is examined. Two types of arrangements, hexagonal and rectangular, in two different environments are considered. We present quantitative results collected from a real-world embedded network of 60 nodes. Experimentally, we find that on average, the path computed by the network is only 24% longer than the optimal path. Also, we find a slight advantage for the hexagonal arrangement",

        "abstract": "An important milestone for building affordable robots that can become widely popular is to address robustly the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem with inexpensive, off-the-shelf sensors, such as monocular cameras. These sensors, however, impose significant challenges on SLAM procedures because they provide only bearing data related to environmental landmarks. This paper starts by providing an extensive comparison of different techniques for bearing-only SLAM in terms of robustness under different noise models, landmark densities and robot paths. We have experimented in a simulated environment with a variety of existing online algorithms including Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RB-PFs). Our experiments suggest that RB-PFs are more robust compared to other existing methods and run considerably faster. Nevertheless, their performance suffers in the presence of outliers. In order to overcome this limitation we proceed to propose an augmentation of RB-PFs with: (a) Gaussian sum filters for landmark initialization and (b) an online, unsupervised outlier rejection policy. This framework exhibits impressive robustness and efficiency even in the presence of outliers",

The approach is composed of extraction of features and building a probability grid map using only the footprint of sparse sonar data, estimation of position uncertainty of the feature, and evaluation of the reliable features. A virtual circle association frame model has been developed, which associates two sonar footprints into a virtual circle frame. Using this model, the geometric primitives such as lines, points, and arc features are separately extracted. While extracting the features, a grid map is also built using the orientation probability approach. The position uncertainty of each extracted feature is, then, estimated by considering both the position uncertainty of the robot and the measurement uncertainty of the sonar sensor. Finally, the reliable features among all extracted ones are evaluated from grid association method. The proposed methods have been tested in a real home environment with a mobile robot",

        "abstract": "The ATRON self-reconfigurable robot consists of simple interconnected modules. Modules move relative to other modules and as a result change the shape of the robot. The ATRON modules are difficult to control because of complex motion constraints on the modules. Motion constraints are reduced by using meta-modules composed of three modules. A meta-module may emerge from unstructured groups of modules if three modules are connected in the right configuration. The meta-module then moves on a surface of modules and stop at another position. To attract moving meta-modules and thereby to specify the shape-changing task of the robot we use attraction-points. In this work we evolve a distributed artificial neural network controller for the modules. The controller is identical on every module and controls when a meta-module emerges, how it move and when it stops. In simulation we demonstrate how this control strategy allows the ATRON robot to shape-change to support an unstable roof, build a bridge across a gap and to self-repair a broken bone. We conclude that the control strategy is able to shape-change and self-repair the ATRON robot independent on whether it consists of dozens, hundreds or thousands of modules",

        "abstract": "Many robotics applications require a human operator to monitor multiple robots that collaborate to achieve the operator's goals. Most approaches to such monitoring focus on each robot independently of its peers. When robots are tightly-coordinated, the operator is thus cognitively burdened to build a mental picture of the state of coordination. We report on extensive experiments (approximately 100 hours) with up to 25 human operators, working in two coordinated multi-robot tasks. In these, we contrasted standard displays, which assume each robot is independent, with an ecological socially-attentive display that makes the state of coordination explicit. The results show significant improvements in task completion time, number of failures, and the failure rate. Moreover, the display reduces the variance in operator control, thus leading to significantly more consistent operator performance",

        "abstract": "Conventional cameras have limited dynamic range, and as a result vision-based robots cannot effectively view an environment made up of both sunny outdoor areas and darker indoor areas. This paper presents an approach to extend the effective dynamic range of a camera, achieved by changing the exposure level of the camera in real-time to form a sequence of images which collectively cover a wide range of radiance. Individual control algorithms for each image have been developed to maximize the viewable area across the sequence. Spatial discrepancies between images, caused by the moving robot, are improved by a real-time image registration process. The sequence is then combined by merging color and contour information. By integrating these techniques it becomes possible to operate a vision-based robot in wide radiance range scenes",

        "abstract": "The configuration space of a robot is partitioned into free space and C-obstacle space. Most of the prior work in collision detection and motion planning algorithms is targeted towards checking whether a configuration or a 1D path lies in the free space. In this paper, we address the problem of checking whether a C-space primitive or a spatial cell lies completely inside C-obstacle space, without explicitly computing the boundary of C-obstacle. We refer to the problem as the C-obstacle query. We present a fast and conservative algorithm to perform this C-obstacle query. Our algorithm uses the notion of generalized penetration depth that takes into account both translational and rotational motion. We compute the generalized penetration depth for polyhedral objects and compare it with the extent of the motion that the polyhedral robot can undergo. Our approach is general and useful for designing practical algorithms for complete motion planning of rigid robots. We have integrated our query computation algorithm with star-shaped roadmaps (G. Varadhan and D. Manocha, 2005) - a deterministic sampling approach for complete motion planning. We have applied our modified planning algorithm to planar robots undergoing translational and rotational motion in complex 2D environments. Our algorithm is able to perform the C-obstacle query in milliseconds and improves the performance of the complete motion planning algorithm",

        "abstract": "A robot exploring an environment can estimate its own motion and the relative positions of features in the environment. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms attempt to fuse these estimates to produce a map and a robot trajectory. The constraints are generally non-linear, thus SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear optimization problem. The optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a poor initial estimate. Our approach uses a variant of stochastic gradient descent on an alternative state-space representation that has good stability and computational properties. We compare our algorithm to several others, using both real and synthetic data sets",

        "abstract": "The probability of finding alive a person buried by a snow avalanche decreases dramatically with time. The best chance for the victims is to carry an avalanche beacon or ARVA (from the french: Appareilde Recherche de Victimes d'Avalanche), that transmits a magnetic field that can be detected by the rescuer's ARVA. However, the signals received are difficult to interpret and require people with good training on the actual searching techniques. In this paper we propose to address the search for victims as a SLAM problem: tracking the rescuer location while building a map of the locations of the victims under the snow, using 3D measurements of the magnetic field produced by their ARVAs. Given the high non-linearity of the problem, we propose a technique based on sum of Gaussians (SOGs) and extended Kalman filter. We present preliminary simulation results showing that this technique is faster and more accurate than the classical ones",

The procedure is applicable to rigid linkages (i.e., those that can only adopt a finite number of isolated configurations) and to mobile ones (i.e., those that have internal degrees of freedom). The method is based on the fact that this analysis always reduces to finding the roots of a polynomial system of linear, quadratic, and hyperbolic equations, which is here tackled with a new strategy exploiting its structure. The method is conceptually simple, geometric in nature, and easy to implement, yet it provides solutions of the desired accuracy in short computation times. Experiments are included which show its performance on the double butterfly linkage, for which an accurate an complete discretization of its configuration space is obtained",

        "abstract": "Reliable navigation is a very important part of an autonomous mobile robot system. This means for instance that the robot should not lose track of its position, even if unexpected events like wheel slip and collisions occur. The standard approach to this problem is to construct a navigation system that is robust in itself. This paper proposes that detecting faults can also be made outside the normal navigation system, as an additional fault detector. Besides increasing the robustness, a means for detecting deviations is obtained, which can be important for the rest of the robot system, for instance the top level planner. The method uses two or more sources of robot position estimates, and compares them to detect unexpected deviation without getting deceived by drift or different characteristics in the position systems it gets information from. Both relative and absolute position sources can be used, meaning that existing positioning systems already implemented can be used in the detector. For detection purposes, an extended Kalman filter is used in conjunction with a CUSUM test. The detector is able to not only detect faults, but also give an estimate of when the fault occurred, which is useful for doing fault recovery. The detector is easy to implement, as it requires no modification of existing systems. Also the computational demands are very low. The approach is implemented and demonstrated on a mobile robot, using odometry and a scan matcher as sources of position information. It is shown that the system is able to detect wheel slip in real-time",

        "abstract": "An actuator for a middle-sized flapping flight robot is quantitatively investigated. Flapping flight like that of insects is a potentially useful method of travel for micro robots. Some insect-mimicking robots have been developed, which have actuators with two or more degrees of freedom per wing. For the detailed design of such an actuator, it is necessary to deal with the interaction between the behavior of the actuator and the aerodynamic forces generated by the actuation. In particular, the torque and power requirements of each degree of freedom are essential in the choice of a suitable motor, but it is impossible to determine these without considering the interaction between the driving force of the actuator and the reaction force of the wing from the surrounding airflow. Here, we achieved an analysis of the mechanical aspects of flapping flight, actuator and wing, using finite element analysis based on the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method, which can treat the fluid-structure interaction problem properly. We worked out the spec of motors for the 2DOF actuator, and investigated the structural tolerance. We developed a useful tool for the design of flapping flight robots",

These structures contain vital information of image features and thus provide a novel method for image feature representation. To discover these intrinsic structures, we first propose neighborhood linear embedding (NLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm, to discover neighborhood relationship and global distribution of input data simultaneously. Secondly, NLE is extended to discover the clustering structure of data by incorporating with a Euclidean distance histogram and a series of band pass filters. Finally, by combining with a dimensionality reduction technique, the discovered intrinsic structures are visualized and manipulated in low-dimensional space in the format known as embeddings. The proposed NLE allows the discovery process to adapt to the characteristics of input data. In addition, it is revealed that an image feature composed of image patches can be tracked by tracking the contour containing embeddings of the corresponding image patches",

        "abstract": "This study proposes the analysis of two control strategies for a planar biped. One control makes it possible to find and study the existence of a cyclic motion and its stability, in this approach the avoidance of unexpected rotation of the supporting foot is treated via the control of the center of pressure or CoP. When the task is a simultaneous control of the joints and of the CoP, the system becomes under-actuated in the sense that we have fewer inputs than outputs. This control law is designed to track a desired geometric evolution of the biped configuration, and not the temporal evolution. But the temporal evolution is completely defined and can be analyzed through the study of a model with one degree of freedom. The influence of the desired geometric evolution of CoP on the stability properties of the control law is studied. The second control law improve the performances of the first one by increasing the rate of convergence towards the cyclic motion and enlarging the basin of attraction of the control. This improvement of the performances is possible by forcing the convergence by the control and relaxing the CoP evolution to be within the foot limits",

Shipments in IASHS need to be handled by a large amount of equipment. Thus, optimization-based tactical and operational planning models and methods for how to route the shipments through the network of equipment in IASHS are required for reducing the shipment transit time.

        "abstract": "The problem of stable force-reflecting teleoperation with time-varying communication delay is addressed. A new force reflection algorithm is presented, where the environmental force reflected on the master side can be altered depending on the forces applied by the human operator. This alteration is not felt by the human operator, however, it makes the force reflection safe in the sense it does not destroy the stability of the teleoperator. In particular, using IOS small gain approach, it is shown that the overall stability in the teleoperator system with the force-reflecting algorithm proposed can be achieved theoretically for arbitrarily low damping on the master side and arbitrarily high force-reflection gain. The simulation results are presented that confirm that the proposed scheme allows to decrease master damping significantly, and thus improve the transparency of force-reflecting teleoperation, without sacrificing the overall stability",

        "abstract": "Metal spinning is a plastic forming process that forms a metal sheet by forcing the metal onto a rotating mandrel using a roller tool. A novel metal spinning machine was designed in which the roller is directly driven by linear motors. We aim to form non-axisymmetric products by controlling the pushing force of the roller so that the roller can quickly track the changing radius of the mandrel. Our experimental results show that the linear motors substantially improve response of the force control and non-axisymmetric products can be rapidly formed. Open-loop force control without a force sensor was also studied. It exhibited a comparable performance to closed-loop control with regard to the forming time",

        "abstract": "In this paper, force-controlled microcontact printing using microassembly-based particle templates is investigated. Polystyrene microparticles are assembled semi-automatically into a desired pattern on a glass substrate using an atomic force microscope nanoprobe installed on a nanopositioning stage. The micropattern on glass is sputtered with aluminum and removed of microparticles by ultrasonic vibration, resulting in a template with microfeatures corresponding to the microparticles. A soft lithography method is used to mold elastomeric polymers on the template, resulting in a stamp. The stamp is inked and printed using a force-controlled system onto a polystyrene substrate. Depending on the particle size and contact force, a smaller micro to nanometer sized pattern can be formed. As the spherical patterns on the stamp collapse due to interfacial contact forces, force-controlled microcontact printing is crucial for controlling the size of stamped features. Green fluorescent protein is used as the ink, enabling the use of fluorescent imaging to observe the stamped imprints. Preliminary experiments using 4.5 and 10 mum diameter polystyrene particles shows the feasibility of our technique. Thus it is possible to realize micro/nanopatterns using assembled microparticle-based stamps in high volumes",

        "abstract": "The goal of this research is to develop a new type of haptic interface termed \"active polyhedron\", which realizes a physical human-machine interaction with virtual continuum objects in PCs. Active polyhedrons are polyhedron-shaped linkage mechanisms. In this paper, we deal with an active icosahedron consisting of 30 intelligent cylinders, which were specially developed for this purpose. In previous reports, the mechanism and kinematics of an active icosahedron and a simple force-presentation method using on/off pneumatic valves were given. In this report, a new force-presentation pneumatic-control system using pressure-control valves, which allows a highly accurate force presentation capable of handling complex continuum objects, and a new force-presentation algorithm, which applies to an apex of the polyhedron are described. These were applied to the active icosahedron. The experimental results showed that the active icosahedron was successful in realizing physical human-machine interaction, with which operators could change the shape, feel and compliance of virtual objects in a PC as if they actually touched them",

Friction compensation can improve the transparency of telerobotic systems, where transparency is quantified in terms of a match between the impedance of the environment and the impedance transmitted to the user. We used Dahl friction models to compensate for physical friction in the device. Experiments performed on a telerobotic system demonstrated that teleoperation transparency is improved by using these models. Further, the stability of the teleoperation is analyzed using passivity theory, and it is shown that the master-slave system remains stable up to a certain level of friction compensation",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with how the absence of an expected sensor reading can be used to improve Markov localization. Negative information has not been used for robot localization for various reasons like sensor imperfections, and occlusions that make it hard to determine if a missing sensor reading is really caused by the absence of a feature. We address these difficulties by carefully modeling the robot's main sensor, its camera. Taking into account the viewing frustum and detected obstacles, the absence of a sensor reading can be associated with the absence of that particular feature. This information can then be integrated into the localization process. We show the positive effect on robot localization in various experiments. (a) In a specific setup, the robot is able to localize using negative information where without it, it is unable to localize. (b) We demonstrate the importance of modeling occlusions and the impact of false negatives on localization. (c) We show the positive impact in a typical run",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of gait transitions, acyclic feedforward motion patterns that allow a robot to switch from one gait to another. Legged robots often utilize collections of gait patterns to locomote over a variety of surfaces. Each feedforward gait is generally tuned for a specific surface and set of operating conditions. To enable locomotion across a changing surface, a robot must be able to stably change between gaits while continuing to locomote. By understanding the fundamentals of gaits, we present methods to correctly transition between differing gaits. On two separate robotic platforms, we show how the application of gait transitions enhances each robot's behavioral suite. Using the RHex robotic hexapod, gait transitions are used to smoothly switch from a tripod walking gait to a metachronal wave gait used to climb stairs. We also introduce the RiSE platform, a hexapod robot capable of vertical climbing, and discuss how gait transitions play an important role in achieving vertical mobility",

We describe an extension to the previous best-performing 'aggression function' to dynamic teams of robots. Experimental results show that the new method provides the best performance yet seen.

The basic approach is to fit an interpolant to the training data, representing the expected observation, and to assume additive sensor noise. This paper takes a Bayesian view of the problem, maintaining a posterior over interpolants rather than simply the maximum-likelihood interpolant, giving a measure of uncertainty in the map at any point. This is done using a Gaussian process framework. To validate the approach experimentally, a model of an environment is built using observations from an omni-directional camera. After a model has been built from the training data, a particle filter is used to localise while traversing this environment",

Novel peeling mechanism of the elastomer adhesive pads, as well as steering and stable climbing using an active tail are explored. The design, fabrication, analysis and test of the robot are reported. Experimental results of walking and climbing up to 85deg sloped acrylic surfaces as well as successful steering and peeling mechanism tests are demonstrated.

        "abstract": "In this work, we present implementation and experiment of the theory of dynamic force sensing for robotic manipulators. In the robot manipulation context, end-effector contact forces may be difficult to measure due to tool interference, yet indirect measurement such as from wrist-mounted force sensors provide force measurement contaminated by inertial forces of the tool distal to the force sensor. In order to extract the contact force exerted by the robot, it is necessary to separate the contact forces from inertial forces. We propose a complete formulation and implementation of a new control strategy based on multi-sensor fusion with three different sensors - that is, encoders mounted at each joint of the robot with six degrees of freedom, a wrist force sensor and accelerometers - whose goal is to obtain a suitable contact force estimator. These new observers contribute to overcome many of the difficulties of uncertain world models and unknown environments, which limit the domain of application of contemporary robots used without external sensory feedback; in addition, the final observer can be applied to any kind of real robot system. An impedance control scheme was proposed to verify the improvement. The experiments were carried out on an industrial Staubli RX60 manipulator with open control system architecture",

The formulation proposed to deduce the input/output velocity equations for such kinematic structures is an extension of the reciprocal screw based method of asymmetrical and constrained parallel mechanisms. The efficiency of this methodology for setting up the differential kinematic model is illustrated through application: the RobuRoc mobile robot. Its complex kinematic structure is first transformed into a spatial parallel mechanism which encapsulates the differential driving wheels system. Then, the analytical form of the reciprocal screw system which corresponds to the actively controlled wrenches applied on the controlled body is established. Reciprocally, it describes the way the wheel velocities are transferred to the output body. It also provides a geometrical information for an exhaustive singularity analysis and traction distribution optimization during the evolution of the system on highly irregular surfaces. From the differential kinematic model, the concept of traction ellipsoid is introduced for evaluating quantitatively the obstacle clearance capabilities when the configuration of the system and the contact conditions are highly variable",

Problems arise with vacuum grippers that can only exert normal forces on payloads. During high-speed transfers undesired shear forces and torques appear that may well lead to the loss of grasped objects and consequently to a production stop and damage to both the object and the environment. A related problem is concerned with handling goods that need special care, such as liquids that should not spill over during transport, or bakery goods on a tray that should not be scrambled and dislocated before being moved into an oven. To be able to handle objects with care but nevertheless with maximum velocity, a new simple and effective methodology based on the adaptation of the gripper orientation is proposed. It leads to robot trajectories (in particular gripper orientations) that minimize shear forces and torques on grasped objects and thus allows gentle robotic handling processes. The methodology is presented as well as simulation and experimental results",

The robot, whose configuration is composed of its position and orientation, moves in a fully-known environment by alternating rotations and forward translations. We pose the problem as a discrete-time planning problem in the robot's information space, which encapsulates the uncertainty in the robot's configuration. Our contribution is to show that in any simply-connected, bounded polygonal environment, localization by odometry alone is possible, but only up to the symmetries in the environment",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a glowworm metaphor based distributed algorithm that enables a collection of minimalist mobile robots to split into subgroups, exhibit simultaneous taxis-behavior towards, and rendezvous at multiple radiation sources such as nuclear/hazardous chemical spills and fire-origins in a fire calamity. The algorithm is based on a glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) technique that finds multiple optima of multimodal functions. The algorithm is in the same spirit as the ant-colony optimization (ACO) algorithms, but with several significant differences. The agents in the glowworm algorithm carry a luminescence quantity called luciferin along with them. Agents are thought of as glowworms that emit a light whose intensity is proportional to the associated luciferin. The key feature that is responsible for the working of the algorithm is the use of an adaptive local-decision domain, which we use effectively to detect the multiple source locations of interest. The glowworms have a finite sensor range which defines a hard limit on the local-decision domain used to compute their movements. Extensive simulations validate the feasibility of applying the glowworm algorithm to the problem of multiple source localization. We build four wheeled robots called glowworms to conduct our experiments. We use a preliminary experiment to demonstrate the basic behavioral primitives that enable each glowworm to exhibit taxis behavior towards source locations and later demonstrate a sound localization task using a set of four glowworms",

This method is based on Maxwell's reciprocal figure theory which establishes a duality between self stressed frameworks and reciprocal figures, which are abstract dual representations of frameworks. We use line geometry tools to introduce a new graphical construction called the mechanism's line of action graph (MLG). The MLG is introduced in order to implement Maxwell's reciprocal figure theory to mechanisms. We show that the configurations where the MLG has a connected reciprocal figure imply a singularity in the mechanism. This singularity analysis tool is also used to trace the singularity loci of the PPM. Finally, we provide detailed examples of the singularity analysis of two common PPMs; one consists of three limbs with a passive revolute joint, actuated prismatic joint and another passive revolute joint (3-RPR), the other consists of three limbs with three revolute joints, where only the first is actuated (3-RRR)",

The system classifies the human hand postures taking advantage of virtual grasping and information about the contact points and normals computed in the virtual reality environment. A pregrasp planning algorithm mimicking the human hand motion is also proposed. Reconstruction of human hand trajectories, approaching the objects in the environment, is based on NURBS curves and a data smoothing algorithm. Some experiments involving grasp classification and pregrasp planning, while avoiding obstacles in the workspace, show the viability and effectiveness of the approach",

In this paper, we present techniques to gravity balance the weight of moving links in industrial robots with various arrangements of joints. In a typical industrial robot, the first joint axis is parallel to the gravity vector, hence, the weight of the first moving link does not have any effect on gravity balancing of the robot. Our approach for gravity balancing of industrial robots uses two steps: (i) we locate the center of mass of distal segments of the robot using auxiliary parallelograms; (ii) we connect springs between the center of mass and other members in the robot such that the total potential energy of the system is invariant with configuration. In this paper, we present designs for gravity balancing of classes of industrial robots with revolute and prismatic joints",

Based on the special properties and constraints associated with both pulpal tissue and endodontic files, we propose a haptic model to simulate endodontic shaping operations, which is a smoothed particle based dynamic model derived for the pulpal tissue coupled with a finite element model for the endodontic files.

These features describe the position of the swarm in the world and its size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high level specifications given in natural language such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features are automatically mapped to probably correct robot control laws",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot localization and navigation requires a map - the robot's internal representation of the environment. A common problem is that path planning becomes very inefficient for large maps. In this paper we address the problem of segmenting a base-level map in order to construct a higher-level representation of the space which can be used for more efficient planning. We represent the base-level map as a graph for both geometric and appearance based space representations. Then we use a graph partitioning method to cluster nodes of the base-level map and in this way construct a high-level map, which is also a graph. We apply a hierarchical path planning method for stochastic tasks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) and investigate the effect of choosing different numbers of clusters",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a dynamically stable humanoid walking pattern generation system that can update the pattern at a short cycle such as 40 [ms]. Frequent update of the pattern enables a robot to reflect change of moving direction and upper body posture with short delay after the change of the command input. It also enables a robot to change the walking pattern according to the change of measurable applied force. Moreover short cycle generation is useful in constructing a system that reflects motion status modified by sensor feedback to the motion generation layer in order to maintain consistency of dynamics. Preview control theory is adopted to decide horizontal torso trajectory that realizes desired ZMP trajectory. The proposed system is implemented on a full-size humanoid HRP-2. Walking pattern is updated at every 40 [ms] with reflecting the current modified torso position in the system. Walking control is successfully carried out by the implemented system. Then an experiment of generating and executing walking pattern while variable force is applied to the hand is shown. The system generates walking pattern reflecting the force sensor information at the wrist while walking",

Since this method can estimate the focal position of the specimen from only a single defocused image, it can easily realize high-speed autofocusing. To demonstrate the proposed method, continuous focusing was applied to focus tracking of a swimming paramecium, in combination with two-dimensional tracking. This allowed three-dimensional tracking of the paramecium for 75 s to be successfully demonstrated",

The surgeon can effectively reach remote intrapericardial locations on the epicardium and deliver therapeutic interventions under direct control. Reducing the overall cross-sectional diameter of the mechanism was the main challenge in the design of this device. Our device differs from others in that we use conventional actuation and still have good maneuverability. We have performed simple proof-of-concept clinical experiments to give preliminary validation of the ideas presented here",

The visual servoing method does not need any measure of the 3D structure of the observed target. Only visual information measured from the reference and the current image are needed to compute the task function (isomorphic to the camera pose) and the control law to be applied to the robot. The control law is designed in order to make the task function converge to zero. We provide the theoretical proof of the existence of the isomorphism between the task function and the camera pose and the theoretical proof of the local stability of the control law. The experimental results, obtained with a 6 d.o.f. robot, show the advantages of the proposed method with respect to the existing approaches",

In particular, we analyze a problem inherent to any homography-based approach to the given task, and show how the proposed approach can address this problem to a large degree.

        "abstract": "We address the problem of human motion recognition in this paper. The goal of human motion recognition is to recognize the type of motion recorded in a video clip, which consists of a set of temporarily ordered frames. By defining a Mercer kernel between two video clips directly, we propose in this paper a recognition strategy that can incorporate both the information of each individual frame and the temporal ordering between frames. Combining the proposed kernel with the support vector machine, which is one of the most effective classification paradigms, the resulting recognition strategy exhibits excellent performance over real data sets",

The target application is to provide assistance to drivers of mining dump trucks when parking their vehicles with respect to loading machinery such as swing loaders and rope shovels - this differs from the traditional parking problem due to visibility constraints and due to the relatively open space surrounding the 'parking spot'. The controller takes account of the steering and velocity loop dynamics, as well as dealing with the motion constraints of the vehicle. Experiments using a 1:5 scale model of a dump-truck/swing-loader system demonstrate the feasibility of the approach",

        "abstract": "A natural control method for resolving the ill-posedness of inverse kinematics of multi-joint reaching movements under redundancy of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) is proposed, which need neither introduce any artificial performance index to determine the inverse kinematics uniquely nor calculate the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian of task coordinates with respect to joint coordinates. The control signal is composed of a linear superposition of three terms 1) damping shaping, 2) task-space position-error feedback with a single stiffness parameter, and 3) gravity compensation by means of estimation of uncertainty in the potential energy. It is shown through computer simulation and theoretical analysis that the signal can generate smooth reaching motions provided that a set of damping factors and the stiffness parameter are selected in a synergistic way. A physical meaning of each term of the control signal is discussed from the viewpoints of Newtonian mechanics and neuro-physiology. It can be concluded from those illustrative examples that mechanical robots with redundant DOFs can be endowed by synergistic adjustments of damping factors and a stiffness parameter with ability of generating human-like skilled motions",

Besides a flexible dialog system and speech understanding an anthropomorphic appearance has many advantages for intuitive usage and understanding of a robot. As a consequence of our effort in creating an anthropomorphic appearance and to come as close as possible to a human-human interaction, we decided to use human-like sensors, i.e., two cameras and two microphones only, not using a laser range finder or omnidirectional camera for tracking persons. Despite the challenge of a limited field of perception, a robust attention system for tracking and interacting with multiple persons simultaneously in real-time was created. Our approach is sufficiently generic to work on robots with varying hardware, as long as stereo audio data and images of a video camera are available. Since the architecture is designed modular with a XML based data exchange we are able to extend the robot's abilities easily",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to optimize and filter trajectories generated from recorded human motion for a humanoid robot with physical limits. The objective function is responsible for mimicking human trainers, enhancing the possibility for fast convergence, while constraints are used to transform motion within the limit of the capabilities of the humanoid robot. Those constraints for angle, velocity, and dynamic force are represented as B-spline coefficients. An iterative soft-constraint paradigm is proposed to enhance the quality of velocity and force constraints. Collision avoidance is also considered as a constraint. For precision refinement, in regions of high-frequency motion not adequately modeled by an initial splining, B-spline is extensible into a hierarchy so that optimization that meets global criteria can be performed locally. Furthermore, all of the constraints can be used solely as filtering. To use these filters, an effective method to directly decompose a trajectory to a B-spline is also presented",

        "abstract": "One of the challenges in the simulation of human motion, either applied to humanoid robots or avatars in virtual environments, is to design a kinematics structure and a set of joint trajectories that move a robot or avatar in a human-like manner. In this paper, a technique is introduced to create accurate human-like motion with a simplified topology as a reference. Using an optical motion capture system, a finite number of key poses are captured from different subjects performing full body articulated movements. Motion is modeled using the Clifford algebra of dual quaternions and dimensional synthesis techniques are applied to generate the kinematic skeleton of a 3D avatar or robot. The synthesized kinematic skeleton provides location of joints and dimensions of the links forming the limbs, as well as the joint trajectories. Five serial chains constitute our approximation to the human skeleton. Revolute, universal and spherical joints are employed, although other topologies can be used in a similar fashion. Several real datasets are evaluated and results demonstrate that good accuracy can be obtained at interactive rates using the presented methodology. The results show that using simple serial chains in combination with dimensional synthesis suffices to generate the mechanical structure and trajectories of a humanoid robot or 3D avatar mimicking human motion",

        "abstract": "This paper defines wide angle foveated (WAF) imaging. A proposed model combines Cartesian coordinate system, a log-polar coordinate system, and a unique camera model composed of planar projection and spherical projection for all-purpose use of a single imaging device. The central field-of-view (FOV) and intermediate FOV are given translation-invariance and, rotation and scale-invariance for pattern recognition, respectively. Further, the peripheral FOV is more useful for camera's view direction control, because its image height is linear to an incident angle to the camera model's optical center point. Thus, this imaging model improves its usability especially when a camera is dynamically moved, that is, overt-attention. Moreover, simulation results of image extraction show advantages of the proposed model, in view of its magnification factor of the central FOV, accuracy of scale-invariance and flexibility to describe other WAF vision sensors",

        "abstract": "This research is investigating the feasibility of using computer vision to provide a level of situational awareness suitable for the task of UAV \"sense and avoid.\" This term is used to describe the capability of a UAV to detect airborne traffic and respond with appropriate avoidance maneuvers in order to maintain minimum separation distances. As reflected in regulatory requirements such as FAA Order 7610.4, this capability must demonstrate a level of performance which meets or exceeds that of an equivalent human pilot. Presented in this paper is a comparison of two initial image processing algorithms that have been designed to detect small, point-like features (potentially corresponding to distant, collision-course aircraft) from image streams, and a discussion of their detection performance in processing a real-life collision scenario. This performance is compared against the stated benchmark of equivalent human performance, specifically the measured detection times of an alerted human observer. The two algorithms were used to process a series of image streams featuring real collision-course aircraft against a variety of daytime backgrounds. Preliminary analysis of this data set has yielded encouraging results, achieving first detection times at distances of approximately 6.5 km (3.5 nmi), which are 35-40% greater than those of the alerted human observer. Comparisons were also drawn between the two separate detection algorithms, and have demonstrated that a new approach designed to increase resilience to image noise achieves a lower rate of false alarms, particularly in tests featuring more sensitive detection thresholds",

This kind of vision sensor combines lens and mirrors to enlarge the field of view. The proposed approach, which exploits the epipolar geometry defined by the current and the desired camera views, does not need any knowledge of the 3-D scene geometry. The control scheme is divided in two steps. In the first one, the epipoles are used together with an approximate input-output linearizing feedback to align the robot with the goal. Feature points are then used in the second translation step to reach the desired configuration. Global asymptotic convergence is proven. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme",

One method of obtaining this reconnaissance information is to deploy a robot as a projectile. This may be accomplished with mechanical aids or simply by throwing the robot manually. This rapid deployment method has the ability to attain locations inaccessible to other technologies. The miniature nature of the presented design has the ability to operate discretely and avoid detection, making it desirable for law enforcement. In the case of urban search and rescue, the diminutive form minimizes the impact on potentially unsound structures. During the course of deployment, unexpected impacts and drops are inevitable, generating a need for an impact invariant design. Design decisions to create this system are presented, and experimental validation of design aspects is discussed",

        "abstract": "Many application tasks require the cooperation of two or more robots. Humans are good at cooperation in shared workspaces, because they anticipate and adapt to the intentions and actions of others. In contrast, multi-agent and multi-robot systems rely on communication to exchange their intentions. This causes problems in domains where perfect communication is not guaranteed, such as rescue robotics, autonomous vehicles participating in traffic, or robotic soccer. In this paper, we introduce a computational model for implicit coordination, and apply it to a typical coordination task from robotic soccer: regaining ball possession. The computational model specifies that performance prediction models are necessary for coordination, so we learn them off-line from observed experience. By taking the perspective of the team mates, these models are then used to predict utilities of others, and optimize a shared performance model for joint actions. In several experiments conducted with our robotic soccer team, we evaluate the performance of implicit coordination",

        "abstract": "Humans rely on information-laden high-frequency accelerations in addition to quasi-static forces when interacting with objects via a handheld tool. Telerobotic systems have traditionally struggled to portray such contact transients due to closed-loop bandwidth and stability limitations, leaving remote objects feeling soft and undefined. This work seeks to maximize the user's feel for the environment through the approach of acceleration matching; high-frequency fingertip accelerations are combined with standard low-frequency position feedback without requiring a secondary actuator on the master device. In this method, the natural dynamics of the master are identified offline using frequency-domain techniques, estimating the relationship between commanded motor current and handle acceleration while a user holds the device. During subsequent telerobotic interactions, a high-bandwidth sensor measures accelerations at the slave's end effector, and the real-time controller re-creates these important signals at the master handle by inverting the identified model. The details of this approach are explored herein, and its ability to render hard and rough surfaces is demonstrated on a standard master-slave system. Combining high-frequency acceleration matching with position-error-based feedback of quasi-static forces creates a hybrid signal that closely corresponds to human sensing capabilities, instilling telerobotics with a more realistic sense of remote touch",

To make human-like passive movements of the arms when walking humanoid robot arms must have similar dynamics to the human arms, even more if this arm is to be used as a prosthesis. Moreover medical diagnosis of muscle or neuro-motor diseases are based on a visual qualitative estimation of joint passive stiffness. There is a pressing need in human body dynamics characterization and especially in subject specific characterization. In this paper a solution to estimate in-vivo the passive dynamic of the arm joint is proposed. It is based on the use of the musculo-skeletal description of the human body and its kinematics computation. The linear passive joint dynamics: stiffness, viscosity and friction, is then estimated with least squares method. Acquisition of movements both designed for estimation or from medical diagnosis check-up, are achieved with motion capture studio only (no pain, no distress on subject). Experimental results for three valid subject are given",

        "abstract": "We have developed a system which integrates the information output from several pose estimation algorithms and from several views of the scene. It is tested in a real setup with a robotic manipulator. It is shown that integrating pose estimates from several algorithms increases the overall performance of the pose estimation accuracy as well as the robustness as compared to using only a single algorithm. It is shown that increased robustness can be achieved by using pose estimation algorithms based on complementary features, so called algorithmic multi-cue integration (AMC). Furthermore it is also shown that increased accuracy can be achieved by integrating pose estimation results from different views of the scene, so-called temporal multi-cue integration (TMC). Temporal multi-cue integration is the most interesting aspect of this paper",

        "abstract": "Vehicle relocation is the problem in which a mobile robot has to estimate the self-position with respect to an a priori map of landmarks using the perception and the motion measurements without using any knowledge of the initial self-position. Recently, random sample consensus (RANSAC), a robust multi-hypothesis estimator, has been successfully applied to offline relocation in static environments. On the other hand, online relocation in dynamic environments is still a difficult problem, for available computation time is always limited, and for measurement include many outliers. To realize real time algorithm for such an online process, we have developed an incremental version of RANSAC algorithm by extending an efficient preemption RANSAC scheme. This novel scheme named incremental RANSAC is able to find inlier hypotheses of self-positions out of large number of outlier hypotheses contaminated by outlier measurements",

        "abstract": "Learning tasks from human demonstration is a core feature for household service robots. To increase the utility of future robot servants, the robot should go beyond simply imitating the user's behavior but try to build flexible, extensible and general task knowledge. This knowledge should at the same time encode the constraints of a task while leaving as much flexibility for optimized reproduction at execution time. This raises the question, which features of a task are the constraining or relevant ones both for execution of and reasoning over the task knowledge. In this paper, a system to record and interpret manipulation task demonstrations is presented. A heuristic measure for relevance assessment of task features is introduced. This relevance measure relies both on general background knowledge as well as task-specific knowledge gathered from the user demonstrations and incrementally improves with more task demonstrations becoming available. The utility of this relevance heuristic is evaluated within the problem of recognizing equal operations performed in different demonstrations of the same task in different contexts",

Robotics education is greatly improved when classroom teaching is supported by adequate laboratory courses and experiments following the \"learning by doing\" paradigm. However, cost of robotic laboratory equipment is an important issue, and several low cost instruments have been developed to permit an effective teaching in robotics at an affordable cost. These learning tools have demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of hand-on experiences and of group work in robotics learning. Among the best known and most used tools for robotics teaching, there is the Legocopy Mindstormtrade set, which is normally used to develop and program mobile robots, often biologically inspired and cooperating. In this paper however, we describe our experience with using LEGO kits in the development of teaching curricula for fixed robot manipulators. We found that the LEGO set is also an excellent tool to analyze robot kinematics and trajectory planning, and we describe our experience with a laboratory course designed to address kinematic properties of fixed robots",

        "abstract": "On August 30, 2005, we successfully demonstrated a large-scale, real-time, surveillance and control application on a wireless sensor network. The task was to track multiple human targets walking through a 5041 square meter sensor field and dispatch simulated pursuers to capture them. We employed a multi-target tracking algorithm that was a combination of a multi-sensor fusion algorithm for fusing binary detections and a Markov chain Monte Carlo data association (MCMCDA) algorithm that can initiate and terminates tracks autonomously and is robust to a high level of false alarms and missing measurements, a common problem in sensor networks. The tracks were used by a multi-agent coordination and control algorithm to capture the evaders. We were able to demonstrate successful pursuit of two crossing targets and successful tracking of three targets moving through a 144 node sensor field. To the authors' best knowledge, this experiment is the largest demonstration to date of a real-time tracking and control system on a wireless sensor network that does not use classification information",

IPMC has also a sensor function, as the IPMC film generates electromotive force when it is deformed. It has possibility to be integrated into IPMC actuator with soft actuation.

        "abstract": "Robotics applications based on computer vision algorithms are highly constrained to indoor environments where conditions may be controlled. The development of robust visual algorithms is necessary for improving the capabilities of many autonomous systems in outdoor and dynamic environments. In particular, this paper proposes a tracking algorithm robust to several artifacts which may be found in real world applications, such as lighting changes, cluttered backgrounds and unexpected target movements. In order to deal with these difficulties the proposed tracking methodology integrates several Bayesian filters. Each filter estimates the state of a particular object feature which is conditionally dependent on another feature estimated by a distinct filter. This dependence provides improved representations of the target, allowing to segment it out from the background of the image. We describe the updating procedure of the Bayesian filters by a 'hypotheses generation and correction' scheme. The main difference with respect to previous approaches is that the dependence between filters is considered during the feature observation, i.e., into the 'hypotheses correction' stage, instead of considering it when generating the hypotheses. This proves to be much more effective in terms of accuracy and reliability",

First, we describe a simple method based on Gabor filters to produce correspondence probability distributions. Next, we generate a noise model for inertial measurements. Probability distributions over the motions are then computed directly from the correspondence distributions and the inertial measurements. We investigate combining the inertial and visual information for a single distribution over the motions. We find that with smaller amounts of correspondence information, fusion of the visual data with the inertial sensor results in much better egomotion estimation. This is essentially because inertial measurements decrease the \"translation-rotation\" ambiguity. However, when more correspondence information is used, this ambiguity is reduced to such a degree that the inertial measurements provide negligible improvement in accuracy. This suggests that inertial and visual information are more closely integrated in a compositional sense",

        "abstract": "Most haptic educational papers focus on using haptic devices as an aid to teaching. We introduced the use of vibro-tactile communication as well as tactile and kinesthetic sensing and their combination to high school students in order to introduce them to the field of haptics and its applications. The effectiveness of our approach for introducing the concepts as well as the technical issues associated with haptics to this age group was relatively successful. Initially, various physiological response properties of the human tactile system, including the kinesthetic component as well as the tactual (force, texture) properties were presented. The students were then exposed to theory, hardware (sensors, actuators) interfacing as well as the software to close the loop between sensing and haptic feedback after initially investigating open loop configurations. Vibro-tactile (i.e., pager motors) were used in the labs as chiefly communication devices to convey either pan-tilt from an accelerometer (kinesthetic) or the intensity of force exerted on a force pressure sensor. The students enjoyed the experience, especially the hands-on nature of the project and their only major complaint was that there was too much programming. Our future intent is to abstract the building blocks, simplify the software interfacing so as to allow students of various levels and capabilities to effectively be creative and imaginative in developing various haptic communication applications and tools",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a method that helps programming an autonomous agent through human-like objectives as reinforcements, where the agent is responsible for discovering the best actions to fulfil the objectives. Nevertheless, it is not easy to disentangle human objectives in reinforcement like objectives. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) determines the reinforcements that a given agent behaviour is fulfilling from the observation of the desired behaviour. In this paper we present a variant of IRL, which is called IRL with evaluation (IRLE) where instead of observing the desired agent behaviour, the relative evaluation between different behaviours is known by the access to an evaluator. We present also a solution for this problem under the assumption that a relative linear function that preserves the order assumed by the evaluator exists and that the evaluator evaluates policies instead of behaviours. This is posed as a linear feasibility problem, whose solution is well known. Results of simulations of a set of heterogeneous robots in a search and rescue scenario are presented to illustrate the method and the possibility to transfer the learned reinforcement function among robots",

The results of the method determine the regions of the workspace from which human visual system (HVS) has high quality images in most of the eye and neck postures. To evaluate the image quality of points in the HVS, motion perceptibility and acuity measures are defined and computed for the points that are in the focus range and field-of-view (FOV) of the observer. Motion perceptibility in the HVS is evaluated by applying a motion resolvability concept for the first time. The perceptibility measures are averaged over all the eye poses to determine the average visual perceptibility of the human workspace. The method is implemented on a subject with average body sizes, however, it can be easily adapted to different human subjects",

By combining the manipulator differential kinematics with the admissible differential motion of the platform, a simple and general kinematic model for NMMs is derived. Assuming that the robotic system is kinematically redundant for a given task, we present the extension of redundancy resolution schemes originally developed for standard manipulators, in particular the projected gradient (PG) and the reduced gradient (RG) optimization-based methods. The case of a configuration-dependent task specification is also discussed. The proposed modeling approach is illustrated with reference to representative NMMs, and the performance of the PG and RG methods for redundancy resolution is compared on a series of numerical case studies",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the synthesis and the analysis of the kinematics of a new robotic parallel wrist for laparoscopic surgery applications. The main properties of this new wrist are the wide singularity free orientation workspace and the capability of making large rotations of the end-effector with small rotation of the actuators. First, it is shown how these features suit the application of minimally invasive surgery. Secondly, the kinematics is described showing its working principle that allows the achievement of rotation multiplication. The forward kinematics problem is solved geometrically. Afterwards, a methodology based on screw theory for the solution of the differential kinematics is proposed. Finally a workspace representation is presented making a comparison with another known parallel wrist",

Robotic physical therapy devices have been developed in the past, many of which may benefit from the use of bidirectional pneumatic actuators. This paper presents the Robotic Gait Trainer, an ankle rehabilitation device structurally based on a tripod mechanism with one fixed link. The device incorporates two double-acting, compliant Spring Over Muscle (SOM) actuators as actuation links. The kinematic model of the tripod structure and analysis of the workspace of the robotic device are discussed. It is shown that the device is capable of moving the foot about the ankle joint in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as inversion and eversion, a feature unique to the lightweight, compact and easily portable device. Results of the analysis prove that the tripod structure generates a range of motion that matches the safe anatomical range of the ankle joint during gait",

However, for companies such as textile and steel-making companies, optimizing schedules is difficult because of the NP-hard nature of the problem and the complex product structures: assemblies, disassemblies and couplings across orders. To address the difficulties, this paper extends the Lagrangian relaxation approach through selectively relaxing precedence constraints. The solution oscillation is identified and alleviated by adding auxiliary penalty and by nonlinear approximation. Furthermore, the normalized surrogate subgradient method is developed to accelerate the convergence of Lagrangian multipliers to obtain good solutions in computational efficient manner. Testing results demonstrate that better schedules are obtained when solution oscillation is alleviated. The newly developed normalized method significantly improves traditional methods",

Our first contribution is to represent the map as a collection of submaps arranged in a deformable configuration, and to perform loop-closing by registering this submap configuration to an aerial image. The second contribution is to introduce the active contour technique to the SLAM domain, so that the registration is efficiently solved in an iterative energy minimization process. The constraints from robot mapping are modeled as forces trying to keep the submaps consistent to each other, while the pictorial matching is represented by forces guiding submaps to a globally consistent configuration. In the experiment, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm's capability to close a 1,890 meters with only one visiting. The result is compared with ground truth, and high accuracy is observed",

A multimodal service robot is taught grasping skills by a human instructor who demonstrates a grasping action. Our approach contributes novel solutions to the aspects of robustly tracking the demonstrator's hands in real time as well as to the transformation of tracking results into grasping skills. To track the demonstrator's hands in stereoscopic images a mean-shift-like algorithm is adapted. For the very first time this algorithm is applied to local binary patterns (LBP) and color histograms. To retrieve the hand configuration we use view-based principal component analysis (PCA). To develop grasping skills from tracking results the robot repetitively tracks the demonstrator's grasping actions and transforms the results into three-dimensional self organizing maps (SOMs). The SOMs give a spatial description of the collected data and serve as data structures for a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm which optimizes trajectories for use by the robot. The approach is applied to a multimodal service robot. Experiments show the effectiveness of the LBP-enhanced mean-shift-like tracking and the robustness of LbD based on SOMs and RL",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we predict the amount of slip an exploration rover would experience using stereo imagery by learning from previous examples of traversing similar terrain. To do that, the information of terrain appearance and geometry regarding some location is correlated to the slip measured by the rover while this location is being traversed. This relationship is learned from previous experience, so slip can be predicted later at a distance from visual information only. The advantages of the approach are: 1) learning from examples allows the system to adapt to unknown terrains rather than using fixed heuristics or predefined rules; 2) the feedback about the observed slip is received from the vehicle's own sensors which can fully automate the process; 3) learning slip from previous experience can replace complex mechanical modeling of vehicle or terrain, which is time consuming and not necessarily feasible. Predicting slip is motivated by the need to assess the risk of getting trapped before entering a particular terrain. For example, a planning algorithm can utilize slip information by taking into consideration that a slippery terrain is costly or hazardous to traverse. A generic nonlinear regression framework is proposed in which the terrain type is determined from appearance and then a nonlinear model of slip is learned for a particular terrain type. In this paper we focus only on the latter problem and provide slip learning and prediction results for terrain types, such as soil, sand, gravel, and asphalt. The slip prediction error achieved is about 15% which is comparable to the measurement errors for slip itself",

        "abstract": "We are considering a 6 d.o.f. Gough platform that has to move within a given workspace or on a trajectory. The legs of the robot are assumed to be constituted of a set of finite cylindrical elements and we address the problem of determining if any pair of such element would intersect during the robot motion. Collision conditions may be written mathematically according to various equivalent formulations. We show however that these formulations are not numerically equivalent and exhibit an efficient interference checking algorithm based on interval analysis that allows to check 6D workspace or arbitrary time-function trajectories for interference",

        "abstract": "In this paper a novel rotational actuator with adaptable compliance is presented. First the importance of adaptable compliance for bipedal walking is explained, and then a number of comparable designs are given with their possible drawbacks. The MACCEPA concept and design is described in detail. The formula to calculate the generated torque is derived. It is shown, depending on the design parameters, that the torque is a quasi linear function with respect to the angle between equilibrium position and actual position. Also the change of the pre-tension has a quasi linear effect on the torque. Another advantage is that the actuator can be built with standard components, e.g. electrical servo motors. Experiments show the independent control of equilibrium position and compliance. Finally, the concept of controlled passive walking is explained, which is a combination of the control strategies of active and passive walking robots. Controlled passive walking requires actuators with adaptable compliance, preferably where the control of equilibrium position and compliance are independent",

In order to avoid problems occurred in multifunctional robot developments, we design the architecture to fulfill the following three features. Firstly, it embodies the meta-architecture for networked-robots. Secondly, it supports bazaar-style development model. Finally, it doesn't require heavy weight middleware. To realize them, we developed an information sharing framework named networked-whiteboard model along with message passing framework via P2P virtual network. A development methodology using interest-oriented module groups and software patterns is also presented as a means to reduce complexity risks. A middleware is developed as an implementation of this architecture, and we verify the availability and effectivity of our platform through the development of dialogue robot for exhibition",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We explore an online problem where a group of robots has to find a target whose position is unknown in an unknown planar environment whose geometry is acquired by the robots during task execution. The critical parameter in such a problem is the physical motion time, which, under the assumption of uniform velocity of all the robots, corresponds to length or cost of the path traveled by the robot which finds the target. The competitiveness of an online algorithm measures its performance relative to the optimal offline solution to the problem. While competitiveness usually means constant relative performance, this paper uses generalized competitiveness, i.e. any functional relationship between online performance and optimal offline solution. Given an online task, its competitive complexity class is a pair of lower and upper bounds on the competitive performance of all online algorithms for the task, such that the two bounds satisfy the same functional relationship. We classify a common online motion planning problem into competitive class. In particular, it is shown that group of robots navigation to a target whose position is recognized only upon arrival belongs to a quadratic competitive class. This paper describes a new online navigation algorithm, called MRSAM (short for multi-robot search area multiplication), which requires linear memory and has a quadratic competitive performance. Moreover, it is shown that in general any online navigation algorithm must have at least a quadratic competitive performance. The MRSAM algorithm achieves the quadratic lower bound and thus has optimal competitiveness. The algorithm's performance is illustrated in an office-like environments",

Therefore to maintain a wireless link between two robots, it is desirable to comply with these two spatial constraints. Given a swarm of point robots with specified initial and final configurations and a set of desired communication links consistent with the above criteria, we explore the problem of designing inputs to achieve the final configuration while preserving the desired links for the duration of the motion. Some interesting conclusions about the feasibility of the problem are offered. An algorithm is provided and its operation is demonstrated through both simulation and experimentation on Koala robots",

In this paper, a straight stationary barrier is considered in a manipulation problem using passive air flows. Such a system simplifies equilibrium analysis but raises problems on contact modes, rolling or sliding. Coulomb's friction model is employed to solve contact modes when an object sits on a straight barrier. This paper illustrates the relationship between contact modes and the location of a flow sink with respect to location of the straight barrier. Although the friction coefficient is poorly estimated, numerical prediction of contact modes quite well agrees with experimental results",

It takes much time to unravel it once it is raveled. Therefore, it is important to generate unraveling plans efficiently. First, a manipulation process of a linear object including its unraveling is represented as a sequence of its crossing state transitions. Then, possible manipulation processes can be generated once the initial and the objective crossing states are given. Second, qualitative actions to realize manipulation processes are determined. Third, a method for unraveling a linear object as far as possible when its crossing state can not be identified completely is proposed. Finally, an example of unraveling process generation is demonstrated",

Control of the device is based on MR images collected pre-operatively and in real-time during the procedure. A user interface fuses all sensor information for man-in-the-loop control. Stereotactic guidance uses multislice and/or three-dimensional MR images to set a trajectory of insertion. Free-handed (or manual) guidance uses a master/slave control device, which replicates the kinematics structure of the arm, to control its movement. The control software checks any motion of the manipulator whether it is within an allowable volume extracted from MR images. The device control is performed with a host/target computer configuration. The system is connected to the MR scanner to receive the MR images and send the coordinates of the end-effector for dynamic control of the imaged plane. The manipulator compatibility with the MR environment and image-guided maneuvering was tested on a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner",

        "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is a new SLAM algorithm for the mapping of large scale environments by combining local maps. The local maps can be generated by traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) based SLAM. Relationships between the locations of the landmarks in the local map are then extracted and used in an extended information filter (EIF) to build a global map. An important feature is that the information matrix for the global map is exactly sparse, leading to significant computational advantages. This paper thus presents an algorithm that combines the advantages of both the existing local map joining SLAM algorithms, which reduces the linearization error in EKF SLAM and allows computationally demanding global map fusion to be scheduled off-line, and the decoupled SLAM (D-SLAM) algorithm, which provides an efficient strategy for building large maps using relative location information. The effectiveness of the new algorithm is illustrated through computer simulations.",

Problem considered here is the lack of a mathematical description to analyze and explain the dynamic behavior of self-reconfigurable robots. In the global level, the idea of virtual disconnection is developed to abstract the low level module control away from the high level synchronization for both cyclic and acyclic robot configuration. In the module layer, the linear space model is developed to describe each module's internal state, input-output hormone transformation, and its action selection. As a combination of hormone and modern control theory, the approach in this paper gives more features, such as predictability and stability analysis etc, to hormone-inspired control, and makes it applicable to self-reconfigurable systems in general. Simulation and experimental results show the capacity of our method",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the mechanism of the phenomenon between an end effector, a micro object and a substrate during a micro manipulation. In a micro range, the attracting forces such as the van der Waals, capillary, and electrostatic forces dominate and course adhesion between the object and the end-effector. The adhesion makes the manipulation of an object difficult. Recently, we developed a method to reduce the attracting/adhesion effect. When bringing an oscillating end-effector close to a micro object on a substrate, the attracting force between the object and the end-effector is reduced, attracting the object to the substrate. Then, it becomes easy to remove the end-effector from the object. Using this method, a micro object can be easily manipulated. However, the mechanism of the phenomenon is still unclear. In this paper, we develop the theoretical model of the system to analyze the phenomenon, and simulate the dynamical motion of the system. Comparing the experimental results, we show the validity of our approach. Using simulation and experiment, we show that the oscillation of the end-effector can reduce the adhesion effect between the end-effector and the object, attracting the object to the substrate",

        "abstract": "There are many sampling-based motion planning methods that model the connectivity of a robot's configuration space (C-space) with a graph whose nodes are valid configurations and whose edges represent valid transitions between nodes. One of the biggest challenges faced by users of these methods is selecting the right planner for their problem. While researchers have tried to compare different planners, most accepted metrics for comparing planners are based on efficiency, e.g., number of collision detection calls or samples needed to solve a particular set of queries, and there is still a lack of useful and efficient quantitative metrics that can be used to measure the suitability of a planner for solving a problem. That is, although there is great interest in determining which planners should be used in which situations, there are still many questions we cannot answer about the relative performance of different planning methods. In this paper we make some progress towards this goal. We propose a metric that can be applied to each new sample considered by a sampling-based planner to characterize how that sample improves, or not, the planner's current C-space model. This characterization requires only local information and can be computed quite efficiently, so that it can be applied to every sample. We show how this characterization can be used to analyze and compare how different planning strategies explore the configuration space. In particular, we show that it can be used to identify three phases that planners go through when building C-space models: quick learning (rapidly building a coarse model), model enhancement (refining the model), and learning decay (oversampling - most samples do not provide additional information).

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new pneumatic end effector system for micro/nano fluidic handling, nanomanufacturing, and micro/nano manipulation is presented. The new micro pneumatic end-effector system consists of a DC micro-diaphragm pump and compressor, one region of flexible latex tube, a Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensor for in-situ measurement of micro force, and a micro steel tip. The micro steel tip of the new pneumatic end effector system has an internal diameter (ID) of 20 mum used for handling nano entities such as carbon nanotubes, DNA, micro/nano particles as well as for microfluidic handling and droplet control. The DC micro-diaphragm pump is automatically controlled via a voltage driver interfaced with a computer in order to effectively and efficiently control suction force and pressure during microfluidic handling and droplet control in nano manufacturing. The new pneumatic end effector system with force sensing can significantly improve the success rate for handling/depositing micro/nano entities in the case of carbon nanotubes. The experimental results show the success rate of placing carbon nanotubes between electrodes can reach close to 80%. Ultimately, the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated manufacturing process for batch assembly of micro devices, manufacturing of nano devices, microfluidic droplet control, and drug delivery",

Not only they are interesting with respect to the optimized criteria, but also they offer a family of motion primitives that can be used for motion planning in the presence of obstacles. This paper presents characterization of shortest paths for differential-drive mobile robots, with the goal of classifying solutions in the spirit of Dubins curves and Reeds-Shepp curves for car-like robots. To obtain a well-defined notion of shortest., the total amount of wheel rotation is optimized. Using Pontryagin maximum principle and other tools, we establish the existence of optimal trajectories, and derive the set of optimal paths. Some Reeds-Shepp curves appear in the set of optimal paths, whereas there are optimal paths which are different from Reeds-Shepp curves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first progress on the problem",

Such a robot can be inserted into the abdominal cavity through a standard trocar. The surgeon controls the robot using visual feedback from the on-board camera. Measurements were made to identify the forces required to successfully biopsy in vivo tissue, including clamping and tearing forces. The robot design was developed around these parameters and the need to traverse the abdominal environment using specially designed wheels. This mobility allows the biopsy robot to move to the area of interest to sample specific tissues. The lead-screw linkage system that actuated the graspers allows for large force production through careful mechanical design. In vivo testing of this system in a porcine (pig) model has been successful. The robot is capable of traversing the entire in vivo abdominal environment and has successfully been used to biopsy hepatic tissue. In addition, experimental analysis of the biopsy mechanism shows good results towards more elaborate tissue manipulation in the future",

In this paper, we first present the current status of the class, and show how it improves the education and training of students in a robotics curriculum by giving them a hands-on experience with a real robot. We show that, in addition to core subjects such as perception, action and cognition, students also have the opportunity to learn advanced topics such as reinforcement learning and multi-robot coordination. We then discuss the evolution of the class under general categories: hardware and programming environment, team experiments, and assignments. We present important lessons learned in each category, and how they affect the learning experience of participating students. We conclude by discussing future opportunities",

A simple static model that describes the tendon-sheath driving system is presented, and its behavior is compared both with simulative results, obtained with a lumped parameters model of the tendon, and with experimental results. Different static and dynamic friction models are used in the simulations and the related results are compared to highlight some phenomena that are not visible from the static model of the tendon. A simple force control algorithm with feedforward friction compensation based on the static friction model is also presented",

        "abstract": "This paper applies some previously studied extended Kalman filter techniques for planar road geometry estimation to the domain of autonomous navigation of off-highway vehicles. In this work, a clothoid model of the road geometry is constructed and estimated recursively based on road features extracted from single-axis LADAR range measurements. We present a method for feature extraction of the road centerline in the image plane, and describe its application to recursive estimation of the road geometry. We analyze the performance of our method against simulated motion of varied road geometries and against closed-loop detection, tracking and following of desert roads. Our method accommodates full 6 DOF motion of the vehicle as it navigates, constructs consistent estimates of the road geometry with respect to a fixed global reference frame, and requires an estimate of the sensor pose for each range measurement",

The desired robot behavior is detailed for each of the four states along with the necessary transitions between those states",

        "abstract": "Pneumatic actuators are low-cost, safe, clean, and exhibit a high power to weight ratio. In this paper a novel servo pneumatic system based on a miniature cylinder with a 9.5 mm bore size is presented. Four low-cost 2-way proportional valves are incorporated to provide greater design flexibility than the traditional single 4-way servo valve solution. A nonlinear system model is developed and validated using open-loop experiments. The use of bipolynomial functions to model the valve flow rates provides a more accurate solution than the commonly used nozzle flow equations. A novel multiple-input single-output nonlinear position control law is designed using the backstepping method. The stability analysis includes the effects of friction modeling error and valve modeling error. In experiments with a 1.5 kg moving mass, the new control law produced maximum tracking errors of plusmn0.5 mm for a 1 Hz sine wave trajectory, and steady-state errors within plusmn0.05 mm. The tracking errors are 82% less than those produced by a linear controller",

        "abstract": "Recent studies on the insect water strider showed that the insect heavily relies on surface tension force to stay afloat. Inspired by this insect, water strider robots have been developed using the same locomotive principles as the insect. This paper focuses on numerically modeling the supporting legs of the insect and the robots. The rigid-leg model as well as the compliant-leg model is developed using numerical approaches, under an assumption made on the water surface breaking condition. The effect of different leg material and geometry are discussed. It is shown through simulations that four 7 cm-long Teflonreg coated compliant supporting legs with optimized shapes can lift up to 4.3 grams (0.15 g/cm), while an actual prototype carried 3.7 grams. Another prototype using twelve of these legs successfully lifted 9.3 grams. Experiments show that the analyses capture the important features of the supporting legs. The design rules proposed in this paper are useful in understanding the insect statics and also the robotic water strider supporting leg design. This study allows a heavier robot to be used for education, entertainment or environment monitoring purposes",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a passive-type walker using servo brakes referred to as RT Walker. RT Walker realizes several functions such as obstacles/steps avoidance function, path following function, gravity compensation function, variable motion characteristics function, etc., by controlling only servo brakes without using servo motors. These passive-type systems are dependable for using practically in real world environment, because of the passive dynamics with respect to the applied force/moment, simple structure, lightweight, and so on. However, the most serious problem of them is the falling accident of user, because the passive-type systems are lightweight and move easily based on the small force/moment applied by the user unintentionally. In this paper, we pay attention to a method for estimating the human state during the usage of the walker and propose a motion control algorithm for realizing a fall-prevention function based on its human state. We also implement the proposed control methods in RT Walker experimentally and illustrate the validity of them",

The main idea is to test and compare performances of different washout algorithms applied to such platform category. The experimentations allow us to have the best compromise between quality of the perception (sensation), implementation complexity and platform architecture. Implementation of different washout algorithms (optimal, adaptive and classical one) are discussed. Only the longitudinal restitution is studied. The results show that there is not significant differences between these approaches using with platform type. The lack of pitch DOF in our simulator does not allow a restitution of the sustained acceleration and no coordination between longitudinal and pitch channels may be done",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider motion planning for kinematically overconstrained vehicles. Such vehicles are reasonably common in applications that require many axles for static stability. When a system is kinematically overconstrained, typically some contacts with the environment must slip, violating the constraint. This introduces nonsmooth behavior into the equations of motion, making classical motion planning strategies inapplicable. As an example, we consider a vehicle that has a simplified version of the kinematic structure of the rover from the first Mars mission. We introduce a provably complete motion planner for purposes of illustration. However, the primary purpose of this paper is to clearly identify some of the open problems in motion planning for these mechanisms and to propose a kinematic modeling framework that reveals the underlying complications due to slipping while maintaining the relative simplicity associated with kinematic systems over dynamic ones. The planner we describe has properties that we anticipate would be relevant to a general methodology for motion planning for both kinematically overconstrained systems as well as more general systems that have uncertain dynamics",

However, many important application domains require manipulating deformable objects, especially deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as ropes, cables, and sutures. Such objects are far more challenging to handle, as they can exhibit a much greater diversity of behaviors. This paper describes a new motion planner for manipulating DLOs and tying knots (self-knots and knots around simple static objects) using cooperating robot arms. The planner constructs a topologically-biased probabilistic roadmap in the DLO's configuration space. Unlike in traditional motion planning problems, the goal is a topological state of the world, rather than a geometric one. The implemented planner was tested in simulation to achieve various knots like bowline, neck-tie, bow (shoe-lace), and stun-sail",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The roller racer, an undulatory locomotion system, is a toy which can be propelled forward by sitting on it and only oscillating the steering handle. A nonholonomic dynamic model and controllability analysis of the roller racer was first published by Krishnaprasad and Tsakiris in 1998. The model is derived from the usual assumption that all the wheels obey sticking (non-slipping) constraints, i.e., rolling without slipping. Controllability analysis shows that under these assumptions, the roller racer cannot be stopped once started. Yet physical prototypes do not exhibit this characteristic. In this paper, a high-fidelity model of the roller racer is presented by considering the finite static friction between the wheels and the ground, i.e., slipping will occur when constraint force exceeds the maximal allowable frictional force. It is proved that the system could be stopped from any state with only the steering angle control. Furthermore, based on group symmetry and motion primitives, a planner is designed to achieve motions between any two given positions and orientations with zero velocities. Experiments also show that front wheel slipping stops the system faster than joint frictions",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the application of a piezoelectric stack actuator for vibration control in a large-scale robotic manipulator, called the macro manipulator, is studied. The structural flexibility of the system includes deflection and torsional vibration modes. The vibration modes are detected using an appropriate sensor attachment. A nominal transfer function matrix between the input signals of the actuators and the output voltages of the sensors is obtained. A closed-loop controller based on the obtained model is designed. Because of the presence of different vibrational modes and model uncertainties resulting from manipulator motion as well as its varying payloads, an Hinfin  robust controller is utilized and experimental results are presented",

It is assumed that the constraints between the fingertips and the object is rolling and smooth, and each finger contacts with the object at one point. The controller requires no object information, no preplanning and no force sensors. It uses only joint angle, joint angular velocity, contact points (tactile feedback) and the fingers' link length. The paper begins with an derivation of dynamics of the finger-object system. We propose a stable grasping controller and briefly show the proof of dynamic stability of the system. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller with tactile feedback can easily realize the stable pinching",

Key to this approach are methods for dilating the free space and for determining the amount of dilation needed. This paper presents a new method of dilation by shrinking the geometric models of robots and obstacles. Compared with existing work, the new method is more efficient in both running time and memory usage. It is also integrated with collision checking, a key operation in PRM planning. The efficiency of the dilation method enables a new PRM planner which quickly constructs a series of dilated free spaces and automatically determine the amount of dilation needed. Experiments show that both the dilation method and the planner work well in complex geometric environments. In particular, the planner reliably solved the most difficult version of the alpha puzzle, a benchmark test for PRM planners",

Interestingly, when multiple team members can actuate the object being tracked, the motion can become highly discontinuous and nonlinear. We have previously developed a successful tracking approach that switches among target motion models as a function of one robot's actions. In this paper, we report on a tracking approach that can use a dynamic multiple motion model based on a team coordination plan. We present the multi-model probabilistic tracking algorithms in detail and present empirical results both in simulation and in a human-robot Segway soccer team. The team coordination plan allows the robot to much more effectively track mobile targets",

Broadly speaking, IvP coordinates competing control needs such as primary task execution that depends on a sufficient position estimate, and vehicle maneuvers that will improve that position estimate. In this work, vehicles cooperate to improve their position estimates using a sequence of vehicle-to-vehicle range estimates from acoustic modems. Coordinating primary task execution and sensor quality maintenance is a ubiquitous problem, especially in underwater marine vehicles. This work represents the first use of multiobjective optimization in a behavior-based architecture to address this problem",

The multi-scale representation can lead to improved robustness and computational efficiencies in basic operations, such as matching and correspondence, that commonly arise in many localization and mapping procedures. For multi-scale matching and correspondence we introduce a chi2 criterion that is calculated from the estimated variance in position of each detected line segment or point. This improved correspondence method can be used as the basis for simple scan-matching displacement estimation, as a part of a SLAM implementation, or as the basis for solutions to the kidnapped robot problem.

The graphic models of the haptic systems are required to deal with complex geometries, material properties, and the dynamics of the virtual objects to display realistic deformation. Accurate graphic models often incur heavy computational burden, and the reflective force cannot be computed at 1 kHz. This problem is resolved by employing a multirate output estimation method. The dynamics of the graphic model is represented by a discrete input-output model. The parameters of the discrete input-output model are estimated on-line by the proposed multirate output estimation algorithm. The reflective force is computed from the estimated input-output model at a high rate, and traces the force computed from the graphic model as the estimation error quickly approaches zero. The convergence of the proposed estimation algorithm is proved, and the performance is evaluated with simulation",

Given a motion planning problem for such a system and that a solution to the problem exists, then a finite reachability graph containing a solution trajectory is guaranteed to exist, under very reasonable conditions. In general, this graph can be generated using sufficiently dense input space sampling, sufficiently small time step, and sufficiently large tree depth. We show how to find and search such a tree in an incremental, multiresolution way. We prove the completeness of our algorithm, discuss related practical concerns, and show experimental results for several systems",

By exploring the external service servers on the network, the ability of a humanoid is extendable beyond its resource constrains. This system is named network-based humanoid. In this paper, the network-based humanoid architecture (NBHA) is proposed to provide a core framework to develop this network-based humanoid system. It creates a system where humans, robots, and external service servers can interact without complicated configuration. Using this architecture, behaviors can be created, added and removed dynamically. A number of experiments have been conducted successfully by using JadeLeap middleware, FIPA standard and JESS rule engine on our humanoid. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture provides the extendable behavior control system in the network environment, decreases the development time for adding new services and it decreases the time for network connection of robots and user devices",

These rules are written to train and guide safe human operation of marine vehicles and are heavily dependent on human common sense in determining rule applicability as well as rule execution, especially when multiple rules apply simultaneously. To capture the flexibility exploited by humans, this work applies a novel method of multi-objective optimization, interval programming, in a behavior-based control framework for representing the navigation rules, as well as task behaviors, in a way that achieves simultaneous optimal satisfaction. We present experimental validation of this approach using multiple autonomous surface craft. This work represents the first in-field demonstration of multiobjective optimization applied to autonomous COLREGS-based marine vehicle navigation",

The developed approach is designed to enable the manipulator to conserve the joint configuration in cyclic trajectories and to avoid the joint limits. Since the inverse kinematics in this problem has an infinite number of joint angle vectors, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is designed to provide an approximate value for that vector. Feeding this vector as an additional hint input vector to the NN limits and guides the output of the NN within the self-motion. The derivation of the Lyapunov function which is designed to achieve both of the tasks, leads to a computationally efficient online learning algorithm of the NN. The effectiveness of the developed approach is studied by conducting experiments on the PA-10 redundant manipulator",

        "abstract": "Inserting an endoscope into colon requires very technical procedure and it is difficult in some cases even for experienced doctors. Although active colonoscopes have been researched, these instruments are still in the development stage. Mechanisms for this application are required to be soft enough not to injure the colon wall and being deformable enough to adapt to the curves of the colon. In addition, the mechanisms must generate distributed force adequate for traveling. These requirements are difficult to be satisfied using conventional mechanisms and actuators. We have designed and developed two types of new driving mechanism using pneumatic rubber actuators and made their feasibility tests. One mechanism is \"thin tube wave generator\": introducing pulse pneumatic flows to a thin rubber tube causes traveling deformation waves on the tube surface, which drives an object placed on the tube. The other mechanism is \"round bubbler\": a rubber tube which has four chambers in it is wound around the colonoscope to cause traveling deformation waves on the scope surface by sending pneumatic pressures to each chamber sequentially. In this paper, first, we discuss the driving mechanisms, pneumatic control systems, and basic characteristics of these two mechanisms. Then, based on the basic experimental discussions, we fabricated special rubber mechanisms to fit around a conventional colonoscope, and conducted insertion experiments using an intestinum model and an existing colonoscope under various conditions. The experimental results are very promising",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a non-intrusive eye gaze estimation system is proposed. The proposed system consists of five light sources and two cameras, and the direction of the user's eye gaze can be computed by using a projective property without computing the geometrical relation among the eye, the cameras, and the monitor in 3D space. Our method is accurate under head movement, and is comparatively simple and fast. We introduce our method and show experimental results. The experimental results would verify the feasibility of the proposed system as a human-machine interface",

In this paper, a sliding mode observer is firstly constructed to estimate slip parameters based on the kinematics model of a skid-steering vehicle and trajectory measurement. The stability of the sliding mode observer is given in a mathematical context. Slip estimation schemes using an extended Kalman filter and direct mathematical inversion of the kinematic equations are also presented for comparison purposes. It is shown that the non-linear sliding mode observer is more accurate than the other two methods. The robustness and superior performance of the sliding mode observer is demonstrated using both simulation and experimental results. A camera based system is used to measure the vehicle trajectory during experimental validation",

        "abstract": "A significant amount of work has been reported in the area of visual servoing during the last decade. However, most of the contributions are applied in cases of holonomic robots. More recently, the use of visual feedback for control of nonholonomic vehicles has been reported. Some of the examples are docking and parallel parking maneuvers of cars or vision-based stabilization of a mobile manipulator to a desired pose with respect to a target of interest. Still, many of the approaches are mostly interested in the control part of visual servoing loop considering very simple vision algorithms based on artificial markers. In this paper, we present an approach for nonholonomic visual servoing based on epipolar geometry. The method facilitates a classical teach-by-showing approach where a reference image is used to define the desired pose (position and orientation) of the robot. The major contribution of the paper is the design of the control law that considers nonholonomic constraints of the robot as well as the robust feature detection and matching process based on scale and rotation invariant image features. An extensive experimental evaluation has been performed in a realistic indoor setting and the results are summarized in the paper",

Both the position and differential kinematics problems for the hybrid system are solved in details, and the dynamic model for the MPM is derived via Lagrangian formulation approach with simplifying hypotheses. Furthermore, taking the MPM self motion into consideration due to its redundancy, the dynamic control in task space is implemented by employing a model-based controller. Simulation results illustrate that not only the control algorithms are effective well, but also the established dynamic models are accurate enough as well",

Although MR compatibility is a major challenge for development of such robots, no simulation method was known that could predict it. This paper demonstrates the potential of two basic techniques that are useful in predicting the magnetic and electromagnetic compatibility. First, the distortion of the magnetic field caused by the robot can be computed by a finite element method. Simulation of the resonance signal distribution showed good agreement with experimentally obtained signal distributions. Second, a noise source and its strength can be visualized by a spectrum analyzer",

These wheels transmit a power torque according to a direction and are completely free with respect to the two others. They are used on 2 mechanical structures: SM1 and SM2. The complete kinematic study emphasizes the facility of controlling such omni-directional robots, and examines the problems involved in the transition of the wheel-to-floor contact on each axle. From this double study emerges an optimal theoretical architecture, but difficult to realize mechanically. We then present a controller which compensates for the errors related to the simplest mechanical structure; and it is validated on a mobile robot ROMNI using mechanical structure SM1",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the subject of an increasing interest in many applications. Autonomy is one of the major advantages of these vehicles. It is then necessary to develop particular sensors in order to provide efficient navigation functions. In this paper, we propose a method for attitude computation catadioptric images. We first demonstrate the advantages of the catadioptric vision sensor for this application. In fact, the geometric properties of the sensor permit to compute easily the roll and pitch angles. The method consists in separating the sky from the earth in order to detect the horizon. We propose an adaptation of the Markov random fields for catadioptric images for this segmentation. The second step consists in estimating the parameters of the horizon line thanks to a robust estimation algorithm. We also present the angle estimation algorithm and finally, we show experimental results on synthetic and real images captured from an airplane",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the growing interest for omnidirectional sensors on robotic applications and particularly on vision-based control, we present a new framework to handle in a visual servoing scheme the projection of line features into the image plane of a central catadioptric camera. As it is well known, the projection of a 3D line in the image plane of a central catadioptric camera is a conic curve. We propose to use the polar line of the image center with respect to this conic curve to define the input of the vision-based control scheme. The visual observations obtained from the polar lines lead to a minimal representation of projected lines. An efficient control scheme based only on two image features can then be designed. Simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of our approach",

The two basic transformations, namely transpose Jacobian and inverse Jacobian, are said to be dual and any task-space setpoint controller can be obtained from the other by replacing the transpose Jacobian by the inverse Jacobian, and vice versa. Our result also provides a unified analysis for the transpose Jacobian setpoint control and inverse Jacobian setpoint control problems. Experiment results are also presented to verify the theory",

We validate the architecture in a series of experiments, where a human demonstrator teaches a humanoid robot simple manipulatory tasks. First, the combined joint angles and hand path motions are projected into a generic latent space, composed of a mixture of Gaussians (GMM) spreading across the spatial dimensions of the motion. Second, the temporal variation of the latent representation of the motion is encoded in a hidden Markov model (HMM). This two-step probabilistic encoding provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected by the robot, which determines a metric of imitation performance. A generalization of the demonstrated trajectories is then performed using Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). Finally, to generalize skills across contexts, we compute formally the trajectory that optimizes the metric, given the new context and the robot's specific body constraints",

In this paper, this topology is formally derived and all the cells, in the configuration space of the platform, of dimension 6 (non-singular) and dimension 5 (singular), together with their adjacencies, are worked out in detail. This characterization of the singularity loci is useful to come up with designs which admit control strategies free of singularities. In particular, it is shown that by adding an extra leg to any flagged manipulator, the resulting 7-leg structure admits a control strategy (by appropriately choosing which leg remains passive) that completely avoids singularities",

Variations in illumination, suspended particles and a resulting reduction in visibility hinders vision systems from performing satisfactorily in marine environments; at least not as well as they do in terrestrial (Le. non-underwater) surroundings. Our work focuses on quantitatively measuring the performance of three color-based tracking algorithms- color blob tracker, color histogram tracker and mean-shift tracker, in tracking objects underwater in different levels lighting and visibility.

This analysis is utilized in the design of data fusion algorithms, that correctly account for the existing correlations. We examine two cases: i) pose propagation based exclusively on inferred displacement measurements, and ii) the fusion of proprioceptive sensor information with relative-state measurements. For the latter case, an efficient EKF-based estimation algorithm is proposed, that extends the approach of S.I. Roumeliotis and J. Burdick, 2002.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the walking pattern generation method, the kinematic resolution method of CoM (center of mass) Jacobian with an embedded motion, and the walking controller design method for humanoid robots. First, the walking pattern is generated using the simplified model for bipedal robot. Second, the kinematic resolution of CoM Jacobian with embedded motion makes a humanoid robot balanced automatically during the movement of the all other limbs. Actually, it offers the ability of whole body coordination to the humanoid robot. Third, the walking controller is composed of the CoM controller minus the ZMP (zero momentum position) controller. Also, we show that the proposed walking controller brings the disturbance input-to-state stability (ISS) for the simplified bipedal walking robot model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed kinematic resolution method and walking controller is shown through experiments in regard to humanoid robot dancing and walking",

The algorithm incorporates a mechanism, the adjoining property, to select the state transitions that will be learned by the robot controller. The method overcomes some limitations of reinforcement learning techniques when they are employed in applications with continuous non-linear systems, such as nonholonomic vehicles. Furthermore, a good approximation to the optimal behaviour is obtained by a look-up table without of using function interpolation. Finally, we present both simulation and experimental results to show the satisfactory performance of the method compared with the popular Q-learning algorithm",

This paper presents a system for online environment reconstruction that utilizes both external sensors for global localization, and on-body sensors for detailed local mapping. An external optical motion capture system is used to accurately localize on-board sensors that integrate successive 2D views of a calibrated camera and range measurements from a SwissRanger SR-2 time-of-flight sensor to construct global environment maps in real-time. Environment obstacle geometry is encoded in 2D occupancy grids and 2.5D height maps for navigation planning. We present an on-body implementation for the HRP-2 humanoid robot that, combined with a footstep planner, enables the robot to autonomously traverse dynamic environments containing unpredictably moving obstacles",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an algorithm about online gait trajectory generation method, controller for walking, brief introduction of humanoid robot platform KHR-3 (KAIST Humanoid Robot-3: HUBO) and experimental result. The gait trajectory has continuity, smoothness in varying walking period and stride, and it has simple mathematical form which can be implemented easily. It is tested on the robot with some control algorithms. The gait trajectory algorithm is composed of two kinds of function trajectory. The first one is cycloid function, which is used for ankle position in Cartesian coordinate space. Because this profile is made by superposition of linear and sinusoidal function, it has a property of slow start, fast moving, and slow stop. This characteristics can reduce the over burden at instantaneous high speed motion of the actuator. The second one is 3rd order polynomial function. It is continuous in the defined time interval, easy to use when the boundary condition is well defined, and has standard values of coefficients when the time scale is normalized. Position and velocity values are used for its boundary condition. Controllers mainly use F/T(Force/Torque) sensor at the ankle of the robot as a sensor data, and modify the input position profiles (in joint angle space and Cartesian coordinate space). They are to reduce unexpected external forces such as landing shock, and vibration induced by compliances of the sensors and reduction gears, because they can affect seriously on the walking stability. This trajectory and control algorithm is now on the implementing stage for the free-walking realization of KHR-3. As a first stage of realization, we realized the marking time and forward walking algorithm with variable frequency and stride",

It generally corresponds to the motion field of the captured scene in the image so that we can use it distinguish moving objects. The computation of optical flow is conventionally based on the assumption of uniform brightness, which however does not always hold. Numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve the computation precision of optical flow. In this paper, we propose to incorporate optical flow information into a novel geodesic active contour model for moving-object detection in monocular robots. Specifically, an active contour is formulated by using the level set method, which eliminates the need of a re-initialization procedure. The developed scheme alleviates the effect of optical flow noise, increasing the robustness of the perception of moving objects. The experimental results show that our algorithm can successfully track a moving target, e.g., a human being",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, developers have created a number of manipulators designed to provide physical services to human beings. Collisions between those manipulators and humans or other objects in the environment generate massive impacts, causing injury or limiting execution speed. These collisions are unavoidable, however; therefore it is essential that the force of such impacts be reduced, thus improving safety and task performance. One of the most effective methods to reduce impact force is to decelerate by braking immediately before the collision. In this paper, we propose dynamic acceleration polytope braking (DAPB), a method which is optimal braking to decelerate impact velocity quickly and without varying the direction of motion in redundant manipulators. DAPB uses a dynamic acceleration polytope to represent the acceleration ability, while considering manipulator dynamics to determine braking torque. By adopting DAPB, the velocity at impact can be decelerated faster than by zero-braking, which decelerates all joint velocities to zero; as a result, impact force can be greatly reduced. Moreover, since the path of the impact point does not stray from the initial impact direction, additional dangerous situations could be avoided. Several simulations and experiments are executed to confirm the braking performance of DAPB",

Linear programming and LMI solutions are provided for the problem of centralized optimization of communication weights considering the possibility of intermittent bounded communication delays. Heuristic weighting schemes that can be implemented in a distributed fashion are also studied. Consensus convergence time may also be reduced by introducing long-range interactions, creating a \"small world\" network",

        "abstract": "Optimal path planning under full state and map knowledge is often accomplished using some variant of Dijkstra's algorithm, despite the fact that it represents the path domain as a discrete graph rather than as a continuous space. In this paper we compare Dijkstra's discrete algorithm with a variant (often called the fast marching method) which more accurately treats the underlying continuous space. Analytically, both generate a value function free of local minima, so that optimal path generation merely requires gradient descent. We also investigate the use of optimality metrics other than Euclidean distance for both algorithms. These different norms better represent optimal paths for some types of problems, as demonstrated by planning optimal collision-free paths for a multiple robot scenario. When considering approximations consistent with the underlying state space, our conclusion is that fast marching places fewer constraints upon grid connectivity, and that it achieves better accuracy than Dijkstra's discrete algorithm in many but not all cases",

        "abstract": "In this paper the problem of active object recognition/pose estimation is investigated. The principle component analysis is used to produce an observation vector from images captured simultaneously by multiple cameras from different view angles of an object belonging to a set of a priori known objects. Models of occlusion and sensor noise have been incorporated into a probabilistic model of sensor/object to increase the robustness of the recognition process with respect to such uncertainties. A recursive Bayesian state estimation problem is formulated to identify the object and estimate its pose by fusing the information obtained from the cameras at multiple steps. In order to enhance the quality of the estimates and to reduce the number of images taken, the positions of the cameras are controlled based on a statistical performance criterion, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Comparative Monte Carlo experiments conducted with a two-camera system demonstrate that the features of the proposed method, i.e. information fusion from multiple sources, active optimal sensor planing, and occlusion modelling are all highly effective for object classification/pose estimation in the presence of structured noise",

To generate locomotion trajectory for the proposed robot, we adopt the genetic algorithm for minimizing energy consumption. For the fast convergence and efficiency, the RCGA (real coded genetic algorithms) is used. A trajectory is represented by 4-th order polynomials whose coefficients are chromosomes. Equality conditions reflect the start and end position of swing leg and the repeatability condition for stable walking is used with inequality conditions to describe kinematics constraints for swing motion and ZMP (zero moment point) conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed structure and trajectories, computer simulations were executed using SimMechanicsreg",

An effective hybrid force/position based-approach for multi-inputs/multi-outputs (MIMO) robot control is proposed. The approach is based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC) design and optimization methodology operating in two stages: at the first stage, the FLC architecture is defined and the input variables space is partitioned; and the FLC is trained offline on the basis of data acquired during free motion of the robot, in order to map FLC outputs to real behaviour. A method based on Solis' and Wetts' algorithm is then applied for fuzzy parameter optimization so that the constraints in terms of interpretability of the predefined rules are respected. Finally, an online learning of the generated FLC is implemented into the proposed control structure. The approach has been implemented into an experimental setup, including a 2D Cartesian robot linked to a C5 parallel robot, performing contour following under force constraints. The analysis and evaluation of the obtained results show the suitability and efficiency of the proposed approach",

A visual feedback system is constructed to control cells using galvanotaxis (response to the electric field).

        "abstract": "This paper describes a 3D SLAM system using information from an actuated laser scanner and camera installed on a mobile robot. The laser samples the local geometry of the environment and is used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of the workspace. Sequences of images from the camera are used to detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are then further processed with their corresponding local laser scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations. We show how naive application of this transformation to effect the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals. The results are overlaid on an aerial image to provide a ground truth comparison with the estimated map. The paper concludes with an extension into the multi-robot domain in which 3D maps resulting from distinct SLAM sessions (no common reference frame) are combined without recourse to mutual observation",

By putting together insights from the fields of autonomous robotics and of ambient intelligence, the PEIS-ecology approach explores a new road to building assistive, personal, and service robots.

PRIDE is based upon the 4D/RCS (real-time control system) architecture and provides information to planners at the level of granularity that is appropriate for their planning horizon. The primary contribution of this paper is the approach that is used to provide a more synergistic framework, in which the results from one prediction algorithm are used to strengthen/weaken the results of another prediction algorithm. In particular, we describe how the results of an estimation-theoretic short-term (ST) prediction algorithm are used to validate the results of a situation-based long-term (LT) prediction algorithm. We show the results of the long-term prediction both before and after the results of the short-term predictions are integrated, and demonstrate how the latter provide better predictions of vehicle future positions using the AutoSim simulation package",

This paper presents and compares two methods for tracking objects in a stereo camera system using particle filters which differ in the way they address the problem of stereo correspondence during the filtering process. In the first approach, two particle sets, one for each of the left and right stereo image frames are maintained and a mapping between the two sets is established by soft-stereo method, the particles are tracked in three-dimensional space and mapped back into the image frames to make the observations. The effectiveness of the approaches is demonstrated through experiments tracking a moving object and the two approaches are compared in terms of their convergence times and tracking errors",

To get accurate heading information robustly, we propose a method which combines particle filtering with magnetic compasses. Although magnetic compasses can provide absolute heading angle, they have not been used for indoor applications since serious magnetic interferences are commonly founded in home/office environments. We overcome this difficulty by 1) suggesting statistical calibration of a magnetic compass, 2) deriving necessary conditions of the Earth's magnetic field area, and 3) designing an event-based particle filter based on likelihood calculated from conditional probability. Particle filter is an emerging key technology which can be applied to nonlinear/non-Gaussian model, beyond the limitations of Kalman filter. We take advantage of particle filter to optimally fuse the information from both magnetic compasses and odometry data. Experimental results on mobile robot navigation in indoor environments show reliability and robustness of the proposed method",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel control framework for bilateral teleoperation of a pair of multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear robotic systems under constant communication delays. The proposed framework utilizes the simple proportional-derivative (PD) control, i.e. the master and slave robots are directly connected via spring and damper over the delayed communication channels. Using the controller passivity concept, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique, and Parseval's identity, we can passify the combination of the delayed communication and control blocks altogether robustly, as long as the delays are finite constants and an upper-bound for the round-trip delay is known. Having explicit position feedback through the delayed P-action, the proposed framework enforces master-slave position coordination which is often compromised in the velocity-based schemes (e.g. conventional scattering-based teleoperation). The proposed control framework provides humans with extended physiological proprioception so that s/he can affect and sense the remote slave environments mainly relying on her/his musculoskeletal systems. Experiments are performed to validate the proposed control framework",

        "abstract": "Rapid tooling (RT) has recently become more important due to the requirement of rapid manufacturing. RT can manufacture stronger mold and functional component than rapid prototyping (RP) does. Besides, functional component and production are valued gradually. Functionally graded materials (FGM) technology is proposed to apply to functional component. This study aims to propose a new path planning, contour path method, and control feed rate of two powder feeders with two DC server motors to design a functionally graded material (FGM) structure. The continuous material distribution in each layer is changed into discrete stepwise grading by contour path method. It can avoid the problem of manufacturing process with Zig-Zag and increase the resolution of the grading region. Furthermore, the powder delivery database of material is built to control the composition of FGM accurately. Finally, the results of path planning and the case of powder feed are successfully demonstrated",

        "abstract": "Birth represents for each human being one the most wonderful days of his life but also one of the most dangerous. Being born in safe conditions requires to be surrounded by professionals who acquire a rigorous knowledge of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Nowadays, midwives and obstetricians learn mainly in delivery ward during real childbirths. For difficult childbirths, the use of obstetrical instruments (forceps, spatulas or vacuum extractors) is unavoidable. However, the use of such instruments increases the risks of lesions for the mother and the fetus. In practical, only clinical experience acquired in the delivery ward enables these risks to be reduced. Nowadays, simulators in medicine have a real appeal in the medical environment. These tools enable doctors to visualize the position of the organs in the human body, to plan their movements or to carry out a more complete post operational control. A birth simulator provides a training tool and a research tool to compare various techniques for the use of obstetrical instruments or to validate new methods. It is in this context that we have developed, in collaboration with researchers and medical doctors, a new type of instrumented forceps to offer new solutions for training obstetricians for the safe use of obstetrical forceps delivery. The main contributions of this paper are the design of instrumented forceps coupled with the BirthSIM simulator and the path analysis during the forceps blades placement. This analysis leads to the comparison of the repeatability of the movement between novice obstetricians and expert obstetricians. The results highlight the lack of teaching tool to correctly train the novice obstetricians",

Proposed vascular model reproduces the 3-dimensional vessel lumen structure using CT/MRI information with 13 mum resolution, and it also reproduce the physical characteristics of arterial tissue (elastic modulus and friction coefficient). Furthermore, in this paper, we propose a novel method to evaluate the stress on vasculature which is applied by surgical operations. This method allows quantitatively evaluating 3-dimensional stress conditions in real-time during surgical simulation. Finally, we constructed a comprehensive surgical simulation system, which reproduces whole human aorta structure (with more than Imm inside diameter), reproduce patient-specific pulsatile blood streaming, allowed to evaluate the stress applied to the aorta structure by surgical operations with almost same manner and environment as the practical endovascular intervention. Consequently proposed model, evaluation method and resultant system provides a very valuable platform for evaluating the performance of surgical robots and instruments developed by developers and researchers, and surgical procedures",

The new model consists of two strategies: the optical acceleration cancellation (OAC) model, and the lateral alignment strategy. The OAC model uses a linearly decreasing cotangent function of the gaze angle to reduce the distance between the robot and the target on the ground. It determines a set of possible robot positions on the horizontal plane at every time instant. The robot laterally aligns with the target when it moves to the side. The lateral alignment strategy determines a unique robot position at each time instant. The new navigation strategy provides a simple and fast algorithm to navigate mobile robots in an open field to intercept ground balls. Visual servo controllers were designed and simulated. A high-speed mobile robot was developed to conduct interception experiments",

There is today no satisfactory known metric to measure quantitatively and precisely how a robot system satisfies accurately the specification expectations, neither do we know how to qualify and delineate in general the operational domains of the robot. This paper presents an approach aiming at qualifying robot autonomy. We present a method based on the measure of robot performance in achieving a given task related to environment complexity. In order to test a large number of tasks and environment configurations, we have designed a robot simulator that allows the use of the same algorithms implemented on the real robot and in simulation. To illustrate the work, we present results based on hundreds of simulations of a navigation mission and compare robot performance when algorithm parameters change",

        "abstract": "The Cool robot is a four-wheel-drive, solar-powered autonomous vehicle designed to support summertime science campaigns in Antarctica and Greenland. We deployed the robot at Summit Camp, Greenland, during 2005 to validate its power budget and to assess its unique control system that matches solar power input with power demand as the robot drives over rough terrain. The 61-kg robot drove continuously at 0.78 m/s on soft snow, its 160-W average power demand met by solar power alone under clear skies when sun elevation exceeded 16deg. The power-control system reliably matched input with demand as insolation changed during the tests. A simple GPS waypoint-following algorithm provided reliable autonomous navigation over periods of 5-8 hours. The data validate our design models and indicate that the Cool Robot exceeds its design goal of carrying a 15-kg payload 500 km in two weeks on the Antarctic plateau",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel technique for identifying soil parameters for a wheeled vehicle travelling on an unknown terrain. The identified soil parameters are required for predicting vehicle drawbar pull and wheel drive torque which can be employed for traversability prediction, traction control, and performance optimization of a wheeled vehicle on unknown terrain. The Newton Raphson method is used as the identification technique applied on the modified form of the wheel-soil interaction dynamics model using the composite Simpson's rule. This work focuses on identifying the internal friction angle, the shear deformation modulus, and the lumped pressure-sinkage coefficient. The fourth parameter, cohesion, does not influence the vehicle drawbar pull and is assigned an average value during the identification process. In an experimental study, the identified parameters are compared with known values, and shown to be in good agreement. Soil parameter identification can be carried out on-line and thus our approach is suitable for real-time applications. The robustness of the method is also shown to be relatively good. The identified soil parameters can be used to predict drawbar pull and wheel drive torque with good accuracy",

        "abstract": "A distributed processing and communication approach is applied to networked surveillance systems providing an extended perception and sensing capability in monitored environments. By pervasive we mean that the entire surveyed area is covered by a heterogeneous collection of fixed and mobile sensors. The sensor network uses a cooperative tracking technique that allows for the deployment of mobile sensors based on data provided by other sensors in the network. Also, an image-based tracking technique is used for tracking when the target is in view. The task of tracking multiple targets in a distributed surveillance network is a challenging problem because of the following reasons: (1) multiple targets need to be monitored and tracked continuously and must remain in view of at least one of the sensors; (2) the view of the sensors needs to be optimized so that the targets are observed with a discernible resolution for feature identification; (3) it is important to devise stable control algorithms for accomplishing the surveillance task; (4) assigning tracking tasks to sensors must consider load balancing and efficient use of all sensors. This paper presents a distributed communication and processing model that allows for a fast deployment of sensor nodes and implementation of ad hoc tracking in a multi-target surveillance scenario. Also, experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for tracking multiple targets over a large area with fixed and mobile sensors",

The novelty of our formulation is in the sensing model: we focus on stereo sensors where the measurements from two sensors must be combined for an estimation. We study two versions of this problem. In the first version, which we call the placement problem, we are given a workspace and an error threshold. The objective is to place a minimum number of cameras so that no matter where the target is located in the workspace, the uncertainty in localizing it is less than the threshold. For this problem, we present an approximation algorithm and prove that the deviation of its performance from the optimal value is bounded by a constant. In the second version, called the deployment problem, we study the problem of relocating a mobile sensor team to minimize the uncertainty in localizing possibly moving targets. We present a distributed, discrete-time algorithm which explicit addresses communication and motion constraints and show how to compute the optimal move within the time-step for a given target/sensor-pair assignment. The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated with simulations",

We obtain the triangulation of the set of features and we compute for every triangle its normal vector. By grouping adjacent triangles with equal normal we are able to select all the points belonging to the same plane. The method does not require any information about the camera calibration or the camera relative translation. Simulation and experiments on real images validate the proposed algorithm",

Micro finger structure for the micro hand consists of bonded two films having different stiffness. Balloon structures are designed between the two films. Swelling of the balloon structure by applied pressure generates bending motion of the micro finger. This combination of the micro hand is based on the human being's finger and/or hand. The guide robot has several design specifications such as multi degrees of freedom joint as a human, small size, highly accurate directional control and water/ sterilization proof. Micro manipulation robot system is developed by assembling the micro finger with two or three degree of freedom, the guide robot and VR (virtual reality) interface device. The hybrid motion and the manipulation of a single egg (phi1 mm) of fish and a hair (phi100 mum) in macro world is successfully realized",

        "abstract": "In free-floating mode, space manipulator systems have their actuators turned off, and exhibit nonholonomic behavior due to angular momentum conservation. The system is underactuated and a challenging problem is to control both the location of the end effector and the attitude of the base, using manipulator actuators only. Physical limitations, imposed by system's dynamic parameters, are examined. Lower and upper bounds for base rotation, due to manipulator motions, are estimated. An analytical path planning method is briefly presented and appended by a technique which extends drastically the accessibility of final configurations and simplifies the free parameters selection. Based on this extension, a numerical approach is also derived and examples are given. The presented methodologies avoid the need for many small cyclical motions, and use smooth functions in the planning scheme, leading to smooth configuration changes in finite and prescribed time",

This is an alternative to methods for finding global policies based on value functions using dynamic programming and also to using plans based on a single desired trajectory. Our method has the advantage of providing reasonable policies much faster than dynamic programming can provide an initial policy. It also has the advantage of providing more robust and global policies than following a single desired trajectory. Trajectory libraries can be created for robots with many more degrees of freedom than what dynamic programming can be applied to as well as for robots with dynamic model discontinuities. Results are shown for the \"Labyrinth\" marble maze, both in simulation as well as a real world version. The marble maze is a difficult task which requires both fast control as well as planning ahead",

The proposed approach provides a precise estimation of the number of model components (line segments) and their initial parameters independent of their initial values. We use principles of perceptual grouping to evaluate the approximation quality obtained in each expectation maximization (EM) step. By evaluating EM approximation quality we are able to recognize a locally optimal solution, and modify the number of model components and their parameters. Consequently, EM can converge only to a globally optimal solution independent of the initial number of model components and their initial parameters",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the port Hamiltonian model of a manipulator is presented as the result of the power-conserving interconnection of a set of main components (rigid bodies, flexible links and kinematic pairs). Since rigid bodies and flexible links are described within the port Hamiltonian formalism, their interconnection is possible once a proper relation between the power conjugated port variables is deduced. These relations are the analogous of the Kirchoff laws of circuit theory. The final model is a mixed port Hamiltonian system because of the presence of a finite dimensional subsystem modelling the rigid bodies and of an infinite dimensional one describing the flexible links. The intrinsic modularity of the approach simplifies the model deduction and simulation, while the Hamiltonian description suggests the development of energy-based controllers",

This impedance control is designed to realize the following features: 1) sinusoidal torque amplification. 2) Minimization of control input requirement by adjusting stiffness. 3) No requirement for the knowledge of amplitude, frequency and phase of human's torque. 4) No requirement for myoelectric signals. 5) Satisfaction of causality. Convergence of the proposed controller is proven theoretically. Simulation results verify the validity of the control scheme including some conditions not discussed in the theory. Experimental results show the validity of the control system including real human's complex dynamics and feedback loops",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces new analyses and algorithms which are essential for the practical implementation of continuous backbone continuum robots. Actuator length limits strongly shape the configuration or joint space of continuum manipulators, introducing couplings which are not reflected in previously published kinematic models. These unmodeled effects significantly restrict the practical application of previously established kinematic models on continuum robot hardware. This paper presents a new analysis of the effects of actuator limits on continuum robots. Based on the new understanding of the configuration space uncovered, we derive for the first time the configuration space of continuum robots when constrained by actuator length limits. These contributions are essential for effective use of a wide range of continuum robots and have been implemented and tested on two different types of continuum robots. Results and insight gained from this implementation are presented",

        "abstract": "Robotics technology promises an enhanced way of performing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In the robotic-assisted CABG surgery, surgeon performs the operation with intelligent robotic instruments controlled through teleoperation in place of conventional surgical tools. The robotic tools actively cancel the relative motion between the surgical instruments and the point-of-interest on the beating heart, in contrast to traditional off-pump CABG where the heart is passively constrained to dampen the beating motion. As a result, the surgeon operates on the heart as if it were stationary. This algorithm is called active relative motion canceling (ARMC). In this paper, the use of biological signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), to achieve better motion canceling in the model-based intelligent ARMC algorithm is proposed. An ECG contains records for the electrical activity of the heart, which forms a series of waves and complexes. Real time identification of these waves and complexes improve the estimation of the future heart motion and improve the performance of the ARMC algorithm. Finally, the experimental results of the algorithm implemented on a 3-DOF robotic test-bed system are reported",

However, when teleoperating a free-flying robot in space, it is difficult to ensure the commanded position or velocity because of the specific system dynamics. An acceleration command is much more appropriate. However, it is very difficult to handle the acceleration command for the operator. In this paper, a new predictive display technique named \"predictive motion display\" is introduced to overcome the problem. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces both task completion time and collision frequency by 33% and 86%, respectively. In addition, the effectiveness is discussed based on a simple feedback control model",

Especially, in real systems, the ambient flow velocity and angle effects on the thrust force are very important, because vehicles are continuously moving and/or hovering with thruster actions. In this paper, we execute preliminary experiments with the model containing ambient flow effects as CAR (critical advance ratio) and CIA (critical incoming angle). The distinguished characteristics of the above model is the three axial flow states classification. The whole thrust map is divided into three states according to the state of ambient flow velocity, angle, and propeller shaft velocity. The several controllers are tested using the three flow states information. The preliminary experimental results show the best performance can be obtained by the open loop control with accurate model, because the thrust force cannot be measured directly, so the force map from the propeller shaft velocity to thrust force plays important roll in control performance. However, the DOB (disturbance observer) with closed loop controller is realistic solution, because it can compensate various unknown disturbances in real systems",

HMMs in the lower layer abstract the motion patterns and HMMs in the upper layer represent the interaction patterns. We demonstrate the validity of this model through kick boxing match between a motion-captured human and humanoid robot, where the robot can autonomously generate its motion in response to attacks by the human",

In this paper we describe a two stage approach for localization in indoor environments. In the first stage, the environment is partitioned into several locations, each characterized by a set of scale-invariant keypoints and their associated descriptors. In the second stage the keypoints of the query view are integrated probabilistically yielding an estimate of most likely location. The novelty of our approach is in the selection of discriminative features, best suited for characterizing individual locations. We demonstrate that high location recognition rate is maintained with only 10% of the originally detected features, yielding a substantial speedup in recognition and capability of handling larger environments. The ambiguities due to the self-similarity and dynamic changes in the environment are resolved by exploiting spatial relationships between locations captured by hidden Markov model",

The policy is known to ensure safety (i.e., collision avoidance) for an arbitrarily large number of vehicles, if initial configurations satisfy certain conditions. The method is highly scalable, and effective solutions can be obtained for several tens of autonomous agents. On the other hand, the liveness properties of the policy, i.e. the capability of negotiating a solution in finite time, are not completely understood yet. In this paper, we introduce a condition on the final vehicle configurations, which we conjecture to be necessary and sufficient for guaranteeing liveness. We prove the necessity by a constructive method. Because of the overwhelming complexity of proving the sufficiency of such condition, we assess the correctness of the conjecture in probability through the analysis of the results of a large number of randomized experiments",

        "abstract": "We present a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators to be used as programmable central pattern generators, and apply it to control the locomotion of a humanoid robot. Central pattern generators are biological neural networks that can produce coordinated multidimensional rhythmic signals, under the control of simple input signals. They are found both in vertebrate and invertebrate animals for the control of locomotion. In this article, we present a novel system composed of coupled adaptive nonlinear oscillators that can learn arbitrary rhythmic signals in a supervised learning framework. Using adaptive rules implemented as differential equations, parameters such as intrinsic frequencies, amplitudes, and coupling weights are automatically adjusted to replicate a teaching signal. Once the teaching signal is removed, the trajectories remain embedded as the limit cycle of the dynamical system. An interesting aspect of this approach is that the learning is completely embedded into the dynamical system, and does not require external optimization algorithms. We use our system to encapsulate rhythmic trajectories for biped locomotion with a simulated humanoid robot, and demonstrate how it can be used to do online trajectory generation. The system can modulate the speed of locomotion, and even allow the reversal of direction (i.e. walking backwards).

Understanding how errors propagate in serial manipulators and cascades of platform manipulators is important for developing better designs. In this paper we show that errors propagate by convolution on the Euclidean motion group, SE (3). When local errors are small, they can be described well as distributions on the Lie algebra se(3). We show how the concept of a highly concentrated Gaussian distribution on SE(3) is equivalent to one on se(3). Numerical examples illustrate that convolution and covariance propagation provide the same answers for small errors",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the control method of biped walking with heel-off motion. Heel-off motion made it possible to avoid the problem for the impact shock at foot-contact to break the stabilization of walking. The 3D motion is separated into lateral and sagittal motion and each motion is designed individually under the assumption that each motion is possible to be treated independently each other. We adopt the approximate 1-mass model in both planes and derive the dynamics based on these models. It is assumed that the lateral motion is relevant to heel-off motion. On the other hand, in the sagittal plane, there are two phases: 1) the center of rotation (contact point) is ankle joint. 2) the center of rotation is toe. In phase 2), heel-off motion is designed to diminish the impact shock at foot-contact. By applying PDAC to the dynamics, phase around the contact point can be derived. By means of this phase of dynamics, it is possible to inspect heel-off motion analytically. We design the stabilizing controller for each plane and confirm the convergency of dynamics with the numerical simulation",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an interior point approach to exact distance computation between convex objects represented as intersections of implicit surfaces. The implicit surfaces considered include planes (polyhedra), quadrics, and generalizations of quadrics including superquadrics and hyperquadrics, as well as intersections of these surfaces. Exact distance computation algorithms are particularly important for applications involving objects that make contact, such as in dynamic simulations and in contact point prediction for dextrous manipulation. They can also be used in the narrow phase of hierarchical collision detection. In contrast to geometric approaches developed for polyhedral objects, we formulate the distance computation problem as a convex optimization problem; this optimization formulation has been previously described for polyhedral objects. We demonstrate that for general convex objects represented as implicit surfaces, interior point approaches are reasonably fast and in some cases, owing to their global convergence properties, are the only probably good choice for solving proximity query problems. We use an interior point algorithm that solves the KKT conditions obtained from the convex programming formulation. We present implementation results for example implicit surface objects and demonstrate that distance computation rates of about 1 kHz can be achieved",

Instead of only pushing the object through open spaces, we also allow it to use compliance, e.g. allowing it to slide along obstacle boundaries. The advantage of using compliance is twofold: compliance does not only extend the number of situations in which a push plan can be found, it also allows for simpler (i.e. less complicated) paths in many cases. Here, we present an approach based on the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm that, besides paths through the open space, exploits the power of compliance",

Our algorithm is based on a two-level hierarchical decomposition of the task, in which the high-level controller selects the sequence of foot-placement positions, and the low-level controller generates the continuous motions to move each foot to the specified positions. The high-level controller uses an estimate of the value function to guide its search; this estimate is learned partially from supervised data. The low-level controller is obtained via policy search.

Using a teach-replay approach, the robot is manually led along a desired path in a teaching phase, then the robot autonomously follows that path in a replay phase. The technique requires a single off-the-shelf, forward-looking camera with no calibration (including no calibration for lens distortion). Feature points are automatically detected and tracked throughout the image sequence, and the feature coordinates in the replay phase are compared with those computed previously in the teaching phase to determine the turning commands for the robot. The algorithm is entirely qualitative in nature, requiring no map of the environment, no image Jacobian, no homography, no fundamental matrix, and no assumption about a flat ground plane. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of autonomous navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments, on both flat and slanted surfaces, with dynamic occluding objects, for distances over 100 m",

We show that in such systems the product quality, in terms of quality buy rate (the good job ratio of all jobs), can be described by a function of repair capacity and first time quality (the good job ratio of all first time processed jobs). Variations in first time quality can lead to reduction of quality buy rate and substantial waste of production capacity and materials. Therefore, the repair and rework system should be designed to be robust to the fluctuations. Moreover, we observe that the quality buy rate is practically independent of the distribution of the first time quality, but depends primarily on its coefficient of variations",

This paper also includes an experimental evaluation of the device to prove effectiveness of displaying textures. Material property discriminating evaluation was conducted using thermal feedback device that displays simulated temperature profile. To determine the relation between stimulated area and thermal perception sensitivity, a thermal perception experimental setup is developed and the experimental method is described",

Prioritized sweeping, directed exploration, and transformed reward functions provide additional speed-ups. The robot quickly learns goal-directed policies from scratch, requiring few interactions with the environment and making efficient use of available computation time. From an outside perspective it learns the behavior online and in real time. We describe comparisons with standard methods and show the individual utility of each of the proposed techniques",

Since February 2005 a two joint manipulator can be operated from ground via a direct radio link. The aim of ROKVISS is the in flight verification of highly integrated modular robotic joints as well as the demonstration of different control modes, reaching from high system autonomy to force feedback teleoperation. A main goal of the experiment is the evaluation of the dynamical parameters (especially friction, motor constant and stiffness), as well as the monitoring of their evolution over the duration of the mission, in order to validate the long term performance of the system. The paper gives first a short overview of the experiment and in particular a description of the applied control structures. The main focus of the paper is on the joint parameter identification results obtained so far, during one year of operation",

The planner consists of a dual-tree RRT algorithm that uses a novel local planner. A local planner tests if two robot configurations can be connected by a simple path. Ours searches a 3DOF subspace of the robot/obstacle configuration space, whereas prior planners search the line segment that connects the two configurations. Empirical evidence suggests that the benefit of the 3DOF search outweighs the cost. Our planner outperforms prior planners on problems with narrow channels and performs comparably (shorter paths, similar running times) on other problems",

This modality is useful in those cases where environmental conditions preclude measurement of bearing (typically done optically) to landmarks. Here we extend the paradigm to consider the case where the landmarks (nodes of a sensor network) are able to measure range to each other. We show how the two capabilities are complimentary in being able to achieve a map of the landmarks and to provide localization for the moving robot. We present recent results with experiments on a robot operating in a randomly arranged network of nodes that can communicate via radio and range to each other using sonar. We find that incorporation of inter-node measurements helps reduce drift in positioning as well as leads to faster convergence of the map of the nodes. We find that addition of a mobile node makes the SLAM feasible in a sparsely connected network of nodes",

Traditional methods for attitude estimation via Kalman filtering are beset by many conceptual problems relating to the representation of orientations in linear spaces, leading to difficulties in implementation and the interpretation of uncertainty estimates, among other issues. These problems are compounded when it is necessary to jointly estimate position and attitude. We demonstrate how Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering provides a framework for approaching this estimation problem that is both conceptually appealing and practical. Results are shown that demonstrate the filter's robustness to sensor outages and its ability to perform well even in situations with noisy sensors and high initial uncertainty in all state dimensions; these situations are precisely those in which traditional Kalman filtering approaches are most likely to experience problems",

        "abstract": "For planning and implementation of manipulation tasks using one or two arms/hands of a humanoid robot, which would be the most common application of the robot in the future, it is undoubtedly important to know the workspace of the robot. In this paper, we study the reachable space or boundary of an arm/hand when the humanoid robot stands on the ground with its two feet fixed. Since a humanoid robot has more degrees of freedom than a traditional robot and special characters that the latter does not possess, it would be very difficult or impractical to use conventional methods to analyze and obtain its reachable space. Here we propose a numerical approach to analyze and generate humanoid reachable space. Taking into account the robot balance, the geometric and kinematic constraints, we use optimization technique to build mathematic models for the reachable boundary. This discrete method gives rise to an approximation of the reachable space though, it is adequate for practical application. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by an example conducted on the humanoid platform HRP-2, and can be extended to more complex cases",

        "abstract": "The paper addresses the warehouseman's problem with geometrical simplifications under the more realistic case of imperfect sensory information. In this scenario, a 2D workspace contains an actuated robot and a set of unactuated parts. The discrepancy between the robot's and/or the parts' real and measured positions may lead to jerky movements or even collisions in the parts' moving problem we are concerned with. Thus, we need to approximate the state information - taking the highly nonlinear nature of the resulting system into account. This is accomplished using particle filters - which implement recursive Bayesian filter in nonlinear and/or nongaussian environments. For the model of parts which turns out to be linear, the approach reduces to Kalman filtering. First the robot's dynamic model and the measurement model are modified to incorporate the inaccuracies in the sensory data; and then the particle filter is utilized to get improved positional estimate. Enhancements in the robot's movements and reduction in the number of collisions have been verified through extensive computer simulations",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more predominant in modern reconnaissance in both military and civilian applications. Object identification and tracking are typical elements of most missions. While large and expensive UAVs operate in many theatres, there is a need for local intelligence gathering using small, low cost and often disposable UAV platforms. In many situations it may not be practical or desirable for the UAV to be relaying information to the ground via radio link. Similarly, waiting upon ground based control for instruction may also limit the usefulness of a UAV. While ground based control is common, full autonomy allows a UAV to operate beyond the range of human intervention. In such cases, the UAV must be capable of making decisions for itself based on information gained from its surroundings. This paper discusses the development of a vision processing system for a low-cost UAV with a total flying weight of under 3 kg. The system has currently been tested using simulated and real aerial footage with a mission to detect the presence of cars and land vehicles in the field of view. Experiments were conducted using actual FPGA based hardware. This research was conducted by Ashiri and Pyke as part of an undergraduate thesis project in the Dept. Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University",

A nonlinear minimization approach is used to register 2D and 3D cues for monocular 3D tracking. The integration of texture information in a more classical nonlinear edge-based pose computation highly increases the reliability of more conventional edge-based 3D tracker. Robustness is enforced by integrating a M-estimator into the minimization process via an iteratively re-weighted least squares implementation. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several video sequences as well as in visual servoing experiments considering various objects. Results show the method to be robust to large motions and textured environments",

This approach was developed with the annual RoboCup Competition in mind, specifically the 4-Legged League where teams of Sony AIBO robots compete in the game of soccer. The images used for processing were taken from the camera located in the head of the robots, and the objects of interest to be detected were the actual AIBO robots. We use color segmented images for producing initial hypotheses for the location of robots in the image, and grayscale images for final classification purposes. Using both representations to process a scene allows each to make up for the deficiencies of the other, and provides a good balance between fast processing time and high detection accuracy. We present our algorithms and show illustrative examples of their performance",

        "abstract": "There is a strong need to improve the tools clinicians use for training in procedures such as prostate brachytherapy where the success rate is directly related to the clinician's level of experience. Accurate haptic feedback is needed for developing improved surgical simulators and trainers for such procedures. In prostate brachytherapy, accurate needle placement of radioactive seeds in the prostate is crucial to the success of the surgery and to the quality of life of the patient. Therefore, a trainer or simulator for this and other types of needle insertion tasks require an accurate reality-based quantification and model of the needle and soft tissue interaction. To achieve this, we utilize the X-ray images produced by a dual C-arm fluoroscope setup during a needle insertion task to obtain parameters needed for accurate modeling of soft tissue and needle interactions. The needle and implanted markers in the tissue are tracked during the insertion and withdrawal of the needle at speeds of 1.016 mm/sec, 12.7 mm/sec and 25.4 mm/sec. Both image and force data are utilized to determine important parameters such as the local effective modulus during puncture and the approximate cutting force for soft tissue samples. A finite element model was built using the data to model needle puncture of tissue",

A unified sensor model and a unified objective function are proposed to enable search-and-tracking (SAT) within the recursive Bayesian filter framework. The strength of the proposed technique is that a vehicle can switch its task mode between search and tracking while maintaining and using information collected during the operation. Numerical results first show the effectiveness of the proposed technique when a found target becomes lost and must be searched for again. The proposed technique was then applied to a practical marine search-and-rescue (SAR) scenario where heterogeneous vehicles coordinated to search for and track multiple targets. The result demonstrates the applicability of the technique to real search world scenarios",

        "abstract": "A method is proposed to control human grasping force unconsciously by generating small distributed vibration stimuli on a finger based on a human reflex action against detection of partial slippage of contact. Human beings can increase grasping force before the grasped object slips off the fingers based on afferent signals from tactile receptors that detect the expansion of the partial slippage area. We assumed that vibration stimuli that have an appropriate frequency and distribution generate a virtual sensation of partial slippages and induce a reflective grasping force increase. Grasping experiments with minute distributed vibration stimuli using ICPF (ionic conducting polymer gel film) actuators were performed. Experiments results showed that the effective vibratory frequency was 30 Hz, which is the most sensitive range for Meissner's corpuscles that are closely related to detection of partial slippage. We also found that distribution of vibration stimuli were important to produce human grasping force increase",

Based on this observation, we revisit the setpoint control problem from region control point of view, to gain new insights into the robot control problem. We shall show that the approximate Jacobian setpoint controller is a special case of the proposed region reaching controller",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the development of master-slave pneumatic robotic system and its ability to remotely control some functional tasks of backhoe machines during operation on construction sites. The functional tasks include (i) excavating (loading), (ii) lifting, (iii) transporting loads, and (iv) unloading. Pneumatic actuators and grippers, CCD cameras and a control box containing power source, PC and wireless LAN boards are integral part of our pneumatic robot system. During operation, images from the CCD cameras are transported to the master side with a wireless LAN, and then display visually on the laptop PC. Using joysticks, an operator can manipulate the synchronized activities of the system and backhoe machines with or without the CCD cameras. Tests were conducted on some local construction sites to evaluate the effectiveness of the system to control the functional tasks of the backhoe machines. It was found that the use of CCD cameras by the operator to monitor the synchronized activities was more effective than having a direct face to face operator contact with the activities. Disasters caused by environmental changes and man-made actions are increasing worldwide. The safety for rescued workers and investigative officials in disaster areas is a growing concern. Our system provides an opportunity to improve safety",

To enable an on-site worker to share the field of view of a remote support person, we developed a technique for aligning the optical axes of a camera and a projector. We present experimental data that demonstrates the validity of our optomechanical design. Finally, we show that the mobile SCOPE enables workers to continuously share their field of view, no matter where the mobile SCOPE moves",

The intent is to generate a path that enables an unmanned vehicle to surveil with maximum observability by traversing the ridges of a terrain or to operate with maximum covertness by navigating the valleys. The input to the algorithm is a 3D triangle mesh model for the terrain of interest. This mesh may be non-uniform and non-regular. Thus, the algorithm leverages research from computer graphics and computer vision to identify ridge-valley features on the terrain. These features serve as \"obstacles\" for an artificial potential field algorithm. The valleys are obstacles for a surveillance path, or the ridges are obstacles for a covert path. We incorporate geodesic-rather than Euclidean-distances into the potential field formulation to extend path planning to 3D surfaces. We present the theory of our proposed algorithm and provide experimental results",

We represent the environment using a collection of one-dimensional panoramic images formed by averaging the center scanlines of a cylindrical view. Such 1D images can be stored and processed with few resources, allowing a fairly dense sampling of the environment. Image matching proceeds in real time using dynamic programming on scale-invariant features extracted from each circular view. By analyzing the shape of the matching curve, the relative orientation of pairs of views can be recovered and utilized for navigation. When navigating, the robot continually matches its current view against stored reference views taken from known locations, and determines its location and heading from the properties of the matching results. Experiments show that our method is robust to occlusion, repeating patterns, and lighting variations",

We have developed the sensor element that has such characteristics in a very simple structure; two layers of compressible insulators (urethane foam) which are sandwiched between three pieces of stretchable conductive sheets (conductive fabric). The other component is a sensor/communication chip. The chips are arranged at the boundaries of the elements, and the chips measure the capacitances between the conductive layers and send signals through the same conductive layers. The chips enable us to connect the elements to compose a soft robot skin including no long wires",

Two therapeutic seal robots were introduced, and activated for over 9 hours every day to interact with the residents. This paper presents a progress report of this experiment. In order to investigate psychological and social influences of the robots, each subject was interviewed, and their social network was analysed. In addition, their hormones in urine: 17 Ketosteroid sulfate (17-KS-S) and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) were obtained and analysed. The results indicate that the density of the social networks was increased through interaction with the seal robots. Furthermore, urinary tests showed that the reactions of the subjects' vital organs to stress were improved after the introduction of the robots",

        "abstract": "Angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure wherein a catheter (a thermoplastic hollow wire) is inserted into the femoral artery and guided till it reaches a blockage in the blood vessel. There could be some potential complications arising from the conventional way of performing angioplasty, e.g., damage to the blood vessel due to excessive force of insertion and exposure of clinicians to harmful radiations and/or high levels of noise from an MRI machine. In this paper, we investigate the use of a robot manipulator (Mitsubishi PA 10-7C) to aid in the insertion of a catheter into a blood vessel. The robot controls the insertion force while the surgeon can remotely operate the robot from a safe and comfortable environment. The paper describes a hybrid impedance control scheme implemented on the Mitsubishi robot to perform simultaneous force/position control. The robot is used in experiments to insert a catheter into a test-bed by controlling the force of insertion and preventing the catheter from buckling or \"bunching up\". Experimental results for the insertion algorithms are shown",

In this article different alternatives for the implementation of remote actuation would be discussed and a case study would be presented relevant to a robotic arm, which was designed to operate inside a closed cylindrical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner for the performance of image-guided interventions. The transfer of motion to the articulated joints of the arm was implemented using drive shafts and universal joints (u-joints).

In this paper we show that by adaptively reducing the training data, the training process can be performed much more efficiently while still achieving good classification results. The reduction is obtained by utilizing kd-trees and pruning them appropriately. Our algorithm does not require any additional parameters and yields an abstraction of the training data. In experiments with real data collected from a mobile outdoor robot we demonstrate that our approach yields accurate segmentations",

The proposed RNLAR can be used to design primary residual vectors (PRV) for nonlinear systems to detect faults. A nonlinear PRV design method to detect sensor and actuator faults is proposed where the PRVs are made highly sensitive to the faults and less sensitive to the MPM and process disturbance.

However, in case that there are multiple persons in the scene at the same time, it is quite difficult to reconstruct a precise 3D model of each person separately due to the occlusion between them. To deal with this problem, the fast level set method is utilized in the proposed system for integrating stereo range data which is captured by multiple stereo cameras located around the target people. To reconstruct precise 3D models in real-time, the proposed system is implemented on a PC cluster with seven PCs and four stereo cameras. Tracking experiment of multiple persons and real-time reconstruction of 3D human models using the proposed system are successfully carried out",

This is motivated by the search for an effective control strategy to deal with the problem of nonlinear behaviour in the piezoelectric actuation systems. The basic concept associated with this approach lies in the specification of a target performance and the formulation of a robust control scheme for the system to ensure the convergence of the position tracking error to zero in the presence of parametric uncertainties and hysteresis effect inclusive of other un-modelled disturbances. Stability of the control system is proven theoretically and the robust control methodology is demonstrated to possess a promising tracking ability through the control experiments. Implementation of the control law requires only a knowledge of the estimated parameters and their corresponding bounds as well as the bound of the hysteresis effect including disturbances. Being capable of handling uncertainties and disturbances, the robust control methodology is very attractive in the field of micro/nanomanipulation in which high-precision control applications could be realised",

The air velocity observation from an air data system can be used to estimate the error of the on-board Inertial Navigation System (INS). However, due to a priori unknown wind velocity, it cannot directly be used for this purpose. This can be tackled by augmenting the unknown wind velocity into the state vector of SLAM, simultaneously estimating INS, map and wind. This paper proposes a multi-loop SLAM architecture, where the periodic velocity-level SLAM loop limits the INS errors of the velocity effectively, and the aperiodic position-level SLAM loop bounds the overall position error growth. This can significantly increase the consistency of airborne SLAM at the time of loop closure. Simulation results show that the unknown wind vector can be estimated consistently and the robustness of airborne SLAM improves significantly",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose robust sensing method against bubble noises in aquatic environments with a stereo vision system. Usually, three-dimensional (3-D) measurement by robot vision techniques is executed under the assumptions that cameras and objects are in aerial environments. However, an image distortion occurs when vision sensors measure objects in liquid. It is caused by the refraction of the light on the boundary between the air and the liquid, and the distorted image brings errors in a triangulation for the range measurement. Additionally, it is often the case that there exist air bubbles in the field of view when we observe aquatic environments. Therefore, it becomes difficult to acquire clear images because of these view-disturbing noises. As to the former problem, accurate 3-D coordinates of objects' surfaces in liquid are measured by taking for calculating the refraction effect. As to the latter problem, bubble noises are eliminated from a moving image to divide objects in the image into still backgrounds, moving objects, and bubble noise by an image processing technique. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of our proposed method",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) applied to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Conventional Kalman filter methods suffer from the assumption of Gaussian noise statistics, which often lead to failures when these assumptions do not hold. Additionally, the linearization errors associated with the implementation of the standard EKF can also severely degrade the performance of the localization estimate. Currently, stochastic mapping provides a framework for the concurrent mapping of landmarks and localization of the vehicle with respect to the landmarks. However, the stochastic map is essentially an augmented EKF with the limitations thereof. This research addresses the linearization and Guassian assumption errors as they relate to the SLAM problem by proposing a new method, robust stochastic mapping. The robust stochastic map uses a Robust EKF (REKF) in order to address these limitations through the implementation of the bounded Hinfin norm. Experimental data are presented to illustrate the advantage of the localization using the proposed estimation procedure",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the problem of maximizing system performance for future space exploration missions involving both human and robot agents. One of the main challenges in human-robot interaction scenarios is determining which tasks are best done with either human, robotic systems, or in collaboration with each. Such partitioning of the task space must acknowledge the capabilities of both agents, as well as incorporate the effect of repetitive workload, or stress, on the human operator. Our methodology for role allocation, which typically consists of either the human or the machine executing a single task, is based on predicting system performance of a given scenario by incorporating the concept of task switching. Task switching is defined as the process of alternating or switching attention between tasks when responding to a sequence of stimulus presentations. Using this concept, system performance can be predicted and used to determine an optimal allocation of tasks to be divided between human controlled and autonomous robotic systems to minimize mental workload while maximizing task performance. We provide details of the approach in this paper and present our results as applied to a simulated rendezvous/docking mission scenario",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new mechanism and control method of 4-leg-wheel hybrid locomotion. Many previous hybrid vehicles execute wheel-mode and leg-mode alternatively. However, to overcome higher obstacle with sufficient velocity, a wheel locomotion should continuously be executed. In this paper, suitable load distribution control is proposed considering a contact force to the ground and step edge, a wheel driving torque, and a friction coefficient of the wheel and terrain. In a proposed new leg-wheel hybrid mechanism, load distribution control is realized by a torque of twisting joint at the center of the body, and a forward/backward shift of the body. The validity of this control and mechanism is confirmed by some experiments, where vehicle can run over a 105 mm step by 90 mm radius wheels with a good continuous movement. With an adjustment control of the approach angle, a robot can also ride over a 230 mm step",

However, for implementing SLAM in consumer-oriented products such as toys or cleaning robots, it is infeasible to use expensive sensing. In this work we examine the SLAM problem for robots with very sparse sensing that provides too little data to extract features of the environment from a single scan. We modify SLAM to group several scans taken as the robot moves into multiscans, achieving higher data density in exchange for greater measurement uncertainty due to odometry error. We formulate a full system model for this approach, and then introduce simplifications that enable efficient implementation using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Finally, we describe simple algorithms for feature extraction and data association of line and line segment features from multiscans, and then present experimental results using real data from several environments",

The system is comprised of a manipulator whose end-effector rigidly grasps a functional spacecraft, a six-axis force/moment (F/M) sensor placed at the interface of the spacecraft and the manipulator, and a control system. The controller takes the values of the force/moment as well as the manipulator's joint angles and velocities and issues torque command to drive the manipulator so that the motion of the spacecraft model in the presence of external forces replicates 0-g motion dynamics of a flight spacecraft. The control system can also modify the inertia! properties of the spacecraft so as to match those of an actual spacecraft, even if the latter is flexible and the former is rigid. The stability of the overall system is analytically investigated, and the results show that the system remains stable provided that the inertia! properties of two spacecraft are different. Important practical issues such as calibration and analysis of the sensitivity to noise and disturbance are also presented. Finally, the concept of the 0-g emulation of spacecraft is demonstrated by conducting an experiment using a robotic testbed at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA)",

A simulation-based scheduling procedure is proposed to solve the problem. The aim is to reduce potential delays induced by agent queues.

        "abstract": "The ATRON self-reconfigurable robot consists of simple one degree of freedom ATRON modules. The motion capabilities of an individual module are therefore quite limited. To compensate for this, meta-modules composed of more than one module are used to shape-change the system. Meta-modules emerge from the environment created by other modules, move on the surface of other modules and stop at a new position. The flow of meta-modules, from one place to another on the structure of modules, realizes the desired self-reconfiguration. In this paper we compare six different meta-module types composed of ATRON modules. Variations of meta-module morphology and meta-actions are investigated for its ability to shape-change the robot. We conclude that two of the investigated meta-module types are able to shape-change the robot to an acceptable extent",

A probabilistic method has been proposed for the problem, which does not allow self-motions of the robot as it moves along the end-effector path. In this paper, we propose an enhancement, which allows such self-motions. This is primarily accomplished by explicitly representing self-motions for a certain pose as a self-motion graph, which is explored with probabilistic techniques for closed-chain robots. Computer simulations show that this enhancement improves performance in most cases. Depending on the limits set on the run-time (always needed in practice for probabilistic sampling methods), the planner with self-motion enhancement will find a path where the original algorithm without self-motion may not",

From several demonstrations of task operation, a vision system captures movement of the demonstrator mobile robot and associated objects in an operation field. Then, the movement features are extracted to present to an imitation engine. Finally, skill or decision policy from teacher's demonstration is extracted and embedded into a self organizing neural network without explicit external supervisory signals. A simple action selection algorithm for choosing action from learned network is proposed. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a simulated robot and a real mobile robot to imitate two simple robot soccer behaviors: approaching the target and obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, the concept of similarity measure is introduced to evaluate imitation performance from the demonstrator",

For this system to be developed further, to achieve full automation, this first phase had to succeed. The interactive GUI records and displays: real-time video images of the cells; processed images of cells; and the microinjection strategies adopted by operators during cell manipulation through a real-time video processing algorithm. Experiments showed that this first phase of the research was successful. Future research develop knowledge-based controllers using machine-learning techniques as the research drives towards its goal of fully automated cell microinjection",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The biomedical application this paper refers to is the neuroendoscopy of the sub-arachnoid spinal space. Such a kind of endoscopy is strongly challenging due to the tiny space to be explored and to the delicate anatomical structures which lie into it. In order to enhance the degree of safety of the endoscopic intervention, a robotic system for neuroendoscopy has been developed, so as to obtain a robot-assisted exploration which aims to lower the risks for the patient and to ease the catheter maneuvering task. This paper explains how robot sensory feedbacks can be exploited to provide the surgeon with useful information for the navigation and to implement automatic control strategies. It is described how sensory feedbacks processing can improve the safety of the operation by implementing a human-robot cooperation for the understanding of the anatomical environment and the monitoring of physiological parameters. The focus of the paper is on vision and pressure sensory feedbacks. Experimental results prove the reliability and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and their suitability to be employed in real time operation",

Using a linear bandwidth limited force source, we show how series spring stiffness and source stroke length effect power output to an inertial load. We show that an appropriate spring constant increases the peak power delivered to the inertial load over a limited stroke. The series elasticity changes the actuator operating point along its force-velocity curve and therefore effects the actuator work output over a fixed stroke length. For single shot motions, the peak power can increase by a factor of radic2 for appropriate series spring stiffness. We also present an example of how this work relates to human ankle function and it implies for the design of robotic or prosthetic ankles",

Control laws taking explicitly into account such a phenomenon have already been designed in previous work. They can actually improve the guidance accuracy. However their efficiency is highly dependent on the sliding parameters estimation (since these parameters cannot be provided by a direct measurement). In this paper, an observer-like estimator is designed, providing sideslip angles from a single exteroceptive sensor, namely a real time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS). Improvements in guidance accuracy, with respect to previous estimation approaches, is demonstrated through full scale experiments, addressing agricultural applications",

To understand the problem we resort to a simplified quasi-static model in which the locomotion object is represented by a mass point. In this formulation, the driving principle is based on controlling the position of the center of mass of the object, exploiting nonholonomic rolling constraint to propel the hemisphere. Two motion planning algorithms are proposed. The algorithms are tested under simulation. The simulation results show the possibility of steering the locomotion system to the desired configurations by moving the center of mass through multiple generalized figure eights on the main hemisphere plane",

A male moth counter-turns horizontally and vertically across the wind while tracking a pheromone plume. The inter-turn duration, or the amount of time between turns, is about 500 milliseconds on average in both directions. This observation has lead to the development of odor tracking algorithms that use inter-turn timers to control when to turn in both directions. The algorithm presented in this work takes a different approach. The new algorithm controls the rate of turning of the tracking vehicle in a plane normal to the wind direction. Simulation results demonstrate that counter-turning can be achieved in both directions without the use of inter-turn timers. Also, the estimated odor source location approaches the true source location as time progresses",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, the SLAM problem solves the localization and mapping problem in explored and sensed regions. This paper presents a prediction-based SLAM algorithm (called P-SLAM), which has an environmental structure predictor to predict the structure inside an unexplored region (i.e., look-ahead mapping). The prediction process is based on the observation of the surroundings of an unexplored region and comparing it with the built map of explored regions. If a similar structure is matched in the map of explored regions, a hypothesis is generated to indicate that a similar structure has been explored before. If the environment has repeated structures, the mobile robot can utilize the predicted structure as a virtual mapping, and decide whether or not to explore the unexplored region to save exploration time. If the mobile robot decides to explore the unexplored region, a correct prediction can be utilized to localize the robot and speed up the SLAM process. We also derive the Bayesian formulation of P-SLAM to show its compact recursive form for real-time operation. We have experimentally implemented the proposed P-SLAM in a Pioneer 3-DX mobile robot using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter in real-time. Computer simulations and experimental results validated the performance of the proposed P-SLAM and its effectiveness in an indoor environment",

Indeed, it is shown that in the latter problem one requires to estimate (to the least) or measure (to the best) the end-effector pose and its time derivatives. The sensor we propose, based on a clever modelling of CMOS rolling shutter camera, measures simultaneously the end-effector pose of a calibrated visual pattern and its Cartesian velocity using a single view. Although motivated by parallel robot identification, this low cost sensor does not make any assumption on the kinematics of the robot and can thus be used for other applications. Experimental results with real data confirm the relevance of the approach and show the sensor good practical measurement accuracy",

First, it reviews an important previous work, which, to the authors' knowledge, has never been exploited yet. Second, it determines the cusp points in any two-dimensional slice of the joint space. First results show that the number of cusp points may vary from zero to eight. This work finds applications in both design and trajectory planning",

The algorithm is a combination of rolling and wrapping with the pull back/push forward technique. One remarkable advantage of this approach is that interpolation curves are given in closed form, which brings convenience for implementations on real-time control systems. A numerical example along with some visualization results is presented as well",

We analyze the stability of soft object manipulation by simultaneous control of motion and deformation. We model and formulate manipulation by simultaneous control of the motion and deformation of soft object. We then use the symmetric linear mass-damper-spring model for a simple analysis of its dynamical behavior. Second, we analyze the stability of the system. Thus, we show that an adequate feedback gain stabilized the system in PID control. This adequate feedback gain ranges between two positive values. The object cannot be stably controlled at too high a gain; neither can, it be regulated at too low a gain since the object is movable. Furthermore, we unravel the features of soft object manipulation by simultaneous control of motion and deformation",

The spatial memory regards three-dimensional space as mass storage of computers, i.e. three-dimensional point is treated as an address of stored digital data such as various documents, images and commands for machines. Consequently, we can access stored digital data by indicating a point using our own arms, which we named \"human indicator\". In this paper, we implement a prototype of the spatial memory system which is supposed to utilize digital data regarded as externalized knowledge. The implemented system is evaluated through two types of experiments. The tendency to forget and the efficiency of task performance are investigated. By applying the t-test under the level of significance 5%, experimental results of the performance efficiency show significant statistical difference between the results with the spatial memory and without it.",

The HRIS contains a real-time speech attention system and a real-time face tracking system. In the speech attention system, a microphone-array voice acquisition system has been developed to estimate the direction of speaker and purify the speaker's speech signal in a noisy environment. The developed face tracking system aims to track the speaker's face under illumination variation and react to the face motion. The proposed HRIS can provide a robot with the abilities of finding a speaker's direction, tracking the speaker's face, moving its body to the speaker, focusing its attention to the speaker who is talking to it, and purifying the speaker's speech. The experimental results show that the HRIS not only purifies speech signal with a significant performance, but also tracks a face under illumination variation in real-time",

One of the key issues in multi-robot exploration is how to assign target locations to the individual robots. To better distribute the robots over the environment and to avoid redundant work, we take into account the type of place a potential target is located in (e.g., a corridor or a room). To determine the type of a place, we apply a classifier learned with AdaBoost which additionally considers spatial dependencies between nearby locations. Our approach to incorporate the type of places in the coordination of the robots has been implemented and tested in different environments. The experiments demonstrate that our system effectively distributes the robots over the environment and allows them to accomplish their mission faster compared to approaches that ignore the semantic place labels",

This technique applies a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key issue is to reduce the number of particles and/or to make use of compact map representations. This paper presents an approximative but highly efficient approach to mapping with Rao-Blackwellized particle filters. Moreover, it provides a compact map model. A key advantage is that the individual particles can share large parts of the model of the environment. Furthermore, they are able to re-use an already computed proposal distribution. Both techniques substantially speed up the overall process and reduce the memory requirements. Experimental results obtained with mobile robots in large-scale indoor environments and based on published, standard datasets illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous Rao-Blackwellized mapping approaches",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel control strategy based on a non-smooth Lyapunov function to guarantee the stability of the system in the whole motion space. Three control laws that are derived based on three Lyapunov functions are applied successively in three stages of motion control to achieve a suitable posture and increase the energy so as to make the acrobot move into the area around the unstable inverted equilibrium position, and to stabilize it at that position. These three Lyapunov functions are combined into one non-smooth function, which theoretically guarantees the stability of the acrobot in the whole motion space. Simulation results have demonstrated the validity of this strategy",

By referring to the fact that human grasp an object in the form of precision prehension dynamically and stably by opposable forces between the thumb and another finger (index or middle finger), a simple control signal constructed from finger-thumb opposition is proposed and shown to realize stable grasping in a dynamic sense without using object information or external sensing (this is called \"blind grasp\" in this paper). Stability of grasping with force/torque balance under non-holonomic constraints is analyzed on the basis of the concept called \"stability on a manifold\". A few of preliminary simulation results is shown to verify the validity of theoretical results",

We demonstrate the validity and usability of the model by comparing the simulation results with closed-form solutions of Coulomb's friction model and conventional friction model, as well as performing dynamics simulation of highly complex scenes with tens of objects composed of thousands of polygons",

To enable manipulation, actuated arms and effectors are attached to the base providing limited postural control. On the other hand, some of the latest developments in humanoid robotics have succeeded in reducing the footprint and raising the center of mass of a robot using whole body postural control and balancing. By comparing the magnitude of various forces that can be applied to the environment, we demonstrate the advantages of whole body postural control. The results presented suggest that for pushing, pulling, or carrying types of tasks, using whole body postural control can lead to higher performance by allowing a platform to apply more force to the environment",

The method enables a human-like model to maintain its balance with active whole-body motion, such as rotating its arms, bending down, and taking a step, if necessary. First, we capture the human motions of maintaining balance and abstract essential mechanisms from these motions. Next, we construct a model of maintaining balance that has a simple structure, such as an inverted pendulum. This model has two modes of maintaining balance: keeping the feet on the ground, and stepping. In this paper, the stepping mode is mainly described. Finally, we generate whole-body motion based on the model against several perturbations, and we discuss the validity of our method",

Computational stereo performance has progressed such that several commercial or open source implementations are available which operate at frame rate, but suffer from well known correspondence errors. We show that introducing a global segmentation step after commodity stereo can increase robustness and leverage existing stereo software. The global segmentation step is based on a graph structure appropriate for collision detection, human vision inspired foveation, perceptual organization and graph partitioning using the minimum s-t graph cut. This system has been prototyped using the Sarnoff Acadia I vision processor to enable processing of 640 times 480 resolution imagery at 5-10 Hz operation on embedded avionics. We describe system theory, demonstrate segmentation results on scenes of increasing complexity, and show flight experiment results on Georgia Tech's GT-Max autonomous helicopter against real collision obstacles",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In micro- and nanotechnology, handling and manipulation processes are important. Because of the size of the structures, scanning electron microscopes (SEM) are employed. For precise handling, there is a need to know the position of the objects and the tools in all three dimensions of space. For solving this problem, the 2D information of SEM images is not sufficient. There is a need for 3D information. By generating a pair of stereoscopic images, the third dimension (relative depth) can be determined. In this work, a stereo algorithm based on a biologically motivated energy model utilizing a new coherence detection analysis algorithm is proposed. This stereo approach provides a high density and sharp disparity map in sub-pixel accuracy and is invariant to different contrasts in the input images. In addition, a new filter is presented which detects low-texture regions and removes the noise in the disparity map on these positions. In the application section of this work the properties of the stereo algorithm are verified",

This preload is controlled in order to achieve a desired end-effector stiffness, i.e. a desired relationship of applied forces and resulting displacements. This active stiffness yields immediate counteractions to load variations and thus strengthens the integrity of the manipulators. Differential EE-stiffness is defined and a stiffness control scheme is proposed. Results are shown for a planar manipulator",

SDC directly defines the reference stiffness coefficient at each hinge by SDC string which represents the distribution of the stiffness. This simple method does not need costly calculation at all and thus is suitable for controlling closed link robots. We build \"BIYOn\" as the prototype of closed link robots, the variable stiffness hinge (VSH) of which is newly designed. SDC is experimented on BIYOn and then it's found that SDC is effective in a controlling locomotion in practice. We also develop a systematic optimization method of stiffness distribution composed of two-stage approach and succeed in optimization to obtain a fast and smooth rolling motion and a sudden stopping motion",

        "abstract": "This paper provides that an elastic force and an elastic potential energy due to the deformation of soft fingers, which are previously derived, can be calculated into straightforward equations in an analytical way. These formulae lead to the fact that the potential energy of a soft fingertip is a function of two variables, and has a local minimum through the elastic rolling of a contacting object. We formulate four geometric constraints in grasping motions of a rigid object by means of two degrees of freedom robotic hand that has two rotational joints. We define a basic motion including translational and rolling motions when two fingers rotate by infinitesimal angle, and propose a quasi-static manipulation and its algorithm by using the local minimum of elastic potential energy (LMEE) of soft fingers with geometric constraints. In this theory, we define an energy function included in the LMEE algorithm. By solving that function we simulate the path of the center of gravity and the change of orientation of the grasped object, and compare those values with measurements experimentally obtained from a CCD camera equipped above the manipulated object. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the quasi-static manipulation theory based on the LMEE algorithm from experiments",

These data curves, each lying in a different plane, form a \"skeleton\" from which the patch is built in two phases. First, the Darboux frame at the curve intersection is estimated to reflect the local geometry. Second, polynomial fitting is carried out in the Darboux frame. The use of total (absolute) Gaussian curvature effectively prevents unnecessary folding of the surface normally expected to result from fitting over one-dimensional data. The reconstructed patch attains remarkable accuracy as demonstrated through experiments. This work carries a promise for in-hand manipulation. It also has potential application in building accurate models for complex curved objects which can cause occlusion to a camera or a range sensor",

This paper will outline the development of the DP algorithm for discrete time systems. It also describe the application of the algorithm to a rapid maneuver of a long slender payload suspended by a cable at each end. The cables are each held by one of two independent robot manipulators. The DP algorithm will be used to generate optimal swing-free motion trajectories for the robots.

We show that, by suitable choice of the control encoding, finite plans can be efficiently built for a wide class of dynamical systems, computing arbitrarily close approximations of a desired equilibrium in polynomial time. Moreover, we illustrate by simulations the power of the proposed method, solving the steering problem for an example in the class of underactuated systems, which have attracted wide attention in the recent literature",

Our method consists of a motion analysis, a music analysis, and a motion synthesis based on results of the analyses. In these analysis steps, motion and music features are acquired. These features are derived from motion keyframes, motion intensity, music intensity, musical beats, and chord changes. Our system also constructs a motion graph to search similar poses from given dance sequences and to connect them as possible transitions. In the synthesis step, the trajectory that provides the best correlation between music and motion features is selected from the motion graph, and the resulting motion is generated.

In order to achieve an exoskeleton controller which reacts compliantly to external forces, an accurate model of the dynamics of the system is required. In this report, a series of system identification experiments are designed and carried out for the Berkeley lower extremity exoskeleton. As well as determining the mass and inertia properties of the segments of the legs, various non-ideal elements such as friction, stiffness and damping forces are identified. The resulting dynamic model is found to be significantly more accurate than the original model predicted from the designs of the robot",

A dandelion graph structure is used for defining agent neighborhood relations and for representing schedules, so as to support the agent flocking framework. The inter- and intra-roam-space movement algorithms govern the movement of individual agents. Although task information such as due dates and durations can be available for scheduling, in a dynamically changing environment, these values can only be estimated and are often subjected to changes. Therefore, the proposed scheme aims at allowing robot teams to adapt to unforseen circumstances, while at the same time, still making use of available time information for preliminary scheduling and planning. Realistic simulations are performed and verifies the effectiveness of the approach",

We assume that a task skill for a complicated motion is described by the suitable trajectory of the impedance center. Thus, a important point is how to get the suitable trajectory of the impedance center. In our method, the suitable trajectory is got from results of bilateral teleoperation. In the bilateral teleoperation, an operator constructs a motion procedure able to execute the task. The suitable trajectory of the impedance center is calculated from the position and the force data in the teleoperation experiment. A basic element of the task skill is composed of an initial condition, a task skill motion and a final condition. The initial and final conditions are described by values of both sensor and tip position. The task skill motion is described by a hybrid impedance/force control. To demonstrate how to use of our method, we choose the nut attachment task as an example",

In this teaching system, the numerical teaching method has been employed to give detailed descriptions of the motion parameters, but it brings out a trade-off between fine-tuning and complication. Therefore, new devices and functions are added to the teaching system and multiple teaching modes are implemented for solving this problem. The main feature is the use of task teaching with human demonstration data which are obtained in real and virtual human motion measurement systems. The initial teaching data are generated by the demonstration data and the robot commands are converted into them with the control parameters. Typical task is demonstrated and we verify the effectiveness of the teaching modes experimentally",

To achieve this, the problem is formulated in the CX-space which is denoted as the Cartesian product of the hand's configuration space (Cspace), and a space of relative poses between the hand and the payload (X-space). This approach alleviates some difficulties which are unresolved when a search is performed in the hand's C-space alone. A number of kinematic aspects of grasping are addressed by associating them with sets in the CX-space. Solving for a desired grasp then requires identifying a CX-space configuration which lies in the intersection of these sets. Rather than recommending a search technique, this paper presents the framework for this novel formulation. As a demonstration, portions of the CX-space associated with a simulated Utah-MIT hand and a spherical payload are examined",

These roles are inspired by their biological counterparts. This combination of roles gives us a modular robot which potentially may have enough structural strength and actuation power to manipulate its environment and work in three dimension even in the presence of gravity. In this paper we present our preliminary LEGO-based prototype of the Deformatron robot. We measure and analyse the properties of the system in terms of structural strength and actuation power. Finally, we conclude that the Deformatron concept may provide an avenue of research which may make modular robots stronger and better suited for real world task environments",

        "abstract": "Exploration of virtual worlds with unconstrained locomotion possibilities for the user is the main objective of the European research project CyberWalk. This should be achieved through the use of an actuated platform (the CyberCarpet) that compensates for the walker's locomotion in such a way to keep her/him close to the platform center. This paper presents the control problem for the platform motion, including objectives and constraints, overall control architecture, and kinematic modeling. Since the platform has only two actuating devices (linear and angular), the control problem is similar to that of output regulation for nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots in the presence of an unpredictable disturbance due to walker's locomotion. Based on the kinematic model, a velocity control design achieving input-output decoupling and linearization is proposed and its performance is verified by simulations",

Tasks in the matrix can utilize particular preconditions and in conditions to enable execution, motion trajectories to specify desired movement, and references to other tasks to perform subtasks. Interaction between the matrix and external modules such as goal planners is achieved via a high-level interface that categorizes a task using its semantics and execution parameters, allowing queries on the matrix to be performed using different selection criteria. Performable tasks are stored in an XML-based file format that can be readily edited and processed by other applications. In its current implementation, the matrix is populated with sets of primitive tasks (e.g. reaching, grasping, arm-waving) and macro tasks that reference multiple primitive tasks (pick-and-place and facing-and-waving)",

Even a small time delay in a bilateral teleoperation system would generally degrade the system's performance and cause instability. An important approach that guarantees stability for any fixed time delay is the wave variable method. In this paper we present some recent material dealing with teleoperation systems using wave variables. In particular, we describe a wave variable scheme based on a family of scaling matrices for multiple degree-of-freedom bilateral teleoperation system. We include a derivation of a larger family of scaling matrices that guaranteed the system remains stable for a fixed time delay. A multiple degree-of-freedom bilateral teleoperation system using the new wave variable method is simulated using a SIMULINK model. In addition, the new derivation was implemented in hardware using an Immersion joystick and a C++ program",

        "abstract": "Exploration is the fundamental task of guiding a robot autonomously during mapping so that it covers the entire environment with its sensors. In the frontier-based exploration, a robot visits the unknown regions, but the sufficient information on the obstacles was not exploited. In the topological exploration, the robot was forced to visit all the topological nodes, but it was inefficient and time-consuming. In this paper, an efficient exploration called a thinning-based topological exploration (TTE) is proposed. This scheme is based on the position probability of the end nodes of a topological map built in real time. The robot then updates the position probability of each end node sustaining its position at the current location using the range data. By analyzing this position probability, the robot can determine whether or not it needs to visit the specific end node to examine the environment around this node. Various experiments show that the proposed TTE algorithm can perform exploration more accurately than the frontier-based exploration approach and more efficiently than the other topological exploration schemes, because in most cases, exploration for the entire environment can be completed without directly visiting everywhere",

However, in legged robot systems, each leg supports their body weight, and the reaction forces from its ground must be inside of their friction corn. Moreover, the ZMP (zero moment point) of the robot is constrained for stable walk. Therefore, time optimal control inputs must be designed considering these constraints. SONY ERS-7 is used as a quadruped walking robot and a fundamental experiment is done. From the experimental results, the effectiveness of the developed control algorithm is verified",

We approximate the free space using an adaptive volumetric grid that is computed by performing simple geometric tests on the contact surfaces. We use an isosurface extraction algorithm to compute a piecewise-linear approximation to the boundary of the free space. We prove that our approximation is topologically equivalent to the exact free space boundary. We also ensure that our approximation is geometrically close to the exact free space boundary by bounding its two-sided Hausdorff error. We have applied our algorithm to compute the free configuration space for the following instances: (1) a 2D polygonal robot with translational and rotational DOFs navigating among polygonal obstacles, and (2) a 3D polyhedral robot translating among polyhedral obstacles. In practice, our algorithm works well on robots with three DOFs",

        "abstract": "In the biped Lucy pleated pneumatic artificial muscles are used instead of electrical motors to power the joints, because in an antagonistic set-up both the torque and the compliance are controllable. The muscles have also a high power to weight ratio and they can reduce impact effects. Interesting characteristics that can be exploited for legged robots. In this paper a control strategy is discussed where a torque control unit tracks a predefined trajectory and a compliance controller is used to reduce control efforts and energy consumption by fitting the compliance of the actuator to the natural compliance of the desired trajectory. The first part of this paper focusses on the torque control unit for the biped. The proposed control architecture consists of the joint trajectory generator and the joint trajectory tracking controller. The trajectory generator calculates trajectories represented by polynomials based on objective locomotion parameters, which are average forward speed, step length, step height and intermediate foot lift. The joint trajectory tracking controller is divided in three parts: a computed torque module, a delta-p unit and a bang-bang pressure controller. Results of the incorporation of this control architecture in the real biped Lucy are given. Several essential graphs showing tracking performance and pressure regulation are given and the effectiveness of the control algorithm is discussed. A second part of the paper focusses on the compliance controller which is experimentally tested on a one DOF pendulum. A mathematical formulation to exploit the natural dynamics with respect to different walking patterns for this purpose is explained. The experimental results show the effectiveness and importance of the adaptation strategy",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses jumping pattern generation for a serial link robot in order to maximize its jump height under torque limitation. By applying a genetic algorithm (GA) for determining torque assignment, we obtain various jumping patterns with respect to the torque limitation for a fixed mass of the robot. With the increase of the torque limitation, double-leg based jump, single-leg based jump, and spring-type jump are generated for achieving the largest jump height. Under an additional joint angle limitation, we also obtain an interesting solution where one end of the link is first lifted up and the other end finally kicks the ground strongly",

The well established tool of decentralized navigation functions is redefined to cope with the communication restrictions of the system. Each agent plans its actions without knowing the destinations of the others and the positions of those agents lying outside its sensing neighborhood. The stability properties of the closed loop system are checked via Lyapunov stability techniques for hybrid systems. The collision avoidance and goal convergence properties are verified through simulations. The key advantage of the proposed algorithm with respect to the previous ones is the significant decrease of computational load and its applicability to large scale groups",

        "abstract": "Today's laparoscopic surgeon performs laparoscopic surgery by inserting two or three long tools into the patient's abdominal. Surgeon relies on the image captured by a laparoscope that is also inserted into the patient's abdominal. It is common to have a surgical assistant holding the laparoscope and taking directions from the main surgeon on how to move it to keep the surgical tools within the view. However, timely, accurate, and stable adjustments of the laparoscope cannot be guaranteed in lengthy operations due to fatigue of human assistant. We proposed a novel new design by replacing the human assistant with a spherical wrist mechanism robot. In addition, for developing a fully surgeon-based automatic integrated system, an automatic tracking and gesture recognizing sub-system is developed. The automatic tracking sub-system tracks the tip of a surgical tool and moves the laparoscope holding robot to keep the tool within the camera view. This paper focuses on the gesture recognizing sub-system that helps surgeon retrieve critical medical records of the patient instantly by recognizing surgical tool gestures. A modified background reduction method and neural network are applied in the tool gesture recognition process",

In contrast, we tackle the case of a non-rigid environment observed by a 3D sensor, which has been neglected in the literature. We represent the environment as sets of time-varying 3D points explained by a low-rank shape model, that we derive in its implicit and explicit forms. The parameters of this model are learnt from data gathered by the 3D sensor. We propose a learning algorithm based on minimal 3D non-rigid tensors that we introduce. This is followed by a maximum likelihood nonlinear refinement performed in a bundle adjustment manner. Given the learnt environment model, we compute the pose of the 3D sensor, as well as the deformations of the environment, that is, the non-rigid counterpart of pose, from new sets of 3D points. We validate our environment learning and pose estimation modules on simulated and real data",

The hexapod structure is designed to move in an alternating tripod gait driven by two piezoelectric actuators connected by sliding plates to two sets of three legs. We present results of both the kinematic and static analyses of the driving mechanism that essentially consists of three slider cranks in series. This analysis confirmed the force differential needed to propel the device. We then review various other microrobot technologies that have been developed including actuator design and fabrication, power and control electronics design, programming via a finite state machine, and the development of bioinspired fiber arrays. These technologies were then successfully integrated into the device. The robot is now functioning and we have already fabricated three iterations of the proposed device. We hope with further design iterations to produce a fully operational model in the near future",

The motion of such systems is governed by both the non-holonomic constraints acting on the system and a system of differential equations constraining the evolution of generalized momentum. We propose a method that utilizes both governing motions, that is, satisfying all the constraints and instantaneously conserving momentum along un-restricted directions, to generate gaits for systems like the snakeboard, which belongs to the family of mixed non-holonomic systems. We accomplish this by defining a new scaled momentum variable. This scaled momentum allows us to easily explore the design of gaits that causes momentum to evolve such that a desired non-trivial motion results",

Segmenting landmarks from background clutter in such environments is difficult and vision, rather than laser, has a higher potential to perform such tasks due to the higher bandwidth of information it carries. There is a need to establish a benchmark upon which emerging vision SLAM algorithms can be assessed and compared. Towards this objective, this paper proposes the infrastructure for such a benchmark and discusses the issues involved in compiling it. Ego-motion information is extracted via a strap-down inertial measurement unit (IMU). Synchronized Global Positioning System (GPS), IMU, and surrounding images of an outdoor park environment are compiled into a database. IMU data in tested on an inertial navigation system (INS) dead-reckoning algorithm. The adequacy of the stereo image database is validated by extracting disparity maps of each stereo image in the database. IMU simulations show the necessity for visual SLAM to improve pose estimation. The complete data set, including GPS, IMU, and stereo images is available for downloading purposes",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Rapid programming of applications with down-times near zero is a key to automation of small lotsize production. This paper proposes an approach to program by gestures. It combines the visual observation and interpretation of human activities and gestures, mapping to technical tasks and autonomous execution. Automated planning/generation of the robot motion combined with automated correction of pose deviations (induced from the visual observation) allows an execution which is independent of the observation accuracy. The industrial application: bores and internal threads play a critical role as integral parts of connections, bearings, engines, hydraulic and pneumatic systems. The increased industrial requirement for high quality components demands 100% surface inspection of bores (here with diameters from 4 to 50 mm) at small lotsizes. Since state-of-the-art automation is limited to high volumes, the main target is to develop a semi-autonomous system for rapid and flexible inspection featuring new programming. The main focus is on rapid and intuitive programming of robotic systems. The paper describes the implementation and techniques in case of a bore inspection system",

        "abstract": "Robots in formations move while maintaining a predefined geometric shape. Previous work has examined formation-maintenance algorithms that would ensure the stability of the formation. However, for each geometric formation, an exponential number of stable controllers exists. Thus a key question is how to select (construct) a formation controller that optimizes desired properties, such as sensor usage for robustness. This paper presents a monitoring multi-graph framework for formation controller selection, based on sensor-morphology considerations. We instantiate the framework, and present two contributions. First, we show that graph-theoretic techniques can then be used to compute sensing policies that maintain a given formation. In particular, sensor-based control laws for separation-bearing (distance-angle) formation control can be automatically constructed. Second, we present a protocol allowing controllers to be switched on-line, to allow robots to adjust to sensory failures. We report on results from comprehensive experiments with physical robots. The results show that the use of the dynamic protocol allows formations of physical robots to move significantly faster and with greater precision, while reducing the number of formation failures",

In many cases, the coverage has to be completed without the use of a map or any a priori knowledge about the area, a process referred-to as on-line coverage. Previous investigations of multi-robot on-line coverage focused on the improved efficiency gained from the use of multiple robots, but did not formally addressed the potential for greater robustness. We present a novel multi-robot on-line coverage algorithm, based on approximate cell decomposition. We analytically show that the algorithm is complete and robust, in that as long as a single robot is able to move, the coverage would be completed. We analyze the assumptions underlying the algorithm requirements and present a number of techniques for executing it in real robots. We show empirical coverage-time results of running the algorithm in two different environments and several group sizes",

This technique is based on the modeling of the coupling between the ultrasound probe and egg shaped objects. The robotic task consists in reaching a desired image from an arbitrary initial position. The aim of this task is to assist the radiologist diagnostic by automatically moving the ultrasound probe in order to find the ultrasound image view of a tumour cross-section registered in a previous date.

        "abstract": "Model based object tracking has earned significant importance in areas such as augmented reality, surveillance, visual servoing, robotic object manipulation and grasping. Although an active research area, there are still few systems that perform robustly in realistic settings. The key problems to robust and precise object tracking are outliers caused by occlusion, self-occlusion, cluttered background, and reflections. Two most common solutions to the above problems have been the use of robust estimators and the integration of visual cues. The tracking system considered in this paper achieves robustness by integrating model-based and model-free cues. As model-based cues, we consider a CAD model of the object known a priori and as model-free cues, automatically generated corner features are used. The main idea is to account for relative object motion between consecutive frames using integration of the two cues. The particular contribution of this work is the integration framework where not only polyhedral objects are considered. In particular, we deal with spherical, cylindrical and conical objects for which the complete pose cannot be estimate using only CAD like models. Using the integration with the model-free features, we show how a full pose estimate can be obtained. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust system performance in realistic settings with highly textured objects",

To measure this ability, the standard ISO double lane change test was a designed by consumer unions. The detailed simulation of such an active safety issue would contribute to shorten the design cycle time of a vehicle by reducing the number of real world tests. In this paper we discuss the use of a trajectory deformation algorithm to determine a possible motion for a realistic dynamic car model going through such a test, and the way to determine the maximum passage speed. The main idea of this method is to iteratively deform the inputs of the system to progressively reduce the number of collisions while respecting the dynamic constraints. This deformation is calculated for each iteration by taking into account a locally linearized dynamic model of the system. Consequently, this algorithm can anticipate correctly the inputs needed to solve the future collisions",

We present a system in which group members lacking knowledge about the position of the transport target exploit physical interactions with other members of the group that have such knowledge. This is the first such system to achieve a performance superior to that of a passive caster. The system is fully decentralized and the information flow between the robots is limited to physical interactions. The robots have no knowledge about their relative positions. A comprehensive experimental study with up to six physical robots confirms the effectiveness, reliability, and robustness of the system. Finally, the system is examined in rough terrain conditions",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Estimating the traversability of terrain in an unstructured outdoor environment is a core functionality for autonomous robot navigation. While general-purpose sensing can be used to identify the existence of terrain features such as vegetation and sloping ground, the traversability of these regions is a complex function of the terrain characteristics and vehicle capabilities, which makes it extremely difficult to characterize a priori. Moreover, it is difficult to find general rules which work for a wide variety of terrain types such as trees, rocks, tall grass, logs, and bushes. As a result, methods which provide traversability estimates based on predefined terrain properties such as height or shape will be unlikely to work reliably in unknown outdoor environments. Our approach is based on the observation that traversability in the most general sense is an affordance which is jointly determined by the vehicle and its environment. We describe a novel on-line learning method which can make accurate predictions of the traversability properties of complex terrain. Our method is based on autonomous training data collection which exploits the robot's experience in navigating its environment to train classifiers without human intervention. This is in contrast to other learning methods in which training data is collected manually. We have implemented and tested our traversability learning method on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and evaluated its performance in several realistic outdoor environments. The experiments quantify the benefit of our on-line traversability learning approach",

Object concavity is a special geometric property that allows objects to be captured with only few fingers. In particular, certain concave objects may be captured by appropriately placing two fingers close to some pair of opposite concave sections. This paper addresses the problem of computing all configurations of the fingers that are farthest away from each other while still capable of capturing the object. We propose an O(n2lg n) algorithm for this task and present preliminary results showing efficiency of the algorithm",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new adaptive controller for dynamic tracking of a robot manipulator without visual velocity when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. Most controllers in the past require the measurement of the visual velocity or differentiation of the visual position. The measurement of the visual velocity is subject to big noises in general due to low sampling rates of the vision loop. To avoid performance decaying caused by measurement errors of the visual velocity, the controller we developed requires estimated visual velocity only. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot manipulator, we employed the Lyapunov method to prove the convergence of the image errors of the trajectory to zero and the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate good convergence of the trajectory errors of the robot under the control of the proposed method",

On the other hand, existing methods provide some measure of confidence or uncertainty for the estimation when the ground truth is not available, using a gauge constraint which settle the reconstruction coordinate system. Here we justify and describe a method which estimate the uncertainty ellipsoids, when previous methods are not straightforward to use due to a huge number of parameters to fit. Many examples are given and discussed for big reconstructions",

The general framework we previously developed for stabilization of periodic orbits for hybrid systems with impact effects is shown to be applicable to three-dimensional under-actuated bipedal robots. It is shown how periodic solutions for the hybrid dynamical equations describing three-dimensional under-actuated bipedal robots can be found and that these periodic solutions (walking gaits) can be robustly stabilized if a certain semi-definite program can be solved. The fact that the robust control synthesis problem can be cast as a semi-definite program implies that computationally efficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) solvers can be used to find the controllers. We demonstrate the methodology through the simulations on a five-link spatial biped with two degrees of under-actuation",

        "abstract": "Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been used to great effect in flat, indoor environments such as corridors and offices. We demonstrate that with a few augmentations, existing 2D SLAM technology can be extended to perform full 3D SLAM in less benign, outdoor, undulating environments. In particular, we use data acquired with a 3D laser range finder. We use a simple segmentation algorithm to separate the data stream into distinct point clouds, each referenced to a vehicle position. The SLAM technique we then adopt inherits much from 2D delayed state (or scan-matching) SLAM in that the state vector is an ever growing stack of past vehicle positions and inter-scan registrations are used to form measurements between them. The registration algorithm used is a novel combination of previous techniques carefully balancing the need for maximally wide convergence basins, robustness and speed. In addition, we introduce a novel post-registration classification technique to detect matches which have converged to incorrect local minima",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an off-line, iterative algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping within large indoor environments. The proposed approach is based on the idea of separately tracking multiple robot pose hypotheses that are generated each time the robot closes a loop by revisiting an already mapped area. Each tracked pose hypothesis corresponds to a separate possible robot path and maintains a separate map. Loop identification is inherently pursued by a hybrid localization algorithm with global localization capabilities. During the first step of the algorithm, all recorded sensor information is sequentially processed, in order to create a set of possible robot paths and their corresponding maps. After all sensor input is processed, the history of all tracked hypotheses is validated in order to select the most probable robot path and the corresponding map. The second step of the algorithm utilizes an EM-like iterative procedure in order to close the loops identified by the first step, compute a correct robot pose history and produce the final map. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm facilitates computation of correct maps regardless of the number of loops in the robot's path",

        "abstract": "The mapping and localization problems have received considerable attention in robotics recently. The exploration problem that drives mapping has started to generate similar attention, as the ease of construction and quality of map is strongly dependent on the strategy used to acquire sensor data for the map. Most exploration strategies concentrate on selecting the next best measurement to take, trading off information gathering for regular relocalization. What has not been studied so far is the effect the robot controller has on the map quality while executing exploration plans. Certain kinds of robot motion (e.g, sharp turns) are hard to estimate correctly, and increase the likelihood of errors in the mapping process. We show how reinforcement learning can be used to generate good motion control while executing a simple information gathering exploration strategy. We show that the learned policy reduces the overall map uncertainty by reducing the amount of uncertainty generated by robot motion",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Velocity estimation is crucial to certain robotic applications involving high bandwidth modeling and control. In the conventional approaches, the velocities generated from encoders or tachometers are quite noisy and low-pass filters are usually engaged to generate usable velocity signals. The low-pass filter, however, cause non negligible phase lag that may severely affect both modeling and control accuracy in the middle and high frequency range. In this paper, two approaches of using a fusion of an encoder and an imperfect accelerometer are proposed to estimate accurate velocities. The two approaches, namely the two-channel approach and the observer-based approach, estimate velocities by using proper frequency weightings over the encoder and accelerometer signals. The encoder mainly contributes to the low-frequency part of the velocity estimation and the accelerometer mainly contribute to the high-frequency part of the velocity estimation. An adaptive mechanism for estimating the accelerometer gain is also presented. The effectiveness of the two proposed velocity estimation approaches is verified experimentally with respect to a one degree-of-freedom robot in terms of both rigid contact modeling and control",

The controlled forces are the metal forming forces. The designed controller operates in a dynamic environment. The complete control system operates in a manner similar to reaction compensation. The force controller used can be viewed as an integrating on-off controller which has tightly controlled release of control efforts to the controllers. It brings in artificial damping that ensures the stability of the control system. The designed force controller operates within limited tool path disturbances. The controller requires the feed forward of a nominal tool path. The accuracy of the nominal tool path brings the force deviations to within a manageable level. A secondary contribution of this work is the design of a generic external control loop for commercial CNC machines that enables the sensor integration for visual servoing or active force control",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new modeling method for holonomic omnidirectional mobile robots propelled by powered-casters. A mobile robot with powered-casters is redundantly actuated since it is controlled by four or more numbers of motors while its configuration is represented by 3DOF on the ground. The redundant architecture leads inverse problems on motion planning, actuator coordination, static or dynamic control, and dead-reckoning calculations with redundant wheel information. To overcome those problems led by the redundant architecture, a new modeling method based on the virtual linkage concept is proposed. The virtual linkages are applied for representing virtual deformations of a robot frame even though an actual robot frame cannot be deformed. The virtual frame deformation provides additional DOF on the robot, which allows total robot DOF equal to the number of actuators equipped with the mobile robot. The acquired n-wheeled robot model with virtual linkages satisfies a class of 2n by 2n system, no redundancy is found in a control system where no inverse calculations of non-square matrices, nor motion planning of redundant actuators. The proposed virtual link model is generalized and a unified procedure is presented for n-wheeled mobile robots. A modeling example is shown and experiments of a three-wheeled robot prototype are performed for evaluating the proposed model and its implementation to a redundantly actuated omnidirectional mobile robot",

We propose a new approach for altitude control of a 10-gram microflyer, where altitude as well as pitch angle are estimated using a set of visual, airspeed and gyroscopic sensors that weight about 1 (g) in total. This approach does not rely on an explicit estimation of optic flow, but rather takes as input the raw images as provided by the vision sensor. We show that altitude and pitch angle of a simulated agent can be successfully estimated. This result is thus a first step toward autonomous altitude control of indoor flying robots",

This is a principle component of the automated transport and retrieval system (ATRS) - an alternate mobility solution for drivers with lower body disabilities. The ATRS employs robotics, automation, and machine vision technologies, and can be integrated into a standard minivan or sport utility vehicle (SUV). At the core of the ATRS is a \"smart\" wheelchair system that autonomously navigates between the driver's position and a powered lift at the rear of the vehicle eliminating the need for an attendant. From an automation perspective, autonomously docking the wheelchair onto the lift platform presented the most significant technical challenge for the proof-of-concept ATRS. This was driven primarily by geometry constraints, which limited clearance between the chair wheels and the lift platform rails. We present significant simulation and experimental results for our approach. These indicate that the coupling of vision-based localization for feedback and input/output feedback linearization techniques for controller design can provide for accurate wheelchair navigation and reliable docking under a range of ambient illumination conditions",

The importance of force measurement during microassembly is to confirm the microgripper-micropart make a successful grasp and to also protect the microparts and microgripper from excessive forces which may lead to damage during the assembly process. In the proposed approach, the force measurement problem is reduced to a problem of determining the microgripper jaw displacement. A 3-D finite element model is developed to study the relation between the forces and the displacements. The resulting nonlinear force-displacement relationship is fitted into a second degree equation. Computer vision is used to measure the relative displacements of the right and left microgripper jaws with respect to the microgripper base during assembly. Patterns that were introduced to the microgripper during the design phase are used to measure those relative displacements through pattern identification. Two-dimensional pattern identification is performed using normalized cross correlation template matching, to estimate the degree to which the image and pattern are correlated",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a new vision-based framework to control a robot within model-free large-scale scenes, where the desired pose has never been attained beforehand. Thus, the desired image is not available. It is important to remark that existing visual servoing techniques cannot be applied in this context. The rigid, unknown scene (i.e. the metric model is also not available) is represented as a collection of planar regions, which may leave the field-of-view continuously as the robot moves toward its distant goal. Hence, a novel approach to detect new planes that enter the field-of-view, which is robust to large camera calibration errors, is then deployed here. In fact, it is well-known that representing the scene as composed by planes, the estimation processes are improved in terms of accuracy, stability, and rate of convergence. This extended 3D vision-based control technique is also based on an efficient second-order method for plane-based tracking and pose reconstruction. The framework is validated by using simulated data with artificially created scenes as well as with real images, and accurate navigation tasks are shown",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust visual tracking framework to track circle-like objects in cluttered environment. Instead of using the resulting positions after circle detection and tracking in the image domain, we directly perform the visual tracking task in the parameter space which describes the measurement features. The visual tracking technique is combined with targets generation closely. We utilize the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) to filter the detected measurements with noise and disturbance. The likelihood ratio through the Hough transform is employed to modify the evaluation of the association probability and make the estimate more reliable. Furthermore, the joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) is used to deal with the multiple circle-like objects tracking. The likelihood variation of each target is introduced with JPDAF as a basis of the predictions for different targets. The overall performance has been verified in several challenging experiments",

        "abstract": "Traditional haptic rendering creates virtual springs using DC motors with current amplifiers and encoder-based position feedback. It is well known that the stiffness of virtual environments is limited by quantization, discretization, and amplifier bandwidth effects. In this paper we propose a novel control architecture that, rather than canceling motor electrical dynamics, uses them to achieve better performances. First we recognize that the inductance L provides a natural sensor-less stiff behavior at high frequencies. Second, electrical resistance R serves as the basis of a wave transform that, performed through an analog circuit, allows to build a more stable interface with virtual environments, achieving robustness to servo delays and discretization. Encoder feedback and digital control loop are required only to provide parametric robustness at low frequencies. A prototype 1-DOF system has been implemented and confirms the promise of this novel paradigm",

Recently, there have been many technical challenges in the field of tactile sensing as well as tactile display. In this paper, we propose an innovative tactile display device based on soft actuator technology with electroactive polymer (EAP). This device offers advantageous features over existing devices with respect to intrinsic flexibility, softness, ease of fabrication and miniaturization, high power density, and cost effectiveness. In particular, it can be adapted to various geometric configurations because it possesses structural flexibility, so it can be worn on any part of the human body such as finger, palm, and arm etc. It can be extensively applied as a wearable tactile display, a Braille device for the visually disabled, and a human interface in the future. A new design of the flexible actuator is proposed and its basic operational principles are discussed. In addition, a tactile display device with 10times10 actuator array (100 actuator cells) is developed and its effectiveness is confirmed",

The objective is to control the production rate in each processing stage in a way that satisfies the demand for final products, while reducing WIP within the production system. The EA identifies the parameters for which a set of fuzzy controllers performs optimal with respect to WIP and backlog minimization. The proposed EA strategy is compared to heuristically tuned distributed fuzzy controllers. Extensive simulation testing shows that the EA strategy significantly improves the system's performance",

Its most peculiar feature, demonstrated in this paper for the first time, is that its workspace is unlimited and flawed only by six singularity curves (instead of surfaces). These curves correspond to self-motions of the mobile platform and of the legs, or to a lockup configuration. This paper also demonstrates that the four solutions to the direct kinematics of the agile eye (assembly modes) have a simple direct relationship with the eight solutions to the inverse kinematics (working modes)",

The ZMP manipulability ellipsoid was developed by combining the ZMP balance criterion, the humanoid robot dynamics and the manipulability of robotic manipulators. The ZMP manipulability ellipsoid represents the ability of a humanoid robot to instantly move the ZMP from its current ZMP location within the balance criterion. The size and shape of the ZMP manipulability ellipsoid are a function of the joint-torque limitation of a humanoid robot. Thus, the ellipsoid forms an area in which the ZMP can be manipulated instantly, and the larger the ellipsoid, the better the propensity of a humanoid robot will be to recover from an unbalanced situation. We also show that the gravity force of a humanoid robot affects neither the shape nor the translation of the ellipsoid. Furthermore, we show that the ZMP manipulability ellipsoid can aid the humanoid-robot design process by choosing appropriate actuators. Finally, a four degree-of-freedom walking robot was used to illustrate the proposed ZMP manipulability ellipsoid",
