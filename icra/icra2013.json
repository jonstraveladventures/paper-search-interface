        "abstract": "The optical trap is a powerful non-contact approach for manipulating micron sized objects. Teleoperation of optical tweezers can be performed by coupling with a haptic interface, which allows an efficient robotic device to control positions and get force feedback. This provides users direct and intuitive microscopic interactions. The major difficulty in order for haptic devices to generate a reliable tactile sensation lies in its high frequency requirement of more than 1 kHz. This paper presents a fast force feedback teleoperation system for optical tweezers that attains this high frequency. The used force sensor is a novel event-based camera that transmits output as a continuous stream of asynchronous temporal events thus enabling high speed event-based visual processing. This new sensor is compared to a conventional frame based one to show advantages of our setup. A complex task of exploiting three dimensional target surface is performed demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the presented method. This is the first time microspheres are used to touch targets of arbitrary form and color, which may interest broad-reaching biological and physical applications.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When measurements from multiple sensors are combined for real-time motion estimation, the time instant at which each measurement was recorded must be precisely known. In practice, however, the timestamps of each sensor's measurements are typically affected by a delay, which is different for each sensor. This gives rise to a temporal misalignment (i.e., a time offset) between the sensors' data streams. In this work, we propose an online approach for estimating the time offset between the data obtained from different sensors. Specifically, we focus on the problem of motion estimation using visual and inertial sensors in extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based methods. The key idea proposed here is to explicitly include the time offset between the camera and IMU in the EKF state vector, and estimate it online along with all other variables of interest (the IMU pose, the camera-to-IMU calibration, etc). Our proposed approach is general, and can be employed in several classes of estimation problems, such as motion estimation based on mapped features, EKF-based SLAM, or visual-inertial odometry. Our simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields high-precision, consistent estimates, in scenarios involving both constant and time-varying offsets.",

        "abstract": "We developed fabrication and manipulation of hybrid nanorobots by 3D nano exposure and optical tweezers. Hybrid nanorobot is composed of photoresist and silicon nanowire. The robot is fabricated by femtosecond laser exposure and is connected to the glass substrate by a micropillar. The processing resolutions of the femtosecond laser exposure are 270 nm (line width) and 600 nm (thickness), respectively. The robot is released by cutting of the pillar by ablation with femtosecond laser. Release time is within four minutes. The released robot is manipulated by holographic optical tweezers (HOT). We succeeded in high-speed manipulation of the robot using HOT (transport speed: 100 \u00b5m/s, rotation speed: 1140 deg/s). The robot can be fabricated by incorporating temperature indicator to the robot body and inserting a silicon nanowire to the probe. The robot can be used as a thermal sensor by measuring temperature change from the probe to the robot body because silicon nanowire has high thermal conductivity (168 W/m\u00b7K). In this paper, we demonstrated fabrication, on-demand release, and manipulation of the robot in a solution. We also demonstrated temperature calibration and measurement to confirm the effectiveness of the temperature sensor.",

        "abstract": "Needle insertion procedures are commonly used for surgical interventions. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) closed-loop control algorithm to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip towards a target in a soft-tissue phantom. Twelve Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are embedded on the needle shaft. FBG sensors measure the strain applied on the needle during insertion. A method is developed to reconstruct the needle shape using the strain data obtained from the FBG sensors. Four experimental cases are conducted to validate the reconstruction method (single-bend, double-bend, 3D double-bend and drilling insertions). In the experiments, the needle is inserted 120 mm into a soft-tissue phantom. Camera images are used as a reference for the reconstruction experiments. The results show that the mean needle tip accuracy of the reconstruction method is 1.8 mm. The reconstructed needle shape is used as feedback for the steering algorithm. The steering algorithm estimates the region that the needle can reach during insertion, and controls the needle to keep the target in this region. Steering experiments are performed for 110 mm insertion, and the mean targeting accuracy is 1.3 mm. The results demonstrate the capability of using FBG sensors to robotically steer needles.",

With the standard approach, the NDT algorithm has a tendency to have poor convergence performance for even modest initial transformation error. In this work, a segmented greedy cluster NDT (SGC-NDT) variant is proposed, which uses natural features in the environment to generate Gaussian clusters for the NDT algorithm. By segmenting the ground plane and clustering the remaining features, the SGC-NDT approach results in a smooth and continuous cost function which guarantees that the optimization will converge. Experiments show that the SGC-NDT algorithm results in scan registrations with higher accuracy and better convergence properties when compared against other state-of-the- art methods for both urban and forested environments.",

        "abstract": "The building sector is the dominant consumer of energy and therefore a major contributor to anthropomorphic climate change. The rapid generation of photorealistic, 3D environment models with incorporated surface temperature data has the potential to improve thermographic monitoring of building energy efficiency. In pursuit of this goal, we propose a system which combines a range sensor with a thermal-infrared camera. Our proposed system can generate dense 3D models of environments with both appearance and temperature information, and is the first such system to be developed using a low-cost RGB-D camera. The proposed pipeline processes depth maps successively, forming an ongoing pose estimate of the depth camera and optimizing a voxel occupancy map. Voxels are assigned 4 channels representing estimates of their true RGB and thermal-infrared intensity values. Poses corresponding to each RGB and thermal-infrared image are estimated through a combination of timestamp-based interpolation and a predetermined knowledge of the extrinsic calibration of the system. Raycasting is then used to color the voxels to represent both visual appearance using RGB, and an estimate of the surface temperature. The output of the system is a dense 3D model which can simultaneously represent both RGB and thermal-infrared data using one of two alternative representation schemes. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is capable of accurately mapping difficult environments, even in complete darkness.",

        "abstract": "Most existing motion tracking methods works in specific predefined situations and requires large amount of a priori information about the target objects, such as, their shapes, appearances, kinematic structures, possible moves and physically valid poses. This work aims to investigate a generic motion tracking method that allows to reduce the amount of a priori knowledge employed. The proposed 3D tracking method mainly intends to allow the tracking of objects with distinct shapes, including cyclic dependencies between their different parts, and learning their representation models during the motion tracking process. To do so, the Nonparametric Belief Propagation (NBP) technique, the PArticle Message PASsing (PAMPAS) algorithm and the Loose-Limbed probabilistic graphical model are used into this novel approach. The proposed method is applied to distinct and previously unknown objects. The obtained results shown that the method is capable of deal adequately with such situations.",

        "abstract": "Estimating human poses is an important step towards developing robots that can understand human motions and improving their cognitive capabilities. This paper presents a geometric feature for estimating human poses from a 3D point cloud input. The proposed feature can be considered as an extension of the idea of visual features, such as color/edge, of color/grayscale images, and it contains the geometric structure of the point cloud. It is derived by arranging the 3D points into a tree structure, which preserves the global and local properties of the 3D points. Shown experimentally, the tree structure (spatial ordering) is particularly important for estimating human poses (i.e., articulated objects). The 3D orientation (pan, tilt and yaw angles) and shape features are then extracted from each node in the tree to describe the geometric distribution of the 3D points. The proposed feature has been evaluated on a benchmark dataset and compared with two existing geometric features. Experimental results show that the proposed feature has the lowest overall error in human-pose estimation.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the topic of industrial robots identification. The usual identification method is based on the use of the inverse dynamic model (IDM) and least squares (LS) technique. Good results can be obtained provided that a well-tuned bandpass filtering is used. However, we are always in doubt if regressors are exogenous i.e. statistically uncorrelated with error terms. Surprisingly, in papers dealing with identification of real-world systems, exogeneity assumption is never verified whereas it is a fundamental condition to obtain unbiased estimates. In Econometrics, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test (DWH-test) is a theoretical method for investigating whether regressors are exogenous or not. The DWH-test makes of the Two Stage Lesat Squares estimator (2SLS) and an augmented LS regression. However, this test cannot be used as is for robots identification: instruments set is supposed to be valid and restrictive statistical assumptions are made while they are quite implausible in practice. In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap between Econometrics and Control engineering practices by introducing a revisited version relevant for robots identification. An experimental validation performed on a 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) robot shows the effectiveness and the usefulness of this revisited DWH-test.",

The proposed system provides feedback information indicating the robot's perception of the environment and what action a human user desires. Feedback is delivered by iteratively spotlighting objects in the environment using the projector. When the spotlight lands on an object that the human user wants the robot to retrieve, he or she can confirm the object selection, and the robot will perform a grasping task to retrieve the selected object. In this investigation, the proposed camera-projector performs three tasks: 1) Actively detect visually salient objects in the scene from the two camera views using a visual attention model. 2) Locate the detected objects using a trifocal tensor based object matching method, and project a spot of light on the objects to provide information back to the human user. 3) Reconstruct the 3D position of the target to plan robot motion and conduct vision-based control to move a robot manipulator to grasp the object. Experimental results of human-directed object grasping task are presented to demonstrate the functions of the proposed system.",

This robot is specifically designed for the direct visual inspection of water-filled infrastructure such as the inside of nuclear powerplants. The unique propulsion architecture consists of a single bidirectional centrifugal pump combined with two fluidic valves. The pump is used to produce a high velocity jet while the valves are used to quickly switch the jet between output ports. The spherical shape means that the robot is simple to model and control, maneuverable, and robust to collisions. The propulsion architecture is described in detail along with a rigid body model for maneuvering control. A novel valve PWM controller is used to achieve heading control, and the controller performance is confirmed with both simulation and experiments. Finally, experiments are used to illustrate the turning and diving performance of the robot.",

        "abstract": "We develop a plume tracking algorithm for a swarm of mobile sensing agents in turbulent flow. Inspired by blue crabs, we propose a stochastic model for plume spikes based on the Poisson counting process, which captures the turbulent characteristic of plumes. We then propose an approach to estimate the parameters of the spike model, and transform the turbulent plume field detected by sensing agents into a smoother scalar field that shares the same source with the plume field. This transformation allows us to design path planning algorithms for mobile sensing agents in the smoother field instead of in the turbulent plume field. Inspired by the source seeking behaviors of fish schools, we design a velocity controller for each mobile agent by decomposing the velocities into two perpendicular parts: the forward velocity incorporates feedback from the estimated spike parameters, and the side velocity keeps the swarm together. The combined velocity is then used to plan the path for each agent in the swarm. Theoretical justifications are provided for convergence of the agent group to the plume source. The algorithms are also demonstrated through simulations.",

        "abstract": "In vitreoretinal surgery, application of excessive forces and unintentional motion due to hand-tremor can easily result in serious complications. Robotic assistance when combined with tool-to-tissue force sensing capabilities has significant potential to improve such practice. In this paper, we evaluate the membrane peeling performance of a single user for two distinct robotic systems with integrated force sensing capabilities: Micron and the Steady-Hand Robot. We show that these systems provide promising performance improvement with similar impact on peeling forces and comparable tremor cancellation trends.",

One of the primary design motivations is the extensive leverage of compliance to achieve robust shape matching between the hand and the grasped object. This effect results in robust grasping performance under sensing, model, and actuation uncertainty. We show the feasibility of our approach to constructing robotic hands in extensive grasping experiments on objects with varying properties, included water bottles, eye glasses, and sheets of fabric. The RBO hand is based on a novel pneumatic actuator, called PneuFlex, which exhibits desirable properties for robotic fingers.",

The analysis is performed under some simplifying assumptions on the structure of the measurement covariance matrix and provides non trivial results on the aspects affecting convergence in nonlinear optimization based on Gauss-Newton methods. We also provide estimates for the basin of attraction of the maximum likelihood solution and results on the uniqueness of such solution. The results confirm observations of related work and explain why common Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) instances are so well-behaved in terms of convergence. Moreover, as a by-product of the derivation, we present different techniques that can enlarge the convergence radius a-priori (i.e., during robot operation) or a-posteriori (i.e., given the data). We validate the theoretical derivation with experiments on standard benchmarking datasets.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a teleoperated dual-user system incorporating Virtual Fixtures (VFs) that allows concurrent performance of a robotic surgical task by an expert and a trainee. In order to guide the trainee through the procedure, an adaptive VF is created in the trainee's workspace according to the motion generated by the expert who is performing the surgery at the same time. The VF gets adaptively adjusted based on the level of expertise the trainee shows during the surgery. In addition, the trainee's level of expertise is used to adaptively adjust the dual-user dominance factor in an online fashion, which gives the trainee some authority over the task based on his/her skill level. To quantify the trainee's expertise level, a performance measure is proposed, based on the force generated by the VF. Three performance measures from the literature are also used. To satisfy the desired objectives of the proposed system, an impedance-based control methodology is adopted. Stability of the closed-loop system is investigated using the small-gain theorem. A sufficient stability condition is derived that guarantees stability in the presence of time-varying communication delay. Experimental results are given to validate the performance of the system.",

Our solution framework is based on a dynamic Bayesian inference framework, and hence, we refer to it as Dynamic Bayesian C-SLAM (DBC-SLAM). DBC-SLAM combines an NCP-based dynamic model with the dynamic Bayesian network, and incorporates model parameter estimation as an intrinsic part of the overall inference procedure. We show two preliminary \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d examples that demonstrate the use of DBC-SLAM in robotic contact tasks.",

Instead of adding more actuators to increase the controllability of the flapping-wing robot, we use a single actuator to drive a system of mechanical linkages to cause bilaterally asymmetric changes in the wing hinge spring rest angle of the left and right wings. We show in simulation that such a control input can generate wing motions which produce yaw and roll torques. A kinematic model of the mechanism was developed and an at-scale prototype of this concept was built. High speed videos of its wing motions are consistent with the kinematic model and according to the simulation, are capable of generating adequate yaw and roll torques for attitude control.",

        "abstract": "Teleoperated robot-assisted surgery (RAS) provides surgeons with improved dexterity, movement control, and visualization in comparison to standard minimally invasive surgery. However, there exists little quantitative understanding of the motor performance of human operators in RAS. Models of how users control their movements and how this control relates to surgical performance could provide inspiration for new robot or human interface designs, as well as more targeted training methods. Toward this end, we present a framework for the analysis of surgeon arm posture variability based on the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) concept, a method used in the study of human motor control for testing hypotheses about the coupling of control and task variables. We partition users' joint angle variability into variability that does and does not result in hand trajectory change. In a preliminary study applying this framework, we explored how expert and novice operators control planar reaching and reversal movements when moving freehand as well as using a teleoperated RAS system. We show that only movements in task-relevant directions are stabilized by the coordination of joint angles, and that this stabilization is stronger for expert movements than novice movements. We also show that stabilization is stronger in freehand than teleoperated movements, especially for the expert. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed framework can be useful for: (1) assessment of teleoperator design and control that reveals how design parameters affect the ability of the user to exploit the UCM for stabilization of hand movement, and (2) skill assessment in RAS.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a fuzzy logic based terrain identification method using multi-sensor fusion for powered prosthesis control. Five locomotion features including rising time of ground reaction force, sequence of foot strike on ground, foot inclination angle during stance, shank inclination angle at toe-off and maximal shank inclination angle during swing are selected to identify different terrains. These features are measured by fusion of two gyroscopes, two accelerometers, two force sensitive resistors and a timer. Based on the features, a fuzzy logic identification method is developed to identify level-ground, stair ascent, stair descent, upslope and downslope online in real time. Average identification accuracy higher than 97.5% is obtained in experiments of five able-bodied subjects and a transtibial amputee. Continuous identification results show the prospect of using the proposed method to realize real-time terrain identification of powered prostheses.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of maintaining persistence in coordinated tasks performed by a team of autonomous robots. We introduce a dedicated team of charging robots to service a team of primary working robots. Given that the trajectories of the working robots are known within a planning interval, the objective is to plan routes for the charging robots such that they rendezvous with and recharge all working robots to guarantee their continuous operation. To this end, the working robot trajectories are discretized to form a finite set of recharging points at which rendezvous can occur. The problem is formulated as a directed acyclic graph with vertex partitions containing sets of charging points for each working robot. Solutions consist of paths through the graph for each of the charging robots. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and a mixed integer linear program formulation is presented and solved for small problem instances. Finally, it is shown that while the optimal solution is not computationally feasible for large problem sizes, it is possible to graphically transform the single charging robot problem to a Traveling Salesman Problem, for which existing heuristic and approximation algorithms can be applied. Simulation results are presented for both single and multiple charging robot scenarios.",

        "abstract": "As orthopaedic implants become more sophisticated and complex, shaping the bone surface to match the implant becomes increasingly important. Accurate bone machining contributes to success of the implant and can potentially increase the implant's endurance and lifetime. Bone-mounted robots can eliminate intra-operative tracking errors during bone machining. However, registration errors still exist when aligning the pre-operative plan with the patient's anatomy because the plan is based on pre-operative images. Thus, a robotic system that is capable of executing both surface acquisition and bone machining in a single procedure and within the same coordinate system is preferable to the current state of the art. In this study we used a mini bone-attached robotic system (MBARS) with a haptic interface, to examine the accuracy of force-controlled surface acquisition of a femur model. The average distance error between acquired points and the surface model was less than 1 mm, which was further reduced by 5% with a compensation method which included curvature estimation of the reconstructed surface. An initial evaluation of in-situ bone machining based on these force-controlled scans yielded promising results.",

We show that the DAMA problem can be framed as a multi-modal planning problem and describe a hierarchical algorithm that takes advantage of this multi-modal nature. We also extend our earlier forward search sampling algorithm to a bi-directional version. We give results on a complicated manipulation domain and demonstrate that both new algorithms are significantly more efficient than the original, and that the hierarchical algorithm is usually much more efficient than the forward or bi-directional searches.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of precisely localizing a group of stationary targets using a single stereo camera mounted on a mobile robot. In particular, assuming that at least one pair of stereo images of the targets is available, we seek to determine where to move the stereo camera so that the localization uncertainty of the targets is minimized. We call this problem the Next-Best-View problem. The advantage of using a stereo camera is that, using triangulation, the two simultaneous images can yield range and bearing measurements of the targets, as well as their uncertainty. We use a Kalman filter to fuse location and uncertainty estimates as more measurements are acquired. Our solution to the Next-Best-View problem is to iteratively minimize the fused uncertainty of the targets' locations subject to field-of-view constraints. We capture these objectives by appropriate artificial potentials on the camera's relative frame and the global frame, respectively. In particular, with every new observation, the mobile stereo camera computes the new next best view on the relative frame and subsequently realizes this view in the global frame via gradient descent on the space of robot positions and orientations, until a new observation is made. Integration of next best view with motion planning results in a hybrid system, which we illustrate in computer simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a soft lower-extremity robotic exosuit intended to augment normal muscle function in healthy individuals. Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit's performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer's hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30% of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject's average metabolic power was 386.7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381.8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430.6 W). This preliminary work demonstrates that the exosuit can comfortably transmit joint torques to the user while not restricting mobility and that with further optimization, has the potential to reduce the wearer's metabolic cost during walking.",

First, link parameters of the rocker-bogie mechanism are optimized through the Taguchi method, with the aim of making the trajectory of the center of mass (CM) of the mobile platform as smooth as possible. Based on the optimization result, the mobile platform is compactly designed to suit indoor applications. A simple, robust and cost-effective estimation method is then proposed to obtain information of the contact angle between each wheel and the stairs with high fidelity. A composite locomotion strategy is suggested, based on the kinematic and kinetic analysis, combined with the contact angle estimation. The stair-climbing capability of the proposed mobile platform is successfully validated through extensive experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a constraint-based method for haptic interaction between an arbitrary voxelized polygon tool and a streaming point cloud derived from a depth sensor. Using the presented method, a user can interact with both dynamic as well as static point cloud representations of real objects captured in real-time. Every depth image frame is filtered and surface normals are calculated in real-time. For movement of the virtual tool, a \u2018quasi-static\u2019 simulation is used. The innovations of this work include the extension of haptic rendering from streaming point clouds to six degrees of freedom. This is appropriate for co-robotic tasks where haptic feedback to the user is combined with remote control of a robot.",

        "abstract": "Motion capture systems play an important role in health-care and sport-training systems. In particular, there exists a great demand on a mobile motion capture system that enables people to monitor their health condition and to practice sport postures anywhere at any time. The motion capture systems with infrared or vision cameras, however, require a special setting, which hinders their application to a mobile system. In this paper, a mobile three-dimensional motion capture system is developed based on inertial sensors and smart shoes. Sensor signals are measured and processed by a mobile computer; thus, the proposed system enables the analysis and diagnosis of postures during outdoor sports, as well as indoor activities. The measured signals are transformed into quaternion to avoid the Gimbal lock effect. In order to improve the precision of the proposed motion capture system in an open and outdoor space, a frequency-adaptive sensor fusion method and a kinematic model are utilized to construct the whole body motion in real-time. The reference point is continuously updated by smart shoes that measure the ground reaction forces.",

This project establishes the design of an adaptive, four-finger hand utilizing simple 3D-printed components, compliant flexure joints, and readily obtainable off-the-shelf parts. Modular and adjustable finger designs are provided, giving the user a range of options depending on the intended use of the hand. The design tradeoffs and decisions made to achieve the 3D-printable, compact and lightweight robotic gripper are discussed, as well as a preliminary discussion of the performance differences between the finger designs. The authors intend this work to be the first in a series of open-source designs to be released, and through the contributions of the open-source user community, result in a large number of design modifications and variations available to researchers.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a system of multiple coordinating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that can localize and track a shark tagged with an acoustic transmitter. Each AUV is equipped with a stereo-hydrophone system that provides measurements of the relative bearing to the transmitter, as well as an acoustic modem that allows for inter-AUV communication and hence cooperative shark state estimation and decentralized tracking control. Online state estimation of the shark's state is performed using a Particle Filter in which measurements are shared between AUVs. The decentralized control system enables the AUVs to circumnavigate a dynamic target, (i.e. the estimated shark location). Each AUV circles the target by tracking circles of different radii and at different phase angles with respect to the target so as to obtain simultaneous sensor vantage points and minimize chance of AUV collision. A series of experiments using two AUVs were conducted in Big Fisherman's Cove in Santa Catalina Island, CA and demonstrated the ability to track a tagged leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata). The performance of the tracking was compared to standard manual tracking performed using an directional hydrophone operated by a researcher in a boat. In an additional experiment, the AUVs tracked an acoustic tag attached to the tracking boat to quantify the error of the state estimation of the system.",

        "abstract": "Over the past years, there has been a tremendous progress in the area of robot navigation. Most of the systems developed thus far, however, are restricted to indoor scenarios, non-urban outdoor environments, or road usage with cars. Urban areas introduce numerous challenges to autonomous mobile robots as they are highly complex and in addition to that dynamic. In this paper, we present a navigation system for pedestrian-like autonomous navigation with mobile robots in city environments. We describe different components including a SLAM system for dealing with huge maps of city centers, a planning approach for inferring feasible paths taking also into account the traversability and type of terrain, and a method for accurate localization in dynamic environments. The navigation system has been implemented and tested in several large-scale field tests in which the robot Obelix managed to autonomously navigate from our university campus over a 3.3 km long route to the city center of Freiburg.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many neurorobotic experiments require central pattern generators (CPGs) and motion primitives for the target robot, which have to be given prior to an experiment as building blocks. The creation of artificial neural networks, that produce the desired motions, is a tedious and time-consuming task. Also, rapidly varying motion patterns to test alternative motions is difficult due to the rigid nature of the usually hardwired networks. To overcome this problem, a novel network architecture is introduced that allows to capture motions directly from demonstrated movements on the robot hardware. The demonstrated motion patterns are stored in the activation dynamics of the network, instead of in the synaptic weights. This allows the rapid creation and modification of neural CPGs for various - even complex - motions directly on the robot. With a simple adaptation method, the activation dynamics representing the captured motions can also be used to determine synaptic weights to create fixed, reusable neural building blocks. The applicability of the proposed neural network architecture is demonstrated by generating two arm motions for a humanoid robot by demonstration. The successful applications show that the neural motion capturing approach is a useful method to generate CPGs for neurorobotic experiments.",

The classification procedure exploits color, texture, shape, and edge information from 2D and 3D local and global information for each article of clothing using a Kinect sensor. The key contribution of this paper is a novel method of classifying clothing which we term L-M-H, more specifically L-C-S-H using characteristics and selection masks. Essentially, the method decomposes the problem into high (H), low (L) and multiple mid-level (characteristics(C), selection masks(S)) layers and produces \u201clocal\u201d solutions to solve the global classification problem. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the system to efficiently classify and label into one of three categories (shirts, socks, or dresses). These results show that, on average, the classification rates, using this new approach with mid-level layers, achieve a true positive rate of 90%.",

        "abstract": "Motion trajectory gives a meaningful and informative clue in characterizing the motions of human, robots or moving objects. Hence, the descriptor for motion trajectory plays an importance role in motion recognition for many robotic tasks. However, an effective and compact descriptor for multiple 3D motion trajectories under complicated situation is lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel invariant descriptor for multiple motion trajectories based on the kinematic relation among multiple moving parts. There are two kinds of kinematic relation among multiple trajectories: articulated and independent trajectories. Spherical coordinate system is introduced to get a uniform and compact representation for both kinds of trajectories, where the relative trajectory concept are firstly defined based on orientation and distance changes in favor of acquiring relative movement features of each child trajectory with respect to the root trajectory. Then, by incorporating both the differential invariants of root trajectory and orientation, distance variations of each relative trajectory respectively, the new descriptor is constructed. Finally, effectiveness and robustness of our proposed new descriptor for multiple trajectories under complex circumstance are validated by the conducted two experiments for sign language and human action recognition.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new hand exoskeleton device using a three-layered sliding spring mechanism is presented. In contrast to state of the art hand exoskeleton mechanisms (typically link, wire or pneumatically driven), the proposed mechanism is driven through large deformations of the compliant mechanism body. The mechanism can be made compact and lightweight by adequately positioning the compliant elements. In addition, the mechanism is designed to distribute 1-DOF actuated linear motion into three rotational motions of the finger joints, which translate into natural finger flexion/extension. The primary applicatoin of the proposed mechanism is to provide robotic support during physical therapy at the hospital (e.g. Continuous Passive Motion). However, thanks to its light and wearable structure, the proposed device could also be used at home as an assistive/therapeutic device to support activities of daily living. We introduce the mechanical structure of the three-layered sliding spring mechanism, present a prototype implementation as a hand exoskeleton device, and provide a preliminary evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Hexapods are widely used for precision positioning, but their workspace is too limited for some applications. Often, a rotary stage is added to enlarge the orientation workspace, but this increases the system cost. As an alternative, rotary hexapods have been proposed in which the legs are of fixed length and the base attachment points slide along a common circular path. However, these hexapods have a reduced range of motion in some degrees of freedom due to mechanical interferences. In contrast, we propose a design in which two concentric circular rails are used in addition to double spherical joints, three extra rotary sensors, and two high-accuracy rotary encoders. As a result, the workspace of our robot is significantly increased, its direct kinematics can be solved linearly, and its high accuracy is guaranteed. A prototype has been built and is described in detail.",

The language offers three different level of abstraction for robot programming. On lowest level skills are coded by domain experts. On a more abstract level these skills are supposed to be combined by shop floor workers or technicians to define tasks. The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore. To this end we are able to generate code while hiding controller specific implementation details. In addition the development in LightRocks is supported by a generic graphical editor implemented as an Eclipse plugin.",

        "abstract": "\u201cGrasping by caging\u201d has been considered as a powerful tool to deal with uncertainty. In this paper, we continue to explore into \u201cgrasping by caging\u201d and propose a new solution by using eigen-shapes and space mapping. For one thing, eigen-shapes fix dexterous hands into a series of finger formations and help to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity. For the other, space mapping builds a mapping between rasterized grids in 2-D Work space (W space) and rasterized voxels in 3-D Configuration space (C space) and helps to rapidly reconstruct C space so that we can efficiently measure the robustness of caging and find an optimal caging configuration for grasping. Our algorithm can work rapidly and squeezingly cage any 2-D shapes, including objects with either convex boundaries, concave boundaries, 1-order or high-order boundaries and even objects with inner holes. We implement the algorithm with MATLAB and carry out experiments with WEBOTS simulation to test its robustness to uncertainties. The results show that our algorithm can work well with various object shapes and can be robust to noisy control and noisy perception. It is promising in the power grasping tasks of dexterous hands.",

We derive a simplified expression for the robot's angular momentum and invert this expression to solve for the shape velocities that drive the body's angular momentum to a desired value. By choosing a body angular velocity vector parallel to the axis of error rotation, the controller steers the robot towards its desired orientation. The proposed scheme is accomplished through feedback laws as opposed to feedforward trajectory generation, is fairly robust to model uncertainties, and is simple enough to implement on a miniature microcontroller. We verify our approach by implementing the controller on a small (175 g) robot platform, enabling rapid maneuvers approaching the spectacular capability of animals.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel wearable device for measuring such signals. This new design provides much higher measurement accuracy than a previous prototype. Experimental results by using standard weights provide that the relative force and torque error is about 5%. With time-varying load, the new device is compared with an ATI Nano17 force/torque sensor; average relative errors between the force signals is about 16.85%, and average relative errors between the torque signals is about 28.74%. Preliminary manipulation experiments of inserting a catheter into a vascular phantom model illustrated that the device can detect the collision between the catheter and the vascular walls. Subtle force/torque changes caused by changes of movement direction can be detected. Force/torque changes at some critical point (such as the interaction point of vessels) can also be detected.",

This paper reports the development of a new force sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with the ability not just to sense forces at the tip of the surgical instrument located inside the eye, but also to provide information about the interaction force between the instrument shaft and the sclera. The sclera section provides vital feedback for cooperative robot control to minimize potentially dangerous forces on the eye. Preliminary results with 2\u00d72 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) force sensor and force scaling robot control demonstrate significant reduction of forces on the sclera. The design and analysis of the sensor is presented along with a simulated robot assisted retinal membrane peeling on a phantom with sclera constraints and audio feedback.",

        "abstract": "Achieving energy efficient legged locomotion is an important goal for the future of robot mobility. This paper presents a novel joint for legged locomotion that is energy efficient for two reasons. The first reason is the configuration of the elastic elements and actuator which we show analytically has lower energy losses than the typical arrangement. The second is that the joint stiffness, and hence stance duration, is controllable without requiring any energy from the actuator. Further, the joint stiffness can be changed significantly during the flight phase, from zero to highly rigid. Results obtained from a prototype hopper, demonstrate that the joint allows continuous and peak hopping via torque control. The results also demonstrate that the hopping frequency can be varied between 2.2Hz and 4.6Hz with associated stance duration of between 0.35 and 0.15 seconds.",

        "abstract": "In the framework of automated manufacturing systems (AMS), Petri nets are widely used to model, analyze, and control them. Resolving deadlocks is of paramount significance because their emergence reduces the system throughput to zero. Supervisory control technique is the most widely adopted method to resolve them. A control policy can be converted into satisfying a set of inequalities, each of which corresponds to a siphon in a Petri net structure. The number of siphons can be exponential in the worst case, so does the number of inequalities. Taking into account the independent and dependent inequalities, this paper proposes a method to remove all the dependent inequalities while preserving only the independent ones. This method can significantly reduce the size of a supervisory controller. Examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 10cm \u00d7 5cm \u00d7 5cm, 52g one-motor driven robot. One DC motor with a driving gear drives two driven gears to implement the functions of jumping and walking. Two one-way bearings mounted on the inner races of the two driven gears are used to switch between jumping and walking when the motor rotates clockwise and anticlockwise respectively. The jumping energy is obtained by compressing and releasing two torsion springs using a cylindrical cam with quick return characteristics. Two disk cams drive two forelegs with elastic joints to step forward one after another to implement the walking locomotion pattern. Two connecting rods link the forelegs and the rear legs on the left and right sides of the robot to transmit motions from forelegs to rear legs. The jumping and walking performances of the robot are tested. Experimental results show that the proposed robot can jump more than 33cm high at a takeoff angle of 71.2\u00b0 and it can walk forward at 1.43mm/s.",

A fast growing technology in the 3D visualization systems market is multi-views autostereoscopic displays (ADs). However, these devices have not yet found a direct application in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), as it is really challenging to embed a high number of point-of-views in a device which has to pass through a MIS incision. The aim of this work is the development of a miniaturized vision acquisition system for MIS, which can be interfaced with multi-views ADs. The system is anchored by a magnetic link to the abdomen and freely moved by magnetic actuation to adjust the point of view and the horizon of the cameras. The laparoscope can embed up to 9 cameras, while matching typical MIS access incision size.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Because virtual metrology (VM) can achieve real-time and on-line total inspection, it is a promising way for measuring machining precision of machine tools. However, the machining processes possess the characteristics of severe vibrations. Thus, how to effectively handle signals with low signal/noise ratios and extract key features from them is a challenging issue for successfully applying VM to the machine tools. In this paper, a novel VM scheme for predicting machining precision of machine tools is proposed based on several previously developed methods for data quality evaluation, model reliance evaluation, and machining precision prediction. Besides, for data preprocess, we propose a Wavelet-based de-noising method to improve the S/N ratio of sensor data. In addition, we base on the stepwise technique to develop an automatic feature selection method that can extract key features related to machining operations in time, frequency, and time-frequency domains, and can reduce the dimension of essential features. Testing results of a 3-axis CNC machine center machining standard workpieces show that the VMS can achieve the performance that the maximum average error of machining-precision conjecture is less than 2 um and the conjecture of 20 machining-precision items can be completed within 3.8 sec.",

This paper shows how to apply a mathematical framework commonly used for parallel robots to study the kinetostatic properties of hands manipulating objects using precision grasps, considering compliance and underactuation in the joints, without requiring the use of the grasp matrix. The proposed framework is suitable for any hand, but we focus on underactuated hands. We show how the natural redundancy present in fully-actuated hands can be eliminated using underactuation, leading to simplified non-redundant systems that are easier to control. We primarily focus our efforts on introducing and describing the theoretical framework, and follow this with an example application using a three-fingered underactuated hand. For this example, we define the feasible workspace as the subspace of the kinematic workspace for which the hand can accomplish a grasp, and we study how the compliance, rest angles, and joint coupling in the fingers can be designed to increase the size of this feasible workspace.",

More specifically, we first establish an objective system with guaranteed signal convergence and stability performance; then based on the structure of the objective dynamics, a partially saturated control law is derived straightforwardly by solving one partial differential equation, without performing any partial feedback linearization operations on the original crane model. The convergence and stability performance of the objective (i.e., closed-loop) system is guaranteed with Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance theorem. To validate the practical performance of the proposed method, we implement hardware experiments to illustrate that the new method achieves superior performance with reduced control efforts.",

        "abstract": "Robots capable of hover flight in constrained indoor environments have many applications, however their range is constrained by the high energetic cost of airborne locomotion. Perching allows flying robots to scan their environment without the need to remain aloft. This paper presents the design of a mechanism that allows indoor flying robots to attach to vertical surfaces. To date, solutions that enable flying robot with perching capabilities either require high precision control of the dynamics of the robot, or a mechanism robust to high energy impacts. In this article, we propose a perching mechanism comprising a compliant deployable pad and a passive self-alignment system, that does not require any active control during the attachment procedure. More specifically, a perching mechanism using fibre-based dry adhesives was implemented on a 300 g flying platform. An adhesive pad was first modeled and optimized in shape for maximum attachment force at the low pre-load forces inherent to hovering platforms. It was then mounted on a deployable mechanism that stays within the structure of the robot during flight and can be deployed when a perching manoeuvre is initiated. Finally, the perching mechanism is integrated onto a real flying robot and successful perching manoeuvres are demonstrated as a proof of concept.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an approach to extending the capabilities of telemanipulation systems by intelligently augmenting a human operator's motion commands based on quantitative three-dimensional scene perception at the remote telemanipulation site. This framework is the first prototype of the Augmented Shared-Control for Efficient, Natural Telemanipulation (ASCENT) System. ASCENT aims to enable new robotic applications in environments where task complexity precludes autonomous execution or where low-bandwidth and/or high-latency communication channels exist between the nearest human operator and the application site. These constraints can constrain the domain of telemanipulation to simple or static environments, reduce the effectiveness of telemanipulation, and even preclude remote intervention entirely. ASCENT is a semi-autonomous framework that increases the speed and accuracy of a human operator's actions via seamless transitions between one-to-one teleoperation and autonomous interventions. We report the promising results of a pilot study validating ASCENT in a transatlantic telemanipulation experiment between The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, USA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. In these experiments, we observed average telemetry delays of 200ms, and average video delays of 2s with peaks of up to 6s for all data. We also observed 75% frame loss for video streams due to bandwidth limits, giving 4fps video.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to simultaneously track multiple objects which are subject to physical motion and can be evaluated through raw detector responses in video. Due to their two-staged design, popular tracking-by-detection approaches lack precision in the estimated trajectories due to detector inaccuracies, e.g., lighting, deformation or background clutter. Instead of separating the tasks of detection and tracking, we propose to integrate both in a single probabilistic objective function for determining the object states in a sequence. Both support each other accounting for detection inaccuracies and leading to a robust and precise single target tracker. Based on this, we extend it to multiple targets by solving the problem of determining trajectory limits and sorting out any multiple target ambiguities probabilistically. We apply our method to the task of tracking thrown balls with the goal of accurate trajectory prediction for the purpose of ball catching with a humanoid robot. Our results show improved tracking accuracy with respect to ground truth on average by around 17 %, which is dominated by increased accuracy at the beginning of the trajectory.",

        "abstract": "Fault tolerance is critical for various situations where robotic manipulators are applied, such as for hazardous waste disposal, exploring remote environments, or medical procedures. Metrics that are frequently applied to measure the degree of fault tolerance that a manipulator possesses have been focused on local kinematic properties of the Jacobian matrix, e.g., the worst-case manipulability (or relative manipulability) following a locked joint failure. These measures are useful for characterizing the manipulator's dexterity at a given configuration, however, they do not provide a measure for completion of a task within a specified workspace. This paper extends the use of local fault tolerance measures by using them to compute a global measure using a probabilistic analysis. Specifically, we compute cumulative density functions (CDF) that can be used to specify a desired fault tolerance threshold for completion of a task within a specified workspace region. We further show how this CDF can be improved by utilizing redundancy to optimize manipulator configurations throughout this region, using a modified nine degree of freedom Mitsubishi PA10-7C.",

The framework facilitates assessment of grasp success in a goal-oriented way, taking into account both geometric constraints for task affordances and stability requirements specific for a task. We integrate high-level task information introduced by a teacher in a supervised setting with low-level stability requirements acquired through a robot's self-exploration. The conditional relations between tasks and multiple sensory streams (vision, proprioception and tactile) are modeled using Bayesian networks. The generative modeling approach both allows prediction of grasp success, and provides insights into dependencies between variables and features relevant for object grasping.",

In order to have an effective ablation procedure, after positioning the catheter at the desired location inside the heart chamber, a consistent tip/tissue contact should be maintained during the whole procedure. With the goal of implementing hybrid force/position control of the catheter tip during the ablation procedure, this paper studies how the catheter tip deflects when forces are applied. A pseudo-rigid-body 3R model for the catheter tip is introduced. The model performance is evaluated through extensive experiments and it is shown that the proposed model can estimate the shape of the bending section of the ablation catheter if force information is available. This model does not require extensive knowledge of the catheter internal structure. Moreover, the well-established static equations are simple to understand and solve, making this model a convenient choice for developing a control system.",

We propose a task space CPG-based trajectory generation that can be modulated according to terrain irregularities and the posture of the robot trunk. To improve the robot's stability, we implemented a null space based attitude control for the trunk and a push recovery algorithm based on the concept of capture points. Simulations and experimental results on the hydraulically actuated quadruped robot HyQ will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a problem where a suspended load, carried by a rotorcraft aerial robot, performs trajectory tracking. We want to accomplish this by specifying the reference trajectory for the suspended load only. The aerial robot needs to discover/learn its own trajectory which ensures that the suspended load tracks the reference trajectory. As a solution, we propose a method based on least-square policy iteration (LSPI) which is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed method is verified through simulation and experiments.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most unique types of art in Chinese culture, nowadays Chinese calligraphy is attracting increasing interests from researchers. It will be a big step if we have a robot to write Chinese calligraphy, especially in various styles, and it will form a bridge to combine science with art directly. However, there are so many different types and styles in Chinese calligraphy, and to distinguish them is the most basic quality to a green hand, but it is a big challenge for a robot to do so. For the lack of exploration about this, we conduct a lot of experiments to help the robot to accomplish it automatically. We first propose a parametric representation of calligraphic characters, and then adopt the Mahalanobis distance for similarity measurement and classification. The average accuracies of classifying types and styles of the Chinese calligraphy are 96.36% and 95.61% respectively. During the experiments, some interesting phenomena are discovered through similarity measure. Meanwhile, the parametric representation also has some potential applications, such as defining aesthetic grading standards of calligraphy and synthesizing calligraphy. Based on our research, the calligraphy robot can tell which style of calligraphy it sees for mimicking.",

        "abstract": "Every year, stroke significantly affects thousands of individuals who require rehabilitation to regain lost movements and return to a normal life. Exoskeletons are becoming a very powerful tool to help therapists in this rehabilitation process. This work presents a robotic exoskeleton designed to assist overground gait training for stroke survivors with deficits in gait coordination despite conventional rehabilitation. The device is a bilateral exoskeleton with six degrees of freedom and is designed to implement two control strategies. An adaptive trajectory control has been developed to guide the patient's limb within a desired path, allowing a deviation based on torque of interaction between the user and the exoskeleton. An admittance control strategy allows the robotic platform to capture the user's movements during assistive training and to replicate it during active training. Experimental results show that the exoskeleton can adapt a pre-recorded gait pattern for the gait pattern of a specific user. Future investigations will evaluate the device in the rehabilitation of patients who have suffered from stroke and make a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of different robotic therapies.",

Extending our previous work on selecting an individual robot from a population by face-engagement, we show that reaching toward a robot - a specialization of pointing - can be used to designate a particular robot for subsequent one-on-one interaction. To achieve robust operation despite frequent sensing problems, the robots use three phases of human detection and tracking, and emit audio cues to solicit interaction and guide the behaviour of the human. A series of real-world trials demonstrates the practicality of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), like other sampling-based motion planning methods, has been very successful in solving motion planning problems. Even so, sampling-based planners cannot solve all problems of interest efficiently, so attention is increasingly turning to parallelizing them. However, one challenge in parallelizing RRT is the global computation and communication overhead of nearest neighbor search, a key operation in RRTs. This is a critical issue as it limits the scalability of previous algorithms. We present two parallel algorithms to address this problem. The first algorithm extends existing work by introducing a parameter that adjusts how much local computation is done before a global update. The second algorithm radially subdivides the configuration space into regions, constructs a portion of the tree in each region in parallel, and connects the subtrees,i removing cycles if they exist. By subdividing the space, we increase computation locality enabling a scalable result. We show that our approaches are scalable. We present results demonstrating almost linear scaling to hundreds of processors on a Linux cluster and a Cray XE6 machine.",

The approach enables tracking of dynamic objects, incorporates uncertainty and allows for annotations by semantic tags. A demonstration is given for a perception application that exploits the temporal sharing of 3D data.

Thus the agent learns to predict from a visual scene the shape/curvature properties of the object. The associated curvature properties are directly linked to grasp possibilities (as in approaches like [1] and [2]) but can also provide the agent with object categorization regarding the distribution of curvature classes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel approach for automated suturing is introduced and experimental results are presented. Unlike other similar works, the proposed approach adopts a single arm to implement a suturing task with a standard laparoscopic needle holder and curved suture needle. 3D information is obtained from a clinical (single camera) endoscope through an elliptical/circular pose measurement algorithm, which dynamically tracks the suture needle and surface markers. This drives robotic needle steering through a set of surgeon-defined entry/exit points on a tissue pad phantom. Implementation results indicate good depth resolution (1.5mm) and task repeatability (85%) for a variety of consistency, lighting, and location variation scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Opening and navigating through doors remains a challenging problem, particularly in cluttered environments and for spring-loaded doors. Passing through doors, especially spring-loaded doors, requires making and breaking contacts with the door and preventing the door from closing while passing through. In this work, we present a planning framework that handles non-spring and spring-loaded doors, in cluttered or confined workspaces, planning the approach to the door, pushing or pulling it open, and passing through. Because the problem is solved in a combined search space, the planner yields an overall least-cost path. The planner is able to insert a transition between robot-door contacts at any point along the plan. We utilize a compact graph-based representation of the problem to keep planning times low. We precompute the force workspace of the end-effectors to eliminate checks against joint torque limits at plan time. We have validated our solution in both simulation and real-world experiments on the PR2 mobile manipulation platform; the robot is able to successfully open a variety of spring-loaded and non-spring-loaded doors by pushing and pulling.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Stability prediction is an important concern for mobile robots operating in rough environments. Having the capacity to predict areas of instability means pro-actively being able to plan safer traversable paths. The most influential tip-over stability measures are based on two criteria, the robot's center of mass (CM) and the supporting polygon (SP) defined by the convex area spanned between the ground contact-points. However, there is significant uncertainty associated with many parameters in the planning pipe-line: the actual robot kino-dynamic model, its localisation in the ground, and the terrain models, particularly in uneven terrain. This article proposes a statistical analysis of stability prediction to account for some of the uncertainties. This is accomplished using the force angle (FA) stability measure for a reconfigurable multi-tracked vehicle fitted with flippers, a manipulator arm and a sensor head. Probability density function (PDF) of contact-points, CM and the FA stability measure are numerically estimated, with simulation results performed on the open dynamics engine (ODE) simulator based on uncertain parameters. Two techniques are presented: a conventional Monte Carlo scheme, and a structured unscented transform (UT) which results in significant improvement in computational efficiency. Experimental results on maps obtained from a range camera fitted on the sensor head while the robot traverses over a ramp and a series of steps are presented that confirms the validity of the proposed probabilistic stability prediction method.",

The robots move the object by pushing it. The direction in which the object moves is controlled by the way in which the robots distribute themselves around its perimeter \u2014 if the robots dynamically reallocate themselves around the section of the object's perimeter that occludes their view of the goal, the object will eventually be transported to the goal. This strategy is fully distributed, and makes no use of communication between the robots. A controller based on this strategy was implemented on a swarm of 12 physical e-puck robots, and a systematic experiment with 30 randomized trials was performed. The object was successfully transported to the goal in all the trials. On average, the path traced by the object was about 8.4% longer than the shortest possible path.",

Furthermore, to better comply with the hardware/software limitations of mobile robotic platforms, robots actuators are assumed to be saturated. A theoretical characterization of the main properties of the proposed swarm aggregation algorithm is provided.

The microrobot has a dumb-bell shape whose largest dimension is 400 \u00b5m. When subjected to an exterior predefined magnetic field, the magnetic microagent performs a tumbling motion driven by the interacting magnetic forces and momentums. By switching the magnetic field during the motion cycle the agent is also able to perform a sliding locomotion that is useful for micromanipulation. The magnetic field providing the drive force is generated by a portable coil system consisting of five electromagnetic coils. Under the available driven field, the prototype has shown adaptable mobility through tumbling mechanism on various types of surface in both dry and fluid environments, and also shown pushing manipulation in viscous fluid. This manipulation force has been experimentally evaluated through testing with AFM tip and a micro force sensor and shown to be on the order of several \u00b5Ns.",

        "abstract": "Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) and Interaural Time Difference (ITD) are two important cues for robot acoustic localization both in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) areas. However, it is a challenge job to localize a sound source accurately and swiftly only by two acoustic sensors. In this paper, a time-delay compensation based two-layer probabilistic model is presented for binaural sound source localization. In the first layer, a weighting function of Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) named PHAT-\u03c1\u03b3 is used in low-frequency to obtain the prior time-delay. And in this layer a crude estimate of azimuth can also be acquired. At the same time, the probability of all possible time-delay lags can be achieved from the training data. In the Second layer, a new improved algorithm of IID based on time-delay compensation(named IID\u03b4\u03c4) is introduced to refine the probability of the azimuth and the elevation. Lastly, localization result is obtained by Bayes-Rule method. Comparing with three state-of-art algorithms, experimental results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy and costs less time for sound source localization.",

Operating on the inferred shape of the object, an iterative grasp replanning and exploration algorithm decides when further exploration is required, and where to explore in the scene using the pretouch sensor.

        "abstract": "For teleoperation of multiple mobile robots (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles), a better situational awareness of remote environments is crucial for good performance. Visual and force feedback are the most common ways to perceive the environments accurately using a vision system and a haptic device, respectively. In outdoor environments, however, it is difficult to use adequate/accurate sensors (e.g., global localization system) for haptic feedback of the remote environments as well as the slave robots. In this paper, we propose a visual and force feedback method to enhance a human operator's situational awareness in multi-robot teleoperation by fabricating a global view of the multi-robot system and transmitting velocity information of one, respectively, using only local information of the robots. The proposed visual feedback method, then, is evaluated via two psychophysical experiments: maneuvering and searching tests. Several measures are also proposed to assess the human operator's maneuverability and situational awareness quantitatively.",

The algorithm uses active sub-sampling: it searches for corners by exploiting information from local image samples. ACT-CORNER is compared to both the Harris and FAST corner detectors. It is computationally much more efficient than the Harris corner detector. The comparison with FAST depends on the image size, with an advantage for ACT-CORNER for image dimensions of 320 \u00d7 240 pixels or larger. ACT-CORNER's performance is evaluated in the context of optic flow based Time-To-Contact (TTC) estimation. Image zoom experiments show that the accuracy of TTC estimations is similar when ACT-CORNER or FAST are used for corner detection. Finally, experiments with a Parrot AR drone show that the TTC estimates based on ACT-CORNER correspond well to sonar-based estimates.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing trend to use Stewart platforms to implement ultra-high precision tasks under large external loads (e.g. biomechanical testing) mainly due to their high stiffness, and high load carrying capacity. However, the backlash or joint clearance in the system can significantly degrade the accuracy. This work studied the application of actuation redundancy in a general Stewart platform to regulate the preloads on its active joints for the purpose of backlash prevention. A novel active preload control method was proposed to achieve a real-time approach that is robust to large six degree of freedom external loads. The proposed preload method applies an inverse-dynamics based online optimization algorithm to calculate the desired force trajectory of the redundant actuator, and uses a force control scheme to achieve the required force. Simulation results demonstrate that this method is able to eliminate backlash inaccuracies during application of large external loads and therefore ensure the precision of the system.",

We test this claim with a biomimetic fingertip that senses surface texture under a range of contact depths. We compare the performance of passive Bayesian perception with a novel approach for active perception that includes a sensorimotor loop for controlling sensor position. Passive perception at a single depth gave poor results, with just 0.2mm uncertainty impairing performance. Extending passive perception over a range of depths gave non-robust performance. Only active perception could give robust, accurate performance, with the sensorimotor feedback compensating the position uncertainty. We expect that these results will extend to other stimuli, so that active perception will offer a general approach to robust perception in unstructured environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper is authored to describe a control framework that is designated for realizing cyclic, actively-compliant and dynamically-balanced jumping and trotting quadruped locomotion over rough terrain. In order to succeed in exhibiting such locomotion abilities, two controllers are synthesized: i) Active Compliance Control via force feedback, ii) Angular Momentum Control via gyro sensing. The first controller computes the joint displacements that are associated with ground reaction force errors, using Jacobian transpose and admittance blocks. Together with position constraints, these joint displacements are simultaneously fed-back to local servo controllers; allowing the robot to perform the given locomotion task in an actively-compliant manner. The second controller, in the meantime, evaluates gyro sensor information to calculate the required compensation torque about center of mass, which is necessary to regulate upper torso rotational motion. Afterwards, it updates the orientation input in accordance with this compensation torque. Using the proposed framework, the overall control performance is tested via cyclic jumping and trotting motion experiments, conducted over rough terrain with a stiff-by-nature quadruped robot. Results turn out to be positive; the robot demonstrates successful jumping and trotting cycles in a repetitive, actively-compliant and dynamically-balanced fashion.",

In previous work, a formation control law, accurate despite typical off-road conditions (low grip, terrain irregularities, etc), based on a nonlinear observer-based adaptive control has been presented. Satisfactory advanced results have been reported in lateral servoing but inaccuracies in longitudinal regulation have been noticed. In this paper a new predictive approach dedicated to both longitudinal and lateral servoing is proposed. We consider mobile robots made of a single body accounting for bad grip conditions thanks to an observer based approach. After presenting the modelling of the formation and the control law use to maintain longitudinal and lateral deviations with respect to the reference trajectory, we introduce the predictive approach on velocity. Full-scale experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",

The methodology aims at controlling a family of quadrotor micro air vehicle with a common set of sensors and processing hardware but with various sizes, configurations, payloads and propeller types. The parameter estimation is based on the Recursive Least Square algorithm which feeds the estimates to a linear parameter varying controller. The synthesis of the controller relies on structured H\u221e algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.",

        "abstract": "Central pattern generators (CPGs) play a crucial role for animal locomotion control. They can be entrained by sensory feedback to induce proper rhythmic patterns and even store the entrained patterns through connection weights. Inspired by this biological finding, we use four adaptive neural oscillators with synaptic plasticity as CPGs for locomotion control of our real snake-like robot with screw-drive mechanism. Each oscillator consists of only three neurons and uses adaptive mechanisms based on frequency adaptation and Hebbian-type learning rules. It autonomously generates proper periodic patterns for the robot locomotion and can be entrained by sensory feedback to memorize the patterns. The adaptive CPG system in conjunction with a simple control strategy enables the robot to perform self-tuning behavior which is robust against short-time perturbations. The generated behavior is also energy efficient. In addition, the robot can also cope with corners as well as move through a complex environment with obstacles.",

Here a remote sensor or explorer agent throttles its sampling rate in order to track anomalous events while obeying constraints on time and power. This problem is challenging because the agent has limited visibility - all collected datapoints lie in the past, but its resource allocation decisions require predicting far into the future. Our solution is to continually fit a Gaussian process model to the latest data and optimize the sampling plan on line to maximize information gain. We compare the performance characteristics of stationary and nonstationary Gaussian process models. We also describe an application based on geologic analysis during planetary rover exploration. Here adaptive sampling can improve coverage of localized anomalies and potentially benefit mission science yield of long autonomous traverses.",

Two classifiers, LaRank and Online Random Ferns, are adopted to realize this tracking algorithm. The former one maintains the adaptive tracking using a Condensation-based method with an online support vector machine (SVM) as observation model, which also provides the reliable image patch samples to detector for updating. The other one is in charge of the task of detection in order to redetect the object when the target drifts. We also present a refinement strategy to improve the tracker's performance by discarding the support vector corresponding to possible wrong updates by a matching template after re-initialization. The experiments on benchmark dataset compare our tracking method with several other state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating a promising performance of the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Robust navigation for mobile robots requires an accurate method for tracking the robot position in the environment. This paper presents a simple and novel visual-inertial integration system suitable for unstructured and unprepared indoor environments, where MARG (Magnet, Angular Rate and Gravity) sensors and a monocular camera are used. The pre-estimated orientation from MARG sensors, is used to estimate the translation based on the data from the visual and inertial sensors. This has a significant effect on the performance of the fusion sensing strategy and makes the fusion procedure much easier, because the gravitational acceleration can be correctly removed from the accelerometer measurements before the fusion procedure, where a linear Kalman Filter is selected as the fusion estimator. the use of pre-estimated orientation can help to eliminate erroneous point matches based on the properties of the pure camera translation and thus the computational requirements can be significantly reduced compared to the RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm. In addition, an adaptive-frame-rate single camera is selected to not only avoid motion blur based on the angular velocity and acceleration after compensation but also to make an effect called visual zero-velocity update for the static motion. Thus, it can recover a more accurate baseline and meanwhile reduce the computational requirements. In particular, an absolute scale factor, which is usually lost in monocular camera tracking, can be obtained by introducing it into the estimator. Simulation and experimental results are presented for different environments with different types of movement and the results from a Pioneer robot are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method.",

The distinctive merit of the proposed interface is exhibited in its ability to operate in three independent modes. In the drive mode, the motor torque is directed to drive the host module. In the neutral mode, the motor torque aligns the coupling elements prior to docking. In the clamp mode, the motor torque actuates the revolute joint resulting from this docking process, thus allowing one module to revolve relative to its neighbors in the formation. In this paper, an optimality analysis of the unique kinematic properties of the dual-rod slider-rocker (DRSR) mechanism which enables this tri-state operation is presented. This analysis is supplemented by simulations and experimental results that validate these optimal kinematics, as well as the rigidity and the three operation modes of the docking interface.",

        "abstract": "Omnidirectional cameras are widely used for robotic applications in structured environments. However, because of the distorted field of view (FOV), it is hard to describe the primitive features extracted from them robustly. In this paper, we tackle the problem by using Histogram of Gradient (HoG) statistics for the regions of interest (ROI) in the neighborhood of major vertical lines extracted from the panoramic image. As a validation, we compare the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art based on two widely used data-sets, leading to evidently better performance. We also introduce a scene reconstruction scenario using the proposed descriptor based on 1D Trifocal Tensor framework. The comparative results show the competence of the descriptor.",

Specifically, we develop a simple method for establishing correspondences between a line-scan (2D) LIDAR and a camera using a small calibration target that only contains a straight line. Moreover, we formulate the nonlinear least-squares problem for finding the unknown 6 degree-of-freedom (dof) transformation between the two sensors, and solve it analytically to determine its global minimum. Additionally, we examine the conditions under which the unknown transformation becomes unobservable, which can be used for avoiding ill-conditioned configurations. Finally, we present extensive simulation and experimental results for assessing the performance of the proposed algorithm as compared to alternative analytical approaches.",

The approach-path independence is achieved by using highly viewpoint-invariant 3D junction features extracted from stereo pairs of images; these are based on stereo reconstructions of the JUDOCA junctions extracted from the individual images of a stereo pair. The speed in place-recognition and robot-localization is achieved by using a novel cylindrical data structure - we refer to it as the Feature Cylinder - for representing either all of the 3D junction features found in a hallway system during the learning phase of the robot or a set of locale signatures derived from the data. For the case when all data is placed on the Feature Cylinder, we can use the 3D-POLY polynomial-time in a hypothesize-and-verify approach to place recognition. On the other hand, in the locale signature based approach, we can use the same data structure for constant-time place recognition.",

An important application of this algorithm in robotics is the computation of the minimum distance between two objects, which can be performed by taking A as the Minkowski difference of the objects and Q as a set containing the origin in its interior. In this generalized definition, the traditional Euclidean distance is a special case where Q is the unit ball. While this distance measure was proposed almost a decade ago, there has been no efficient algorithm to compute it in general cases. Our algorithm fills this void and we demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to approaches based on general-purpose optimization.",

The general design principles of this innovative kind of underwater robot are illustrated and a first prototype is built and tested. The experiments demonstrate an inverse correlation between the frequency of pulsation and the speed of the robot. A mathematical model which associates the kinematics of the pulsating routine to the dynamics of the swimming is devised and compared with the experiments in order to better investigate the interplay of the various design parameters.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes the design of electromyography (EMG)-based force feedback controller which explicitly considers human-robot interaction for the exoskeletal assistive robot. Conventional approaches have been only consider one-directional mapping from EMG to control input for assistive robot control. However, EMG and force generated by the assistive robot interfere each other, e.g., amplitude of EMG decreases if limb movements are assisted by the robot. In our proposed method, we first derive the nonlinear mapping from EMG signal to muscle force for estimating human joint torque, and convert it to assistive force using human musculoskeletal model and robot kinematic model. Additionally the feedforward interaction torque is feedback into torque controller to acquire the necessity loads. To validate the feasibility of the proposed method, assistive One-DOF system was developed as the real equipment and the simulator. We compared the proposed method with conventional approaches using both the simulated and the real One-DOF systems. As the result, we found that the proposed model was able to estimate the necessary torque adequately to achieve stable human-robot interaction.",

However, prior work did not rigorously consider the role of screw geometry and tissue material properties on the resulting trajectory. This study seeks to develop a plausible empirical model from experimental measurements in an agar gel tissue phantom for use in further research and feasibility studies of magnetic screws for in vivo applications. Non-dimensional parameters representing rotation speed, pitch angle, screw size, magnetic strength, and tissue stiffness are varied orthogonally. Circular trajectories are fitted to the resulting recorded trajectories. Using physical insight and observation of the trends of the non-dimensional turning radius/curvature, simple models for each parameter group are proposed. A final empirical model is then proposed to unify the individual models.",

This has severely limited exploration within and across intervention strategies. We have developed a laboratory testbed suitable for emulating and rapidly assessing wearable robot designs. The testbed is comprised of powerful off-board motor and control hardware, a flexible tether, and lightweight instrumented end-effectors worn by a person. We performed a series of benchtop tests to gauge mechatronic performance, and found significant improvements over prior candidate testbed platforms. In particular, this system has an unusual combination of low worn mass (less than 1 kg), high closed-loop torque bandwidth (17 Hz), and high peak torque (175 N\u00b7m), key to emulating specialized devices. We also performed walking trials to gauge dynamic torque control and versatility. Walking trials with a prosthesis end-effector demonstrated precise torque tracking (4 N\u00b7m RMS error), both in time and joint-angle space, and versatile mechanical behavior through systematic changes in high-level control law parameters. For example, we widely varied net ankle work (from \u22123 J to 9 J per step) using an impedance law relating joint angle and velocity to desired torque. These results suggest such testbeds could be used to emulate and evaluate novel assistive robot concepts prior to laborious product design.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots are artifacts that comprise a significant number of heterogeneous hardware and software components and interact with dynamic environments. Therefore, there is always a chance of faults at run-time that negatively affect the reliability of the system. In this paper we present a novel diagnosis and repair architecture for ROS-based robot systems. It is an extension to the existing ROS diagnostics stack and follows a model-based diagnosis and repair approach. In the paper we discuss the integrated diagnosis and repair architecture in detail. Moreover, we show its application to an example robot system and report first experimental results. The presented work provides three major contributions: a combination of diagnosis and repair, the integration of hardware and software, and the integration into ROS.",

        "abstract": "Recent efforts in mission planning for underwater vehicles have utilised predictive models to aid in navigation, optimal path planning and drive opportunistic sampling. Although these models provide information at a unprecedented resolutions and have proven to increase accuracy and effectiveness in multiple campaigns, most are deterministic in nature. Thus, predictions cannot be incorporated into probabilistic planning frameworks, nor do they provide any metric on the variance or confidence of the output variables. In this paper, we provide an initial investigation into determining the confidence of ocean model predictions based on the results of multiple field deployments of two autonomous underwater vehicles. For multiple missions of two autonomous gliders conducted over a two-month period in 2011, we compare actual vehicle executions to simulations of the same missions through the Regional Ocean Modeling System in an ocean region off the coast of southern California. This comparison provides a qualitative analysis of the current velocity predictions for areas within the selected deployment region. Ultimately, we present a spatial heat-map of the correlation between the ocean model predictions and the actual mission executions. Knowing where the model provides unreliable predictions can be incorporated into planners to increase the utility and application of the deterministic estimations.",

        "abstract": "An Omnimagnet is an omnidirectional electromagnet comprised of a ferromagnetic core inside of three orthogonal nested solenoids. It generates a magnetic dipole-field with both a variable dipole-moment magnitude and orientation with no moving parts. The design of an Omnimagnet, in which each solenoid has the same dipole moment and minimizes the differences between each of the solenoid's fields, is provided and optimized for strength by tailoring the size of the spherical core used to amplify the solenoids' field. This design is then analyzed using FEA tools and shown to be dipole-like in nature. Various magnetic control methods are then motivated by providing the necessary equations relating the three applied currents to applied field, torque, or force on an adjacent magnetic device. Finally, the optimal design is constructed and its utility is demonstrated by driving a helical capsule endoscope mockup through a transparent lumen.",

We present an open source and open hardware design 1 of an optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity. Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and shown in-flight on a micro air vehicle.",

However one of the technical difficulties of implementing the flexible manipulator is to measure the bending curvature. This paper proposes the design of a novel optical sensor for measuring the bending curvature of a flexible manipulator based on light intensity modulation. The sensor is low cost and is temperature independent. A theoretical model of using the sensor design to deduce the curvature of a flexible robot has been created. Implementing the proposed theoretical model, the developed sensor has been used to measure the bend of a section of a flexible segment. Validation tests have been carried out; the results demonstrate that the developed sensor has good accuracy in measuring the bending angles, the orientation of the bending and the bending radius.",

The LED and the PD are fixed on one of the two links that compose the robotic joint, while the canal is integrated into the other link. The paper reports the basic sensor working principle, the integrated design of the miniaturized robotic joint with embedded position sensor and the experimental evaluation of the proposed device on a force/position control loop.

        "abstract": "Robotic gait training has been introduced recently in rehabilitation, and the related researches have been conducted to propose more effective mechanism and control. To automate gait training, position control with reference trajectory has been adopted in many researches. However, there remain problems such as enhancing self-dominated gait or adapting to asymmetry or individual difference to apply robotic gait training to moderately affected hemiplegia patient. To solve this problem, we quantified the manual pelvic assistance (handling) provided by physical therapy, which can enhance patient's self dominated gait individually. In this paper, the physical model of handling was proposed based on the measurement and verified by multiple regression analysis.",

        "abstract": "Robots are meanwhile able to perform several tasks. But what happens, if one or multiple of the robot's joints fail? Is the robot still able to perform the required tasks? Which capabilities of the robot get limited and which ones are lost? We propose an analysis of manipulator structures for the comparison of a robot's capabilities with respect to efficient control. The comparison is processed (1) within a robot in the case of joint failures and (2) between robots with or without joint failures. It is important, that the analysis can be processed independently of the structure of the manipulator. The results have to be comparable between different manipulator structures. Therefore, an abstract representation of the robot's dynamic capabilities is necessary. We introduce the Maneuverability Volume and the Spinning Pencil for this purpose. The Maneuverability Volume shows, how efficiently the end-effector can be moved to any other position. The Spinning Pencil reflects the robot's capability to change its end-effector orientation efficiently. Our experiments show not only the different capabilities of two manipulator structures, but also the change of the capabilities if one or multiple joints fail.",

We envision future industrial robot assistants that support workers in their tasks, advancing manufacturing quality and processes and increasing productivity. However, this requires new channels of fine-grained, fast and reliable communication. In this research we examined the communication required for human-robot collaboration in a vehicle door assembly scenario. We identified potential communicative gestures applicable to this scenario, implemented these gestures on a Barrett WAMTM1 manipulator, and evaluated them in terms of human recognition rate and response time in a real-time interaction. Response time analysis reveals insights into the communicative structure of robot motions; namely, key short gesture segments include the bulk of the communicative information. These results will help us design more efficient and fluid task flow in human-robot interaction scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Particle filtering (PF) is a popular nonlinear estimation technique and has been widely used in a variety of applications such as target tracking. Within the PF framework, one critical design choice that greatly affects the filter's performance is the selection of the proposal distribution from which particles are drawn. In this paper, we advocate the proposal distribution to be a Gaussian-mixture-based approximation of the posterior probability density function (pdf) after taking into account the most recent measurement. The novelty of our approach is that each Gaussian in the mixture is determined analytically to match the modes of the underlying unknown posterior pdf. As a result, particles are sampled along the most probable regions of the state space, hence reducing the probability of particle depletion. We adapt this proposal distribution into a new PF, termed Analytically-Guided-Sampling (AGS)-PF, and apply it to the particular problem of range-only target tracking. Both Monte-Carlo simulation and real-world experimental results validate the superior performance of the proposed AGS-PF over other state-of-the-art PF algorithms.",

We present the design by dynamic similarity technique and the locomotion adaptations which have allowed for this highly dynamic performance. In addition, we demonstrate that rotational dynamics become critical for stability as the scale of a robotic system is reduced. We present a new method of experimental dynamic tuning for legged millirobots, aimed at finding stable limit cycles with minimal rotational energy. By implementing an aerodynamic rotational damper, we further reduced the rotational energy in the system, and demonstrated that stable limit cycles with lower rotational energy are more robust to disturbances. This method increased the stability of the system without detracting from forward speed.",

Our objective is to determine the feasibility of using the anklebot as a gait training tool by increasing the contribution of the paretic ankle in walking function. Underlying our training approach is a novel gait event-triggered, sub-task control algorithm that enables precise timing of robotic assistance to key functional deficits of hemiparetic gait, as well as sagittal-plane biomechanical models capable of predicting necessary levels of robotic support specific to the nature and severity of deficits. These features may facilitate customizability of assisted walking to individual gait deficit profiles. As with our previous studies, we employ an adaptive approach in that, training parameters are incrementally progressed towards those of more normal gait depending on subject performance and tolerance. Here, we present and validate the sub-event detection and sub-task control method, the biomechanical models for the swing and landing phases of gait, and as proof-of-concept, pilot data to demonstrate initial efficacy of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Robots operating in real world environments need to find motion plans quickly. Robot motion should also be efficient and, when operating among people, predictable. Minimizing a cost function, e.g. path length, can produce short, reasonable paths. Anytime planners are ideal for this since they find an initial solution quickly and then improve solution quality as time permits. In previous work, we introduced the concept of Experience Graphs, which allow search-based planners to find paths with bounded sub-optimality quickly by reusing parts of previous paths where relevant. Here we extend planning with Experience Graphs to work in an anytime fashion so a first solution is found quickly using prior experience. As time allows, the dependence on this experience is reduced in order to produce closer to optimal solutions. We also demonstrate how Experience Graphs provide a new way of approaching incremental planning as they naturally reuse information when the environment, the starting configuration of the robot or the goal configuration change. Experimentally, we demonstrate the anytime and incremental properties of our algorithm on mobile manipulation tasks in both simulation and on a real PR2 robot.",

        "abstract": "Recent work in sampling-based motion planning has yielded several different approaches for computing good quality paths in high degree of freedom systems: path shortcutting methods that attempt to shorten a single solution path by connecting non-consecutive configurations, a path hybridization technique that combines portions of two or more solutions to form a shorter path, and asymptotically optimal algorithms that converge to the shortest path over time. This paper presents an extensible meta-algorithm that incorporates a traditional sampling-based planning algorithm with offline path shortening techniques to form an anytime algorithm which exhibits competitive solution lengths to the best known methods and optimizers. A series of experiments involving rigid motion and complex manipulation are performed as well as a comparison with asymptotically optimal methods which show the efficacy of the proposed scheme, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.",

        "abstract": "The spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model is commonly used to describe the dynamics of hopping robots. Based on this model, the control of hopping robots has been widely investigated. A fundamental limitation of the model is that it fails to account for impact with the ground, and this is due to its single degree-of-freedom in the vertical direction. A more accurate representation of the hopping robot is proposed using a two mass model and inelastic impact with the ground. A control scheme is developed to converge the maximum jumping height of the robot to a desired value. The control scheme utilizes feedback linearization in continuous time and updates a control parameter in discrete time to achieve the control objective. Simulation results are presented to show the efficacy of the control scheme.",

This paper presents a robust control scheme that is designed to meet the challenges encountered by such robots, i.e., discrete actuator inputs, complex system modeling and cross-coupling between actuators. In the proposed scheme, a desired vectorial system output, such as a position or a force, is commanded by recruiting actuators based on their influence vectors on the output. No analytical model of the system is needed, influence vectors are identified experimentally by sequentially activating each actuators. Experimental results on a four-degrees-of-freedom binary manipulator with twenty actuators confirm the method effectiveness, for position and motion control, and its ability to tolerate massive perturbations and up to 50% actuator failures.",

        "abstract": "Localization and modeling of stairways by mobile robots can enable multi-floor exploration for those platforms capable of stair traversal. Existing approaches focus on either stairway detection or traversal, but do not address these problems in the context of path planning for the autonomous exploration of multi-floor buildings. We propose a system for detecting and modeling ascending stairways while performing simultaneous localization and mapping, such that the traversability of each stairway can be assessed by estimating its physical properties. The long-term objective of our approach is to enable exploration of multiple floors of a building by allowing stairways to be considered during path planning as traversable portals to new frontiers. We design a generative model of a stairway as a single object. We localize these models with respect to the map, and estimate the dimensions of the stairway as a whole, as well as its steps. With these estimates, a robot can determine if the stairway is traversable based on its climbing capabilities. Our system consists of two parts: a computationally efficient detector that leverages geometric cues from dense depth imagery to detect sets of ascending stairs, and a stairway modeler that uses multiple detections to infer the location and parameters of a stairway that is discovered during exploration. We demonstrate the performance of this system when deployed on several mobile platforms using a Microsoft Kinect sensor.",

We develop a model for a detailed understanding of the relationship between robot velocity and applied force, and apply this to the measurement of binding forces between antibody-coated beads and protein-coated glass slides. We also verify binding between specific antibody/protein combinations relative to untargeted control combinations, and we measure the rate at which this binding occurs. This offers a truly novel technique for measuring binding forces between proteins.",

        "abstract": "Facilitating efficient programming-by-demonstration methods for advanced robot systems is an ongoing research challenge. This paper addresses one important challenge in this area, which is the programming of kinematically redundant robots. We argue that standard programming-by-demonstration methods for teaching task-space trajectories on a redundant robot using physical human-robot interaction are too complex for non-expert human tutors. We therefore introduce a new interaction and control concept for redundant robot systems, Assisted Gravity Compensation, based on a hierarchical control scheme, separating task-space programming from the redundancy resolution. The user is actively assisted by a given redundancy resolution while kinesthetically teaching task-space trajectories. This control scheme is implemented on our experimental robot system called FlexIRob and we briefly present results of a kinesthetic teaching experiment obtained in a larger field study on physical Human-Robot Interaction with 48 industrial workers. These results show, that the Assisted Gravity Compensation reduces the complexity of a kinesthetic teaching task, which is revealed by an improved task performance, making kinesthetic teaching an efficient programming-by-demonstration method for redundant robots.",

        "abstract": "Lack of haptic feedback in teleoperated robot-assisted surgery (RAS) is known to be detrimental in many surgical tasks. While performing a class of force sensitive tasks, surgeons commonly use both hands. Oftentimes, one hand is used to exert tension/compression forces, and the other to hold the suture knot or tissue. A novel control framework to accomplish haptic force feedback for two-handed tasks in teleoperated RAS is presented in this paper. The force applied on the surgical environment by the action hand is not transferred back to the same hand, but rather to the other hand. In two-handed tasks that involve an action and a reaction force, this provides an intuitive way of feeling the action. Because the loop in not closed from the slave back to the master of the same hand, it does not have a destabilizing effect. The technique can be easily implemented using a variable-structure controller that combines two PD controllers and a switch. It has been evaluated with an experimental setup consisting of four haptic devices with promising results.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new inspection planning algorithm, called Random Inspection Tree Algorithm (RITA). Given a perfect model of a structure, sensor specifications, robot's dynamics, and an initial configuration of a robot, RITA computes the optimal inspection trajectory that observes all points on the structure. Many inspection planning algorithms have been proposed, most of them consist of two sequential steps. In the first step, they compute a small set of observation points such that each point on the structure is visible. In the second step, they compute the shortest trajectory to visit all observation points at least once. The robot's kinematic and dynamic constraints are taken into account only in the second step. Thus, when the robot has differential constraints and operates in cluttered environments, the observation points may be difficult or even infeasible to reach. To alleviate this difficulty, RITA computes both observation points and the trajectory to visit the observation points simultaneously. RITA uses sampling-based techniques to find admissible trajectories with decreasing cost. Simulation results for 2-D environments are promising. Furthermore, we present analysis on the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.",

The controller guarantees asymptotic convergence of the satellite attitude and angular velocity to their desired values in presence of delay. Finally, a simulation example is presented that illustrates performance of the proposed controller in presence of delayed attitude measurement.",

        "abstract": "Over the last years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in detection and 3D pose estimation of known and unknown objects. However, the question of how to identify objects based on language descriptions has not been investigated in detail. While the computer vision community recently started to investigate the use of attributes for object recognition, these approaches do not consider the task settings typically observed in robotics, where a combination of appearance attributes and object names might be used in referral language to identify specific objects in a scene. In this paper, we introduce an approach for identifying objects based on natural language containing appearance and name attributes. To learn rich RGB-D features needed for attribute classification, we extend recently introduced sparse coding techniques so as to automatically learn attribute-dependent features. We introduce a large data set of attribute descriptions of objects in the RGB-D object dataset. Experiments on this data set demonstrate the strong performance of our approach to language based object identification. We also show that our attribute-dependent features provide significantly better generalization to previously unseen attribute values, thereby enabling more rapid learning of new attribute values.",

In this context it is important to go beyond the 2D laser scanner for open doorway detection, for both safety reasons as well as opportunities for improved shared-control behavior development. We evaluate the doorway detection by systematically testing the performance on several doors and door configurations from varied view points, using point clouds generated by a Microsoft Kinect.",

Some cells are highly sensitive to direct laser exposure, which may influence their behavior or even cause photodamage. In addition, manual manipulation of cells is time consuming making it hard to carry out systematic studies that are properly timed to exhibit the desired motility. This paper presents an automated planning approach for precise, collision-free, indirect manipulation of cells with irregular, dynamically changing shapes using Optical Tweezers (OT). We have evaluated the effectiveness of our manipulation approach using physical experiments.

In this paper, we present a robotically controlled laser-induced cell fusion approach based on the microwell array, which exhibits advantages of high selectivity and controllability. Optical tweezers and optical scissors are employed to achieve cell pairing and fusion, respectively. The specific cells are characterized and preselected with an on-chip isolation method prior to pairing. The paired cells are then transported, deposited, fused, and released at a predefined location with high spatiotemporal resolution. Experiments of fusion on individual pairs of human embryonic stem cells are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed cell fusion tool.",

        "abstract": "Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a problem class with significant applicability to robotics when considering the uncertainty present in the real world, however, they quickly become intractable for large state and action spaces. A method to create a less complex but accurate action model approximation is proposed and evaluated using a state-of-the-art POMDP solver. We apply this general and powerful formulation to a robotic navigation task under state and sensing uncertainty. Results show that this method can provide a useful action model that yields a policy with similar overall expected reward compared to the true action model, often with significant computational savings. In some cases, our reduced complexity model can solve problems where the true model is too complex to find a policy that accomplishes the task. We conclude that this technique of building problem-dependent approximations can provide significant computational advantages and can help expand the complexity of problems that can be considered using current POMDP techniques.",

The semiconductor industry employs this capability to probe sub-micrometer-sized features to evaluate the performance of integrated circuits (IC) for design/quality monitoring. In electron microscopy imaging, the use of low accelerating voltages and high magnifications, as required for IC nanoprobing tasks, results in significant image noise and drift. This paper presents automated nanoprobing with a nanomanipulation system inside a standard scanning electron microscope (SEM). We achieved SEM image denoising and drift compensation in real time. This capability is necessary for achieving robust visual tracking and servo control of nanoprobes for probing nanostructures in automated operation. This capability also proves highly useful to conventional manual operation by rendering real-time SEM images that have little noise and drift. The automated system probed nanostructures on an SEM metrology chip as surrogates of electronic features on IC chips. Success rates in visual tracking and Z-contact detection under various imaging conditions were quantitatively discussed. The experimental results demonstrate the system's capability for automated probing of nanostructures under IC-chip-probing relevant EM imaging conditions.",

        "abstract": "Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheters enable high-quality ultrasound imaging within the heart, but their use in guiding procedures is limited due to the difficulty of manually pointing them at structures of interest. This paper presents the design and testing of a catheter steering model for robotic control of commercial ICE catheters. The four actuated degrees of freedom (4-DOF) are two catheter handle knobs to produce bi-directional bending in combination with rotation and translation of the handle. An extra degree of freedom in the system allows the imaging plane (dependent on orientation) to be directed at an object of interest. A closed form solution for forward and inverse kinematics enables control of the catheter tip position and the imaging plane orientation. The proposed algorithms were validated with a robotic test bed using electromagnetic sensor tracking of the catheter tip. The ability to automatically acquire imaging targets in the heart may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of intracardiac catheter interventions by allowing visualization of soft tissue structures that are not visible using standard fluoroscopic guidance. Although the system has been developed and tested for manipulating ICE catheters, the methods described here are applicable to any long thin tendon-driven tool (with single or bi-directional bending) requiring accurate tip position and orientation control.",

A two-fingered microhand system, that has been developed as a micro manipulator, can perform dexterous cell manipulation such as grasping, rotating, and transferring using two end effectors in a chopstick-like motion. The automated manipulation uses processing results based on all-in-focus (AIF) images and depth map obtained from the vision system; however, errors in the results still reduce the efficiency of the system. In this study, we introduce an automated grasping system that corrects the image processing error using the reaction force from the target object during grasping maneuvers. In our improved microhand system, micro force sensors that comprises strain gauge are attached to the two fingers of microhand. The two fingers with micro force sensor are set to be able to measure the horizontal and vertical forces to detect grasping state, precisely. Using the sensor information and the image processing results, we demonstrate that this system improves the accuracy and success rate of automated grasping.",

        "abstract": "To assist nature observation, we develop an automatic bird species filtering method that takes videos from cameras with unknown parameters as input, and outputs likelihood of candidate species. The method recognizes the time series of salient extremities, which is the inter-wing tip distance, performs frequency analysis on periodicity, and provides a species prediction metric using likelihood ratios. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed method, we derive the probability that the salient extremity can be recognized in image for an arbitrary camera perspective.We also prove that the periodicity of the IWTD in the image is the same as the wingbeat frequency in the 3D space regardless of camera parameters with the exception of ignorable degenerated cases. Experiment results validate our analysis and show that the algorithm is very robust to segmentation error and data loss up to 30%.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of filtering whilst maintaining as little information as possible to perform a given task. The literature includes several illustrations of how adroit choices for state descriptions may lead to concise -or even minimal- filters tailored to specific tasks. We introduce an efficient algorithm which is able to reproduce these handcrafted solutions. Specifically, our algorithm accepts as input an arbitrary combinatorial filter, expressed as a transition graph, and outputs an equivalent filter that uses fewer information states to complete the same filtering task. We also show that solving this problem optimally is NP-hard, and that the related decision problem is NP-complete. These hardness results justify the potentially sub-optimal output of our algorithm. In the experiments we describe, our algorithm produces optimal or near-optimal reduced filters for a variety of problem instances. These reduced filters are of interest for several reasons, including their direct application on platforms with severely limited computational power and in systems that require communication over low-bandwidth noisy channels. Moreover, inspection of reduced filters may provide insights into the structure of a problem that can guide the design of the other elements of a robot system.",

In substitution for \u201ctying\u201d process by thread on tie-dyeing, this paper proposes usage of elastic cap with different thickness at the both ends. A cloth is pushed into the cap by a needle of 1 mm diameter attached on the robot hand. It was confirmed that the cloth was tightened at the both ends of the elastic cap and the effect of the tie-dyeing was valid. The usage of the elastic plastic cap realizes the tie-dyeing pattern similar to the conventional method using thread. Moreover, these elastic caps are reusable. To improve the work efficiency, a cap cartridge and a sub robot attached on the robot hand were examined. The high efficiency of the work was achieved and an increase in the speed of robot was also effective. In regard to polyester cloth, its elasticity increases with projections that are created when the wet heat treatment is applied with the caps on. In this case, the stretch properties are also effective.",

Cleaning office buildings on a daily basis is a problem that could be partially automatized with a cleaning robot that assists the cleaning professional yielding a higher cleaning capacity. A typical task in this domain is the selective cleaning, that is a focused cleaning effort to dirty spots, which speeds up the overall cleaning procedure significantly. To enable a robotic cleaner to accomplish this task, it is first necessary to distinguish dirty areas from the clean remainder. This paper discusses a vision-based dirt detection system for mobile cleaning robots that can be applied to any surface and dirt without previous training, that is fast enough to be executed on a mobile robot and which achieves high dirt recognition rates of 90% at an acceptable false positive rate of 45%. The paper also introduces a large database of real scenes which was used for the evaluation and is publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Maturing technology has allowed the reliable deployment of robots into large-scale environments for monitoring and exploration applications. Planning techniques which ignore the value of information gathered during transit are able to operate efficiently in these environments and generate trajectories between specified starting and ending locations. Including the value of information gathered during transit increases the complexity of the problem and often leads to algorithms which are unable to scale up to large environments. This paper presents a method for planning informative surveys in large-scale unexplored environments. The proposed methodology does not require a starting or ending location as a constraint. Instead, robot operators are required to specify a survey template, which satisfies both vehicle constraints and the scientific objectives of the deployment. This constraint converts the exploration problem into an experimental design problem where the objective is to choose a location for the specified survey trajectory. A functional representation of the survey utility is learnt using a Gaussian process. This model allows the utility of candidate survey placements to be queried in a continuous space and in arbitrary locations. The proposed exploration method is demonstrated and validated on marine data. The objective is to design a survey which allows the spatial distribution of habitats in a large marine environment to be estimated accurately. The results show that the proposed exploration method is able to model the hidden survey utility function successfully and recommend informative survey placements.",

The planner takes into account the predicted trajectory of the human and searches future trajectories of the robot for the path with the highest utility. Contrary to traditional motion planning, instead of determining goal points close to the person, we introduce a task dependent goal function which provides a map of desirable areas for the robot to be at, with respect to the person. The planning framework is flexible and allows encoding of different social situations with the help of the goal function. We implemented our approach on a telepresence robot and conducted a controlled user study to evaluate the experiences of the users on the remote end of the telepresence robot. The user study compares manual teleoperation to our autonomous method for following a person while having a conversation. By designing a behavior specific to a flat screen telepresence robot, we show that the person following behavior is perceived as safe and socially acceptable by remote users. All 10 participants preferred our autonomous following method over manual teleoperation.",

        "abstract": "The ability to follow or move alongside a person is a necessary skill for an autonomous mobile agent that works with human users. To accomplish the task, the robot must be able to track and follow the person it is accompanying while maneuvering through obstacles without collision. Also, the robot must be able to respect user preferences and exhibit behaviors that are intuitive and socially acceptable. That is, the robot is required to make complex decisions on-line, in environments that are almost always dynamic and uncertain in the presence of pedestrians. This paper discusses a versatile motion planning algorithm for person pacing, which refers to the capability to walk next to another person at user-preferred distance and orientation [1]. The algorithm is based on the Model Predictive Equilibrium Point Control (MPEPC) framework [2] which allows a robot to navigate gracefully in dynamic, uncertain, and structured environments. We show that with a simple task description for person pacing, an agent with the MPEPC navigation algorithm can make intelligent decisions on-line, maximizing the expected progress toward achieving the task while minimizing the action cost and the probability of collision. We present navigation examples generated from real data traces, where a wheelchair robot exhibits very reasonable behaviors across a wide range of situations.",

        "abstract": "Localizing tumors and measuring tissue mechanical properties can be useful for surgical planning and evaluating progression of disease. In this paper, supervised machine learning algorithms enable mechanical localization of stiff inclusions in artificial tissue after autonomous robotic palpation. Elastography is used to generate training data for the learning algorithms, providing a non-invasive, inclusion-specific characterization of tissue biomechanics. In particular, elastography was used to characterize the stiffness of artificial tissue with an embedded hard inclusion. Once the inclusion was identified on the elastographic image, machine learning methods identified the difference in stiffness between the inclusion and surrounding soft tissue and generated classifiers, which were used to label stiffness values as either part of the inclusion or soft tissue. Next, data acquired via autonomous robotic palpation of the artificial tissue created a map of the stiffness distributed over the surface of the tissue. The points in this map were thresholded against the classifiers trained by the machine learning algorithms, and points theorized to belong to the hard inclusion were labeled. Centroid approximations of the hard inclusion based on this labeling show that classifying stiffness data acquired by autonomous robotic palpation and labeled by a classifier trained from elastography data provides a more accurate method of localizing hard inclusions than using unclassified data.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous valve turning is an extremely challenging task for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). To resolve this challenge, this paper proposes a set of different computational techniques integrated in a three-layer hierarchical scheme. Each layer realizes specific subtasks to improve the persistent autonomy of the system. In the first layer, the robot acquires the motor skills of approaching and grasping the valve by kinesthetic teaching. A Reactive Fuzzy Decision Maker (RFDM) is devised in the second layer which reacts to the relative movement between the valve and the AUV, and alters the robot's movement accordingly. Apprenticeship learning method, implemented in the third layer, performs tuning of the RFDM based on expert knowledge. Although the long-term goal is to perform the valve turning task on a real AUV, as a first step the proposed approach is tested in a laboratory environment.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we explore the use of nondeterministic search trajectories to accomplish a two-fold mission of mobile robot search for a stationary target while avoiding counter-targeting by the adversary throughout the operation. We analyze the characteristics associated with a Levy distribution of search leg lengths to generate appropriate randomized search trajectories. We discuss the alteration of the probability distribution of the Levy search as a result of the method utilized to best address the presence of the bounded search area and confine the searcher within its boundaries. Through regression analysis of simulation results, we determine expressions for the coverage ratio evolution of the modified Levy search strategy and the distribution on time to target detection TD, from which we are able to calculate the expected time, E[TD], to detect the target uniformly distributed within the search area. We assert assumptions regarding the adversary's detection and tracking abilities to estimate the expected time, E[TC], required for it to counter target the searcher. From these two expected times, we construct a novel probabilistic mission performance metric that measures the likelihood that the searcher will detect the target before it is counter targeted itself.",

In this work, we design and validate a new approach that takes explicitly into account obstacle velocities, to achieve safe visual navigation in outdoor scenarios. A wheeled vehicle, equipped with an actuated pinhole camera and with a lidar, must follow a path represented by key images, without colliding with the obstacles. To estimate the obstacle velocities, we design a Kalman-based observer. Then, we adapt the tentacles designed in [1], to take into account the predicted obstacle positions. Finally, we validate our approach in a series of simulated and real experiments, showing that when the obstacle velocities are considered, the robot behaviour is safer, smoother, and faster than when it is not.",

        "abstract": "In this research we present a non-invasive Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) system that allows patients with motor paralysis conditions to control electronic appliances in a hospital room. The novelty of our system compared to other BMI applications is that our system gradually becomes autonomous by learning user actions (i.e. turning on/off window, lights, etc.) under certain environment conditions (temperature, illumination, etc.) and brain states (i.e. awake, sleepy, etc.). By providing learning capabilities to the system, patients are relieved from mental fatigue or stress caused by continuously controlling appliances using a BMI. We present an interface that allows the user to select and control appliances using electromyogram signals (EMG) generated by muscle contractions such as eyebrow movement. Our learning approach consists in two steps: 1) monitoring user actions, input data from sensors distributed around the room, and Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from the user, and 2) using an extended version of the Bayes Point Machine approach trained with Expectation Propagation to approximate a posterior probability from previously observed user actions under a similar combination of brain states and environmental conditions. Experimental results with volunteers demonstrate that our system provides satisfactory user experience and achieves over 85% overall learning performance after only a few trials.",

A distributed leader-follower scheme allows the human operator to command the overall group motion. The group autonomously maintains the connectivity of the interaction graph by using a decentralized gradient descent approach applied to the Fiedler eigenvalue of a properly weighted Laplacian matrix. The degree of connectivity, and then the flexibility, of the interaction graph can be finely tuned by the human operator through an additional bilateral teleoperation channel. Passivity of the overall system is theoretically proven and extensive human/hardware in-the-loop simulations are presented to empirically validate the theoretical analysis.",

This scheme includes a novel force-feedback algorithm that enables the user to feel the texture of the environment. In addition, a novel mapping function is introduced to teleoperate the UAV in an unlimited workspace in position control mode with a joystick which has a limited workspace. An obstacle avoidance strategy is designed to autonomously modify the position set point of the UAV independently of the pilot's commands. The stability analysis of the whole teleoperation loop is provided. Experiments demonstrate the successful teleoperation of a UAV using an haptic joystick and a hexacopter UAV equipped with a 2D laser-range scanner.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that a musculoskeletal model with an anatomically-inspired abdomen model can estimate human-like abdominal muscle tension, in contrast to previous musculoskeletal models or models based on joint elasticity. We first model the abdominal structure based on anatomical knowledge. The anatomically-inspired abdomen model consists of a Tendinous Intersection model that connects the muscle bellies of Rectus Abdominis and represents its pathway, a Rectus Abdominis model that represents the muscle contraction part, and a balloon-type abdominal cavity model that represents the volumetric abdominal cavity. These models compute the intra-abdominal pressure and its effect on the lumbar vertebrae joint torques. We use these models with our musculoskeletal model to estimate the abdominal muscle tension during sitting up motion with optical motion capture, inverse kinematics, and inverse dynamics computation. Our computational results show that our abdomen model estimates the muscle tension with a waveform similar to the muscle activity measured by electromyography, while the previous musculoskeletal model and the joint elasticity model estimate obviously different muscle tension patterns. These results imply that the intra-abdominal pressure is critical in estimating the abdominal muscle tension rather than the inertial properties and the joint elasticity.",

        "abstract": "To address some of the challenges in modular micro-robotics, we present a new heat-activated bonding method for assembly. This bonding method quickly forms strong bonds through the use of thermoplastic or solder binding sites integrated into each module face, addressing problems of assembly strength and electrical conductivity. The strength of the bonds for each method are compared for different module styles, bonding conditions and breaking conditions in a destructive test. For 800\u00b5m modules, bond strengths of up to 500mN are observed with thermoplastic bonds, which indicates that the assemblies could be potentially used in high-force structural applications of programmable matter, microfluidic channels or healthcare. By magnetically functionalizing the modules using embedded magnetic particles, the modules are moved remotely for assembly using a magnetic coil system. In this way, a set of six modules are remotely assembled one-by-one into an arbitrary shape capable of locomotion to demonstrate the scalability and strength of the system.",

        "abstract": "Navigating and path planning in environments with limited a priori knowledge is a fundamental challenge for mobile robots. Robots operating in human-occupied environments must also respect sociocontextual boundaries such as personal workspaces. There is a need for robots to be able to navigate in such environments without having to explore and build an intricate representation of the world. In this paper, a method for supplementing directly observed environmental information with indirect observations of occupied space is presented. The proposed approach enables the online inclusion of novel human positional traces and environment information into a probabilistic framework for path planning. Encapsulation of sociocontextual information, such as identifying areas that people tend to use to move through the environment, is inherently achieved without supervised learning or labelling. Our method bootstraps navigation with indirectly observed sensor data, and leverages the flexibility of the Gaussian process (GP) for producing a navigational map that sampling based path planers such as Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) can effectively utilise. Empirical results on a mobile platform demonstrate that a robot can efficiently and socially-appropriately reach a desired goal by exploiting the navigational map in our Bayesian statistical framework.",

        "abstract": "Mechanical performance of a surgical robot can be evaluated and improved based on a working score; however, intuitive operability cannot be evaluated in this way. We propose a method that measures the user's brain activity for evaluating intuitive operability from the perspective of cognitive science. We hypothesized that hand-eye coordination, such as the slave configuration for the endoscope, has the greatest effect on intuitive operability, because it is the cause of physical differences between a human and a robot. The objective of this paper is to clarify the appropriate slave configuration for the endoscope to study hand-eye coordination using brain activity measurements. In the experiment, we used a brain imaging device, optical topography, to measure the users' brain activity while they controlled the hand-controller to position the tip of the virtual arm on the target. The experiment was carried out a number of times with the virtual arm position configured in a variety of ways. According to the results, some subjects showed peak performance with a specific slave configuration. We conclude that the slave configuration with the highest brain activity depends on the body image, which is a spatial symbol in the human brain from the perspective of cognitive science.",

Results show that the vehicle motion model in combination with in-vehicle sensors exhibit good accuracy in estimating planar vehicle motion.

Furthermore, the accuracy obtained from vision-only in direction estimation is not only maintained, but in fact further improved, primarily in situations where the matched visual features are few.",

        "abstract": "We present CELLO (Covariance Estimation and Learning through Likelihood Optimization), an algorithm for predicting the covariances of measurements based on any available informative features. This algorithm is intended to improve the accuracy and reliability of on-line state estimation by providing a principled way to extend the conventional fixed-covariance Gaussian measurement model. We show that in experiments, CELLO learns to predict measurement covariances that agree with empirical covariances obtained by manually annotating sensor regimes. We also show that using the learned covariances during filtering provides substantial quantitative improvement to the overall state estimate.",

        "abstract": "The incorporation of passive compliance in robotic systems could improve their performance during interactions and impacts, for energy storage and efficiency, and for general safety for both the robots and humans. This paper presents the recently developed COMpliant huMANoid COMAN. COMAN is actuated by passive compliance actuators based on the series elastic actuation principle (SEA). The design and implementation of the overall body of the robot is discussed including the realization of the different body segments and the tuning of the joint distributed passive elasticity. This joint stiffness tuning is a critical parameter in the performance of compliant systems. A novel systematic method to optimally tune the joint elasticity of multi-dof SEA robots based on resonance analysis and energy storage maximization criteria forms one of the key contributions of this work. The paper will show this method being applied to the selection of the passive elasticity of COMAN legs. The first completed robot prototype is presented accompanied by experimental walking trials to demonstrate its operation.",

The increase of positioning accuracy is a very important issue before making automatic assembly or other micro-tasks such as characterization. Thermal drift is one of the major sources of inaccuracy for automatic micromanipulation in ambient conditions and even in clean room. This paper addresses the calibration of a 1-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) nanopositioning cell including thermal drift compensation. The nanopositioning cell consists of a single-axis PZT stage and a XYZ manual stage which is usually used for fine positioning in microassembly platform. Subsequently, validations are implemented to test the performance by integrating the calibrated model. The experimental results show an effective improvement of the accuracy by a factor of 7 when temperature changes in the range of temperature for training, and 2.4 times improvement is achieved when temperature goes out of the training range.",

        "abstract": "Continuum robots have opened a broad array of applications to robotics in general, and the concentric tube continuum robots promise many benefits in medicine. Many people intuitively assume that these robots can deploy along a curved trajectory, in such a way that the curved shape of the robot's shaft remains unchanged as the tip progresses forward (i.e. \u201cfollow-the-leader\u201d deployment). This capability would be useful in advancing along winding lumens (e.g. blood vessels, lung bronchi, etc.), as well as when the device is embedded in soft tissue and used as a steerable needle. However, in this paper we show that deploying in a follow-the-leader manner is not possible except in very special cases of tube precurvatures, combined with specific deployment sequences. We also show that follow-the-leader deployment is not possible even for many of the \u201csimple\u201d cases where one might intuitively expect it to be. Fortunately, useful special cases of perfect follow-the-leader behavior do exist, and we provide examples and describe the conditions that must be satisfied for this to be possible. We also study approximate follow-the-leader behavior, proposing a metric to quantify the similarity of a general deployment to a follow-the-leader deployment.",

Using a musculoskeletal planar arm model with muscle and joint redundancies, we show that synergies identified by CCA give more natural and tractable activation patterns in virtual controller space with lower dimensionality when the arm performs reaching and a 3D pole balancing movement tasks.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-thin dies are difficult to package because of their fragility and flexibility. Current ultra-thin die integration technology for 3D microsystems relies on robotic pick-and-place machines and machine vision, which has rather limited throughput for high-accuracy assembly of fragile ultra-thin dies. In this paper, we report a hybrid assembly strategy that consists of robotic pick-and-place using a vacuum micro-gripper, and droplet self-alignment by capillary force. Ultra-thin dies with breakable links are chosen as part of the assembly strategy. Experimental results show that we can align ultra-thin (10\u03bcm) dies with sub-micron accuracy without machine vision. A fully automatic sequence of stacking several of these dies is demonstrated. Up to 12 ultra-thin dies have been stacked. These early results show that die-to-die integration of ultra-thin dies with higher throughput than the current industry robot is possible by applying both robotic handling and droplet self-alignment to ultra-thin die assembly.",

We successfully demonstrated the end-effector positioning to reach the target point in Cartesian coordinate frame based on force control without solving the inverse kinematic problem. The advantage of this function is obvious in moving the end-effector to go to the target point safely because the robot arm can be stopped or disturbed during the movement. The impedance gain can be adjusted adaptively according to the moving trajectory conditions. As the result, the end-effector can reach the presetting target point. We also have experimentally demonstrated the effect of adaptive impedance/compliance control, velocity control and EEFC which are useful in many applications, such as laparoscopic surgery, industrial taper cutting compensation and feeding food to the impaired person.",

        "abstract": "Intensive rehabilitation training of the arm can improve motor recovery in patients with neurological impairment. Actuated robots are becoming more and more common in this field as they serve to actively assist, enhance and assess neurorehabilitation. However, there is currently no actuated robot available specifically designed for the rehabilitation of children with upper extremity motor impairments. In this paper, we describe a completely new designed exoskeleton-based arm robot, ChARMin, with four degrees of freedom to guide and assist shoulder and elbow movements for young patients with motor impairments. The serial mechanical structure includes parallel kinematics for remote center of rotation actuation. This allows to keep a safe distance between parts of the robot and the patient and it reduces friction, while being highly adaptable to cover the anthropometrics for patients aged 5 to 18 years. Additionally, a novel passive weight support mechanism and 6 degrees of freedom force sensors are installed for a safe and transparent operation of the device.",

        "abstract": "Robot manipulation in unstructured environments depends on understanding the geometric and physical constraints that the environment imposes on the robot. While approaches like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) allow robots to understand geometric constraints, the understanding of environmental physical manipulation constraints is largely unaddressed when exploring unstructured flexible environments. The aim of this paper is to investigate algorithms that enable robots to autonomously perform exploratory manipulation tasks to comprehend physical constraints that guide safe manipulation. To achieve this goal we break new ground in the area of constraint exploration in unknown flexible environments. We propose using spatial stiffness, represented using screw theory, as a measure of mechanical constraints in the context of flexible environments. This paper focuses on developing a compact representation of global workspace constraints using locally measured stiffness properties. Additionally, we propose methods for identifying and classifying the various types of mechanical constraints that may exist in an elastic workspace, using only local stiffness properties. Used in tandem, these methods form a real-time compatible approach for exploring and mapping constraints of a flexible unknown environment.",

        "abstract": "Perimodiolar electrode arrays for cochlear implant surgery present surgeons with challenges during their insertion into the cochlea. These challenges stem from the inherent flexibility of these arrays and the fragile intracochlear anatomy and has opened opportunities for high precision robotic systems. This paper investigates effects of insertion speed on insertion forces using perimodiolar electrode arrays in human temporal bones and complements previously published results on insertion force and speed relationships when using straight outer-wall electrode arrays. The paper presents a custom-made parallel robot equipped with a high resolution force/moment sensor as an insertion platform. Experimental results using 42 insertions in 8 temporal bones are analyzed and grouped by insertion speed. Our results show a reduction in insertion forces up to insertion speeds of 1 mm/s. The second aspect of this paper is the investigation of the feasibility of using insertion force and speed data to sense conditions predicting the onset of electrode tip fold over, a complication resulting in poor placement of electrode contacts. It is shown that tip folding can be detected by features taken from insertion force data when employing a support vector machine classifier. The capability to detect such errors in a procedure is a critical component to the development of a practical surgical tool.",

Our robot hypothesizes the boundaries of objects in a pile of unknown objects (object segmentation) and verifies its hypotheses (object detection) using deliberate interactions. To guarantee the safety of the robot and the environment, we use compliant motion primitives for poking and grasping. Every verified segmentation hypothesis can be used to parameterize a compliant controller for manipulation or grasping. The robot alternates between poking actions to verify its segmentation and grasping actions to remove objects from the pile. We demonstrate our method with a robotic manipulator. We evaluate our approach with real-world experiments of clearing cluttered scenes composed of unknown objects.",

It optimizes pose-graphs of particular structure called pose-chains by employing an extended version of trajectory bending. Our solution is designed as a back-end optimizer to be used within systems whose front-end performs state-of-the-art visual odometry and appearance based loop detection. The optimality conditions of our closed-form method and that of state-of-the-art iterative methods are discussed. The practical relevance of their theoretical differences is investigated by extensive experiments using simulated and real data. It is shown using 49 kilometers of challenging binocular data that the accuracy obtained by our closed-form solution is comparable to that of state-of-the-art iterative solutions while the time it needs to compute its solution is a factor 50 to 200 times lower. This makes our approach relevant to a broad range of applications and computational platforms.",

        "abstract": "Percutaneous intervention has become a topic of interest in recent years, due to the many potential advantages for the patient. To date, several novel needle steering systems have been developed to improve both the accuracy and applicability of this type of surgery, but many of these can still only provide limited control of the trajectory between an entry site and a deep seated target. Our previous work describes the first prototype of a bio-inspired multi-part needle, codenamed STING, which can steer along planar trajectories within a compliant medium by means of a novel programmable bevel, where the steering angle is a function of the offset between interlocked needle segments. This paper presents our first attempt to model a bio-inspired 4-part needle, an extension of the planar steering system with the potential to steer along three-dimensional (3D) trajectories within a compliant medium. This paper introduces a 3D kinematic model and closed-loop controller for the needle, which is inspired by the modeling strategy employed for under-actuated underwater vehicles, followed by simulation results which demonstrate that 3D trajectory tracking can be completed successfully.",

Similar to traditional electric motors, the MR scanner acts as the stator and generates propulsive torques on an actuator rotor containing one or more ferrous particles. To generate maximum motor torque while avoiding instabilities and slippage, closed-loop control of the electromagnetic field gradients, i.e., commutation, is required. This paper proposes and demonstrates a method for commutation based on interleaving pulse sequences for rotor tracking and rotor propulsion. Fast rotor tracking is achieved by a new technique utilizing radio-frequency (RF) selective excitation of a properly located fiducial marker by the ferrous particle of the rotor. Optimal marker location is derived and demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of rotor angle. In addition, closed-loop commutation control is shown to increase motor torque and also to enable regulation of rotor angle.",

However, these works were either open-loop or not fully successful under controlled simulations.

        "abstract": "Although simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are widely appreciated in mobile robot navigation, they can be further improved to suit practical applications in dynamic environmental conditions. One such important improvement is the detection and tracking of moving objects present in the sensor field of view (FOV). In this paper we propose to extend our recently introduced Collaborative Multi-vehicle SLAM (CMSLAM) solution based on the random finite set (RFS) representation of the feature map and measurements, by tracking both static and dynamic features. We represent static features observed during the SLAMprocess, along with dynamic features present in the current sensor FOV, as an augmented RFS. The corresponding probability density is propagated using a Bayes recursion, from which the static feature map and the estimates of dynamic feature locations can be obtained. Measurement update in the CMSLAM process is carried out only using the static feature map to take advantage of obvious accuracy improvements.",

        "abstract": "We propose a distributed algorithm for collaborative localization of multiple autonomous robots that fuses inter-robot relative measurements with odometry measurements to improve upon dead reckoning estimates. It is an extension of our previous work [6], in which a method for fusing inter-robot pose measurements was presented. In this paper we extend the method to fuse any type of inter-robot measurements (distance, bearing, relative position, relative orientation, and any combination thereof), thus increasing the applicability of the method. The proposed method is posed as an optimization problem in a product Riemannian manifold; and is solved by gradient descent without performing a parameterization of the orientations. The proposed distributed algorithm allows each robot to compute its own pose estimate based on local measurements and communication with its neighbors. Simulations show that the proposed distributed algorithm significantly improves localization accuracy over the case of no-collaboration. Simulations show that, in some situations, the proposed distributed algorithm outperforms two competing methods - an Extended Kalman Filter-based algorithm as well as a distributed pose graph optimization method that relies on an Euclidean parameterization of orientations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a centralized method for collision avoidance among multiple agents is presented. It builds on the velocity obstacle (VO) concept and its extensions to arbitrary kino-dynamics and is applicable to heterogeneous groups of agents (with respect to size, kino-dynamics and aggressiveness) moving in 2D and 3D spaces. In addition, both static and dynamic obstacles can be considered in the framework. The method maximizes a joint utility function and is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program, where online computation can be achieved as a trade-off with solution optimality. In experiments with groups of two to 50 agents the benefits of the joint utility optimization are shown. By construction, it's suboptimal variant is at least as good as comparable decentralized methods, while retaining online capability for small groups of agents. In its optimal variant, the proposed algorithm can provide a benchmark for distributed collision avoidance methods, in particular for those based on the VO concept that take interaction into account.",

Moreover, we introduce a method to define the direction of the force in an optimal way, in order to introduce the smallest possible perturbation with respect to the desired behavior of the system.

A time-of-flight laser scanner obtains a range image from the sensor toward the target by measuring the round-trip time of a laser pulse. At the same time, for most laser scanners, the reflectance image (which is the strength of the reflected light) is available as a by-product of the range value. The proposed technique first assigns appearance information to a 3D model by colorizing a reflectance image based on the similarity of color and reflectance images. Then the color information is transferred to the corresponding range image, and the colorized 3D model is obtained. We carried out experiments using a laser scanner and showed the performance of the proposed technique in several conditions.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown how Lingodroids, language learning mobile robots, learn terms for space and time, connecting their personal maps of the world to a publically shared language. One caveat of previous studies was that the robots shared the same cognitive architecture, identical in all respects from sensors to mapping systems. In this paper we investigate the question of how terms for space can be developed between robots that have fundamentally different sensors and spatial representations. In the real world, communication needs to occur between agents that have different embodiment and cognitive capabilities, including different sensors, different representations of the world, and different species (including humans). The novel aspects of these studies is that one robot uses a forward facing camera to estimate appearance and uses a biologically inspired continuous attractor network to generate a topological map; the other robot uses a laser scanner to estimate range and uses a probabilistic filter approach to generate an occupancy grid. The robots hold conversations in different locations to establish a shared language. Despite their different ways of sensing and mapping the world, the robots are able to create coherent lexicons for the space around them.",

The adaptive identification algorithm estimates the hydrodynamic mass, quadratic drag, gravitational force, and buoyancy parameters of a second-order rigid-body plant under the influence of actuator forces and torques. Adaptive model identification methods do not require instrumentation of vehicle acceleration as required of other standard methods, such as conventional least squares. Previous adaptive model identification methods have focused on model-based adaptive tracking controllers however these approaches are not applicable when the plant is either uncontrolled, under open-loop control, or using any control law other than a specific adaptive tracking controller; the adaptive identifier reported herein does not require reference trajectory-tracking, and thus is applicable in these commonly occurring cases. An experimental comparison of adaptive identification and conventional least squares parameter identification is reported. The adaptively identified model is shown to be similar to the least squares identified model.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a method is proposed for controlling a hopping monopod. It takes dynamics of the robot into account to have better nominal tracking of desired trajectories and more compliant environmental interactions at the same time. We have incorporated also natural dynamics of the robot into the system by using off-line gaits extracted from optimizations on energy. The main control loop consists of the projected inverse dynamics that generates actuator torques given desired trajectories and also a feedback loop designed and tuned specifically for the structure of the robot. A trajectory generator uses known optimal trajectories together with some stabilizing control laws that modify these trajectories to have better robustness in different situations. The average speed of the robot is also regulated by means of a self-organizing controller. We apply soft transitions in trajectories from phase to phase to avoid sharp actuator input profiles. Our method is successfully tested on a monopod hopper robot in simulation. It can handle slightly rough or sloped terrains while maintaining a given average speed. Simulation results suggest that our method is a promising candidate to control a real robot under construction.",

In such structures, the volume of the organ remains constant during their motions, enabling diverse, complex, and highly controlled movements without the support of a skeleton. Such flexible structures show major advantages over articulated arms that have a rigid skeleton and joints. These advantages have been attracting roboticists aiming to apply these material properties to soft robot controls. In this paper, we show that the muscular-hydrostat system itself has the computational capacity to achieve a complex nonlinear computation. By using a 3D dynamic simulator of the system inspired by the octopus, we actually demonstrate that the system is capable of emulating complex nonlinear dynamical systems by exploiting its elastic body dynamics as a computational resource. In addition, we systematically analyze its computational power in terms of memory capacity, and show that the system has an intrinsic and characteristic short term memory profile. Finally, the implications for soft robot control and future application scenarios are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of finding optimal time parameterized trajectories for N unlabeled robots navigating through a cluttered environment to N unlabeled goal locations where success is defined as every goal being reached by any robot. We propose a complete computationally-tractable algorithm for simultaneously finding trajectories and assignment of goal locations. This method is then demonstrated to have an upper complexity bound of that scales polynomially in the number of robots, O(N3). The trajectories generated are guaranteed to be minimum length and collision free, while the assignment policy minimizes the maximum distance travelled. The key idea in the paper comes from the coupling between the optimal assignment, the properties of the resulting paths, and the set of valid priority assignments to the robots. These benefits result from structure in the solution to the optimal assignment to create a partial ordering of the robots, which in turn allows safe trajectories to be easily generated. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the algorithm through simulations with tens and hundreds of robots operating in cluttered and confined environments.",

The anatomy, workspace, and access constraints for this procedure are identified and used as a guideline for the design of the telesurgical system and its control architecture. Constraints are mapped into the configuration space of the robot rather than in task space simplifying the modeling and the enforcement of virtual fixtures. The redundancy resolution is autonomously modified in order to exploit the remaining degrees of freedom using task priority. These methods are validated on a glass model of urinary bladder.",

Conventional treatment techniques suggest replacing the component, while less-invasive approaches attempt to access and clean the lesion through the screw holes in the component. However, current rigid tools have been shown to access at most 50% of the lesion. Using a recently developed dexterous manipulator, we have adapted a group-theoretic convolution framework to define the manipulator's workspace and its ability to fully explore a lesion. We compared this with the experimental exploration of a printed model of the lesion. This convolution approach successfully contains the experimental results and shows over 98.8% volumetric coverage of a complex lesion. The results suggest this manipulator as a possible solution to accessing much of the area unreachable to the conventional less-invasive technique.",

Commonly, a pseudo-inverse operator is applied to solve operational tasks. However, it is known that discontinuities in the control signals appear as a by-product of task transitions during motion execution. In particular, these transitions involve the insertion, removal and swapping of tasks. Recently, some methods have been reported that overcome such discontinuities in the control signals. In this work, we provide time parametrization capabilities to these continuous kinematic controllers in order to handle the time axis of operational tasks at will. Then, we show that the proposed scheme can be naturally extended for the case of prioritized kinematic tasks while preserving continuity under task transitions. Our scheme is validated in a real experiment with a NAO humanoid robot.",

Given the start and the goal positions and the winding constraints, the solution to this problem is a feedback vector field such that, when integrated from the start, the trajectory is the shortest path connecting the start and the goal which satisfies given constraints. Such constraints intuitively restrict the direction and the number of times the path winds around given planar regions. We formulate a continuous version of this problem that contrasts with the discrete treatments previously presented. This leads to a geometrical characterization of the problem for which simplicial complex approximation is particularly useful. Thus, it yields theoretical insight as well as a practical algorithm for approximating the continuous problem using an efficient and high-accuracy heuristic-driven front propagation method on simplicial meshes. Experimental results are given evaluating the solution quality and efficiency of the method versus methods based on the discrete formulation and without using heuristics.",

        "abstract": "We present a new method for continuously and accurately estimating the shape of a continuum robot during a medical procedure using a small number of X-ray projection images (e.g., radiographs or fluoroscopy images). Continuum robots have curvilinear structure, enabling them to maneuver through constrained spaces by bending around obstacles. Accurately estimating the robot's shape continuously over time is crucial for the success of procedures that require avoidance of anatomical obstacles and sensitive tissues. Online shape estimation of a continuum robot is complicated by uncertainty in its kinematic model, movement of the robot during the procedure, noise in X-ray images, and the clinical need to minimize the number of X-ray images acquired. Our new method integrates kinematics models of the robot with data extracted from an optimally selected set of X-ray projection images. Our method represents the shape of the continuum robot over time as a deformable surface which can be described as a linear combination of time and space basis functions. We take advantage of probabilistic priors and numeric optimization to select optimal camera configurations, thus minimizing the expected shape estimation error. We evaluate our method using simulated concentric tube robot procedures and demonstrate that obtaining between 3 and 10 images from viewpoints selected by our method enables online shape estimation with errors significantly lower than using the kinematic model alone or using randomly spaced viewpoints.",

So, we aim, in this paper, to study the effects of the addition of these modifications on walkers with fully passive lower limbs. By comparing three systems (a passive compass, an upper-body stabilizing walker and a head stabilizing walker) simulations show that: (ii) upper-body stabilization improves the stability of the walking limit cycle; (ii) in return, the stabilization of the upper body requires a noticeable amount of the kinetic energy of the walker, and a significant energy supply (steeper slopes for the passive case) is necessary to guarantee the stability of the gait, especially for the case of head stabilization; and (iii) in a dynamical context, such as steep slopes, the upper-body and head stabilization have close performances for absorbing perturbations and smoothing the impacts, but with a slight advantage for the latter.",

Our certificates of invariance are given in terms of sums of squares proofs of a set of appropriately defined Lyapunov inequalities. These certificates, together with our proposed polynomial controllers, can be efficiently obtained via semidefinite optimization. Our approach can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a given trajectory, input saturations (e.g. torque limits), and can be extended to deal with uncertainty in the dynamics and state. The resulting controllers can be used by space-filling feedback motion planning algorithms to fill up the space with significantly fewer trajectories. We demonstrate our approach on a severely torque limited underactuated double pendulum (Acrobot) and provide extensive simulation and hardware validation.",

The control of such a redundantly actuated CSPR turns to be challenging as a realtime embeddable algorithm for distributing the cable tensions should be used, together with a suitable control scheme. This paper proposes a computationally efficient tension distribution algorithm implemented within a dual-space feedforward scheme in order to properly control the moving platform.

An important part of this is the ability to choose between different gaits in order to travel optimally at a certain speed or to robustly deal with unanticipated perturbations. In this paper, we present a control framework for a quadrupedal robot that is capable of locomoting using several gaits. We demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm by performing experiments on StarlETH, a recently-developed quadrupedal robot. We implement controllers for a static walk, a walking trot, and a running trot, and show that smooth transitions between them can be performed. Using this control strategy, StarlETH is able to trot unassisted in 3D space with speeds of up to 0.7m/s, it can dynamically navigate over unperceived 5-cm high obstacles and it can recover from significant external pushes.",

The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone.",

This analysis is done by comparing the characteristics of the transient- and steady-states of the controlled MTB inside and outside a micro-fabricated maze. In this analysis, the magnetic dipole moment of our MTB is characterized using a motile technique (the u-turn technique), then used in the realization of a closed-loop control system. This control system allows the MTB to reach reference positions within a micro-fabricated maze with a channel width of 10 \u00b5m, at a velocity of 8 \u00b5m/s. Further, the control system positions the MTB within a region-of-convergence of 10 \u00b5m in diameter. Due to the effect of the channel wall, we observe that the velocity and the positioning accuracy of the MTB are decreased and increased by 71% and 44%, respectively.",

We assume that the vehicle can precisely determine its initial position in a known map of the environment. However, inspired by practical limitations, we assume that the vehicle is equipped with noisy actuators and, during its motion in the environment, it can only measure the angular velocity of its wheels using limited accuracy incremental encoders. Assuming the duration of the motion is finite, we map the measurements to a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We use recent results in Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to obtain an MDP control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfaction. We translate this policy to a vehicle feedback control strategy and show that the probability that the vehicle satisfies the specification in the environment is bounded from below by the probability of satisfying the specification on the MDP. We illustrate our method with simulations and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "The bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model captures characteristic properties of human locomotion, and it is therefore often used to study human-like walking. The extended variable spring-loaded inverted pendulum (V-SLIP) model provides a control input for gait stabilization and shows robust and energy-efficient walking patterns. This work presents a control strategy that maps the conceptual V-SLIP model on a realistic model of a bipedal robot. This walker implements the variable leg compliance by means of variable stiffness actuators in the knees. The proposed controller consists of multiple levels, each level controlling the robot at a different level of abstraction. This allows the controller to control a simple dynamic structure at the top level and control the specific degrees of freedom of the robot at a lower level. The proposed controller is validated by both numeric simulations and preliminary experimental tests.",

While conventional evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based MPC approaches cannot guarantee the stability, the proposed CC-based MPC guarantees the asymptotic stability regardless of the optimality of the solution that the CC-based algorithm generates with a small number of individuals. To guarantee the stability, a terminal state constraint is found, and then a repair algorithm is applied to all candidate solutions to meet the constraint. The cooperatively coevolving particle swarm optimization (CCPSO), most recently developed algorithm among CC-based EAs, is adopted and modified to fit into the formation control problem. Experiments are performed on a group of nonholonomic mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CC-based MPC.",

The system can be used to guide resource constrained mobile sensors through a dynamically changing environment in order to obtain a path that results in data collection at important locations in the domain. A simulated chemical puff is used as a test application where small, resource constrained aerial vehicles provide mobile sensing capabilities. A fluid-based control scheme is used to guide the mobile sensors through the domain to collect data on the puff. The data is then used to update and improve a model of the puff concentration. Simulations are provided, demonstrating the decrease in error between the simulated and actual puffs over time. Additionally, the effect of using different numbers of mobile sensors as well as different schemes for guiding the mobile sensors is investigated. The feasibility of the technique using real sensors is demonstrated experimentally using a single UAV tracking a simulated puff.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a Leader-Follower formation control strategy for underactuated marine vehicles which move under sensing and communication constraints in the presence of bounded persistent environmental disturbances. We assume that the vehicles do not communicate for exchanging information regarding on their states (pose and velocities), and that their sensing capabilities are restricted, due to limited range and angle-of-view. Sensing constraints are thus realized as a set of inequality state constraints which should never be violated (viability constraints). The viability constraints define a closed subset K of the configuration space (viability set K). The control objective is thus reduced into to coordinating the motion of the vehicles in a Leader-Follower formation, while system trajectories starting in K always remain viable in K. The proposed control design employs dipolar vector fields and a viability-based switching control scheme, which guarantees that system viability is always maintained. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm, as well as its relevance with surveillance of (stationary) targets are demonstrated through simulations.",

Peculiar dynamics of the internal motions is exploited to achieve obstacle avoidance via the formation reconfiguration. Simulations are performed to support the theory.",

        "abstract": "Recent technological advances in surgery have permitted cellular and molecular imaging to be carried out intra-operatively. Although optical biopsy techniques such as probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) have enabled real-time diagnosis and tissue characterisation in vivo, the flexibility of the probe introduces significant challenges under manual control. Examination of large tissue areas is particularly challenging due to micron-scale resolution of the probe and the need for maintaining consistent probe orientation and force contact with the tissue to avoid cellular deformation or damage. The use of a robotic manipulator to perform surface scanning automatically introduces great benefits in terms of positioning repeatability and accuracy. However, pre-programming of such complex task is not realistic due to patient-specific anatomy and constant changes in tissue morphology during the operation. To overcome this problem, a cooperative, in situ microscopic scanning and simultaneous tissue surface reconstruction technique is proposed. The system provides a hands-on, learning-based framework for optimal trajectory coverage from surgeon-demonstrated motions intraoperatively. The position and force information acquired during the scanning are also used to simultaneously reconstruct the surface morphology and combined with the pCLE images to generate a 3D functional map of the tissue.",

Such sensors may fail to detect a subset of the visible targets or return false positive detections. These measurement sets are used to localize the targets using the Probability Hypothesis Density, or PHD, filter. Robots communicate with each other on a local peer-to-peer basis and with a server or the cloud via access points, exchanging measurements and poses to update their belief about the targets and plan future actions. The server provides a mechanism to collect and synthesize information from all robots and to share the global, albeit time-delayed, belief state to robots near access points. We design a decentralized control scheme that exploits this communication architecture and the PHD representation of the belief state. Specifically, robots move to maximize mutual information between the target set and measurements, both self-collected and those available by accessing the server, balancing local exploration with sharing knowledge across the team. Furthermore, robots coordinate their actions with other robots exploring the same local region of the environment.",

To achieve this, we represent the problem as a graph, where the nodes are robot and target poses at individual time-steps and the edges are their relative measurements. Static landmarks at known position are used to define a common reference frame for the robots and the targets. In this way, we mitigate the risk of using measurements and state estimates more than once, since all the relative measurements are i.i.d. and no marginalization is performed. Experiments performed using a set of real robots show higher accuracy compared to a Kalman filter.",

In particular, the impact that a humanoid robot, acting as an avatar for a remote member of the group, has on the collaboration between the members of the group is investigated. This is carried out in the context where the avatar is depicting the actions being carried out by the remote user during a game. A preliminary study was performed to find out how the users interact when they are all co-located. The experiment is then carried out in two variants, in the first, a member of the group is moved to a remote location and allowed to interact with the other members using audio support alone. In the second, a robot is used to represent the actions of the remote user to the co-located users. The results obtained indicate that the addition of an avatar, used in such a way, has a positive impact on group interaction and allows for the task to be completed more successfully than when the avatar is not used. Further, comparative analysis of videos of the group behavior with a co-located team and group behavior with one member represented by the robot avatar, showed similar cooperative action.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the use of Cooperative Dual-Task Space (CDTS) as an efficient approach for the whole-body motion balancing problem for humanoid robots. The CDTS variables have been used efficiently to describe and control coordinated motions of dual-arms. Similarly, the concept of CDTS variables can be extended to describe the constraints and the control of humanoid legs. When the leg motion is described and controlled by CDTS variables, the variables regarding the feet constraints and the control variables in the leg motion regarding the waist movement can be nicely decoupled. One of the CDTS variables can be used to describe the constraints on the feet, and the constraints can be expressed independently of the support-foot changes. The proposed CDTS-based method provides an efficient way to stabilize the merged whole-body motion by modifying the horizontal waist position by a coordinated motion of both legs while satisfying the changing constraints on both feet in the lower-body motion. Thus, the proposed CDTS-based method provides the possibility of generating a large library of whole-body motions for a humanoid robot by combining an upper-body motion captured from humans and lower-body motions generated by an existing biped walking pattern planner. The performance of the proposed CDTS-based approach was validated through extensive simulations including cases that showed a HOAP-2 robot walking on a flat terrain and climbing up the stairs with a rapid upper-body movement.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the motion of multiple fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) following closed intersecting curves. We require that each UAV avoid collisions with its teammates without changing its predefined, periodic path. Also, each robot must keep a minimum speed to avoid stall and a maximum speed determined by its physical constraints. The centralized solution presented in this paper is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The solution to this problem, which maximizes safeness (in the sense of collision avoidance), determines, for each UAV, the start time and the velocity profile over the curve.",

The robots are modeled as a rigid body with six massless legs, each having two compliant degrees of freedom and the contact is modeled using Coulomb's model. We start our analysis by formulating the cost of transport for rigid legged robots as a function of their geometry, friction coefficients, actuation velocities and slope angle and compare it to the results of a dynamic multibody numeric simulation. In the second part, we estimate the cost of transport in the more general case when the legs and surface are compliant. We evaluate the energy consumptions factors, sliding, work against gravity, elastic losses of the legs and the surface, and kinetic energy and compare them to the total energy input of the actuators. This analysis allows us to evaluate the work range of the robots and determine the optimum locomotion paths for improved battery performance.",

Emphasizing minimalism and using only InfraRed and contact sensors for communication, our position unaware robots physically embody elements of the tree. Although robots are fundamentally constrained in the spatial operations they may perform, we show that the approach-implemented on physical robots- remains consistent with the original data-structure idea. In particular, we show that a generalized form of Voronoi bias is present in the construction of the tree, and that such trees have an approximate space-filling property. We present an analysis of the physical system via sets of coupled stochastic equations: the first being the rate-equation for the transitions made by the robot controllers, and the second to capture the spatial process describing tree formation. We are able to provide an understanding of the control parameters in terms of a process mixing-time and show the dependence of the Voronoi bias on an interference parameter which grows as O(\u221aN).",

We introduce the anti-factor as a means to subtract information in graphical SLAM systems, and illustrate its use to both replace information in an incremental solver and to cancel out neighborhood information from shared summarized maps. This paper presents and compares three summarization techniques, with two exact approaches and an approximation. We evaluated the proposed system in a synthetic example and show the augmented local system and the associated summarization technique do not double-count information, while keeping performance tractable.",

In many approaches to coordination, robots jointly plan their actions through negotiation, which incurs communication costs. Previous work examined the use of learning to reduce the need for negotiations in a network of static robots. Robots incrementally learn how each team member impacts the team utility and can thus make coordinated, team-wide decisions. In this paper, we extend the concept of learning utility models to a team of mobile robots. We also propose a mechanism by which robots switch between negotiating and using the learnt model. This mechanism reduces the communications required for coordination whilst maintaining the same level of tracking performance. Hardware experiments demonstrated that our approach resulted in coordinated behaviours while only negotiating intermittently. Simulation results show that our approach reduced the data communicated for negotiations by up to 70%, without making a statistically significant impact on the tracking performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a P2P wireless network framework with numerous nodes that can communicate with their neighbors in a stable condition with no collisions of transmissions. Under the network convergence state, every node transmits periodically in order with a cycle shared in the network. To realize that situation, we apply a pulse-coupled oscillator technique to shift the timing of transmission of each node to avoid overlapping with neighboring nodes' transmissions. Additionally, we propose an algorithm to find the suboptimal transmission cycle, preferred small for faster communication, depending on the number of nodes and the network topology based on a class of chromatic number problem in graph theory. We developed a multi-thread simulation platform for multiple node communications to verify the algorithm. Results demonstrate its feasibility both with simulations and with real devices by implementing the method onto an omnidirectional infrared communication device and an RF long-distance communication device.",

In addition to limited mobility and ranges of communication and sensing, the robot team has to deal with challenges from signal source anonymity, short transmission duration, and variable transmission power. We propose a two-step approach: first, we decentralize belief functions that robots use to track source locations using checkpoint-based synchronization, and second, we propose a decentralized planning strategy to coordinate robots to ensure the existence of checkpoints. We analyze memory usage, data amount in communication, and searching time for the proposed algorithm. We have implemented the proposed algorithm and compared it with two heuristics. The experiment results show that our algorithm successfully trades a modest amount of memory for the fastest searching time among the three methods.",

        "abstract": "A novel behavior representation is introduced that permits a robot to systematically explore the best methods by which to successfully execute an affordance-based behavior for a particular object. The approach decomposes affordance-based behaviors into three components. We first define controllers that specify how to achieve a desired change in object state through changes in the agent's state. For each controller we develop at least one behavior primitive that determines how the controller outputs translate to specific movements of the agent. Additionally we provide multiple perceptual proxies that define the representation of the object that is to be computed as input to the controller during execution. A variety of proxies may be selected for a given controller and a given proxy may provide input for more than one controller. When developing an appropriate affordance-based behavior strategy for a given object, the robot can systematically vary these elements as well as note the impact of additional task variables such as location in the workspace. We demonstrate the approach using a PR2 robot that explores different combinations of controller, behavior primitive, and proxy to perform a push or pull positioning behavior on a selection of household objects, learning which methods best work for each object.",

        "abstract": "Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. Due to its fascinating properties, several attempts are being actively made to expand applications of origami-inspired designs in engineering. This paper presents the design of a deformable wheel based on an origami structure that was integrated with a small-scale mobile robot. The wheel of the robot employs an origami structure proposed by Guest et al. All segments of the structure are connected by links-i.e., folding lines-and this linked structure provides advantages in terms of maintaining geometry and force transmissibility. These two advantages enable control of the shape or size of the wheel by activating a certain portion of the structure. With this property, the wheel diameter of the robot is reduced from 11 cm to 4 cm by four SMA coil spring actuators. Two plate springs are embedded in the wheel to maintain stiffness and allow the wheel to recover from contraction. With the deformable wheel, the robot can pass through a 5 cm gap despite having an 11 cm wheel in its normal state. This deformable wheel concept can be used to build mobile robots that can move quickly with large wheels and move through small gaps when required.",

        "abstract": "Data association is an essential problem in simultaneous localization and mapping. It is hard to solve correctly, especially in ambiguous environments. We consider a scenario where the robot can ease the data association problem by deploying a limited number of uniquely identifiable artificial landmarks along its path and use them afterwards as fixed anchors. Obviously, the choice of the positions where the robot should drop these markers is crucial as poor choices might prevent the robot from establishing accurate data associations. In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning when to drop the landmarks so as to optimize the data association performance. We use Monte Carlo reinforcement learning for computing an optimal policy and apply a statistical convergence test to decide if the policy is converged and the learning process can be stopped. Extensive experiments also carried out with a real robot demonstrate that the data association performance using landmarks deployed according to our learned policies is significantly higher compared to other strategies.",

As cable-driven manipulator has actuation redundancy, the tension distribution can be manipulated even at a stationary pose. Such property allows the cable-driven manipulator to adjust the stiffness of each variable stiffness device, thereby changing the stiffness of the manipulator.

Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches are incorporated in the design to enable antagonistic actuation at the joints. A single unidirectional motor supports bidirectional actuation of all joints. Unlike most current safe robots, high quality actuation is preserved, while the manipulator weight and effective inertia are reduced. This is achieved by relocating the driving motor to the base of the robot. Moreover, MR clutches have been shown to pose superior torque to mass, and torque to inertia characteristics over conventional servo motors, further contributing to the reduction of manipulator mass and inertia. The manipulator exhibits both high performance and intrinsic safety as a result of mechanically passive dynamics. A set of experiments is performed to validate the manipulator performance.",

The robot arm design combines tendon actuation with elasticity in the tendons to achieve a significant reduction in mass and passive compliant behavior. The use of elastic tendons in all joints in order to gain maximum safety and performance properties, however, results in a significant increase of the model complexity with oscillatory behavior and kinematic coupling of the joint equilibrium positions. Therefore, special effort needs to be made to model the robot arm dynamics, which is an essential basis for model-based algorithms utilizing and fully exploiting the particular properties of the robot arm. This paper therefore derives the full dynamics model of the robot arm with focus on the nonlinear elastic tendon actuators, the kinematic tendon coupling, and modeling complexity reduction by reflecting all model parameters to the joint space. The resulting model is validated by comparing the identified simulation model with experimental data of an application-related pick-and-place trajectory and a trajectory with undamped oscillating motions of the robot arm.",

        "abstract": "This paper details the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a novel mobile robot capable of both aerial and terrestrial locomotion. Flight is achieved through a quadrotor configuration; four actuators provide the required thrust. Adding a rolling cage to the quadrotor makes terrestrial locomotion possible using the same actuator set and control system. Thus, neither the mass nor the system complexity is increased by inclusion of separate actuators for terrestrial and aerial locomotion. An analysis of the system's energy consumption demonstrates that during terrestrial locomotion, the robot only needs to overcome rolling resistance and consumes much less energy compared to the aerial mode. This solves one of the most vexing problems of quadrotors and rotorcraft in general \u2014 their short operation time. Experimental results show that the hybrid robot can travel a distance four times greater and operate almost six times longer than an aerial only system. It also solves one of the most challenging problems in terrestrial robot design \u2014 obstacle avoidance. When an obstacle is encountered, the system simply flies over it.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, fabrication, and testing of a compliant rotary nanopositioning stage for precision engineering applications. The major advantage of the rotary stage lies in that it possesses a large rotational range and a compact size simultaneously. A new idea of compound radial flexure is proposed to enable this merit. A novel rotary stage is designed to provide a rotary angle over 10\u00b0 while delivering a negligible magnitude of center shift. In the design procedure, analytical models are established for the performance evaluation of the stage, which are validated by finite element analysis (FEA). A prototype stage of 10-cm diameter is fabricated by wire-electrical discharge machining (EDM) process for experimental tests. The stage is driven by a voice coil motor and its output motion is measured by laser displacement sensors. Both FEA and experimental results confirm the large rotational range and low level of center shift of the rotary nanopositioning system. The proposed idea can be extended to the design of other precision positioning systems with rotary motion.",

As more ground is broken and more layers are explored, the need for a robotic solution to make digging both easier and safer becomes greater. The applications of a self-burying robot extend from mining and military applications to humanitarian applications. This paper elucidates design principles that form the foundation for self burying robots. In this paper, a bimodal robot is described which is capable of travelling above-ground in one mode and capable of burying itself in the other mode. The variables that affect digging are examined, as well as the design decisions made in order to optimize the resources available to the robot. Finally, future work in the area of self-burying robots is discussed.",

More recently, many robotics researchers are making their best efforts to improve the locomotion speed, as well as the stability and robustness, of quadruped robots. The high-speed locomotion creates various challenges in the development of actuators, mechanical design, and control algorithms of the robot. In this paper, a linear actuation system for the high-speed locomotion of a quadruped robot is introduced. The proposed actuator is designed based on the principle of brushed direct-current electric motor systems. For the minimal impedance and improved force capacity, the actuator is designed with dual layers of cores, which are aligned parallel to permanent magnets. The mechanical and electrical properties of the actuation system, such as back-drivability, controllability, and response time, are verified by experimental results. A robotic leg, which is the rear leg of a cheetah-like robot, is designed with the proposed actuator, and is introduced briefly in this paper also.",

        "abstract": "Modern processes of micro- and nanofabrication imply several metrology steps on critical dimensions in order to assure and assess device perfomences. Particularly, manufacturing processes of novel disruptive photonic devices and nanoelectronic circuit architectures require improved three dimensional acquisition and visualization techniques for their metrology. Amongst others line width and sidewall roughness are the most important parameters for nanooptical components but the determination of these parameters becomes increasingly demanding, since the continuous shrinkage of these devices demand an even higher lateral resolution of the measurements. The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a common tool for this characterization and a standard instrument for all kinds of research and development disciplines. However, the characterization of three dimensional high-aspect ratio and sidewall structures remains a hardly accomplishable task. Novel exchangeable and customizable scanning probe tips, so-called NanoBits, can be attached to standard AFM cantilevers offering unprecedented freedom in adapting the shape and size of the tips to the surface topology of the specific application. The ultimate goal is the realization of an in-situ exchange of NanoBits within the regular AFM environment. For this, NanoBits have to be provided in a freestanding way, making them accessible for the AFM cantilever. The direct fabrication of such structures is still challenging, hence the robotic preassembly of NanoBits cartridges is proposed, where every cartridge can carry several different NanoBits. Within this paper all components required for the realization of this concept are presented.",

For example, they absorb energy during the impact, which make them suitable in delicate manipulation or human interaction. In this work, we look at their performance during grasping tasks, analyzing the effect of some design parameters like precurvature and stiffness of the links, number/DOFs of fingers or scale of the hand. Our work is based on a grasp stability analysis together with a grasp closure analysis adapted to flexible hands. Simulation and experimental tests with a two flexible-finger gripper are provided as validation of our analysis.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the design principles for highly efficient legged robots and the implementation of the principles on the MIT Cheetah robot. Three major energy loss modes during locomotion are heat losses through the actuators, losses through the transmission, and the interaction losses that includes all losses of the system interacting with the environment. We propose four design principles that minimize these losses: employment of high torque density motors, low impedance transmission, energy regenerative electronics and a design architecture that minimizes the leg inertia. We present the design features of the MIT cheetah robot as an embodiment of these principles. The resulting cost of transport (COT) is 0.51 during 2.3 m/s running, which rivals running animals in the same scale.",

This concept involves the use of stents to maintain the structural integrity in artery/vein crossings. A design of an 11 degree of freedom robot that includes a 6 DoF Stewart-Gough platform, a two DoF differential wrist, and a three DoF actuator for deployment of stent and bridge vessel separators is proposed as a validated robotic system for ophthalmic microsurgery. The robot also allows for quick exchange of surgical graspers and the integration of a custom made B-mode OCT probe. The paper presents the kinematic modeling and calibration of the robot for demonstration of ocular and intraocular manipulation. The system telemanipulation framework is constructed and experimental evaluations of stent deployment and membrane peeling are shown with a verification of results using OCT probe images. We believe these preliminary results demonstrate new technology that may enable micro-vascular stenting for treatment of branch retinal vein occlusion while offering a general platform for dexterous retinal surgery.",

This design is based on wedge-shaped electromagnetic coil generating a driving torque on a rotor embedded with permanent magnets. Additional permanent magnets are used to create a virtual spring effect, supply a restoring torque to the rotor and adding nonlinear system stiffness. Flapping wing parameters were varied systematically to generate 16 unique wing profiles, from which wings were fabricated. Independent bench tests for the coil and spring magnets were used to modify analytical models of the actuator, derived in detail in a parallel study. Based on the equations of motion, estimates for the primary mode of resonance and the peak-peak stroke amplitude were determined using an approximate solution. Frequency response tests were conducted on the flapper using the set of test wings at varying supply voltages and spring configurations to verify the predicted resonate frequencies and amplitudes. Wing kinematics and mean lift measurements were performed for the flapper operating at resonance, producing a lift-to-weight ratio for the actuator of over one at 24V.",

        "abstract": "A new, seven parameter class of micromanipulators is found with decoupled dynamics. The flexibility of the new class is demonstrated by designing a Stewart platform with fully equalized and decoupled dynamics (i.e., all resonant frequencies are equal). Although this has been attempted before by other researchers, it has not been previously accomplished. The ability to design the dynamics so they are amenable to control leads to significant increases in closed loop performance and robustness. The dynamically decoupled and equalized manipulator is compared to an asymmetric manipulator in closed loop. Even though both manipulators control the same payload over the same bandwidth with exactly the same struts, the H\u221e controller for the equalized manipulator is five times less sensitive to worst case disturbances than the H\u221e controller for the asymmetric manipulator. Moreover, the decoupling facilitates the design of Nyquist stable compensators which give the decoupled manipulator one hundred times higher performance at low frequencies. This greatly increased performance and robustness requires implementation of only the six compensators along the diagonal of the six degree-of-freedom system, versus implementation of all 36 compensators for the asymmetrical manipulator.",

This is the first time a fully distributed deterministic algorithm has been written to achieve the parallel reconfiguration of a system of homogeneous modules from an initial arbitrary shape to a straight chain goal configuration. The contribution of this paper is an algorithm that uses no pre-processing or message passing to accomplish reconfiguration. The algorithm eliminates the possibility of module collision by assuming modules have the capability to detect another module at a distance of one cell away on each of their six sides. The algorithm is successful as long as: the system starts in an initial configuration that satisfies admissibility requirements, the goal cells are known to all modules, and if every module is equipped with sensors to determine if the cell adjacent to and in the same direction as a neighboring empty cell is occupied. A discrete-event simulator tests the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Buoyancy-driven underwater gliders (UGs) have proven to be quite effective for long-range, long-term oceanographic sampling. However, current off-the-shelf UGs are large, heavy, expensive, and difficult to modify, both in hardware and software, which prevents their frequent use for lake observations and limits researchers' ability to perform multi-vehicle coordination experiments. Our current research goal is to develop UGs that would share the buoyancy-driven concept with the first generation of gliders, but are smaller in size, lighter in weight, and lower in price. Our future research goal is to design and develop an underwater glider fleet that will result in novel and transformative research capabilities in coordinated control. Along with advancing research and broadening data collection ability, UGs provide a hands-on tool for engaging students in sophisticated STEM learning. This paper describes in detail the design, manufacturing, and modeling of our inexpensive Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Presentation in Education (GUPPIE). GUPPIE was developed using practical components such as syringes for buoyancy control and a hull made of acrylic for easy analysis. The design is both affordable and easy-to-duplicate. GUPPIE's pedagogical platform provides hands-on learning applications that demonstrate glider mechanics, mechatronics, hydrodynamics, trimming, diving and surfacing performance, and mobility in water.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, piezo-actuated micro/nano positioning stages emerge as a significant tool in the nanotechnology. However, the shortcomings of small positioning stroke and hysteresis of piezoelectric actuators have constrained their further development and applications. In this paper, a novel piezo-actuated hydraulic displacement amplifier (PHDA) based on Pascal's law and area differential principle is first proposed aiming to solve the contradictions among positioning stroke, positioning resolution and mechanism dimension in piezo-actuated micro/nano positioning stages. After a series of optimal designs, the proposed PHDA mechanism is fabricated and experimentally tested. In this study, a piezoelectric (PZT) actuator P-840.20 with open-loop travel of 30 \u03bcm is employed, the experimental results indicate that the displacement amplification ratio can reach up to 34.6, thus the maximum output displacement can achieve up to around 1.02 mm. Both theoretical derivation and prototype test results testify the well performance of the proposed mechanism. This new amplifier can be widely extended to practical precision manipulation applications in case of large motion range required.",

The stator has four independent inductors that generate thrust forces on the rotor surface. The motor is also equipped with four optical mouse sensors that measure surface velocity to estimate the rotor's angular velocity, which is used for vector control of the inductors and control of angular velocity and orientation. Design considerations including torque distribution for the inductors, angular velocity sensing, angular velocity control, and orientation control are presented.

        "abstract": "Neurologic examination procedures require not only abundant knowledge but also prominent skills. During medical education and training, several methods will be put to use such as watching video, reading books, making use of the simulated patient (SP), and so on. These can help medical staffs, especially novices, to master the skills and accumulate experiences. To make up for the drawbacks of the above methods, such as lack of active interactions, limitation of multi-symptom reproductions, etc, the medical training simulators have been developed to improve training effectiveness. However, most of these simulators only mimic the symptoms. They have no the abilities to show the pathology of diseases. This limits the training effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an elbow robot named WKE-1(Waseda Kyotokagaku Elbow Robot No.1) for neurologic examination training as one part of the whole body patient robot named WKP (Waseda Kyotokagaku Patient). In this robot, we simulate various symptoms occurring during the examination of elbow force, biceps tendon reflex, involuntary action, and also make a physiological neurological model to simulate the pathology of the nervous system. Taking advantage of this robot, the trainee can get a systematic training on both the skills and knowledge. Finally, we take a set of experiments to verify our proposed mechanism and system. The experimental results lead to the consideration that the approach is worth following in further research.",

The stage is constructed with a symmetric structure by employing three parallel PUU legs, a moving platform and a fixed platform. It is driven by 6 electromagnetic actuators and with 3 translational DOFs. The mobility characters of the stage is analyzed and proved via FEA method. The compliance modeling of the stage is conducted by resorting to compliance matrix method, and analytical models for electromagnetic forces are also established, both mechanical structure and electromagnetic model are validated by finite element analysis (FEA) performed with ANSYS. The mechanical structure is analyzed in a multi-physics environmental simulation and electromagnetic actuators are applied in ANSYS too. Both FEA and the analytical models well demonstrate that the movement of the stage is purely translational. The prototype of the designed system is fabricated, preliminary test shows the design is successful. With the parameters designed in the paper, the stage can have large working space, very high resolution and heavy work-load ability as well.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents development of a quad rotor tail-sitter VTOL UAV (Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) which is composed of four rotors and a fixed wing. The conventional VTOL UAVs have a drawback in the accuracy of the attitude control in stationary hovering because they were developed based on a fixed-wing aircraft and they used the control surfaces, such as aileron, elevator, and rudder for the attitude control. To overcome such a drawback, we developed a quad rotor tail-sitter VTOL UAV. The quad rotor tail-sitter VTOL UAV realizes high accuracy in the attitude control with four rotors like a quad rotor helicopter and achieves level flight like a fixed-wing airplane. The remarkable characteristic of the developed quad rotor tail-sitter VTOL UAV is that it does not use any control surfaces even in the level flight. This paper shows the design concept of the developed UAV and experimental verification of all flight modes including hovering, transition flight and level flight.",

        "abstract": "Proteomics is a well established subject in medical science, which focuses on the library of proteins specific to a given bio-system, the proteome, and understanding of relationships therein. It is a very challenging task to find out the correct position coordinates of all the proteins in the 2D gel, because proteins change their position in each experiment according to their mass and charge with a lot of noise and non-linear background. The precise excision of the correct protein spots is also important for further analysis. The Spot Picker Robot can be seen as an essential tool in proteomics. It accurately locates and identifies the protein spots from 2D gels and picks and transfers the proteins for further analysis, thus enhancing data quality and reliability in the field of proteomics. The application of this robot, has helped in discovering new proteins to develop biomarkers for new diagnostic tests. It provides the necessary automation for high throughput analysis. Our spot picker robot features the non-separable wavelet based novel imaging algorithms, better design of light illumination for detection of faint, irregular & overexposed protein spots in a nonlinear background and generates more accurate reference position coordinates of a dynamic protein object. The system includes a high performance solenoid controlled surgical grade protein spot excision tool and a novel wavelet based accurate positioning algorithm to reduce the effect of jerks on the system. Even with all these features, the cost of the system is very reasonable.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new suction cup with a disc spring for exiting adsorption mechanisms (for example, wall-climbing robots). The center of the suction cup can be pulled up manually through the use of buckling of the disc spring. When deformation of the disc spring reaches a certain balance point, it can sufficiently generate adsorption force. However, with time, the adsorption force will gradually decrease because of air inflow into the suction cup. Then, the spring can be automatically pulled up again to next balance point according to the air inflow. Repeating this process enables the adsorption for a long duration. By pushing back the disc spring to the original position manually, the suction cup is easily detached from the wall. This proposed suction cup can achieve long adsorption, easy attachment and detachment, and energy saving. In this paper, analysis of the adsorption force, design of the suction cup, and experiment of the prototype are conducted.",

The longitudinal model has three degree of freedom, i.e., the altitude, the horizontal position and the pitch angle. A stable controller is designed so as to guarantee the stability of the trajectory tracking control system for the three-degree-of-freedom model.

The proposed robot hand consists of five finger modules. Each finger has four links and three joints, and Joint 2 and 3 are coupled by the four-bar linkage mechanism. The dual-mode twisting actuation allows that the robot finger can move fast (up to 356.7 deg/sec) in Mode I and generate a large grasping force(up to 36.5 N) in Mode II. In addition, the workspace of the robot finger module is enlarged by EM joint locking mechanism depending on the locking states. In order to verify the effectiveness of the mechanisms adopted in the robot hand, we theoretically and numerically analyze the performances of the robot finger module such as bending speed, fingertip force, and workspace. Finally, through the developed robot hand, we perform the grasping test for various objects and the grasping performance is experimentally demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "For use as five-finger myoelectric hands in daily living, robotic hands must be 1) lightweight and human sized as well as possess 2) human-like multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) and a high grip force. The compatibility of these requirements is a trade-off; ideal robotic hands have yet to sufficiently satisfy both these requirements. Herein a power allocation mechanism is proposed to improve the grip force without increasing the size or weight of robotic hands using redundant DoF during pinching motions. Additionally, this mechanism is applied to an actual five-finger myoelectric hand, which can make seven types of motions that are necessary for activities of daily living (ADL) and realizes about a 60% improvement in fingertip force, allowing three fingers to pinch objects exceeding 1 kg.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Improved robot mobility is necessary in order to realize the expected uses of robots in the human life environment, which includes obstacles such as stairs and narrow passages. Because objects which humans require are often located on desks or tables, which are at some height above ground level, a long vertical dimension is also necessary in the robot design. To meet these requirements, this study focused on a type of mobile robot using an inverted pendulum, which enables a robot with a long vertical dimension to negotiate narrow passages. Since it is difficult for inverted pendulum robots to climb steps, this study proposes a planetary wheel mechanism which makes it possible for an inverted pendulum robot to ascend differences in level. This mechanism has an extremely simple structure, comprising a belt, pulley, and arm, and has the advantage of not requiring addition of a new actuator. This paper describes the composition of the proposed mechanism and its principle of operation, and also describes the control method. A prototype of the robot was produced, and it was shown experimentally that the robot was capable of climbing stairs with a height of 120 mm\u2013130 mm at a rate of approximately 2.4 s per one step.",

Finally we organized an experimental environment and performed experiments for different frequencies, and through 2D localization using obtained sensor model, we meet with very confident results. The experimental results show a close correlation with the developed sensor model and the possibility of underwater localization systems using EM wave.",

The key idea of the framework is that action develops the agent's perception of the own body and its action. In this framework, a robot voluntarily generates movements, and then develops the ability to perceive its own body and the effects of action primitives. The robot, moreover, demonstrates manipulative actions composed of the learned primitives, and characterizes the actions based on their sensory effects. After learning, the robot can predictively recognize humans' manipulative actions with cross-modal recovery of unavailable sensory information and reproduce the recognized actions. We evaluated the proposed framework in experiments with a real robot. In the experiments, we achieved developmental recognition of human actions as well as their reproduction.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this study, we present a motor-driven flapping-wing actuator, designed to operate at its resonant frequency using a torsion spring. The wing is driven by a DC motor directly through gear transmission. Linear torsion springs mounted on the load shaft creates restoring torque when the wing is displaced from its mid-stroke position. The actuator dynamics is obtained using system identification. The flapping motion of the wing is achieved by closed-loop motor control, for example, tracking a sinusoidal wave with the frequency tuned to match the resonant frequency of the system. PID and LQR controllers are applied for instantaneous wing kinematics tracking: A PID controller is able to precisely track the trajectory with relatively large control input; on the other hand, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) achieves large flapping amplitude with small input effort. We show that the mechanism is able to track sinusoidal motions with different amplitude, bias and frequencies with relatively large range by changing the springs, therefore generating roll and pitch torques that can be used for flight control. Then a Hopf oscillator based central pattern generator is also shown to be an alternative trajectory to track. The proposed wing actuation mechanism provides an at-scale wing testing platform for flapping wing micro aerial vehicles.",

We describe two methods that combine 3D scene priors with vision sensors to generate background-likelihood images, which act as probability masks for objects that are not part of the scene prior. This results in a system that is able to cope with extreme scene motion, even when most of the image is obscured. We present results on real data collected in central London during rush hour and demonstrate the benefits of our techniques on a core navigation system \u2014 visual odometry.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present provably-good algorithms for multi-robot task assignment, where each task has to be completed within its deadline. Each robot has a upper limit on the maximum number of tasks that it can perform due to its limited battery life, and each task takes the same amount of time to complete. Each robot has a different payoff (or cost) for the tasks and the objective is to assign the tasks to the robots such that the total payoff (cost) is maximized (minimized) while respecting the task deadline constraints. This problem is an extension of a special generalized assignment problem (where each task consumes the same time resource and must be finished), with additional deadline constraints for the time resource assignment. We show that the problem can be reduced to a problem of assigning tasks to robots, where the tasks are organized in overlapping sets, and each robot has a limit on the number of tasks it can perform from each set, which is a variant of multi-robot assignment problem with set precedence constraint (SPC-MAP) discussed in [1].We present a distributed auction-based algorithm for this problem and prove that the solution is almost-optimal. We also present simulation results to depict the performance of our algorithm.",

The network is consisted of mobile sensing nodes whose sensing pattern is uniform based on the geodesic metric. The space under consideration is partitioned based on the geodesic distance among the nodes (geodesic Voronoi diagram), resulting in compact Voronoi sets. A distributed coordination scheme is proposed, that leads the network towards its optimal state (in area-wise terms) in a monotonic manner. Unlike previous results that rely on the Euclidean distance and/or the Voronoi partitioning of the convex hull of the environment, the control law results in motions of the mobile nodes in the interior of the environment.

        "abstract": "Experimental results for a handheld six degrees of freedom parallel robot with realtime position control and disturbance attenuation are presented. The robot's base is freely movable in space by a human operator, while the tool is position controlled and stabilized relatively to a reference coordinate system. The challenge is to decouple the tool as far as possible from the user involved arm tremor and unintended motions. The robot is equipped with a camera-based position and orientation tracking system, linear actuators, and a realtime control system. Kinematics, co-ordinate transforms and workspace limits are presented with its specifications. Experiments with sinusoidal stimuli on a test stand and during the handheld operation are discussed with respect of stabilizing performance and work-space violation. The resulting error bounds of less than 0.5 mm in the Cartesian position demonstrate that such a robot device has the potential to improve the classical manual surgical interventions. Further, the paper demonstrates the compliance of the user motion to the workspace provided by the robot.",

Using an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), the approach combines both visual and kinesthetic information to track both the manipulators and object. From visual updates of the object and manipulators, and tactile updates, the method estimates both the robot's internal state and the object's pose. Nonlinear constraints are incorporated into the framework to deal with the an additional arm and ensure the state is consistent. Two frameworks are compared in which the first framework run two single arm filters in parallel and the second consists of the augment dual arm filter with nonlinear constraints. Experiments on a wheel changing task are demonstrated using the DARPA ARM-S system, consisting of dual Barrett- WAM manipulators.",

We present an optical tactile sensor in the form of a compliant elastomer 'fingertip' tracked by a high-speed low-resolution image sensor with on-board signal processing. We propose a dual-mode bio-mimetic control loop, where in reflex mode the sensor sends fast reflexive action commands directly to actuators, bypassing the central controller to minimise reaction times. For higher-level interpretation, a slower explore mode enables more sophisticated processing of the sensory input by the central controller. We demonstrate sensing of normal force in both modes of operation, showing that in reflex mode we are able to rapidly detect the presence of forces and compute an approximate magnitude estimate while in explore mode we are able to perform more accurate force measurements.",

This method called DIDIM (Direct and Inverse Dynamic Identification Models) was previously validated on rigid robots and is now extended to a flexible joint manipulator. DIDIM method for flexible joint manipulators is derived into a three-step procedure: first, a rigid low frequency dynamic model is identified with DIDIM method; second, approximate values of the inertia ratio and stiffness are identified using the total inertia and friction values of step 1 and classical non linear programming algorithm; third, all the dynamic parameters (inertia, friction, stiffness) of the flexible robot are more accurately identified all together, starting from the values identified in step 1 and 2 and using the DIDIM method. An experimental setup exhibits results and shows the effectiveness of our approach compared with a classical output error methods.",

For example, Dynamic Manipulability Ellipsoid (DME) describes a distribution of hand acceleration produced by normalized joint torque. On the other hand, Reconfiguration Manipulability Ellipsoid (RME) denotes a distribution of each link velocity produced by joint angular velocity. This paper shows new index of Dynamic Reconfiguration Manipulability (DRM) combined dynamic manipulability and reconfiguration manipulability, and we have adopted the DRM to a humanoid robot, exhibiting how the DRM indicates directly the configuration-changeability of walking humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "We present the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), a wearable robot designed to assist human workers with additional arms and legs attached to the wearer's body. The SRL can work closely with the wearer by holding an object, positioning a workpiece, operating a powered tool, securing the human body, and more. Although the SRL has the potential to provide the wearer with greater strength, higher accuracy, flexibility, and dexterity, its control performance is hindered by unpredictable disturbances due to involuntary motions of the wearer, which include postural sway and physiological tremor. This paper presents 1) a Kalman filter approach to estimate the state of the SRL despite the involuntary wearer's motion, and 2) a method for improving the accuracy and stabilizing the human body and the SRL. The dynamics of the human-SRL system are analyzed, including human-induced disturbance models based on biomechanics literature. A discrete Kalman filter is constructed and its performance is evaluated in terms of error covariance. A \u201cbracing\u201d technique is then introduced to suppress the human-induced disturbances; one robotic limb grasps an environment structure and uses it as a support to attenuate the disturbances. We show how bracing can be used to shape the stiffness parameters at the robot base.

        "abstract": "Underwater autonomous gliders (UAG) such as Slocum electric gliders provide an effective platform and tool for marine and coastal scientists to conduct prolonged missions over weeks or months. However, localization of these gliders underneath ocean surface is challenging due to the lack of inexpensive, effective underwater positioning sensors. In this paper, we present a dynamic model-based localization scheme to improve the positioning estimation of UAG. The new localization approach is built on an experimentally validated dynamic model and fused with onboard depth and yaw angle sensor measurements. We compare and validate the proposed scheme with dead reckoning and the ground truth.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses a dynamic nonprehensile manipulation of a deformable object, where the shape of a thin object is dynamically controlled by the plate's rapid motion. After explaining the manipulation principle, we introduce a simplified analytical model where an object is modeled by two mass points and the plate has two degrees of freedom: a translational motion and a rotational one. After categorizing jump patterns of the mass point with considering the plate's acceleration, we show that gait-like behaviors of the object are generated on the periodic plate's motion. Through simulation analysis, we show the deformation velocity transition of the object with respect to the amplitude of plate's acceleration. We reveal that the transition is characterized by particular amplitudes which govern the jump patterns of the mass point. We make clear that the optimum plate's motion leading to the maximal deformation velocity exists on one of such particular amplitudes.",

        "abstract": "Off-line dynamic identification requires the use of a model linear in relation to the robot dynamic parameters and the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters. Most of time, the used model is the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM). However, the computation of its symbolic expressions is extremely tedious. In order to simplify the procedure, the use of the Power Identification Model (PIM), which is dramatically simpler to obtain and that contains exactly the same dynamic parameters as the IDIM, was previously proposed. However, even if the identification of the PIM parameters for a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) planar serial robot was successful, its fails to work for 6 DOF industrial robots. This paper discloses the reasons of this failure and presents a methodology for the identification of the robot dynamic parameters using the PIM. The method is experimentally validated on an industrial 6 DOF St\u00e4ubli TX-40 robot.",

We also present a new dataset consisting of a 6 km outdoor path traversed once per month for a period of 5 months, which contains several challenges including short-term and long-term dynamic behaviour, lateral deviations in the path, repetitive scene appearances and strong illumination changes. We show superior performance of the dynamic mapping system compared to state-of-the-art techniques on our dataset.",

Arm movements assist with stability and recovery for ground robots, in particular humanoids and dynamically balancing vehicles. However, there is little work in aerial robotics where the manipulators themselves facilitate flight stability or the load mass is repositioned in flight for added control. We present recent results in arm motions that achieve increased flight stability without and with different load masses attached to the end-effectors. Our test flight results indicate that we can accurately model and control our aerial vehicle when both moving the manipulators and interacting with target objects.",

The challenge arises when the human goal/plan is uncertain or unknown to the robot. In this paper we propose a novel control scheme which dynamically selects between a model-based and a model-free strategy depending on the level of disagreement between the human and the robot. The disagreement is measured in terms of the interaction force. A task specific model-based controller is selected when the human's motion intention coincides with the robot's goal. A model-free control scheme based on the human force as motion prediction source is selected in case of disagreement and when the human goal/plan is unknown. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated in a human user study on human-robot cooperative object transport through a 2D maze in virtual reality.",

Sidewinding locomotion is treated as a planar movement for simplicity, and the normal forces acting on the grounded links and the torques applied on pitch joints are calculated by solving equilibrium equations. Energy efficiency of sidewinding locomotion is compared with that of lateral undulation. Simulation results show that the sidewinding locomotion is, generally, energetically more efficient, and in the case where the viscous coefficient is small, there is a lower bound in the mean velocity of center of mass for sidewinding locomotion to be more efficient than lateral undulation.",

Rapid advances in various cell- and molecule-based biomedical applications have led to increasing demands for the precise and proactive control of cell chemotaxis movement. This paper presents the development of a robot-aided optical manipulation tool for dynamics analysis and automated control of cell chemotaxis movement. Cell locomotion model is developed to characterize the relationship between the chemoattractant and the forces that govern the cell migration. The microparticles, releasing a chemokine while in motion, are optically trapped and robotically controlled to induce cell polarization and migration. Experiments performed on migrating leukemia cancer cells demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The arising research income of this paper will benefit the development of an automated control strategy for cell migration, targeting at the novel therapies in the future medicine.",

        "abstract": "Optical manipulation of biological cells has recently attracted increasing attention in bioscience and nanotechnology, where optical tweezers are used as end-effectors to manipulate the cells with high precision and flexibility. Analysis of the dynamics of the optically trapped cells plays a critical role in many cell manipulation tasks such as the automatic cell transportation and force transducer. This paper presents a novel approach to calibrating the cell dynamics with the adaptive control technology. According to different measurements, two adaptive tracking controllers are designed, based on which the estimated parameters of the cell trapping dynamics (i.e., the rate of viscous coefficient and trapping stiffness) can automatically converge to the true values. Stability of the adaptive controllers and convergence of the estimated parameters are analyzed by using Lyapunov approach. Simulations and experiments of manipulating yeast cells are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In contrast to RANSAC-based methods which follow a hypothesis-and-verify approach, ERODE employs instead the whole set of observations together with a robust kernel to perform robustified least-squares minimization. Our proposal has important practical applications among computer vision problems, which we demonstrate with stereovisual odometry experiments with both simulated and real data.",

This paper formulates mechanical function as a product of both effector's shape and motion, and, assuming a fixed motion model, explores the role of shape in satisfying it. We assume that the desired mechanical function is expressed as a set of constraints on the geometry of contact, and develop the tools for transforming these constraints into an effector shape. A previous paper [1] addressed the special case of revolute or prismatic fingers. This paper develops the more general case, including all smooth 1DOF planar mechanisms. The technique is illustrated with the design of finger shapes to improve the stability of a planar grasp of an object.",

We discuss hardware considerations for design of robots at this scale, and the benefits of a direct-drive system over coupled transmissions.

        "abstract": "Rich scene understanding from 3-D point clouds is a challenging task that requires contextual reasoning, which is typically computationally expensive. The task is further complicated when we expect the scene analysis algorithm to also efficiently handle data that is continuously streamed from a sensor on a mobile robot. Hence, we are typically forced to make a choice between 1) using a precise representation of the scene at the cost of speed, or 2) making fast, though inaccurate, approximations at the cost of increased misclassifications. In this work, we demonstrate that we can achieve the best of both worlds by using an efficient and simple representation of the scene in conjunction with recent developments in structured prediction in order to obtain both efficient and state-of-the-art classifications. Furthermore, this efficient scene representation naturally handles streaming data and provides a 300% to 500% speedup over more precise representations.",

Additionally, we leverage this result to improve the consistency of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimator introduced for efficiently processing line observations over a sliding time-window at cost only linear in the number of line features. Finally, we validate the proposed algorithm experimentally using a miniature-size camera and a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-quality inertial measurement unit (IMU).",

Single parts need to be picked out of the boxes and have to be fed to a machine. The task of automatically isolating single objects is known as the bin-picking problem. Even in modern factories the task of bin-picking is not automated widely yet. The automatization of this task is expensive since state-of-the-art solutions require object-class specific algorithms. In this paper we present an applicable solution for the bin-picking problem which is based on a standard 3d-sensor and is able to handle arbitrary objects. Furthermore, it is robust against noise and object occlusions. Additionally, we propose an approach for optimal grasp pose estimation with collision avoidance that effectively reduces system cycle times.",

In the extreme, our algorithm can handle up to one million robots on a grid with one billion vertices in approximately 30 minutes. Perhaps more importantly, we prove that with high probability, the algorithm supplies paths with total distance within a constant multiple of the optimal total distance. Furthermore, our hierarchical method also allows these paths to be scheduled with a tight completion time guarantee. In practice, our implementation yields a total path distance less than two times of the true optimum and a much shorter completion time.",

        "abstract": "A large number of robotic, computer vision and computer graphics applications rely on efficiently solving the associated sparse linear systems. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure from motion (SfM), non-rigid shape recovery, and elastodynamic simulations are only few examples in this direction. In general, these problems are nonlinear and the solution can be approximated by incrementally solving a series of linearized problems. In some applications, the size of the system considerably affects the performance, especially when the sparsity is low. This paper exploits the block structure of such problems and offers very efficient solutions to manipulate block matrices within iterative nonlinear solvers. The resulting method considerably speeds-up the execution of the implementation of the nonlinear optimization problem. In this work, in particular, we focus our effort on testing the method on SLAM applications, but the applicability of the technique remains general. Our implementation outperforms the state of the art SLAM implementations on all tested datasets. In incremental mode, where a larger portion of time is spent in updating the system, our implementation is on average two times faster than the others.",

        "abstract": "A dynamic model of a jump glider is presented and correlated with the results obtained with a prototype glider. The glider uses a carbon fiber spring and a main wing that pivots approximately parallel to the airflow during ascent and latches into place for a gliding descent. The robot demonstrates longer traveled distance than an equivalent drag-free ballistic mass. A detailed numerical and a simplified algebraic model are also introduced, which are useful for exploring design tradeoffs and performance. These models suggest ways to improve the traveled distance and indicate that with modest variations in the wing angle of attack during ascent, one can choose from a variety of launch angles to accommodate variations in ground friction without greatly compromising range.",

In contrast to many current approaches which plan as far ahead as possible using as much environment information as is available, our approach considers only a small set of poses (vector of joint angles) neighbouring the robot's current pose in configuration space. Our approach is compared to an existing exploration strategy for a similar robot. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in the number of information gain estimation calculations that need to be performed, while still gathering an equivalent or increased amount of information about the environment.",

We introduce a fragment of linear temporal logic that can be used to specify common motion planning tasks such as safe navigation, response to the environment, persistent coverage, and surveillance. This fragment is computationally efficient; the complexity of control policy synthesis is a doubly-exponential improvement over standard linear temporal logic for both non-deterministic transition systems and Markov decision processes. This improvement is possible because we compute directly on the original system, as opposed to the automata-based approach commonly used. We give simulation results for representative motion planning tasks and compare to generalized reactivity(1).",

In contrast to previous techniques which typically address this problem in batch and/or through graphical models, we demonstrate that by learning visual similarities between pixels across frames, a simple filtering algorithm is able to achieve high performance predictions in an efficient and online/causal manner. Our technique is a meta-algorithm that can be efficiently wrapped around any scene analysis technique that produces a per-pixel semantic category distribution. We validate our approach over three different scene analysis techniques on three different datasets that contain different semantic object categories. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is very efficient in practice and substantially improves the consistency of the predictions over time.",

        "abstract": "Many robotic systems deal with uncertainty by performing a sequence of information gathering actions. In this work, we focus on the problem of efficiently constructing such a sequence by drawing an explicit connection to submodularity. Ideally, we would like a method that finds the optimal sequence, taking the minimum amount of time while providing sufficient information. Finding this sequence, however, is generally intractable. As a result, many well-established methods select actions greedily. Surprisingly, this often performs well. Our work first explains this high performance - we note a commonly used metric, reduction of Shannon entropy, is submodular under certain assumptions, rendering the greedy solution comparable to the optimal plan in the offline setting. However, reacting online to observations can increase performance. Recently developed notions of adaptive submodularity provide guarantees for a greedy algorithm in this online setting. In this work, we develop new methods based on adaptive submodularity for selecting a sequence of information gathering actions online. In addition to providing guarantees, we can capitalize on submodularity to attain additional computational speedups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in simulation and on a robot.",

The output is a set of fixation points that indicate the potential location of the target object in the image. The proposed approach outperforms purely bottom-up approaches - saliency maps of Itti et al. [15], and kernel descriptors of Bo et al.

We assume that the sensor nodes can transmit within a certain region around their position, which is called the communication set. We model the communication set as a convex set to take into account asymmetric transmission systems (like directional antennas). We derive a necessary condition for the optimality of a mobile robot tour through the communication sets. Based on this condition, we design a three-step approach to compute a local minimum of the optimization problem. We prove that our solution is guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the global optimal solution. Our algorithm works for both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional sensor networks where the sensor nodes are heterogeneous and can have directional communication properties. In contrast, existing algorithms for computing data collecting routes are for planar sensor networks and assume the communication sets to be discs. We also present simulation results depicting the performance of our algorithm.",

The optimum conditions of locomotion were obtained as a function of the number of cells, friction coefficients, stroke length, energy recovery factor, and tangential compliance. In this paper we focus on the energy requirements of inchworms which, unlike earthworms, consume energy both during the locomotion of the cells and the clamping. In order to estimate the energy requirements, an experiment was performed on the aorta of a bull in which the normal and tangential compliances were obtained. The analysis allows us to compare between inchworms, regular earthworms and earthworms with lower forward coefficient of friction, and determine which of the devices is more efficient with given environment conditions. We also propose a new gait of locomotion for inchworms which reduces the energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Step planning is becoming an increasingly important research topic for humanoid robots. Most cost functions for step planning in the literature are designed based on terrain information. The energy cost to perform each step action is usually ignored. In walking, energy consumption depends on gait features such as step length and width. In this paper, we use three simple and intuitive energy cost functions for different step lengths, widths, and the turning angle. These functions are inspired by literature on human walking energy analysis, and the function parameters are tuned to match computed costs for optimal humanoid walking motions obtained by simulation. The energy cost and the terrain cost are combined to obtain an optimal step planning sequence using A* search.",

        "abstract": "In the last years the classical optimal control of rigid structures gives way to alternatives both in hardware (elastic structures) as in software (non-linear control). In this work we consider both alternatives together. We test the possibility to apply speed-gradient (SG) control [1] to elastic structures. The SG method has many advantages, e.g. exploitation of natural dynamics of the system and mathematically provable criteria of goal achievement. However the cost function that satisfies the requirements of the SG method may be difficult to find. In this work we propose two approaches to this problem: usage of virtual springs and usage of learning methods based on Slow Feature Analysis (SFA). A classical example of a cart-pole system and an example of a system which uses two serial springs for hopping show in simulation the viability of our approach. Proposed here combination of SG control with learning is a novel approach which opens interesting perspectives for further research on passive control.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous aerial soaring presents a unique opportunity to extend the flight duration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we examine the problem of a gliding UAV searching for a ground target while simultaneously collecting energy from known thermal energy sources. The problem is posed as a tree search problem by noting that a long-duration mission can be divided into similar segments of flying between and climbing in thermals. The algorithm attempts to maximise the probability of detecting a target by exploring a tree of the possible thermal-to-thermal transitions to a fixed search depth and executing the highest utility plan. The sensitivity of the algorithm to different search depths is explored, and the method is compared against a locally-optimal myopic search algorithm. In larger, more complicated problems, the suggested method outperforms myopic search by sacrificing short-term utility to reach more valuable exploration areas later in the mission.",

Moreover, they are unable to account for geometry, magnetization and any physical imperfections of the magnetic source. This paper presents a novel method of modeling the magnetic field of axisymmetric permanent magnets with artificial neural networks (ANNs), which permits accurate field modeling even at close proximity to the magnet. ANN based field models used to characterize experimental field data of solid and annular cylindrical magnets were found to be on average at least 10 times more accurate than that of dipole based models. Using model-based localization, tracking results from following a predetermined figure `8' path were also promising, with an average error of 0.43 mm in XY plane and 0.93 mm in XZ plane from only three sensor inputs.",

T-RRT has been successfully applied to diverse problems in robotics and structural biology. In this paper, we aim at enhancing T-RRT to solve ever more difficult problems involving larger and more complex cost spaces. We compare several variants of T-RRT by evaluating them on various motion planning problems involving different types of cost functions and different levels of geometrical complexity. First, we explain why applying as such classical extensions of RRT to T-RRT is not helpful, both in a mono-directional and in a bidirectional context. Then, we propose an efficient Bidirectional T-RRT, based on a bidirectional scheme tailored to cost spaces. Finally, we illustrate the new possibilities offered by the Bidirectional T-RRT on an industrial inspection problem.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates how to design a comfortable wrist exoskeleton which complies with the natural coordination mechanisms in the redundant wrist. Human sensorimotor control is known to impose intrinsic kinematic constraints to solve redundant motor tasks. To this end, the effect of an exoskeleton on natural motor strategies was assessed during pointing tasks performed with the wrist. The exoskeleton was designed based on the kinematic model of one specific subject. Then wrist orientation was observed during pointing tasks with the exoskeleton in the following conditions: i) optimal alignment between human and exoskeleton joints; ii) varying degrees of misalignment between human and exoskeleton joints; iii) optimal alignment while the PS axis was locked (i.e. no redundancy). The results exhibited a modification of the natural coordination mechanisms characterized by a subject-specific Koenderink shape index. Kruskal-Wallis pairwise analyses demonstrated a significant variation between test conditions indicating a change of intrinsic constraints with misalignment and locked PS. The assessment methodologies presented in this paper can be used to test for ergonomic constraints and can guide the design of robotic systems performing kinematically redundant tasks.",

This analysis focuses on a problem arising in tracking systems with both optical and inertial sensors. Optical sensors always need a line-of-sight, and a natural idea is to continue tracking using only inertial sensors during an occlusion when the line-of-sight is lost. Several error sources are present in inertial tracking; here we consider the error due to sensor noise which cannot be compensated and is present even if the setup is perfectly calibrated and initialized. The result of this analysis is a mathematical expression for the expected error as a function of time and provides an answer to the following two questions: Depending on the precision needed and the inertial sensors employed, for how long is purely inertial tracking possible? Which sensor characteristics have to be improved to decrease the tracking error?",

The RoboBee is a sub-100 mg flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicle that is able to lift its own weight under external power, but, like flying insects, is unstable in flight without active feedback. We discuss design and characterization of two low-latency insect-inspired sensors for flight control: an antenna to sense airspeed and light-sensing ocelli to estimate attitude angle relative to a luminous sky. We demonstrate accurate wind velocity estimation in a wind tunnel despite the effect of nearby flapping wings.We also demonstrate pitch angle control using the ocelli on a wire-mounted RoboBee that is free to rotate about its pitch axis. These flight-weight sensors are essential first steps toward autonomous upright stability and controlled forward motions.",

Higher engagement would suggest a greater degree of interest in, and attention to, the material presented. These findings will seed future gaze tracking systems that will enable robots to estimate listeners' state. By tracking audience gaze, our goal is to enable robots to cater the type of content and manner of its presentation to the preferences or educational goals of a particular crowd, e.g. in a tour guide, classroom or entertainment setting.",

        "abstract": "Environmental monitoring of spatially-distributed geo-physical processes (e.g., temperature, pressure, or humidity) requires efficient sampling schemes, particularly, when employing an autonomous mobile agent to execute the sampling task. Many approaches have considered optimal sampling strategies which specialize in minimizing estimation error, while others emphasize reducing resource usage, yet rarely are both of these performance parameters used concurrently to influence the navigation. This work discusses how a spatial estimation process and resource awareness are integrated to generate an informed navigation policy for collecting useful measurement information. We also enable a direct comparison between this informed navigation method and more common approaches using two performance metrics. We show that our informed navigation outperforms these approaches based on performance evaluation as a function of estimation error and resource usage for a useful range of coverage within the sampling area.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new grasp force efficiency (GFE) measure that considers not only contact point locations but also the hand configuration and mechanism. GFE evaluates the largest wrench applied to the object that the grasp can resist with unit contact forces. Traditional GFE measures depend solely on the contact point locations without considering how the unit contact forces are generated. Intuitively, however, the actuators' effort required to generate unit contact forces depends on the hand configuration and mechanism and therefore should affect the grasp efficiency. For example, generating a unit contact force with an under-actuated finger would be more difficult than with a fully actuated finger. Our new GFE measure addresses this issue and is potentially useful for hand mechanism design as well as grasp planning. We also present a novel geometry-based iterative algorithm for computing the generalized penetration distance of a point in an arbitrary convex set. The algorithm allows unified and accurate computation of the new and traditional GFE measures with various criteria without linear approximation. Other applications of the algorithm include penetration depth computation of two convex objects for physics simulation.",

        "abstract": "Underactuation represents a solution to reduce the number of Degrees of Freddom (DoF) of robotic hands. Altough reducing the number of DoFs in general limits the ability to perform many and different types of grasp, the use of springs in the structure improves the compliance of the grasp and mitigates the loss of generality due to the reduction of DoFs in the mechanical structure. The use of active and passive elastic elements improves robustness of the whole grasp. In this paper we evaluate the grasp stiffness which depends on the structural compliance of hand links and joints and of the contacts, and on the gains of impedance controllers. A quasi-static model of the grasp for underactuated hands is presented and used to explicitly compute the grasp compliance.",

        "abstract": "Mapping is an important task for mobile robots. But assessing the quality of maps in a simple, efficient and automated way is not trivial and an ongoing research topic. A new approach on map evaluation is presented here. It is based on Topology Graphs as a topological, abstracted representation of 2D grid maps. The Topology Graphs are derived from Voronoi Diagrams that get post-processed to capture the high-level spatial structures. Based on a similarity metric on vertices in Topology Graphs, the vertices can be matched across maps and spatial (dis)similarities and hence errors in the mapping can be identified and measured. More precisely, the vertex-similarity is the basis to match the structures of Topology Graphs up to the identification of subgraph isomorphisms through wave-front propagation. This allows to determine important map quality attributes up to very challenging structural elements like brokenness, i.e., the number of locally correct partitions in the candidate map and their relative placement towards each other. Experiments with real robot generated maps including examples from various teams in the RoboCup Rescue competition are used to validate the usefulness of this method for map quality assessment.",

A novel concept of a pick-and-place robot arm is considered, which is called the resonating arm (RA). It uses a nonlinear spring mechanism to generate pick-and-place motions without the need for powerful actuators. This improves energy efficiency, cost and weight of the robot arm. Because of the complex interactions of the spring mechanism and the controller, we use evolutionary co-optimization to optimize the RA system as a whole. The results reveal that evolutionary co-optimization yields near optimal solutions for a 1 degree of freedom (1-DOF) RA, which require 43% less torque than the solution found through a separate optimization of the system and the control parameters. In case of a 2-DOF RA, evolutionary co-optimization resulted in credible solutions as well, but with less consistency.",

Proper treatment of these objective functions, while commonplace in fields such as economics, is often overlooked in robotics. Additionally, optimization of the performance of robotic systems can be restricted due to the expensive nature of testing control parameters on a physical system. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm for expensive-to-evaluate functions that generates a Pareto set of solutions. This algorithm is compared against another leading MOO algorithm, and then used to optimize the speed and head stability of the sidewinding gait for a snake robot.",

        "abstract": "Coverage of a given area by means of coordinated autonomous robots is a mission required in several applications such as, for example, patrolling, monitoring or environmental sampling. From a mathematical perspective, this can often be modeled as the need to estimate a scalar field, eventually time varying as in the security applications. In this paper, the problem is addressed for the challenging underwater scenario, where localization and communication pose additional constraints. The solution exploits the appealing properties of the Voronoi partition of a convex set within a probabilistic framework. In addition, the algorithm is totally distributed and characterized by a strong engineering perspective allowing the handling of asynchronous communication or possible loss or adjunct of vehicles. Beyond the test in dozen of numerical case studies, the algorithm has been validated by a challenging underwater test in 3 dimension involving two Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The experiments were run in the La Spezia harbor, in Italy, in February 2012 as demo of the European project Co3AUVs.",

        "abstract": "Marine robots are an increasingly attractive means for observing and monitoring in the ocean, but underwater acoustic communication (\u201cacomms\u201d) remains a major challenge, especially for real-time control. Packet loss occurs widely, bit rates are low, and there are significant delays. We consider here strategies for feedback control with acomms links in either the sensor-controller channel, or the controller-actuator channel. On the controller-actuator side we implement sparse packetized predictive control (S-PPC), which simultaneously addresses packet-loss and the data rate limit. For the sensor-controller channel we study a modified information filter (MIF) in a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control scheme. Field experiments were carried out with both approaches, regulating crosstrack error in a robotic kayak using acomms. Outcomes with both the S-PPC and MIF LQG confirm that good performance is achievable.",

As a first step towards LROD, we automatically process the raw video stream of an entire workday of a robotic agent to discover objects. We claim that the key to achieve this goal is to incorporate domain knowledge whenever available, in order to detect and adapt to changes in the environment. We propose a general graph-based formulation for LROD in which generic domain knowledge is encoded as constraints. Our formulation enables new sources of domain knowledge\u2014metadata\u2014to be added dynamically to the system, as they become available or as conditions change. By adding domain knowledge, we discover 2.7\u00b7 more objects and decrease processing time 190 times. Our optimized implementation, HerbDisc, processes 6 h 20 min of RGBD video of real human environments in 18 min 30 s, and discovers 121 correct novel objects with their 3D models.",

        "abstract": "Sidewinding is an efficient translational gait used by biological snakes to locomote over flat ground. Prior work has identified the fact that it is possible to steer the moving direction of sidewinding. The previously proposed virtual tread model reveals the working principal of sidewinding from a geometric point of view. Unfortunately, the implementation of the virtual tread model relied on a computationally expensive numerical fitting algorithm that impeded online applications. Motivated by this limitation, in this work we propose a novel approach to develop analytical expressions for snake robot gaits based on the study of the corresponding geometric model. This approach is rooted in the identification of dominant frequency components afforded by the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Applying this method to the virtual tread model for conical sidewinding, we derive an analytical expression between the parameters that describe the gait's motion and the turning radius of the system moving in the world. This analytical expression, which we call the extended gait equation, is verified by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In constraint-based programming, robot tasks are specified and solved as optimization problems with sets of constraints and one or multiple objective functions. In our previous work, we presented (i) a generic modeling approach for geometrically complex robot tasks, including the modeling of parametric uncertainty, in order to allow the robot task programmer to specify the optimization problem without explicitly writing down the different (possibly numerous and involved) constraint equations, and (ii) methods for solving these optimization problem online in the instantaneous case (reactive control), and offline in the non-instantaneous case (trajectory planning). This paper has two contributions. First, it extends our framework to include task constraints (e.g. tracking a curve) that are not given as explicit functions of time. These constraints are highly relevant in practice, for example to facilitate time-optimal path planning combined with other constraints. Second, it extends our framework to user-configurable task horizons when solving the optimization problem, to allow task programmers to make a trade-off between computational speed and (global) task optimality. Both of these novel framework extensions are illustrated by a time-optimal laser tracing experiment.",

The method is based on task-oriented dynamics model learning and a robust disturbance state observer. The combination of both leads to an efficient torque observer that can be incorporated to any control scheme. The use of a learning-based approach avoids the need of analytical models of joints' friction or Coriolis dynamics effects.",

This method can be used for 3 dimensional cell assembly by embedding cells in the thermoresponsive gel structures. Gel blocks can be maintained the gel condition by the hysteresis character and the microstructures can be formed by assembling the gel blocks. The temperature distribution around a microheater was analyzed to generate the thermoresponsive gel and avoid thermal damages to cells. The generation of thermoresponsive gel was conducted using the microheater which was embedded in a probe tip and manipulated by a micromanipulator. The fabrication of a gel block was achieved using the hysteresis character and the fabricated gel block was picked and placed by the probe. Cells were embedded in the gel by controlling the position of microheater to avoid the influence of thermal convection flow. The positioning of the gel blocks can be precisely controlled by the micromanipulator. The results indicate the method we propose has a great possibility to achieve 3D cell assembly without large stress to cells during the assembly and cell culture.",

This paper presents a pattern recognition approach for the interpretation of FCSs in terms of valence, based on the selection of discriminative subsequences in video data. These subsequences capture important temporal dynamics and are used as prototypical reference subsequences in a classification procedure based on dynamic time warping and feature extraction with active appearance models. Using this valence classification, the robot can discriminate positive from negative interaction situations and react accordingly. The approach is evaluated on a database containing videos of people interacting with a robot by teaching the names of several objects to it. The verbal answer of the robot is expected to elicit the display of spontaneous FCSs by the human tutor, which were classified in this work. The achieved classification accuracies are comparable to the average human recognition performance and outperformed our previous results on this task.",

In this setting, every robot defines a preference function over parts of the task according to its sensing and motion capabilities. These preferences are described by density functions over the task. With such interpretation, we want to find an allocation of the global task that maximizes the probability of task completion. We first formulate the task distribution problem as a fair subdivision problem and provide a centralized algorithm to compute the allocations for each robot. We provide a complexity analysis and computational results of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the advance of the technology allows robots to acquire dense point clouds decreasing the price and increasing the performance. However, it is a hard task to deal with due to the large amount of points, the redundancy and the noise. This paper proposes an adaptable system to build a 3D feature model of point clouds using Gaussian Mixture Models. These 3D models are used in order to detect changes in the autonomous robot's working environment. The presented work describes an efficient change detection system based on two consecutive stages. First, a top-down approach estimates features using Gaussian Mixture Models. The presented new approach improves the performance of previous related works in terms of computational load and robustness, nevertheless the system is selection criteria dependent. Thus, the efficiency of different selection criteria are evaluated and compared in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the Minimum Distance Length (MDL) criteria outperforms the other studied methods. In the second stage, a change detection method is performed using the previously estimate Mixture of Gaussians. The proposed full system is able to detect changes using Gaussian Mixture Models with a reduced computational cost in relation to state-of-art algorithms.",

The proposed method performs a low-level shape matching by wrapping multiple cords around an object in order to quickly isolate promising grasping spots. From these spots, hand palm posture can be computed followed by a standard close-until-contact procedure to find the contact points. Along with the contacts information, the finger kinematics is then used to filter the unstable grasps. Through multiple simulated examples with a twelve degrees-of-freedom anthropomorphic hand, we demonstrate that our method can compute good grasps for objects with complex geometries in a short amount of time. Best of all, this is achieved without complex model preprocessing like segmentation by parts and medial axis extraction.",

        "abstract": "A human detection algorithm running on an indoor mobile robot has to address challenges including occlusions due to cluttered environments, changing backgrounds due to the robot's motion, and limited on-board computational resources. We introduce a fast human detection algorithm for mobile robots equipped with depth cameras. First, we segment the raw depth image using a graph-based segmentation algorithm. Next, we apply a set of parameterized heuristics to filter and merge the segmented regions to obtain a set of candidates. Finally, we compute a Histogram of Oriented Depth (HOD) descriptor for each candidate, and test for human presence with a linear SVM. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a publicly available dataset of humans in an open area as well as our own dataset of humans in a cluttered cafe environment. Our algorithm performs comparably well on a single CPU core against another HOD-based algorithm that runs on a GPU even when the number of training examples is decreased by half. We discuss the impact of the number of training examples on performance, and demonstrate that our approach is able to detect humans in different postures (e.g. standing, walking, sitting) and with occlusions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for recognizing places in indoor environments based on the extraction of planar regions from range data provided by a hand-held RGB-D sensor. We propose to build a plane-based map (PbMap) consisting of a set of 3D planar patches described by simple geometric features (normal vector, centroid, area, etc.). This world representation is organized as a graph where the nodes represent the planar patches and the edges connect planes that are close by. This map structure permits to efficiently select subgraphs representing the local neighborhood of observed planes, that will be compared with other subgraphs corresponding to local neighborhoods of planes acquired previously. To find a candidate match between two subgraphs we employ an interpretation tree that permits working with partially observed and missing planes. The candidates from the interpretation tree are further checked out by a rigid registration test, which also gives us the relative pose between the matched places. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is an efficient way to solve this problem, working satisfactorily even when there are substantial changes in the scene (lifelong maps).",

        "abstract": "Temporal projection is the computational problem of predicting what will happen when a robot executes its plan. Temporal projection for everyday manipulation tasks such as table setting and cleaning is a challenging task. Symbolic projection methods developed in Artificial Intelligence are too abstract to reason about how to place objects such that they do not hinder future actions. Simulation-based projection is fine-grained enough but computationally too expensive as it is not able to abstract away from the execution of uninteresting actions (such as navigation). In this paper we propose a novel temporal projection mechanism that combines the strengths of both approaches: it is able to abstract away from the execution of continuous but uninteresting actions and provides the realism and fine grainedness needed to reason about critical situations.",

The system runs at frequencies of 30Hz and higher in a single thread on a desktop CPU with no GPU acceleration required. We recover the unconstrained 6-DoF trajectory of a moving camera by aligning sparse features observed in the current RGB-D image against a model of previous features. The model is persistent and dynamically updated from new observations using a Kalman Filter. We formulate a novel uncertainty measure for sparse RGD-B features based on a Gaussian mixture model for the filtering stage. Our registration algorithm is capable of closing small-scale loops in indoor environments online without any additional SLAM back-end techniques.",

Our actuation system allows us to move the ShadowHand skeleton faster than a human hand (70 msec limit-to-limit movement, 30 msec overall reflex latency), generate sufficient forces (40 N at each finger tendon, 125N at each wrist tendon), and achieve high compliance on the mechanism level (6 grams of external force at the fingertip displaces the finger when the system is powered.) This combination of speed, force and compliance is a prerequisite for dexterous manipulation, yet it has never before been achieved with a tendon-driven system, let alone a system with 24 degrees of freedom and 40 tendons.",

An extension of the Particle Swarm Optimization to multi-robot applications was recently proposed and denoted as Robotic Darwinian PSO (RDPSO). This paper contributes with a further extension of the RDPSO, by integrating a fault-tolerant distributed search in order to prevent communication network splits. To that end, each robot performs packet forwarding according to a paradigm of multi-hop communication, thus maintaining a maximum range or minimum signal quality between its \u201cbest\u201d neighbors. This results in a sum of virtual forces for each robot to ensure a multi-connected MANET over time. Experimental results with 15 physical robots show that a more fault-tolerant strategy clearly influences the time needed to converge to the final solution but is less susceptible to robot failures.",

This allows for matching at any time, without requiring individual images to be stored representing each time of day, and matching is performed efficiently by simultaneously matching to the entire database. We further show how matching along image sequences can be incorporated into the system and adapt existing methods by allowing for non-zero acceleration.

        "abstract": "We study the feature-based map merging problem in robot networks. Each robot observes the environment and builds a local map. Simultaneously, robots communicate and compute the global map of the environment; this communication is range-limited. We propose a dynamic strategy based on consensus algorithms that is fully distributed and does not rely on any particular communication topology. Robots reach consensus on the latest global map, using the increments between their previous and current local maps. Under mild connectivity conditions, our merging algorithm asymptotically converges to the global map. We give proofs of unbiasedness of this global map, at each step and robot. Our approach has been validated using real RGB-D images.",

        "abstract": "Rhythmic motor primitives can be used to learn a variety of oscillatory behaviors from demonstrations or reward signals, e.g., hopping, walking, running and ball-bouncing. However, frequently, such rhythmic motor primitives lead to failures unless a stabilizing controller ensures their functionality, e.g., a balance controller for a walking gait. As an ideal oscillatory behavior requires the stabilizing controller only for exceptions, e.g., to prevent failures, we devise an online learning approach that reduces the dependence on the stabilizing controller. Inspired by related approaches in model learning, we employ the stabilizing controller's output as a feedback error learning signal for adapting the gait. We demonstrate the resulting approach in two scenarios: a rhythmic arm's movements and gait adaptation of an underactuated biped.",

        "abstract": "Robotic and prosthetic hand designers are challenged to replicate as much functionality of the human hand as possible, while minimizing cost and any unnecessary complexity. Selecting which aspects of human hand function to emulate can be difficult, especially when little data is available on unstructured human manipulation behavior. The present work analyzes 19 hours of video with over 9000 grasp instances from two housekeepers and two machinists to find small sets of versatile human grasps. A novel grasp span metric is used to evaluate sets of grasps and pick an optimal grasp set which can effectively handle as many different objects as possible. The results show medium wrap and lateral pinch are both important, versatile grasps for basic object handling. The results suggest that three-fingertip precision grasps such as thumb-2 finger, tripod, or lateral tripod can be used to handle dexterous manipulation of a wide range of objects. The recommended grasp sets can help aid difficult design decisions for robotic and prosthetic hands, as well as suggesting important human hand functionality to restore during hand surgery or rehabilitate in an impaired hand.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of registering fingernail images using Active Appearance Models (AAM). A shape model is formed using two contours, one to trace the edge of the fingernail and a second to outline the edge of the finger. This model is used to create an AAM, which is then used to register several hundred images. Using the images and associated force measurements, three different models relating pixel intensity to finger contact force are formed. This process is repeated for eight subjects. These image-force models could then be used to measure the finger contact force without obstructing the haptic sense or instrumenting the object being touched, allowing for more natural interaction between human and robot. Two of the models are found to predict force with an RMS error of 0.3N normal force (4% of the full range) and 0.23N shear force (3% of the full range). These two models are also shown to be nearly independent of image resolution, with no significant difference in the results for resolutions between 10-by-10 and 50-by-50. The simpler of the two models relies on the Texture Parameters generated by the AAM. Since these parameters are already calculated as part of the registration process, this removes an additional calculation step and could lead to improved real-time processing.",

The quadrotor prototype discussed in this paper, on the other hand, has the ability to also control the orientation of its 4 propellers, thus making it possible to overcome the aforementioned underactuation and behave as a fully-actuated flying vehicle. We first illustrate the hardware/software specifications of our recently developed prototype, and then report the experimental results of some preliminary, but promising, flight tests which show the capabilities of this new UAV concept.",

Depth can however be inferred based on various cues in the image. Prior work has examined optical flow, and perspective cues, however these methods cannot handle frontal obstacles well. In this paper we examine the problem of detecting obstacles right in front of the vehicle. We developed a method to detect relative size changes of image patches that is able to detect size changes in the absence of optical flow. The method uses SURF feature matches in combination with template matching to compare relative obstacle sizes with different image spacing. We present results from our algorithm in autonomous flight tests on a small quadrotor. We are able to detect obstacles with a frame-to-frame enlargement of 120% with a high confidence and confirmed our algorithm in 20 successful flight experiments. In future work, we will improve the control algorithms to avoid more complicated obstacle configurations.",

The prototype makes use of a pair of relatively long elastic strings as the compliant structures. In this article, we experimentally analyze the wing kinematics and efficiency of a more compact prototype, where small helical springs are implemented instead of elastic strings. Since the proof-of-concept prototype validated the quasi-sinusoidal assumption in spite of nonlinear aerodynamic damping, incorporating instantaneous wing kinematics into the analysis is not necessary, simplifying experiments and data processing. Along with wing kinematics and system efficiency, the possibility of controlling the wing pair to flap independently is evaluated as well.",

        "abstract": "Fleas have a unique catapult mechanism with a special muscle configuration. Energy is stored in an elastic material, resilin, and the extensor muscle. Force is applied by the extensor muscle to generate a torque. Energy is released as a small triggering muscle reverses the direction of the aforementioned torque. A flea can jump 150 times its body length using this elastic catapult mechanism. In this paper, a flea-inspired catapult mechanism is presented. This mechanism can be categorized as an active storage and active release elastic catapult. Owing to its unique stiffness change characteristic, a shape-memory-alloy coil spring actuator enables the mimicking of the flea's catapult mechanism. Two types of flea-inspired jumping mechanisms were developed for verifying the feasibility of applying the concept to an efficient jumping robot. The first prototype has a flea-like appearance and the second is simplified to contain just the essential components of the flea-inspired catapult mechanism. The two prototypes are 20-mm- and 30-mm-long and can jump 64 cm and 120 cm, respectively. This unique catapult mechanism can be used not only for jumping robots but also for other small-sized robots to generate fast-releasing motion.",

Since the gripper is made of flexible polymer material and only the valves contacted with the object are opened to suck the surface, this gripper can hold a free-form surface such as having steps, curvatures, etc. Namely, the valve is autonomously switchable between open and close states. As the valve becomes small, the gripper can cope with higher step and higher curvature. We fabricate this gripper using Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology; this technology makes it possible to fabricating many elements with micrometer order high precision by batch processing. Two types of gripper were fabricated; one is a large-scale gripper for verifying the working principle, another is a miniature gripper based on MEMS. The absorbed weights of the large-scale and miniature grippers were 19.6 N (2 kgf) and 120 mN (12 gf), respectively.",

        "abstract": "Flexure joints are widely used to ensure manipulator mobility in difficult environmental conditions such as for micro-manipulation and in aerospace application. The use of flexure joints may imply complex kinematic behaviors that need to be considered to increase the device accuracy. This paper proposes, compares and analyzes three incremental models of the flexure joints used in an active wrist parallel telescope. A spherical joint model, a model issued from the beam theory and a stiffness model are considered. Because of uncertainties on the model parameters, an accurate experimental calibration with photogrammetry data is used to choose the most suitable model considering the telescope requirements. The experiments show that observability issue in calibration is the main factor limiting the model complexity in our case.",

It can control the position and attitude of an experimental model and measure the external forces and moments acting on the model. It can also reduce or remove magnetic control forces or moments, which are used as constraint forces or moments during levitation, for specifically selected degree of freedoms (DOFs). A yaw controller for a flapping-wing MAV model was systematically designed using these advantages of the MSBS. The performance of the controller was verified under a free yaw condition; a free flight condition was emulated for the yaw DOF during a wind tunnel test while the magnetic constraint moment for the yaw direction was removed and the other positions and attitudes of the model were fixed by the MSBS.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an underwater robot navigation strategy in flow. Our aim is to demonstrate that knowing the relative flow speed is advantageous because it permits using more energy efficient and stable control for trajectory following. We use a biomimetic robot that moves in uniform flow using a side-slipping maneuver. Side-slipping permits the robot to move laterally with respect to the incoming flow by exploiting its passive dynamics. The side-slipping maneuver is controlled by adjusting the heading of the robot with respect to the flow. We implement simple PID controllers for controlling the motion of the side-slipping robot laterally and transversely. Also, we compare the performance of the robot in the case where the robot does not know the flow speed. In this latter case the robot's heading towards the waypoint is controlled and the flow effect is considered as a disturbance compensated by the control algorithm. Comparative experiments demonstrate that it is advantageous for a robot to know not just its speed and orientation with respect to the world's frame of reference but also its local flow-relative speed. It permits the robot to follow trajectories more stable and using less energy. In the discussion section we propose possible future directions for implementing the on board flow-relative control.",

First, the total compliance is identified. Then, in the control phase, the desired pose of the tool center point is computed from the force control error. Thus standard position control may be applied. This leads to an inherently stable control scheme, even with a low sampling rate of the sensor interface and unknown environmental compliance. The method is designed for applications of industrial robots, e.g. assembly tasks. Parallel control considers the existence of a reference trajectory which allows feedforward in force controlled directions. The paper further examines couplings between forces and torques, which are important for partially constrained configurations. A possible impact force is considered when colliding with an unexpected object.",

Many research groups are focusing their efforts on the design of active locomotion methods to allow a complete maneuverability of the device along the gastrointestinal tract. A promising approach for locomotion is represented by master-slave magnetic coupling; however the typical large gradients of magnetic forces make device controllability very hard with important safety concerns: in this framework magnetic capsule localization and interaction force control become extremely relevant. In the present work, a preliminary on-line localization has been implemented obtaining a position feedback closed loop control of a magnetic driven capsule endoscope. Furthermore, interaction forces with the environment have been evaluated by exploiting a dedicated setup for magnetic dragging. Distributed charges-current and dipole-dipole magnetic models applied to capsule endoscopy have been investigated and results have been compared with experimentally measured magnetic forces. Advantages and limitations of employed models have been evaluated and their usability for Real-Time force calculation has been discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the path following problem of a wheeled mobile robot with rhombic like kinematics (two drivable and steerable wheels) operating in cluttered environments. Four path following controllers are developed to steer the kinematic model of a rhombic like vehicle (RLV) along a desired path: three are based on feedback laws derived at a kinematic level with geometrical inspiration; the fourth is a nonlinear controller built upon a kinematic model of the vehicle using Lyapunov functions. By fully exploiting the kinematic capabilities of this type of vehicles, all the developed controllers are capable of performing under two situations: when both wheels follow the same path, or when each wheel follows a different path. Simulated and experimental results are presented in the paper to illustrate the performance of the controllers. The main conclusions of these controllers are summarized, leading to a possible application in the vehicles that will operate in the remote handling missions of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).",

        "abstract": "The projection-based force reflection (PBFR) algorithms were previously demonstrated to substantially improve stability characteristics of the force reflecting teleoperator systems and haptic interfaces without transparency deterioration in the steady state; however, the transient response of the PFBR algorithms suffers from relatively slow force convergence. In particular, the high frequency component of the contact force, which is very important for the haptic perception of stiff surfaces, is typically filtered out. In this paper, a solution to this problem is proposed which is based on the idea to separate different frequency bands in the force reflection signal and consequently apply the projection-based principle to the low-frequency component, while reflecting the high-frequency component directly. It is shown that, for bilateral teleoperators with irregular communication delays, stability can always be achieved by implementing the above described force reflection scheme, if the cut-off frequency of the complementary filters is sufficiently high and a certain weighting coefficient in the force reflection algorithm is sufficiently low. Experimental results demonstrate that substantial simultaneous improvement of stability and transparency is achieved using the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The ability to learn from human demonstration is essential for robots in human environments. The activity models that the robot builds from observation must take both the human motion and the objects involved into account. Object models designed for this purpose should reflect the role of the object in the activity - its function, or affordances. The main contribution of this paper is to represent object directly in terms of their interaction with human hands, rather than in terms of appearance. This enables the direct representation of object affordances/function, while being robust to intra-class differences in appearance. Object hypotheses are first extracted from a video sequence as tracks of associated image segments. The object hypotheses are encoded as strings, where the vocabulary corresponds to different types of interaction with human hands. The similarity between two such object descriptors can be measured using a string kernel. Experiments show these functional descriptors to capture differences and similarities in object affordances/function that are not represented by appearance.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose to reconstruct a complete 3-D model of an unknown object by fusion of visual and tactile information while the object is grasped. Assuming the object is symmetric, a first hypothesis of its complete 3-D shape is generated from a single view. This initial model is used to plan a grasp on the object which is then executed with a robotic manipulator equipped with tactile sensors. Given the detected contacts between the fingers and the object, the full object model including the symmetry parameters can be refined. This refined model will then allow the planning of more complex manipulation tasks. The main contribution of this work is an optimal estimation approach for the fusion of visual and tactile data applying the constraint of object symmetry. The fusion is formulated as a state estimation problem and solved with an iterative extended Kalman filter. The approach is validated experimentally using both artificial and real data from two different robotic platforms.",

This paper proposes a novel model-free approach for probabilistic representation and tracking of moving objects from 3D point set data based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). GMM is inherently flexible such that represents any shape of objects as 3D probability distribution of the true positions. In order to achieve the robustness of the model, the proposed tracking method consists of GMM-based 3D registration, Gaussian Sum Filtering, and GMM simplification processes. The tracking performance of the proposed method was evaluated in the moving two human hands with one object, and it performed over 87% tracking accuracy together with processing 5 frames per second.",

For each parallel level, we propose efficient algorithms to effectively utilize the massive data parallelism of GPUs. To obtain the maximum parallel performance at highest level, we introduce two workload distribution techniques such as data/compute interleaving and workload balancing. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first parallel algorithm that executes POMDP efficiently on GPUs. Our GPU-based algorithm outperforms the existing CPU-based algorithm by a factor of 75~90 on different benchmarks.",

While most walking control strategies in the field of bipedal locomotion aim to constantly maintain balance, the Foot Placement Estimator (FPE) estimates where the foot must be placed in order to restore balance. One of the key novelties of the FPE approach is its natural extension to form complete gait cycles using a state machine and simple proportional-derivative controllers. In this paper, the FPE control strategy is extended from 2D to 3D robots, and demonstrated in simulation on a 14-DOF lower body bipedal robot.",

This behavior allows snake robots to adapt to changes in its environment, e.g. changes in pipe diameter while climbing. To simplify the task of high-level closed-loop control, the controller uses a low-dimensional gait framework that has been previously used for open-loop trajectory generation. We use an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the gait parameters that best represent the robot's shape, and then choose a control space of parameters relative to that state. Because this controller specifies whole-body motions of the robot, we are able to generate compliant behavior, even though the joints of the robot contain stiff gear ratios with no mechanical compliance or torque sensing.",

In contrast, actively-illuminated sensors such as laser rangefinders work in a variety of lighting conditions, including full darkness. We leverage previous successes by applying sparse appearance-based methods to laser intensity images, and address the issue of motion distortion by considering the estimation problem in continuous time. This is facilitated by Gaussian Process Gauss-Newton (GPGN), an algorithm for non-parametric, continuous-time, nonlinear, batch state estimation. We include a concise derivation of GPGN, along with details on the extension to three-dimensions (3D). Validation of the 3D laser-based VO framework is provided using 1.1km of experimental data, which was gathered by a field robot equipped with a two-axis scanning lidar.",

The algorithm was compared against a standard SARSA(\u03bb) algorithm on two simulated examples: a battery charge/discharge problem, and a soaring glider problem. Results show that incorporating the information gain value into the action selection encouraged exploration early on, allowing the iGP-SARSA(\u03bb) algorithm to converge to a more profitable reward cycle, while the e-greedy exploration strategy in the SARSA(\u03bb) algorithm failed to search beyond the local optimal solution.",

        "abstract": "A major strength of humanoid robotics platforms consists in their potential to perform a wide range of manipulation tasks in human-centered environments thanks to their anthropomorphic design. Further, they offer active head-eye systems which allow to extend the observable workspace by employing active gaze control. In this work, we address the question where to look during manipulation tasks while exploiting these two key capabilities of humanoid robots. We present a solution to the gaze selection problem, which takes into account constraints derived from manipulation tasks. Thereby, three different subproblems are addressed: the representation of the acquired visual input, the calculation of saliency based on this representation, and the selection of the most suitable gaze direction. As representation of the visual input, a probabilistic environmental model is discussed, which allows to take into account the dynamic nature of manipulation tasks. At the core of the gaze selection mechanism, a novel saliency measure is proposed that includes accuracy requirements from the manipulation task in the saliency calculation. Finally, an iterative procedure based on spherical graphs is developed in order to decide for the best gaze direction. The feasibility of the approach is experimentally evaluated in the context of bimanual manipulation tasks on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.",

        "abstract": "We present here a simple technique of inverse kinematics to be used for humanoid legs. This technique has two advantages. First it permits to manage the stretched-legs space boundary singularities encountered with the classical inverse kinematics that uses a whole Jacobian matrix for all leg joint angle variations. This leg singularity configuration always appears when the humanoid robot has to get from the standing position with both legs stretched to a knee flexed position and vice-versa. Second the technique is independent of the convention of angle orientation at the hips and at the ankles. Therefore it does not require the specific solving for hip and ankle joint angles of the rotation matrix equations in the case of analytical geometric methods. The inverse kinematics proposed here is based on geometrical calculations to get knee coordinates, and on the decomposition of inverse leg kinematics, i.e. inverse kinematics at the hip for the one part, and inverse kinematics at the ankle for the other part. This calculation assumes that the leg has six rotary degrees of freedom, three at the hip, one at the knee, and two at the ankle. The orientation of rotary joints at the hip and at the ankle can be arbitrary.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new structure-from-motion (SFM) technique called `generalized laser three-point' algorithm. It is designed to estimate the motion of the camera-laser fusion system which consists of a 2D laser sensor and multiple cameras. The laser points are projected onto the images and tracked to other frames to be used as 3D-2D correspondences. However, the typical three-point algorithms cannot estimate the motion of the system if three points are collinear. Using the laser points as 3D points, this case happens frequently if the laser sensor scans a large plane (e.g. open ground). Even in that case, two frames of the laser data are not collinear if the system is moved while it captures the frames. Among three point correspondences required to estimate the motion, we select two points and the other point from different frames. We estimate the relative pose between the frames by solving an 8-degree polynomial equation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more appropriate for our fusion system than the previous algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new formulation of prioritized task-space control for humanoids that is used to develop a dynamic kick and dynamic jump in a 26 degree of freedom simulated system. The demonstrated motions are controlled through a real-time conic optimization scheme that selects appropriate joint torques and contact forces. More specifically, motions are characterized in appropriate task spaces, and the real-time optimizer solves the task-space control problem while accounting for user-defined priorities between the tasks. In contrast to previous solutions of the Prioritized Task-Space Control (PTSC) problem for humanoids, the solution presented here satisfies the ZMP constraint and ground friction limitations at all levels of priority, and is general to periods of flight as well as support. All generated motions include control of the system's centroidal angular momentum, which leads to emergent whole-body behaviors, such as arm-swing, that are not specified by the designer. In addition, compared to a previous quadratic programming solution of the PTSC problem, our approach gains a factor of 2 speedup in its required computational time. This speedup allows the control approach to operate at real-time rates of approximately 200 Hz.",

Node marginalization in a pose-graph induces fill-in and leads to computational challenges in performing inference. The proposed method is able to produce a new set of constraints over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization, or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a Chow-Liu tree. The proposed algorithm improves upon existing methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to strictly full-state relative-pose constraints and works equally well with other low-rank constraints such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in a way that accounts for measurement correlation, a problem ignored in other methods that rely upon measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over several real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence.",

One common prerequisite of these methods is to abstract away from raw point cloud data, e.g. to planar patches, to reduce the amount of data and to handle noise and clutter. We present a novel method to abstract RGB-D sensor data to parametric surface models described by B-spline surfaces and associated boundaries. Data is first pre-segmented into smooth patches before B-spline surfaces are fitted. The best surface representations of these patches are selected in a merging procedure. Furthermore, we show how curve fitting estimates smooth boundaries and improves the given sensor information compared to hand-labelled ground truth annotation when using colour in addition to depth information. All parts of the framework are open-source1 and are evaluated on the object segmentation database (OSD) also available online, showing accuracy and usability of the proposed methods.",

The proposed actuator consists of a ball-shaped rotor with multiple PM poles and a spherical-shell-shaped stator with circumferential air-core coils. Due to manufacturing and assembly restrictions, the actual geometric parameters of the spherical actuator differ from their nominal values. Hence, the identification of such errors is significant for high accuracy motion control. The calibration model is formulated based on the differential form of torque equation. To identify the position vector errors in the magnetization axes of PM poles and coils axes, an iterative least-squares algorithm is employed. The proposed calibration method can also be applied to other PM spherical actuators. To verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed calibration algorithm, simulations are conducted on the spherical actuator. The results have shown that the positioning accuracy of the spherical actuator is greatly improved after calibration.",

Efficient solutions to this problem are relevant for effectively localizing robots and for creating maps in real time. Relatively few methods have been proposed to efficiently solve this problem in very large environments using 2D range data. In this paper, we introduce geometrical FLIRT phrases (GFPs) as a novel retrieval method for very efficient and precise place recognition. GFPs perform approximate 2D range data matching, have low computational cost, can handle complicated partial matching patterns and are robust to noise. Experiments carried out with publicly available datasets demonstrate that GFPs largely outperform state-of-the-art approaches in 2D range-based place recognition in terms of efficiency and recall. We obtain retrieval performances with more than 85% recall at 99% precision in less than a second, even on data sets obtained from several kilometer long runs.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new gesture-based human interface for natural robot control. Detailed activity of the user's hand and arm is acquired via a novel device, called the BioSleeve, which packages dry-contact surface electromyography (EMG) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) into a sleeve worn on the forearm. The BioSleeve's accompanying algorithms can reliably decode as many as sixteen discrete hand gestures and estimate the continuous orientation of the forearm. These gestures and positions are mapped to robot commands that, to varying degrees, integrate with the robot's perception of its environment and its ability to complete tasks autonomously. This flexible approach enables, for example, supervisory point-to-goal commands, virtual joystick for guarded teleoperation, and high degree of freedom mimicked manipulation, all from a single device. The BioSleeve is meant for portable field use; unlike other gesture recognition systems, use of the BioSleeve for robot control is invariant to lighting conditions, occlusions, and the human-robot spatial relationship and does not encumber the user's hands. The BioSleeve control approach has been implemented on three robot types, and we present proof-of-principle demonstrations with mobile ground robots, manipulation robots, and prosthetic hands.",

Wide range of motion types like crawling or walking can be achieved using Central Pattern Generators producing periodic control signals. Although these motions can be very effective to steer robots in their vicinity or in a given direction, they need to be switched to reach a far position in the environment. This paper presents a novel modification of Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for modular robots. For efficient exploration of the configuration space, predefined motion primitives are used. While the motion primitives provide effective local motions, the RRT-based planner switches them in order to reach the desired global goal.",

In this paper, a global optimization approach is proposed for long-term tracking of an a priori unknown number of targets, particularly aim to improve the robustness in case of complex interaction and mutual occlusion. With a state-space discretization scheme, the multiple object tracking problem is formulated with a grid-based network flow model, resulting in a convex problem that can be casted into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP), then solved through relaxation. In order to allow recovery from misdetections, common heuristics such as non-maxima suppression is eschewed within observations. In addition, we show that how behavior cue can be integrated into the association affinity model, providing discriminative hints for resolving ambiguities between crossing trajectories. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on multiple challenging video sequences, using a calibrated multi-camera setup.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel mapping approach to map a human grasp to a robotic grasp based on human grasp motion trajectories rather than grasp poses, since the grasp trajectories of a human grasp provide more information to disambiguate between different grasp types than grasp poses. Human grasp motions usually contain complex and nonlinear patterns in a high-dimensional space. In this paper, we reduced the high-dimensionality of motion trajectories by using locality preserving projections (LPP). Then, a Hausdorff distance was performed to find the k-nearest neighbor trajectories in the reduced low-dimensional subspace, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression was used to map a demonstrated grasp motion by a human hand to a robotic hand. Several experiments were designed and carried out to compare the robotic grasping trajectory generated with and without the trajectory-based mapping approach. The regression errors of the mapping results show that our approach generates more robust grasps than using only grasp poses. In addition, our approach has the ability to successfully map a grasp motion of a new grasp demonstration that has not been trained before to a robotic hand.",

To control the movement of the robot hand, a topologically motivated coordinate system is used in order to wrap the hand around such loops. Finally, another concept from topology - namely the Gauss linking integral - is adapted to serve as evidence for secure caging grasps after a grasp has been executed. We evaluate our approach in simulation on a Barrett hand using several target objects of different sizes and shapes and present an initial experiment with real sensor data.",

The model was tested using a large-scale experiment in which a humanoid robot explored 100 different objects by performing a variety of exploratory behaviors on them and detecting the resulting sensory feedback from several sensory modalities. The results show that with a small amount of prior training, the robot's model was able to successfully individuate the objects with a high degree of accuracy.",

Our approach is based on the coordination of 2D sweep lines that move through the environment to clear it from all contamination, representing the possibility of a target being located in an area, and thereby detecting all targets. The trajectories of the UAVs are computed from the motion of these sweep lines. Low cost coordination strategies of the UAV sweep lines are computed in 2D and simply-connected polygonal environments and then converted to strategies capable of clearing multiply-connected 2.5D environments. We present simulation experiments with maps of real and artificial environments and demonstrate the execution of strategies with simulated quadrotors using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.

Many existing methods simplify the task with static camera assumptions, initial calibration stages, or ad hoc pose constraints, making them difficult to be applied to assistive robots used for healthcare applications. This paper introduces a method of hand-body association suitable for crowded environments, by incorporating depth cameras. A robust human hand and body detector, optimized for crowded environments, is first introduced. This is followed by a probabilistic framework for associating hands and bodies. Geodesic distances, based on depth information, are employed to isolate points local to a hand, regardless of their Euclidean proximity to points in other regions. This facilitates subsequent hand-body association based on a Bayesian framework with increased association robustness. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using a range of parameters against an existing approach. A public dataset has been created to assess the method's practical value in crowded environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method in room transfer function (RTF) estimation, employed specifically for dereverberation in hands-free human-robot communication.We introduce a radial distance compensation scheme which significantly improved the RTF estimate robust to the speech power variation due to changes in speaker's radial position. The proposed method is implemented in two levels; first, waveform-level compensation is executed to reflect the change in power caused by the change of radial position to the RTF. We generated possible RTF estimates within a close neighbourhood based on curve fitting. Then, we select among these estimates the optimal RTF based on acoustic model likelihood criterion, the same criterion employed in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The latter is referred to as acoustic model-level compensation, which links the generated RTF to the ASR. We note that in ASR application, both waveform and acoustic models play an important role in achieving optimal performance. Thus, the synergistic effect of the two processes guarantee ASR performance improvement when used in conjunction with our ASR-based dereverberation scheme. Experimental evaluation show robustness in recognition performance when used in hands-free human-robot communication environment.",

        "abstract": "Marine phenomena such as algal blooms can be detected using in situ measurements onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), but understanding plankton ecology and community structure requires retrieval and analysis of water specimens. This process requires shipboard or manual sample collection, followed by onshore lab analysis which is time-consuming. Better understanding of the relationship between the observable environmental features and organism abundance would allow more precisely targeted sampling and thereby save time. In this work, we present an approach to learn and improve models that predict this relationship. Coupled with recent advances in AUV technology allowing selective retrieval of water samples, this constitutes a new paradigm in biological sampling. We use organism abundance models along with spatial models of environmental features learned immediately after AUV deployments to compute spatial distributions of organisms in the coastal ocean purely from in situ AUV data. We use Gaussian process regression along with the unscented transform to fuse the two models, obtaining both the mean and variance of the organism abundance estimates. The uncertainty in organism abundance predictions is used in a sampling strategy to selectively acquire new water specimens that improves the organism abundance models. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the advantage of performing hierarchical probabilistic regression. After the validation through simulation, we show predictions of organism abundance from models learned on lab-analyzed water sample data, and AUV survey data.",

The system consists of a four-axis robot arm and two high-speed vision sensors. We control the robot using visual information received at a rate of 500Hz. The control system consists of three layers: motion control, short-term strategy, and long-term strategy. In the motion control layer, the robot is controlled by visual information of the puck. In the short-term strategy layer, motion of the robot is changed according to the motion characteristics of the puck. In the long-term strategy layer, the motion of the robot is changed according to the playing style of the opponent. By integrating the three control layers, the robot exhibits human-like reactions, which increase the appeal of the game. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

Autonomously traversing rough terrain and such obstacles while ensuring the safety of the robot is a challenging task in mobile robotics. In this paper we introduce a two-phase motion planning algorithm for actively reconfigurable tracked robots. We first use the completeness of a graph search on a regular grid to quickly find an initial path in a low dimensional space, considering only the platform's operating limits instead of the complete state. We then take this initial path to focus the RRT* search in the continuous high-dimensional state space including the actuators of the robot. We do not rely on a detailed structure/terrain classification or use any predefined motion sequences. Hence, our planner can be applied to urban structures, like stairs, as well as rough unstructured environments. Simulation results prove our method to be effective in solving planning queries in such environments.",

        "abstract": "In applying reinforcement learning (RL) to multi-robot control, the size of the learning state space easily explodes because the state space has a high dimension. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is one of the most practical approaches to solve the problem; however, automatically decomposing a plain MDP state space into sub-spaces has not been studied thoroughly enough to be applied to practical robotics problems. We propose a method that automatically forms hierarchical sub-tasks for multi-robot delivery missions. The method executes sub-task decomposition and the learning process in a step-by-step manner, by widening the robot's range of movements around the load and gradually decreasing the domain of the load position. The method automatically detects the state in which cooperative motion among the robots is needed for them to accomplish the mission. The performance of the method is demonstrated by simulations.",

This article deals with a control methods which enables to follow a high speed trajectory based on visual servoing. The non-linear direct model of the NWR is introduced and the calculation of the inverted model is described. This inverted model is used in the control law to determine the control parameter in function of the reference trajectory. The method proposed has been validated on an experimental setup whose time calculation has been optimized to reach a control period of 1 ms. Future works will be done on the study of smaller components e.g. nanowires, in order to provide high speed and reliable assembly methods for nanosystems.",

Central to the proposed solution are dual landmark and observation complexes (instances of simplicial nerve complexes), which can be iteratively built through local observations without any metric or time-sequenced information. We have shown that these complexes approximate the topology of the underlying physical environment. Specifically, the notion of a \u201chole\u201d (i.e., a topological invariant) within these complexes naturally represents a physical structure (e.g., a building) that limits landmark visibility/communication with respect to the robot's location. Taking advantage of this property, we formulate a homological sensing model that operates on these constructs enabling the robot to \u201ccount\u201d the number of structures in its vicinity using local homology computations as a pseudo-metric surrogate sensor. Our homological sensor is highlighted in the context of a Monte-Carlo localization algorithm that resolves robot location by correlating the measured number of topological invariants with an unlabeled, metric map location.",

To accomplish more natural and intelligent human robot interaction (HRI), a robot should not only be able to infer the user's intention through recognizing the actions, but also to perform appropriate decisions and to learn from the user's feedback. In traditional approaches, user intention inference and feedback learning are dealt with separately. In this paper, we propose an integrated strategy of human-oriented perception, user modeling and user sensitivity in a social environment. The robot can analyze a user's feedback to adjust its decisions as the user expects through the strategy. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach that enables autonomous adaptation of robot's decision to the user desires. Also, we demonstrate a satisfactory performance in terms of successful inference of human intentions, as well as adequacy of the decisions made by the robot for meeting user expectation.",

        "abstract": "The vision-based mechanisms that pedestrians in social groups use to navigate in dynamic environments, avoiding obstacles and each others, have been subject to a large amount of research in social anthropology and biological sciences. We build on recent results in these fields to develop a novel fully-distributed algorithm for robot local navigation, which implements the same heuristics for mutual avoidance adopted by humans. The resulting trajectories are human-friendly, because they can intuitively be predicted and interpreted by humans, making the algorithm suitable for the use on robots sharing navigation spaces with humans. The algorithm is computationally light and simple to implement. We study its efficiency and safety in presence of sensing uncertainty, and demonstrate its implementation on real robots. Through extensive quantitative simulations we explore various parameters of the system and demonstrate its good properties in scenarios of different complexity. When the algorithm is implemented on robot swarms, we could observe emergent collective behaviors similar to those observed in human crowds.",

        "abstract": "Humans incorporate and switch between learnt neuromotor strategies while performing complex tasks. Towards this purpose, kinematic redundancy is exploited in order to achieve optimized performance. Inspired by the superior motor skills of humans, in this paper, we investigate a combined free motion and interaction controller in a certain class of robotic manipulation. In this bimodal controller, kinematic degrees of redundancy are adapted according to task-suitable dynamic costs. The proposed algorithm attributes high priority to minimum-effort controller while performing point to point free space movements. Once the robot comes in contact with the environment, the Tele-Impedance, common mode and configuration dependent stiffness (CMS-CDS) controller will replicate the human's estimated endpoint stiffness and measured equilibrium position profiles in the slave robotic arm, in real-time. Results of the proposed controller in contact with the environment are compared with the ones derived from Tele-Impedance implemented using torque based classical Cartesian stiffness control. The minimum-effort and interaction performance achieved highlights the possibility of adopting human-like and sophisticated strategies in humanoid robots or the ones with adequate degrees of redundancy, in order to accomplish tasks in a certain class of robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "In physical Human-Robot Interaction, the basic problem of fast detection and safe robot reaction to unexpected collisions has been addressed successfully on advanced research robots that are torque controlled, possibly equipped with joint torque sensors, and for which an accurate dynamic model is available. In this paper, an end-user approach to collision detection and reaction is presented for an industrial manipulator having a closed control architecture and no additional sensors. The proposed detection and reaction schemes have minimal requirements: only the outer joint velocity reference to the robot manufacturer's controller is used, together with the available measurements of motor currents and joint positions. No a priori information on the robot dynamic model and existing low-level joint controllers is strictly needed. A suitable on-line processing of the motor currents allows to distinguish between accidental collisions and intended human-robot contacts, so as to switch the robot to a collaboration mode when needed. Two examples of reaction schemes for collaboration are presented, with the user pushing/pulling the robot at any point of its structure (e.g., for manual guidance) or with a compliant-like robot behavior in response to forces applied by the human. The actual performance of the methods is illustrated through experiments on a KUKA KR5 manipulator.",

In this new application humanoid are expected to help evaluation through quantitative measures, which is difficult with human subjects, and also to reduce the burden coming from ethical concerns with costly tests by human subjects. Taking a passive supportive wear \u201cSmart Suit Lite\u201d designed to relieve the load at lower back as an example, we have conducted pilot experiments by using the humanoid robot HRP-4C. The motion to be performed by the humanoid is obtained through retargeting technique from measured human lifting motion. The supportive effect is first estimated by simulation taking into account the mechanism of the supportive device. The experimentation of humanoid hardware brought us encouraging results on the basic feasibility of this application, as we observed a clear decrease of the torque for lifting when wearing the device as expected by the simulation.",

The system aims to simplify the robot control and to provide a natural and intuitive interaction between the human and the robot. The key element of the system is exploitation of the human sensorimotor learning ability where a human demonstrator learns how to operate a robot in the same fashion as humans adapt to various everyday tasks. Another key aspect of the proposed system is that the robot learns the task simultaneously while the human is operating the robot. This enables the control of the robot to be gradually transferred from the human to the robot during the demonstration. The control is transferred based on the accuracy of the imitated task. We demonstrated our approach using an experiment where a human demonstrator taught a humanoid robot how to maintain the postural stability in the presence of the perturbations. To provide the appropriate feedback information of the robot's postural stability to the human sensorimotor system, we utilized a custom-built haptic interface. To absorb the demonstrated skill by the robot, we used Locally Weighted Projection Regression machine learning method. A novel approach was implemented to gradually transfer the control responsibility from the human to the incrementally built autonomous robot controller.",

Its design is optimized in order to provide the means of robust environmental interaction through contact (e.g. docking and sliding on walls). Due to the rapid change of the dynamics from the free-flying helicopter to the helicopter subject to the forces and moments during contact a hybrid systems modeling approach is followed. This global model of the system's dynamics is the basis for the design of a hybrid model predictive controller that guarantees the stability of the hybrid system and provides the capability of controlled docking on walls as well as sliding on them. The capabilities of the platform and the efficiency of the control law are illustrated through experimental studies.",

        "abstract": "One of the central problems in computer vision is the detection of semantically important objects and the estimation of their pose. Most of the work in object detection has been based on single image processing and its performance is limited by occlusions and ambiguity in appearance and geometry. This paper proposes an active approach to object detection by controlling the point of view of a mobile depth camera. When an initial static detection phase identifies an object of interest, several hypotheses are made about its class and orientation. The sensor then plans a sequence of viewpoints, which balances the amount of energy used to move with the chance of identifying the correct hypothesis. We formulate an active M-ary hypothesis testing problem, which includes sensor mobility, and solve it using a point-based approximate POMDP algorithm. The validity of our approach is verified through simulation and experiments with real scenes captured by a kinect sensor. The results suggest a significant improvement over static object detection.",

In particular, we study the observability of the nonlinear IMU-RGBD calibration system and prove that the calibration parameters are observable given observations to a single point feature. Moreover, we show that the system has four unobservable directions corresponding to the global translation and rotations about the gravity vector. Based on the results of the observability analysis, we design a consistency-improved, observability constrained (OC) extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based estimator for calibrating the sensor pair while at the same time tracking its pose and creating a 3D map of the environment. Finally, we validate the key findings of the observability analysis and assess the performance of the OC-EKF estimator both in simulation and experimentally.",

The scale factor is computed from the walking speed estimation derived by the kinematic model of human walking. This model not only keeps the important characteristic in biped rolling-foot model, but also makes the speed estimation feasible using human body acceleration. A wearable and calibrated IMU-Camera device is made to mount on the center of human's waist for experimental verification. With the human walking speed and gyroscope measurement, an Unscented Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the current scale factor and refine the attitude of the camera. Experiments in an indoor environment are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Visual servoing offers improved data collection by posing the tracking task as one of controlling a feature as viewed by the inspection sensor, although is complicated by the introduction of wind as aircraft heading and course angle no longer align. In this work it is shown that the effects of wind alter the desired line angle required for continuous tracking to equal the wind correction angle as would be calculated to set a desired course. A control solution is then sort by linearizing the interaction matrix about the new feature pose such that kinematics of the feature can be augmented with the lateral dynamics of the aircraft, from which a state feedback control design is developed. Simulation results are presented comparing no compensation, integral control and the proposed controller using the wind correction angle, followed by an assessment of response to atmospheric disturbances in the form of turbulence and wind gusts.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art laser phonomicrosurgery (LP) used for the treatment of laryngeal abnormalities involves complex otolaryngological surgical techniques. It relies heavily on surgeon dexterity, requiring significant psychomotor skills. Equipment scale and size, laser operative distance, and the anatomically small nature of the vocal folds all combine to compound the surgical challenges. An objective measurement is therefore necessary to understand the impact of equipment design, its usability, surgeon skill, and learning, on performing LP effectively. This paper introduces imaging based feature extraction as a method to establish metrics to assess surgical performance in LP. Experimental analysis demonstrates the utility of these metrics in measuring surgical task execution vis-\u00e0-vis the task objectives. The metrics also provide for a combined rating scale giving a robust quantitative classification of the levels of surgical performance.",

        "abstract": "The use of spoken instructions in human-robot teams holds the promise of enabling untrained users to effectively control complex robotic systems in a natural and intuitive way. Providing robots with the capability to understand natural language directions would enable effortless coordination in human robot teams that operate in non-specialized unknown environments. However, natural language direction following through unknown environments requires understanding the meaning of language, using a partial semantic world model to generate actions in the world, and reasoning about the environment and landmarks that have not yet been detected. We address the problem of robots following natural language directions through complex unknown environments. By exploiting the structure of spatial language, we can frame direction following as a problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty. We learn a policy which predicts a sequence of actions that follow the directions by exploring the environment and discovering landmarks, backtracking when necessary, and explicitly declaring when it has reached the destination. We use imitation learning to train the policy, using demonstrations of people following directions. By training explicitly in unknown environments, we can generalize to situations that have not been encountered previously.",

        "abstract": "Since the introduction of the first prototypes of robotic end-effectors showing manipulation capabilities, much research focused on the design and control of robot hand and grippers. While many studies focus on enhancing the sensing capabilities and motion agility, a less explored topic is the engineering of the surfaces that enable the hand to contact the object. In this paper we present the prototype of the Velvet Fingers smart gripper, a novel concept of end-effector combining the simple mechanics and control of under-actuated devices together with high manipulation possibilities, usually offered only by dexterous robotic hands. This enhancement is obtained thanks to active surfaces, i.e. engineered contact surfaces able to emulate different levels of friction and to apply tangential thrusts to the contacted object. Through the paper particular attention is dedicated to the mechanical implementation, sense drive and control electronics of the device; some analysis on the control algorithms are reported. Finally, the capabilities of the prototype are showed through preliminary grasps and manipulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "Efficient and intuitive interfacing of the interventionalist to the information and tools available from image-guided robotic assisted surgeries is required to achieve the full benefit of these technologies. Ongoing research has been performed into the use of forbidden region guided fixtures (FRVF) for human-in-the-loop control of image-guided procedures via haptic force-feedback devices (FFD). Although commercially available FFD provide sufficient degrees-of-freedom (DoF), collaborating clinicians, as well as the results of our previous work indicate that these systems are not completely intuitive for controlling fixed-point access interventional tool which have a remote center of motion. Within this context, we introduce a new FFD which is designed with the same DoF constraints as a fixed-point access interventional tool. The device is tested in a clinical simulation of a robot assisted trans-apical valve implantation under guidance from real-time magnetic resonance imaging. Pre-acquired real-time images are used in the clinical simulation to dynamically update the FRVF and therefore provide guiding forces to allow the operator to see the safe boundaries of operation via a visualization interface and physically feel them through the FFD. Inertial and gravity compensation and per DoF dynamic response of the physical prototype are validated and the frequency response of the system demonstrates it is adequate for tactile sensing. During clinical simulation the operator was successfully able to maneuver the tool within the safe path to the region of interest with the guidance of visual and force-feedback.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an Implicit Active Constraints control framework for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. It extends on current frameworks by prescribing the external constraints implicitly from the operator motion, forgoing the need for pre-operative imaging; the constraints are defined in situ so as to avoid the use of invasive fiducial markers. A hands-on cooperatively-controlled robotic platform, comprising of a surgical instrument and a compliant manipulator, has been designed for an arthroscopic procedure. The surgical platform is capable of constraining the pose of the instrument so as to ensure it passes through the incision point and does not cause trauma to the surrounding tissue. A flexible arthroscopic instrument is designed and its use is investigated to enlarge reachable and dexterous workspace, increasing the accessibility to the target anatomy. The behaviour of the flexible instrument is analysed. A detailed performance analysis is conducted on a group of subjects for validating the control framework, simulating a minimally invasive arthroscopic procedure. Results demonstrate a statistically significant enhancement in the control ergonomics as well as the accuracy and safety of the procedure.",

The mental model is applied to KOBIAN-R, a 65-DoFs whole body humanoid robot designed for human-robot interaction and emotion expression. To evaluate the importance of the proposed system in the framework of human-robot interaction and communication, we conducted a survey by showing videos of the robot behaviors to a group of 30 subjects. The results show that the integration of dynamical emotion expression and locomotion makes the humanoid robot more appealing to humans, as it is perceived as more \u201cfavorable\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d, and less \u201crobot-like.\u201d",

In this sense, one of the key aspects of the paper is to predict feasible reference features for the low-level IBVS controller. Along the paper, we discuss and analyze the improvements introduced with the new control structure in terms of convergence time and reachability, that is, the ability to converge in complex scenarios such as rotations around the camera axis and large displacements. Validations are also provided through real experimentation with an industrial robot of 6 DOF in eye-in-hand configuration.",

        "abstract": "Moving tumors, especially in the vicinity of lungs, pose a challenging problem in radiotherapy as healthy tissue should not be irradiated. We developed a system to compensate tumor motion with the robotic treatment couch HexaPOD to improve treatment quality. The HexaPOD, carrying the patient, counteracts the tumor motion so that it is eliminated in the beams-eye-view of the linear accelerator. The focus of this work is on two control methods for the HexaPOD in order to realize reference tracking. The first method is a simple position control scheme to enable reference tracking. It is reformulated as second method to be adopted by a model predictive controller to better account for patient comfort and to maintain tracking accuracy. The performance of both methods is compared in experiments with real hardware using prerecorded patient trajectories and human volunteers whose breathing motion was compensated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for improving the quality of distorted 3D point clouds made from a vehicle equipped with a laser scanner moving over uneven terrain. Existing methods that use 3D point-cloud data (for tasks such as mapping, localisation, and object detection) typically assume that each point cloud is accurate. For autonomous robots moving in rough terrain, it is often the case that the vehicle moves a substantial amount during the acquisition of one point cloud, in which case the data will be distorted. The method proposed in this paper is capable of increasing the accuracy of 3D point clouds, without assuming any specific features of the environment (such as planar walls), without resorting to a \u201cstop-scan-go\u201d approach, and without relying on specialised and expensive hardware. Each new point cloud is matched to the previous using normal-distribution-transform (NDT) registration, after which a mini-loop closure is performed with a local, per-scan, graph-based SLAM method. The proposed method increases the accuracy of both the measured platform trajectory and the point cloud. The method is validated on both real-world and simulated data.",

        "abstract": "Roadmap spanners provide a way to acquire sparse data structures that efficiently answer motion planning queries with probabilistic completeness and asymptotic near-optimality. The current SPARS method provides these properties by building two graphs in parallel: a dense asymptotically-optimal roadmap based on PRM* and its spanner. This paper shows that it is possible to relax the conditions under which a sample is added to the spanner and provide guarantees, while not requiring the use of a dense graph. A key aspect of SPARS is that the probability of adding nodes to the roadmap goes to zero as iterations increase, which is maintained in the proposed extension. The paper describes the new algorithm, argues its theoretical properties and evaluates it against PRM* and the original SPARS algorithm. The experimental results show that the memory requirements of the method upon construction are dramatically reduced, while returning competitive quality paths with PRM*. There is a small sacrifice in the size of the final spanner relative to SPARS but the new method still returns graphs orders of magnitudes smaller than PRM*, leading to very efficient online query resolution.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an approach called FSBS (Forward Search in Belief Space) for online planning in POMDPs. The approach is based on the RTBSS (Real-Time Belief Space Search) algorithm of [1]. The main departure from the algorithm is the introduction of similarity measures in the belief space. By considering statistical divergence measures, the similarity between belief points in the forward search tree can be computed. Therefore, it is possible to determine if a certain belief point (or one very similar) has been already visited. This way, it is possible to reduce the complexity of the search by not expanding similar nodes already visited in the same depth. This reduction of complexity makes possible the real-time implementation of more complex problems in robots. The paper describes the algorithm, and analyzes different divergence measures. Benchmark problems are used to show how the approach can obtain a ten-fold reduction in the computation time for similar obtained rewards when compared to the original RTBSS. The paper also presents experiments with a quadrotor in a search application.",

We show that allowing this kind of task switching causes tasks to be completed more efficiently. In addition, we present conditions under which queues can be guaranteed to make progress, and we support these claims with simulation and experimental results.

In this work, we characterize the near-field sensor's ability to detect tagged objects in the robots manipulator, present robot behaviors to determine the identity of a grasped object, and investigate how additional RF signal properties can be used for \u201cpre-touch\u201d capabilities such as servoing to grasp an object. The future combination of long-range (far-field) and short-range (near-field) UHF RFID sensing has the potential to enable roboticists to jump-start applications by obviating or supplementing false-positive-prone visual object recognition. These techniques may be especially useful in the healthcare and service sectors, where mis-identification of an object (for example, a medication bottle) could have catastrophic consequences.",

Then, propose a new technique for the numerical evaluation of the surgical tools applied within this interventional surgery to aid in the design and selection of surgical instruments. Initially, the in-vitro intravascular simulator was constructed, followed by cerebral aneurysm models that were fabricated with highly sensitive photoelastic materials of epoxy resin. Then reconstruct virtual reality modeling of the blood vessel and catheter to record the position information and realize virtual guidance for training. Meanwhile, conduct image processing of photoelastic effects for numerical evaluations of surgical instruments such as catheter insertion and stent expansion. During the stent expansion experiment, the average stress in the selected region of interest caused by the expansion was calculated and compared with the corresponding value obtained before the expansion. The presented simulator and measurement technique can assist in improving a surgeons skills, quantifying the performance of medical mechanisms, and contribute to 3D analysis of stress distribution. This approach can also provide feedback control for robot assisted endovascular systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to motion generation for quadrotor micro-UAV's navigating cluttered and partially known environments. We pursue a graph search method that, despite the high dimensionality of the problem, the complex dynamics of the system and the continuously changing environment model is capable of generating dynamically feasible motions in real-time. This is enabled by leveraging the differential flatness property of the system and by developing a structured search space based on state lattice motion primitives. We suggest a greedy algorithm to generate these primitives off-line automatically, given the robot's motion model. The process samples the reachability of the system and reduces it to a set of representative, canonical motions that are compatible with the state lattice structure, which guarantees that any incremental replanning algorithm is able to produce smooth dynamically feasible motion plans while reusing previous computation between replans. Simulated and physical experimental results demonstrate real-time replanning due to the inevitable and frequent world model updates during micro-UAV motion in partially known environments.",

        "abstract": "Our paper explores the performance of a recently proposed incremental smoother in the context of nonlinear sensor fusion for a real-world UAV. This efficient factor graph based smoothing approach has a number of advantages compared to conventional filtering techniques like the EKF or its variants. It can more easily incorporate asynchronous and delayed measurements from sensors operating at different rates and is supposed to be less error-prone in highly nonlinear settings. We compare the novel incremental smoothing approach based on iSAM2 against our conventional EKF based sensor fusion framework. Unlike previously presented work, the experiments are not only performed in simulation, but also on a real-world quadrotor UAV system using IMU, optical flow and altitude measurements.",

The specification is expressed as a formula in linear temporal logic. The agents are modeled by Markov decision processes with a common set of actions. These actions, however, may or may not affect the behaviors of all the agents. To alleviate the well-known state explosion problem, an incremental approach is proposed where only a small subset of agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedure initially and more agents are successively added until the limitations on computational resources are reached. The proposed algorithm runs in an anytime fashion, where the probability of satisfying the specification increases as the algorithm progresses.",

        "abstract": "A grasp g is said to achieve local force closure with respect to a given external wrench wext if g can resist wext as well as any wrench in some neighborhood of wext, with grasp quality no less than some threshold Q. Such grasps are particularly useful for tasks that do not require an object to be completely restrained: such as holding an object so that it does not fall, or picking up objects and dropping them into a container. If we allow the use of disc-fingers in contact with convex vertices of a polygonal object P, then any given wext acting on P can be resisted by a 2-finger grasp. We show how to compute the set of all 2-finger grasp configurations with contacts on given boundary features of P that are capable of resisting a given wext with quality at least Q. We also show that any grasp in the interior of such a grasp set achieves local force closure with respect to wext. By finding the largest square contained in such a grasp set we can obtain maximal independent contact regions for local force closure grasps of P with contacts on a given pair of features.",

Current autonomous rotorcraft use shipdeck mounted transponders to measure the relative pose of the vehicle to the landing pad. This tracking system is not only expensive but renders an unequipped ship unlandable. We address the challenge of tracking a shipdeck without additional infrastructure on the deck. We present two methods based on video and lidar that are able to track the shipdeck starting at a considerable distance from the ship. This redundant sensor design enables us to have two independent tracking systems. We show the results of the tracking algorithms in three different environments - field testing results on actual helicopter flights, in simulation with a moving shipdeck for lidar based tracking and in laboratory using an occluded, and, moving scaled model of a landing deck for camera based tracking. The complimentary modalities allow shipdeck tracking under varying conditions.",

The robot can switch between claw mode and wheel mode by folding and unfolding the front body and rear body of the robot. The transformation could be made by controlling the motors on a pitch joint through the front claw and rear one in 90\u00b0 angle shift after folding. The claw mode is mainly used to cross various uneven terrain or climb stairways. Yet, the wheel mode is for moving on flat ground. This robot can be adaptive to various riser and tread of stairs by appropriately controlling the transformation mechanism. Testing and verification have been done both in numerical simulation and the field test on the developed prototype. Compared with the existing hybrid robots, it has been proved to be well adaptive to various environments, structurally simple, easy to control and light in weight.",

The ability to perform hops of an arbitrary and changing size accurately forms the motivation behind the work done here. This would allow control of a running robot's foot placement and thus fast traversal of terrain with limited safe foot placement spots. In this paper, the hopping controller is developed and validated using an articulated, hydraulically actuated leg from the HyQ robot which has been modified to include an elastic foot and constrained to hop vertically. It is shown that instantaneous control over the step-time can be achieved using only joint positions and ground contact senses. This was achieved with a simple feedforward lookup in combination with a proportional and integral action.",

The goal of this work is to show that the interaction control allows the manipulator to track a desired force, normal to a vertical wall, while still maintaining the possibility of moving on the wall. The control strategy has been implemented and validated in simulations and experiments on the manipulator standalone, i.e., attached to a fixed base, and on the manipulator attached to the aerial vehicle.",

We present a novel grasp planning method which not only incorporates the potential collision between object and manipulator, but takes advantage of this interaction. The natural uncertainty and difficulties in observation in such tasks is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Recent advances in point-based methods as well as a novel state space representation specific to the grasping problem are leveraged to overcome state space growth issues. Simulation results are presented for the combined localization, manipulation, and grasping of a small nut on a table.",

This skill is a prerequisite for general manipulation in unstructured environments. Robot-environment interactions are used to move an unknown object, creating a perceptual signal that reveals the kinematic properties of the object. The resulting perceptual information can then inform and facilitate further manipulation. The algorithm is computationally efficient, handles partial occlusions, and depends on little object motion; it only requires sufficient texture for visual feature tracking. We conducted experiments with everyday objects on a robotic manipulation platform equipped with an RGB-D sensor. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method to lighting conditions, object appearance, size, structure, and configuration.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, minimally-invasive surgical systems based on flexible robotic manipulators have met with success. One major advantage of the flexible manipulator approach is its superior safety characteristics as compared to rigid manipulators. However, their soft compliant structure, in combination with internal friction, results in poor position and force regulation and has limited their use to simpler surgical procedures. In this paper, we discuss a new approach to continuum robotic manipulation that combines flexible, actively actuated continuum segments with small, limited stroke rigid-link actuators. The small rigid-link joints are interleaved between successive continuum segments and provide a redundant motion and error correction capability. The authors refer to this approach as interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation. In this paper, we describe the overall approach and investigate its performance using a one degree-of-freedom testbed and two degree-of-freedom planar simulation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The future exploration of small Solar System bodies will, in part, depend on the availability of mobility platforms capable of performing both large surface coverage and short traverses to specific locations. Weak gravitational fields, however, make the adoption of traditional mobility systems difficult. In this paper we present a planetary mobility platform (called \u201cspacecraft/rover hybrid\u201d) that relies on internal actuation. A hybrid is a small (\u223c 5 kg), multi-faceted robot enclosing three mutually orthogonal flywheels and surrounded by external spikes or contact surfaces. By accelerating/decelerating the flywheels and by exploiting the low-gravity environment, such a platform can perform both long excursions (by hopping) and short, precise traverses (through controlled \u201ctumbles\u201d). This concept has the potential to lead to small, quasi-expendable, yet maneuverable rovers that are robust as they have no external moving parts. In the first part of the paper we characterize the dynamics of such platforms (including fundamental limitations of performance) and we discuss control and planning algorithms. In the second part, we discuss the development of a prototype and present experimental results both in simulations and on physical test stands emulating low-gravity environments. Collectively, our results lay the foundations for the design of internally-actuated rovers with controlled mobility (as opposed to random hopping motion).",

The system is based on the Anubis\u00ae platform - a manual flexible system designed by Karl Storz for transluminal operations. Our new robot is a modular robotic system, compatible with the medical environment, allowing an easy setup in the operating room. It provides up to 10 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), enabling the 3D positioning of an endoscopic camera, positioning of two instruments and offering grasper opening / closing functionalities. The paper presents for the first time the mechanical, electrical and control design of STRAS. An initial characterization of the system shows that, because of complex mechanical interactions, the kinematic modeling is not sufficient for cartesian control. However, first experiments, demonstrate that the robotic system can be telemanipulated using joint control and that the robotic system enables a single user to perform complex tasks with the underlying flexible system.",

This paper describes the optimization and comparison of three inverse kinematic algorithms designed to predict the pose of a 25 degree of freedom robotic human upper body model (RHBM). Motion analysis data of 10 subjects performing 5 activities of daily living were used to evaluate the performance of each method. The first algorithm used a numerically optimized weighted-least-norm (WLN) solution. The second algorithm maximized the joint angle probability density, using the gradient projection method (GP). The third algorithm used a single layer artificial neural network (NN), trained by Levenberg-Marquart backpropagation using the motion analysis data. Error was evaluated using the root mean square of the difference between calculated and recorded joint angles. The robustness was then tested by progressively excluding subject data from the training set, re-training the algorithms, and evaluating the error for all subjects. The numerically optimized WLN solution showed the highest robustness, and the GP and NN solutions had greater accuracy for the data included in training and lower accuracy for the data excluded from training. The gradient projection method showed greater robustness than the artificial neural network, and has potential to be refined and combined with the weighted least norm solution to increase accuracy and robustness. Future work will investigate combined methods and the ability to predict motion of persons using prostheses.",

        "abstract": "Serial kinematic chains are widely used in robotics and computer animation among other fields. Many manipulators do not have closed-form solutions to the inverse kinematics problem, which is of great importance for many applications. In this paper we introduce a fast and accurate procedure which yields all joint angle solutions for a given manipulator or limb posture (position and orientation) and certain swivel angle. By means of a spatial decomposition method, the procedure involves finding accurate models which represent the behavior of the robot or limb in a given workspace region. We propose Support Vector Machines, a very popular machine learning method, as the method that models such behaviors. The performance of the method is tested on the Robotic Research Arm K-1207. The results confirm that the method finds accurate solutions and can be used on real world applications with real-time requirements.",

An ensemble-based system identification method was used to investigate the time-varying behavior of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees of freedom, both in the sagittal and frontal planes. We also provide solutions to overcome the limitations of original ensemble-based methods in practical applications. A pilot study of three human subjects demonstrated the efficacy of our approach. Analysis results showed clear time-varying behaviors of ankle impedance across the gait cycle except in the mid- and terminal-stance phases, and these behaviors were accurately approximated as a second-order model with stiffness, damping, and inertia components. Interestingly, all three subjects showed similar time-varying behaviors in both degrees of freedom: impedance increased around heel-strike and decreased significantly at the end of the stance phase.",

        "abstract": "The use of groups of autonomous marine vehicles has enormous potential in numerous marine applications, perhaps the most relevant of which is the surveying and exploration of the oceans, still widely unknown and misunderstood. In many mission scenarios requiring the concerted operation of multiple marine vehicles carrying distinct, yet complementary sensor suites, relative positioning and formation control becomes mandatory. However, the constraints placed by the medium make it hard to both communicate and localize vehicles, even in relation to each other. In this paper, we deal with the challenging problem of keeping an autonomous underwater vehicle in a moving triangular formation with respect to 2 leader vehicles. We build upon our previous theoretical work on range-only formation control, which presents simple feedback laws to drive the controlled vehicle to its intended position in the formation using only ranges obtained to the leading vehicles with no knowledge of the formation path. We then introduce the real-world constraints associated with the use of autonomous underwater vehicles, especially the low frequency characteristics of acoustic ranging and its unreliability. We discuss the required changes to implement the solution in our vehicles, and provide simulation results using a full dynamic and communication model. Finally, we present the results of real world trials using MEDUSA-class autonomous marine vehicles.",

We set the boundary estimation problem as a classification problem of the region in which the physical events occurs, and employ support vector learning (SVL). By using the hyper-dimensional radius function obtained from SVL, we build the hyper-potential field to generate a velocity vector field which is globally attractive to a desired closed path with circulation at the desired speed. We also study stabilizing the collective configuration of the multiple mobile sensors. To coordinate the mobile sensors in the formation that encloses the boundary, we define virtual phases of mobile sensors and compute the desired speed of each mobile sensors minimizing the level of synchrony of the virtual phases. Both a simulation and an experiment is performed and the results demonstrate that this study provides good performance of the collective boundary tracking.",

This work proposes a new algorithm that treats both problems jointly. The sole input is a sequence of dense 3D measurements as returned by multi-layer laser scanners or time-of-flight cameras. A major characteristic of the proposed approach is its applicability to any type of environment since specific object models are not used at any algorithm stage. More specifically, precise localization in non-flat environments is possible as well as the detection and tracking of e.g. trams or recumbent bicycles. Moreover, 3D shape estimation of moving objects is inherent to the proposed method. Thorough evaluation is conducted on a vehicular platform with a mounted Velodyne HDL-64E laser scanner.",

        "abstract": "Graspless manipulation is easily interfered by external disturbances because the manipulated object is not completely held by a robot hand and supported by an environment such as a floor. Thus it is important to ensure the manipulation is executed robustly against some disturbances. In our works, a rigid-body-based analysis of indeterminate contact forces for quasi-static graspless manipulation has been proposed, and also joint torque optimization for robotic hands. The joint torques of the robot is determined in consideration of some robustness of manipulation against disturbances, which include changes or estimation errors of friction. In the analysis of contact forces in quasi-statics, a kinematic constraint on static friction is considered to exclude infeasible sets of frictional force, with considering treatment of kinetic friction. Additionally, new objective functions for computing optimal joint torques in both static and quasi-static graspless manipulation are proposed. Some numerical samples of both applications are shown to verify our proposed methods.",

Recent advances in sampling-based methods seem to be only applicable to \u201clow-level\u201d control. The problem of realizing \u201chigh-level\u201d controllers that satisfy a temporal logic specification does not readily admit approximations, unless the notion of correctness is relaxed as might be achieved with probabilistic variants of temporal logics. In this paper, we argue that not all possible environment (uncontrolled) behaviors need to be explicitly planned for, but rather short-time strategies can be generated online while maintaining global correctness. We achieve this by separating feasibility from controller synthesis, using metrics from the underlying continuous state space to ensure short-time strategies chained together provide globally correct behavior.",

Our primary contribution is an algorithm to compute and maintain a small representative set, called a kinematic coreset, of the n moving clients.We prove that, in any given moment, the maximum distance between the clients and any set of k servers is approximated by the coreset up to a factor of (1 \u00b1 \u03b5), where \u03b5 > 0 is an arbitrarily small constant. We prove that both the size of our coreset and its update time is polynomial in k log(n)/\u03b5. Although our optimization problem is NP-hard (i.e., takes time exponential in the number of servers to solve), solving it on the small coreset instead of the original clients results in a tractable controller. The approach is validated in a small scale hardware experiment using robot servers and human clients, and in a large scale numerical simulation using thousands of clients.",

        "abstract": "The kinematics of wire-driven parallel robot (WDPR) is one of the most challenging problem of modern kinematics. We investigate here the kinematics of two robots with 3 and 4 wires, in a crane configuration, having specific location of the anchor point on the platform. The 4-3-1 robot has 4 wires, three of them being connected at the same anchor point on the platform. We show that this robot has up to 4 solutions to the forward kinematics. The 3-2-1 robot has 3 wires, two of them being connected at the same point on the platform: we show that the forward kinematics solutions of this robot, that involves its static equilibrium, may be obtained by solving a polynomial of degree 64, leading to a maximum of 256 solutions to the FK. In both cases the proposed maximum number of solutions is much better than the one already known for robots of general structure having 3 or 4 wires. Numerical experiments let us conjecture that the 64th order polynomial will always factor out and that all roots will be obtained from a polynomial of degree 32, leading to at most 128 solutions and we have obtained examples with up to 10 solutions with positive tensions in the wires. We justify this study by experimentally showing that a 4-3-1 robot moving in its workspace may become a 3-2-1 robot as one wire become slack, numerical simulations showing that this will happen in more than 50% of the poses in the workspace (but the 4-3-1 has obviously a larger workspace than the 3-2-1, hence its interest).",

Given a non-degenerate calibration dataset and considering the stochastic models of the sensors, the task is formulated as a maximum likelihood problem. In order to facilitate the derivation of consistent measurement equations, the trajectory of the robot and other auxiliary variables are included into the optimization problem. This formulation can be transformed into a nonlinear least squares problem which can be readily solved. Applied to our legged robot StarIETH, the framework estimates kinematic parameters (segment lengths, body dimensions, angular offsets), accelerometer and gyroscope biases, as well as full inter-sensor calibrations. The generic structure easily allows the inclusion of additional sensor modalities. Based on datasets obtained on the real robot the consistency and performance of the presented approach are successfully evaluated.",

By using measurements from a laser tracker and least-squares estimates of polynomial functions, a typical accuracy of about 20 micrometer was achieved for the base actuators.

The gripper consists of two fingers, each with two links, and is actuated using a single active tendon. During unobstructed closing, the distal links remain parallel, creating exact fingertip grasps. Conversely, if the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. We optimize the route of the active tendon and the parameters of the springs providing passive extension forces in order to achieve this behavior. We show how an additional passive tendon can be used as a constraint preventing the gripper from entering undesirable parts of the joint workspace. Finally, we introduce a method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve enveloping grasps of a large range of objects, and apply it to a set of common household objects.",

        "abstract": "We present Kinodynamic RRT*, an incremental sampling-based approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robots with linear dynamics. Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.",

This paper advocates that for robotics applications, which often involve mission-critical decision making, good performance according to these standard metrics is desirable but insufficient to appropriately characterise system performance. We introduce and motivate the importance of a classifier's introspective capacity: the ability to mitigate potentially overconfident classifications by an appropriate assessment of how qualified the system is to make a judgement on the current test datum. We provide an intuition as to how this introspective capacity can be achieved and systematically investigate it in a selection of classification frameworks commonly used in robotics: support vector machines, LogitBoost classifiers and Gaussian Process classifiers (GPCs). Our experiments demonstrate that for common robotics tasks a framework such as a GPC exhibits a superior introspective capacity while maintaining commensurate classification performance to more popular, alternative approaches.",

Geometric perturbations to the terrain enter the equations of motion through a relocation of the hybrid event \u201cguards\u201d which trigger an impact event; these perturbations can have a large effect on the stability of the robot and do not fit into the traditional robust control analysis and design methodologies without additional machinery. We attempt to provide that machinery here. In particular, we quantify the robustness of the system to terrain perturbations by defining an L2 gain from terrain perturbations to deviations from the nominal limit cycle. We show that the solution to a periodic dissipation inequality provides a sufficient upper bound on this gain for a linear approximation of the dynamics around the limit cycle, and we formulate a semidefinite programming problem to compute the L2 gain for the system with a fixed linear controller. We then use either binary search or an iterative optimization method to construct a linear robust controller and to minimize the L2 gain. The simulation results on canonical robots suggest that the L2 gain is closely correlated to the actual number of steps traversed on the rough terrain, and our controller can improve the robot's robustness to terrain disturbances.",

The use of this type of robots on a regular basis to preserve a clean hull, usually when ships are in port or anchored, will improve the efficiency of the ships and will permit a reduction in the use of chemicals that are harmful to the environment to prevent the growth of marine life on the hull. The main contribution of the robot described in this paper is that it is a completely novel design that through an appropriate morphology solves the problems that arise when moving along hulls, including changing planes, negotiating appendices, portholes, corners, and other elements. It thus provides a basis for completely autonomous operation. The design and implementation of the robot is described and some simulations and tests in real environments are presented.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRMs) are quite successful in solving complex and high-dimensional motion planning problems. While particularly suited for multiple-query scenarios and expansive spaces, they lack efficiency in both solving single-query scenarios and mapping narrow spaces. Two PRM variants separately tackle these gaps. Lazy PRM reduces the computational cost of roadmap construction for single-query scenarios by delaying roadmap validation until query time. Toggle PRM is well suited for mapping narrow spaces by mapping both Cfree and Cobst, which gives certain theoretical benefits. However, fully validating the two resulting roadmaps can be costly. We present a strategy, Lazy Toggle PRM, for integrating these two approaches into a method which is both suited for narrow passages and efficient single-query calculations. This simultaneously addresses two challenges of PRMs. Like Lazy PRM, Lazy Toggle PRM delays validation of roadmaps until query time, but if no path is found, the algorithm augments the roadmap using the Toggle PRM methodology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Lazy Toggle PRM in a wide range of scenarios, including those with narrow passages and high descriptive complexity (e.g., those described by many triangles), concluding that it is more effective than existing methods in solving difficult queries.",

We focus our report on the definition of a similarity measure that reflects whether the shapes of two parts resemble each other, and whether their associated grasps are applied near one another.

In particular, robot grasping tasks require quick reactions in many applications such as human-robot interaction. In this paper, we propose an approach for grasp learning that enables robots to plan new grasps rapidly according to the object's position and orientation. This is achieved by taking a three-step approach. In the first step, we compute a variety of stable grasps for a given object. In the second step, we propose a strategy that learns a probability distribution of grasps based on the computed grasps. In the third step, we use the model to quickly generate grasps. We have tested the statistical method on the 9 degrees of freedom hand of the iCub humanoid robot and the 4 degrees of freedom Barrett hand. The average computation time for generating one grasp is less than 10 milliseconds. The experiments were run in Matlab on a machine with 2.8GHz processor.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for robust visual object tracking based on the structured sparse representation framework. Conventional structured sparse representation based tracker models the nonlinear appearance manifold with a single subspace that is difficult to handle significant pose and illumination changes. Different from the afore-mentioned method, the proposed algorithm approximates the nonlinear appearance manifold by multiple low dimensional subspaces computed by an incremental learning scheme based on the merging and insert strategy. In order to enhance the discriminative power of the model, a number of clustered background subspaces are also added into the basis library and updated during tracking. With the Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (BOMP) algorithm, we show that the complex nonlinear appearance manifold can effectively represent by a sparse linear combination of structured union of subspaces. Experiments on benchmark video sequences show that the new structured sparse representation model improves the robustness of tracking.",

Our contributions are: (1) a new scheme for learning and predicting associations between depth and local image appearance using RGB-D data; and (2) the use of this scheme for the initialization of state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems from a single image frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automatically initialize a SLAM system by associating depth to sensor features through machine learning techniques. We performed a series of tests by making use of the celebrated PTAM system and obtained very promising results. We show successful one-shot initialization examples accomplished by applying our proposed approach to unstructured scene environments.",

Previous approaches to dialog use domain knowledge to constrain the types of language people are likely to use. In contrast, by introducing a joint probabilistic model over speech, the resulting semantic parse and the mapping from each element of the parse to a physical entity in the building (e.g., grounding), our approach is flexible to the ways that untrained people interact with robots, is robust to speech to text errors and is able to learn referring expressions for physical locations in a map (e.g., to create a semantic map). Our approach has been evaluated by having untrained people interact with a service robot. Starting with an empty semantic map, our approach is able ask 50% fewer questions than a baseline approach, thereby enabling more effective and intuitive human robot dialog.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for grasping unknown objects from piles or cluttered scenes, given a point cloud from a single depth camera. We introduce a shape-based method - Symmetry Height Accumulated Features (SHAF) - that reduces the scene description complexity such that the use of machine learning techniques becomes feasible. We describe the basic Height Accumulated Features and the Symmetry Features and investigate their quality using an F-score metric. We discuss the gain from Symmetry Features for grasp classification and demonstrate the expressive power of Height Accumulated Features by comparing it to a simple height based learning method. In robotic experiments of grasping single objects, we test 10 novel objects in 150 trials and show significant improvement of 34% over a state-of-the-art method, achieving a success rate of 92%. An improvement of 29% over the competitive method was achieved for a task of clearing a table with 5 to 10 objects and overall 90 trials. Furthermore we show that our approach is easily adaptable for different manipulators by running our experiments on a second platform.",

Symbolic planning, however, requires knowledge about the preconditions and effects of the individual actions. In this work, we present a practical approach to learn manipulation skills, including preconditions and effects, based on teacher demonstrations. We believe that requiring only a small number of demonstrations is essential for robots operating in the real world. Therefore, our main focus and contribution is the ability to infer the preconditions and effects of actions based on a small number of demonstrations. Our system furthermore expresses the acquired manipulation actions as planning operators and is therefore able to use symbolic planners to solve new tasks. We implemented our approach on a PR2 robot and present real world manipulation experiments that illustrate that our system allows non-experts to transfer knowledge to robots.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous navigation for large Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is fairly straight-forward, as expensive sensors and monitoring devices can be employed. In contrast, obstacle avoidance remains a challenging task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) which operate at low altitude in cluttered environments. Unlike large vehicles, MAVs can only carry very light sensors, such as cameras, making autonomous navigation through obstacles much more challenging. In this paper, we describe a system that navigates a small quadrotor helicopter autonomously at low altitude through natural forest environments. Using only a single cheap camera to perceive the environment, we are able to maintain a constant velocity of up to 1.5m/s. Given a small set of human pilot demonstrations, we use recent state-of-the-art imitation learning techniques to train a controller that can avoid trees by adapting the MAVs heading. We demonstrate the performance of our system in a more controlled environment indoors, and in real natural forest environments outdoors.",

Our path integral inverse reinforcement learning algorithm can deal with high-dimensional continuous state-action spaces, and only requires local optimality of demonstrated trajectories. We use L1 regularization in order to achieve feature selection, and propose an efficient algorithm to minimize the resulting convex objective function. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to two core problems in robotic manipulation. First, we learn a cost function for redundancy resolution in inverse kinematics. Second, we use our method to learn a cost function over trajectories, which is then used in optimization-based motion planning for grasping and manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous algorithms in high-dimensional settings.",

Using statistical relational learning, the system extracts a full-joint probability distribution over the actions that form a task, their (partial) ordering, and their properties. Relevant action properties and relations among actions are learned as those that are consistent among the observations. The models can be used for classifying action sequences, for determining which actions are relevant for a task, which objects are usually manipulated, and which action properties are typical for a person. We evaluate the approach on synthetic data sampled from partial-order trees as well as two real-world data sets of humans activities: the TUM kitchen data set and the CMU MMAC data set. The results show that our approach outperforms sequence-based models like Conditional Random Fields for classifying observations of activities that allow a large amount of variation.",

This requirement implies the need to learn the individual primitives as well as a strategy to select the primitives sequentially. Such hierarchical learning problems are commonly either treated as one complex monolithic problem which is hard to learn, or as separate tasks learned in isolation. However, there exists a strong link between the robots strategy and its motor primitives. Consequently, a consistent framework is needed that can learn jointly on the level of the individual primitives and the robots strategy. We present a hierarchical learning method which improves individual motor primitives and, simultaneously, learns how to combine these motor primitives sequentially to solve complex motor tasks. We evaluate our method on the game of robot hockey, which is both difficult to learn in terms of the required motor primitives as well as its strategic elements.",

Often flight trajectories are not only subject to unknown system dynamics, but also to specific task constraints. This paper presents a motion planning method for generating trajectories with minimal residual oscillations (swing-free) for rotorcraft carrying a suspended loads. We rely on a finite-sampling, batch reinforcement learning algorithm to train the system for a particular load. We find criteria that allow the trained agent to be transferred to a variety of models, state and action spaces and produce a number of different trajectories. Through a combination of simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the inferred policy is robust to noise and the unmodeled dynamics of the system. The contributions of this work are 1) applying reinforcement learning to solve the problem of finding swing-free trajectories for rotorcraft, 2) designing a problem-specific feature vector for value function approximation, 3) giving sufficient conditions for successful learning transfer to different models, state and action spaces, and 4) verification of the resulting trajectories in both simulation and autonomous control of quadrotors with suspended loads.",

        "abstract": "We discuss the problem of learning uncertainty models of ocean processes to assist in the operation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the ocean. We focus on the prediction of ocean currents, which have significant effect on the navigation of AUVs. Available models provide accurate prediction of ocean currents, but they typically do not provide confidence estimates of these predictions. We propose augmenting existing prediction methods with variance measures based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We show that commonly used measures of variance in GPs do not accurately reflect errors in ocean current prediction, and we propose an alternative uncertainty measure based on interpolation variance. We integrate these measures of uncertainty into a probabilistic planner running on an AUV during a field deployment in the Southern California Bight. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty measures improve the safety and reliability of AUVs operating in the coastal ocean.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Creating rich representations of environments requires integration of multiple sensing modalities with complementary characteristics such as range and imaging sensors. To precisely combine multisensory information, the rigid transformation between different sensor coordinate systems (i.e., extrinsic parameters) must be estimated. The majority of existing extrinsic calibration techniques require one or multiple planar calibration patterns (such as checkerboards) to be observed simultaneously from the range and imaging sensors. The main limitation of these approaches is that they require modifying the scene with artificial targets. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for extrinsically calibrating a range sensor with respect to an image sensor with no requirement of external artificial targets. The proposed method exploits natural linear features in the scene to precisely determine the rigid transformation between the coordinate frames. First, a set of 3D lines (plane intersection and boundary line segments) are extracted from the point cloud, and a set of 2D line segments are extracted from the image. Correspondences between the 3D and 2D line segments are used as inputs to an optimization problem which requires jointly estimating the relative translation and rotation between the coordinate frames. The proposed method is not limited to any particular types or configurations of sensors. To demonstrate robustness, efficiency and generality of the presented algorithm, we include results using various sensor configurations.",

        "abstract": "Traditional vertical take-off and landing micro aerial vehicles (VTOL MAVs) are generally underactuated, i.e., equipped with fewer actuators than degrees-of-freedom (DOF). As a consequence, they possess a limited mobility because of the inherent underactuation (e.g., they can neither translate laterally with a zero attitude nor hover at a spot with a nonzero attitude). In this paper, we present the design of a novel MAV, the Omnicopter, with two central counter-rotating coaxial propellers for thrust and yaw control and three perimeter-mounted variable angle ducted fans to control roll and pitch and provide lateral forces. It can work under two configurations, a fixed 90\u00b0 ducted fan angle configuration and a variable angle ducted fan configuration. The variable angle configuration provides full actuation to the Omnicopter position/attitude. After a brief introduction of the Omnicopter platform, we discuss the control design, allocation and implementation for the two configurations separately. Simulations and experimental results verify the performance of the Omnicopter.",

The accuracy of a robot system is one of the most important comparison criteria for various applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to increase the relative accuracy of a cable robot under changing payload, by compensating the error induced by elasticity. In the first step, the load is identified based on cable force sensors and the acceleration of the platform. Second, for the actual pose the stiffness matrix is computed and the expected displacement of the platform in Cartesian space is determined. Lastly, the displacement is compensated by adapting the cable lengths. Furthermore, the influence of the calibration of cable force sensors and their parameters' inaccuracies are discussed. The algorithms are implemented and evaluated on a 6-DOF cable robot. We could experimentally prove an improvement of over 50% in the relative accuracy under changing load.",

This paper provides a non-iterative solution to determine the six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) position and orientation of a wireless capsule endoscope being actuated by a rotating magnetic dipole. Non-iterative solutions in the past have only been used to locate immobile objects. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm calculates the 6-DOF position and orientation of capsules that are truly stationary as well as those that are operated in the \u201cstep-out\u201d regime, where the magnetic field is rotated too quickly for the capsule to rotate synchronously, but the capsule does undergo chaotic movement.",

The new approach, named Locally Weighted Learning Model Predictive Control (LWL-MPC), is proposed as a solution to learn to control robotic systems with nonlinear and time varying dynamics. This paper demonstrates the capability of LWL-MPC to perform online learning while controlling the joint trajectories of a low cost, three degree of freedom elastic joint robot. The learning performance is investigated in both an initial learning phase, and when the system dynamics change due to a heavy object added to the tool point. The experiment on the real elastic joint robot is presented and LWL-MPC is shown to successfully learn to control the system with and without the object. The results highlight the capability of the learning control system to accommodate the lack of mechanical consistency and linearity in a low cost robot arm.",

The inverse iteration algorithm for spectral analysis is formulated in a distributed manner to allow each agent to estimate a component of global network connectivity, improving on the convergence rate issues of previous approaches. Potential-based controls drive the agents to maximize connectivity under local degree constraints, maintain established links to guarantee connectivity, and avoid collisions. To achieve constraint satisfaction we exploit a switched model of interaction that regulates link addition through symmetric, repulsive potentials between constraint violators, enforcing discernment in communication through spatial organization. Simulations of connectivity estimation as well as agent aggregation and leader-following applications demonstrate the ability of our proposed methods to generate connectivity maximizing, constraint-aware self organization.",

        "abstract": "Locating end-effector tips is a prerequisite step in micromanipulation. The tip of micromanipulation tools is typically a few micrometers in size and highly delicate. In all existing automated micromanipulation systems, the process of locating the end-effector tip is conducted by a skilled operator, and the automation of this task has not been attempted. This paper presents a technique for automatically locating end-effector tips. The technique consists of programmed sweeping patterns, MHI (motion history image) end-effector detection, active contour for estimating end-effector positions, autofocusing and quad-tree search for locating end-effector tip, and finally visual servoing to position the tip to the center of the field of view. Two types of micromanipulation tools (micropipette representing single-ended tools and microgripper representing multi-ended tools) were used in experiments for testing. Quantitative results were reported in the speed and success rate of the auto-locating technique, based on over 500 trials. Furthermore, the effect of factors such as imaging mode and image processing parameter selections was also quantitatively discussed. Guidelines are provided for the implementation of the technique in order to achieve high efficiency and success rates.",

Our approach uses the camera's maximum exposure duration and sensor gain to achieve appropriately exposed images even in unlit night-time environments, albeit with extreme levels of motion blur. Using the SeqSLAM algorithm, we first evaluate the effect of variable motion blur caused by simulated exposures of 132 ms to 10000 ms duration on localization performance. We then use actual long exposure camera datasets to demonstrate day-night localization in two different environments. Finally we perform a statistical analysis that compares the baseline performance of matching unprocessed grayscale images to using patch normalization and local neighborhood normalization - the two key SeqSLAM components. Our results and analysis show for the first time why the SeqSLAM algorithm is effective, and demonstrate the potential for cheap camera-based localization systems that function across extreme perceptual change.",

The core of the proposed solution is based on off-the-shelf components consisting of the Caspa camera module and Gumstix Overo board accompanied by a developed efficient image processing method for detecting black and white circular patterns. Although the idea of the roundel recognition is simple, the developed system exhibits reliable and fast estimation of the relative position of the pattern up to 30 fps using the full resolution of the Caspa camera. Thus, the system is suited to meet requirements for a vision based stabilization of the robotic swarm. The intent of this paper is to present the developed system as an enabling technology for various robotic tasks.",

        "abstract": "Low-cost but high performance robot arms are required for widespread use of service robots. Most robot arms use expensive motors and speed reducers to provide torques sufficient to support the robot mass and payload. If the gravitational torques due to the robot mass, which is usually much greater than the payload, can be compensated by some means, the robot would need much smaller torques, which can be delivered by cheap actuator modules. To this end, we propose a counterbalance mechanism which can completely counterbalance the gravitational torques due to the robot mass. Since most 6 DOF robots have 3 pitch joints, which are subject to gravitational torques due to the robot mass, we propose a 3 DOF counterbalance mechanism based on the double parallelogram mechanism, in which reference planes are provided to each joint for proper counterbalancing. A 5 DOF counterbalance robot arm was built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mechanism. Simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed mechanism had effectively decreased the torque required to support the robot mass, thus allowing the prospective use of low-cost motors and speed reducers for high performance root arms.",

The entire optic flow processing system, including the spatial and temporal filtering stages, has been updated with respect to the original design. This new lightweight sensor was tested under free-flying outdoor conditions over various fields onboard a 80 kg unmanned helicopter called ReSSAC. The visual disturbances encountered included helicopter vibrations, uncontrolled illuminance, trees, roads, and houses. The optic flow measurements obtained were finely analyzed online and also offline, using the sensors of various kinds mounted onboard ReSSAC. The results show that the optic flow measured despite the complex disturbances encountered closely matched the approximate ground-truth optic flow.",

        "abstract": "Untethered magnetic devices, such as magnetic microrobots and magnetically actuated capsule endoscopes, stand to significantly impact the field of minimally invasive medicine. These devices, which we refer to as magnetically actuated tools (MATs), are often controlled using electromagnets, which can be expensive to scale clinically. Due to their potential for low-cost and high strength, permanent magnets are being considered for MAT actuation. Great care must be taken for in vivo medical applications, however, as systems using single permanent magnets typically generate an attractive force, which may cause trauma if uncontrolled. In this paper, we present techniques for managing the attractive magnetic force. We find that in the case of rotating MATs actuated using a single rotating permanent magnet (RPM), for which magnetic torque is the primary form of actuation, the attractive magnetic force can be substantially reduced in magnitude and the time-averaged attractive component eliminated when operating the MAT such that magnetic torque is maximized. We provide experimental demonstration that validates and illustrates the force management strategies presented.",

The inability to hover and low agility in motion cause more difficulties on planning a feasible path in a compact region, and a limited payload allows only low-grade sensors for state estimation and control.",

        "abstract": "Object search is an integral part of daily life, and in the quest for competent mobile manipulation robots it is an unavoidable problem. Previous approaches focus on cases where objects are in unknown rooms but lying out in the open, which transforms object search into active visual search. However, in real life, objects may be in the back of cupboards occluded by other objects, instead of conveniently on a table by themselves. Extending search to occluded objects requires a more precise model and tighter integration with manipulation. We present a novel generative model for representing container contents by using object co-occurrence information and spatial constraints. Given a target object, a planner uses the model to guide an agent to explore containers where the target is likely, potentially needing to move occluding objects to enable further perception. We demonstrate the model on simulated domains and a detailed simulation involving a PR2 robot.",

We model each robot as a controlled Markov chain whose state comprises its position on a finite two-dimensional lattice and the direction of motion. The goal is to find the minimum number of robots and an associated time-invariant memoryless control policy that guarantees that the largest number of states are persistently surveilled without ever visiting a forbidden state. We propose a design method that relies on a finitely parametrized convex program inspired by entropy maximization principles. For clarity of exposition, we focus on simple dynamics and state/control spaces, however the proposed methodology can be extended to more general cases. Numerical examples are provided.",

        "abstract": "A novel design concept is presented for amplifying the displacement of a PZT stack over 50-fold while transmitting a significant amount of work per cycle. Piezoelectric devices, such as PZT stack actuators, have a competitive power density, while consuming virtually no energy for generating a force at a constant position. Despite the salient features, the actual work usable for activating a load is significantly reduced when displacement amplification mechanisms are used for attaining displacements large enough to drive a macroscopic robotic system. This paper addresses how the work produced by a PZT stack is transmitted to a load without attenuation. The theoretical limit of maximum work is obtained and experimentally verified. Conditions for transmitting the maximum work, i.e. maximum work transmissibility, are obtained based on a simple model. A novel displacement amplification mechanism using a flexure-free, buckling mechanism is then presented as a solution that satisfies the maximum energy transmissibility conditions. A prototype device is designed and tested. Initial experiments show promising results.",

        "abstract": "When an object is caged by a set of fingers, it cannot move arbitrarily far from the caging fingers regardless of what possible rigid motion it takes. Although this condition makes caging an attractive choice for nonprehensile manipulation, directly computing caging configurations is still a complex process. More importantly, using a cage could be too restrictive than necessary in many real cases. This is because some object motions rarely occur in reality. Therefore, some non-caging formations of fingers that only allow these rare escape motions can still effectively be deployed in many caging tasks. This paper introduces a concept of partial cage quality which determine an ability to cage an object of a non-caging formation of fingers, partial cage. We believe that the quality is closely related to possibility of an object escaping from a partial cage. A measurement framework based on motion planning is presented together with experimental results to illustrate and justify the proposed concept.",

First, it is demonstrated with ex vivo experiments that a spiral scan performs better than a raster scan on soft tissue. Then a mechanical design is developed in order to perform the spiral scan. The design in this paper is based on a conic structure with a particular curved surface. The mechanism is simple to implement and to drive; therefore, it is a low-cost solution. A 5:1 scale prototype is implemented by rapid prototyping and the requirements are validated by experiments. The experiments include manual and motor drive of the system. The manual drive demonstrates the resulting spiral motion by drawing the tip trajectory with an attached pencil. The motor drive demonstrates the speed control of the system with an analysis of video thread capturing the trajectory of a laser beam emitted from the tip.",

Whereas many traditional approaches to multi-agent navigation typically consist of two-levels \u2014 a macro-scale level providing agents with a global direction of motion around (large) static obstacles, and a micro-scale level in which agents seek to avoid collision with other agents \u2014 our approach adds a meso-scale level to give agents realistic behavior in scenarios where groups of other agents (e.g. families or crowds in a virtual world) form coherent entities. Rather than moving straight through such groups, our approach lets agents move around them. Our formulation considers each agent as an individual that may perceive sets of other agents as a group, and plans its motion accordingly. We base our approach on the velocity obstacle concept, and we show using simulation results that our method dramatically improves the quality of the trajectories computed for the agents.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a skeleton calibration method for orientation measurement sensors based motion capture systems. In this method, the orientation sensors are used to measure the posture of the limbs. A template is used to register the end-effectors' postures (feet, hands for example). Through capturing the limb postures while the end-effectors match with the pre-defined postures on the template, a linear equation system of the skeleton dimensions can be generated based on the human kinematics. The limb dimension parameters can be optimized based on that. The identifiablility of this skeleton dimension is discussed. The symmetric property of the skeleton is also taken into consideration. To demonstrate the method, IMU sensors and a footprint template are used to calibrate the lower limb dimension. Results show the absolute dimension errors can be controlled within centimeter level for this human lower limb calibration. Compared with existing methods, this template based method is a quick and self-contained method which does not need extra measurement devices, and the skeleton model does not have asymmetric problems. Since the inertial MoCap systems are widely used nowadays, this method is useful to generate an accurate skeleton model for precise behavior presentation.",

This control is used to achieve point-to-point positioning of the cluster, manipulation of microobjects, and assembly of microobjects into a microstructure. The control system achieves stable positioning of the cluster, while simultaneously compensating for the planar drag forces on the cluster and the microobject.

        "abstract": "This paper presents new insights about the sensor-based control of Gough-Stewart (GS) platforms. Previous works have shown that it was possible to control the GS platform by observing its legs directions instead of using the encoders values or the measurement of the platform pose. It was demonstrated that observing only three legs directions was enough for the control but no physical explanations were given. Moreover, sometimes, the GS platform was not converging to the desired pose and the reasons of these divergences were not disclosed. This paper aims at answering to this two opened problems. It is shown that observing three leg directions involves controlling the displacement of a hidden robot whose models differs from those of the usual GS platform. This robot has assembly modes and singular configurations different from those of the GS platform. This involves that the legs to observe should be chosen carefully in order to avoid inaccuracy problems. In this sense, the accuracy analysis of the new robot is performed to show the importance of the leg selection. All these results are validated on a GS platform simulator created using ADAMS/Controls and interfaced with Matlab/Simulink.",

If the cost bounds cannot be satisfied with the initial specification, then it is desirable to return to the user a specification that can be satisfied on the system within the desired cost budget. We prove that the specification revision problem for automata-based optimal planning is NP-complete. In order to provide exact solutions to the problem, we present an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation for different versions of the problem. Finally, we indicate that a Linear Program (LP) relaxation can compute fast approximations to the problem.",

        "abstract": "The use of free vibration in elastic structure can lead to energy efficient robot locomotion, since it significantly reduces the energy expenditure if properly designed and controlled. However, it is not well understood how to harness the dynamics of free vibration for the robot locomotion, because of the complex dynamics originated in discrete events and energy dissipation during locomotion. From this perspective, this paper explores three minimalistic models of free vibration that can characterize the basic principle of robot locomotion. Since the robot mainly exhibits vertical hopping, three one-dimensional models are examined that contain different configurations of simple spring-damper-mass components. The self-stability of these models are also investigated in simulation. The real-world and simulation experiments show that one of the models best characterizes the robot hopping, through analyzing the basic kinematics and negative works in actuation. Based on this model, the control parameters are analyzed for the energy efficient hopping.",

In this paper we present a biocompatible and sterilizable robot, together with an image-guidance approach designed to deliver the tip of the needle accurately to the blood clot and to move it within the clot, to aspirate it. An experimental evaluation demonstrates removal of 92% of the target clot tissue in a proof-of-concept phantom study.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a mobile robot localization system using multiple observations, which show the robot's global position. One of observations is GPS observation, the other is utilized an appearance based place recognition. Using GPS observations has still some challenging problems such as multipath and signal lost under the environments there is tall buildings nearby. It affects a significant error on localization. On the other hand, appearance based place recognition methods are efficient to recognize the robot's global position. It becomes possible to use a scene database with global position information. However, it could fail to function properly in natural environments like a lawn grass or trees in a park. We solve these demerits of each observations by using these multiple observations. Our system uses not only multiple observations but also dead reckoning with Gyrodometry model. As a result, the proposed localization system have achieved robust localization. To verify the validity of proposed method, our experiments using 1600m outdoor course in different seasons were conducted.",

        "abstract": "We present a mobile robot navigation system guided by a novel vision-based road recognition approach. The system represents the road as a set of lines extrapolated from the detected image contour segments. These lines enable the robot to maintain its heading by centering the vanishing point in its field of view, and to correct the long term drift from its original lateral position. We integrate odometry and our visual road recognition system into a grid-based local map that estimates the robot pose as well as its surroundings to generate a movement path. Our road recognition system is able to estimate the road center on a standard dataset with 25,076 images to within 11.42 cm (with respect to roads at least 3 m wide). It outperforms three other state-of-the-art systems. In addition, we extensively test our navigation system in four busy college campus environments using a wheeled robot. Our tests cover more than 5 km of autonomous driving without failure. This demonstrates robustness of the proposed approach against challenges that include occlusion by pedestrians, non-standard complex road markings and shapes, shadows, and miscellaneous obstacle objects.",

The work is aimed at off-road navigation for mobile ground robots where soft hazards are posed by varying terrain conditions (e.g. deformable soil, slopes, vegetation). Soft hazards pose operating constraints (i.e. speed limits) to the mobile robot that need to be satisfied to ensure motion safety. This paper presents a new morphological erosion operator that generalizes binary obstacle growing to mobility space (the space of speed limits) to deal with both hard and soft hazards seamlessly. This ensures that topological constraints due to vehicle size as well as momentum are taken into account, and leads to a straight-forward approach to generalize the concept of `regions of inevitable collision' for soft hazards.",

Further, unlike the Sarrus Linkage, which is overconstrained, this 7-R linkage is non-overconstrained. This property makes the Sarrus Linkage-like mechanism more robust to manufacturing errors. Simulation has shown that even with large manufacturing errors, such mechanism is still able to realize desired rectilinear motion. One possible application for this mechanism is a durable automotive suspension.",

Thereby, first a PD controller with gravity and Coriolis/centrifugal compensation shapes a desired dynamics, which is decoupled in terms of modal coordinates. Then an asymptotically stable limit cycle is generated on the link side dynamics for a selected mode. Finally, the modal control approach first introduced for rigid robots is extended to the VSA case. This is done by a joint torque controller, which decouples the torque dynamics from the link side dynamics. Stability and convergence are proven for the dynamics resulting from each feedback control. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of the proposed approach is verified by simulation and experiments on the VSA robotic arm DLR Hand Arm System.",

This novel UAV is developed to possess the capability to perform autonomous conversion between the Vertical Take-Off and Landing, and the Fixed-Wing flight modes. Via this design's implemented features however, the capability for additional control authority on the UAV's longitudinal translational motion arises: The rotor-tilting servos are utilized in performing thrust vectoring of the main rotors, thus exploiting their fast response characteristics in directly providing translation-controlling forces. The system's hovering translation is handled by a Model Predictive Control scheme, following the aforementioned actuation principles. While performing experimental studies of the overall controlled system's efficiency, the advantageous effects of this novel control authority are clearly noted. Additionally, in this article the considerations and requirements for operational autonomy-related on-board-only state estimation are addressed.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The increasing popularity of catheter-based ablation therapy in treating cardiac arrhythmia has motivated researchers to seek new techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of such procedures. After guiding the catheter through the vessels into the heart chambers, precise positioning of the catheter tip and consistent tool/tissue contact force are the two factors that greatly affect the ablation outcome. Implementing force/position control of the catheter tip will improve the efficacy of cardiac ablation procedures immensely. This paper proposes a model-based force control system to ensure a desired contact force at the distal tip, without directly measuring the force applied at the tip. In this regard, it is studied how the displacement of the proximal handle of a common 7-Fr pull-wire ablation catheter relates to the change of angle at its distal tip. The resulting mapping together with a mapping that relates the forces at the distal tip to the tip shape are used in developing a control system that ensures a desired contact force at the tip. This paper also introduces an optical strain sensor that can be used without modification in the manufacture of present day ablation catheters. This strain sensor completes the feedback loop of the control system through integration with the shape to force model. Performance of the control system is evaluated experimentally and the results suggest that model-based control of steerable catheters is feasible for catheter ablation. The proposed control system can be employed on a conventional ablation catheter following a fairly simple calibration step.",

        "abstract": "One of the most elegant ways of teaching new skills to robots is to provide demonstrations of a task and let the robot imitate this behavior. Such imitation learning is a non-trivial task: Different anatomies of robot and teacher, and reduced robustness towards changes in the control task are two major difficulties in imitation learning. We present an imitation-learning approach to efficiently learn a task from expert demonstrations. Instead of finding policies indirectly, either via state-action mappings (behavioral cloning), or cost function learning (inverse reinforcement learning), our goal is to find policies directly such that predicted trajectories match observed ones. To achieve this aim, we model the trajectory of the teacher and the predicted robot trajectory by means of probability distributions. We match these distributions by minimizing their Kullback-Leibler divergence. In this paper, we propose to learn probabilistic forward models to compute a probability distribution over trajectories. We compare our approach to model-based reinforcement learning methods with hand-crafted cost functions. Finally, we evaluate our method with experiments on a real compliant robot.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to develop new methods for telerobotic on-orbit servicing of spacecraft under ground-based supervisory control of human operators to perform tasks in the presence of uncertainty and telemetry time delay of several seconds. We propose a new delay tolerant control methodology, using virtual fixtures, hybrid position/force control, task frame formalism, and environment modeling, that is robust to modeling and registration errors. The task model is represented by graphical primitives and virtual fixtures on the teleoperation master and by a hybrid position/force controller on the slave robot. The virtual fixtures guide the operator through a model-based simulation of the task, and the goal of the slave controller is to reproduce this action (after a few seconds of delay) or, if measurements are not consistent with the models, to stop motion and alert the operator. This approach is suitable for tasks in unstructured environments, such as servicing of existing on-orbit spacecraft that were not designed for servicing. We introduce the overall control concept, its main components, and an example application in which the remote slave robot cuts the tape that secures a flap of multi-layer insulation over the access panel of a satellite mockup.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the wind turbine manufacturing industry, the bolt-nut joint tightening process is one of the core processes in the full production chain and concerned with assembling the hub body, the pitch system and the bearing unit. This operation is currently executed manually with the aid of different tools and gauges; the main disadvantages are a relatively high degree of variability and the necessity to repeat this task several times during a production run to achieve a satisfactory, final tightening torque within a specified angle range. Moreover, the bolt tightening process includes various uncertainties such as the presence of friction forces and the use of different bolt sizes with different stiffness values which make it highly nonlinear and uncertain resulting in a challenging control problem. To facilitate the development of an effective control strategy, we study the bolt tightening process and propose 4 tightening stages, namely, bolt-nut alignment, partial and full engagement and final bolt tightening. Based on the characteristics of each stage, a fuzzy controller is designed for each stage to realize the respective control objectives. A fuzzy error detector incorporating the knowledge of each stage is proposed for early error detection, making use of the input from a torque and encoder (angular position) sensor. Errors can be detected in each stage to interrupt the process and prevent any damage to the system.",

We propose a methodology that requires no prior knowledge of the objects' kinematics, including the type of joint - either prismatic or revolute. The method consists of a velocity controller which relies on force/torque measurements and estimation of the motion direction, rotational axis and the distance from the center of rotation. The method is suitable for any velocity controlled manipulator with a force/torque sensor at the end-effector. The force/torque control regulates the applied forces and torques within given constraints, while the velocity controller ensures that the end-effector moves with a task-related desired tangential velocity. The paper also provides a proof that the estimates converge to the actual values. The method is evaluated in different scenarios typically met in a household environment.",

The team's objective is to maximize the amount of time it takes an intruder boat to reach the asset. The team must cooperatively deal with uncertainty about which boats are actual intruders, employ active blocking to slow down intruders' movement towards the asset, and intelligently distribute themselves around the target to optimize future guarding opportunities. Our planner incorporates a market-based algorithm for allocating tasks to individual USVs by forward-simulating the mission and assigning estimated utilities to candidate task-allocation plans. The planner can be automatically adapted to a specific mission by optimizing the behaviors used to fulfil individual tasks. We present detailed simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

The parameterized probability density of object tracks unresolved in sensor data is updated via inferences about the sensor-to-object geometries necessary to result in occlusion of the unresolved object. Negative information is also leveraged to improve data association and to enable a novel death model, all of which contribute to a more accurate and precise belief of the local scene. Simulation and experimental results are presented from a common autonomous driving scenario.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for a flapping-wing actuation mechanism. Driven by oscillating magnetic torque acting on the rotor, the proposed actuator operates as a forced nonlinear oscillator. The resonance of the system is achieved by using a virtual magnetic spring without any mechanical components. Analytical models of the driving torque and the wing flapping (rotor) dynamics are derived and validated by experimental measurements from a parallel study. The flapping amplitude at primary resonance is obtained by solving the dynamic equation using the method of multiple time scale. The aerodynamic lift is then calculated based on quasi-steady aerodynamic model. Finally, the developed framework is used to investigate the feasibility and performance of the proposed actuator at different scales, while we show that a lift-to-weight ratio over one can be achieved in a large domain of design parameter space.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for solving the Constrained Manipulator Visual Servoing (CMVS) problem. Classical eye-in-hand visual servoing relies on a reference image to capture the end-effector positioning task, but non-convex workspace constraints (such as whole-arm collision and camera occlusion constraints) are not represented. An explicit CAD model of the workspace is typically required for collision avoidance and visibility planning algorithms. In our novel CMVS framework, during the reference image capture process, we leverage the user's kinesthetic and visual capabilities to obtain a set of qualitatively-diverse demonstrations that provide information about the robot's work environment. We investigate methods for identifying the topology of the feasible regions represented directly in the control space of the robot (i.e., image-space and joint-space). We use a combination of stochastic modeling and graphical methods to describe the feasible space, capturing both the inter-group and intra-group variations. Specifically, our method uses the inter-groups variations to build a map that describes the global connectivity of the space, while exploiting the intra-group variations to automatically derive the appropriate gains in the control law. For a given target object, we apply online Gaussian Mixture Regression to the relevant feasible space regions to provide an idealized trajectory for tracking in image-space and in joint-space. We illustrate the key advantages of our approach through a set of visual servoing experiments on a Barrett WAM 7-DOF manipulator with a Sony XC-HR70 camera.",

The conception of the oscillating-paddling gait is introduced firstly and followed by the thrust model. In order to verify the proposed model, a thrust measuring facility is built. A series of experiments are carried out with this facility. From the results, we verify the thrust model for the oscillating-paddling gait. Furthermore, we characterize how the amplitude and direction of the generated net thrust force relate with the amplitude, period and oscillation ratio of the oscillating-paddling gait.",

The model developed in this paper can be used to compute the recovery length of SMA springs. We used the model to develop a temperature feedback position controller to control the joint motion of the SMA spring-actuated robot. We also implemented a position controller for the robot using image feedback because the robot was designed to be operated under MRI guidance. Since the image tracking algorithm for image feedback control may fail in some situations, the temperature feedback controller can be used as a backup control scheme for the robot. The experimental results showed that the image feedback controller worked well while the temperature feedback controller did not. This is because the theoretical model did not include the nonlinear characteristics of the tendon-sheath mechanisms. Therefore, we used an empirical model to implement a temperature feedback controller and it was used to control the robot precisely.",

These scenarios are particularly critical for smaller robots with torque and power limited actuators, which as experimentally shown in this work can easily fail to accomplish their tasks in these environments. This paper motivates and provides a methodology that integrates the robot, actuator and terrain models with an efficient motion planner to exploit the vehicle momentum as a way to successfully traverse these difficult terrains. In particular, experimental results showing the efficacy of the proposed methodology are presented for a vegetation patch and a steep hill. Finally, a discussion of the necessary perception work to fully automate the process is included.",

Our target application is the estimation of moving surfaces during minimally invasive surgery for the purpose of aiding in the guidance of surgical tools. Our approach uses a bank of Kalman filters to estimate FFT parameters that encode the periodic motion of visually detected features. To ensure convergent estimation for this highly nonlinear problem, we have developed an iterative update procedure that treats the Kalman filter measurement update step as an optimization problem. Unlike existing solutions that rely on stereo vision, our approach estimates periodic motion with a single moving camera. With an experiment involving a beating heart phantom, we have shown that our approach is able to successfully estimate the periodic motion of visual features.",

If the robot pose is unknown, the region-based ceiling features from the current image are matched to a pre-built feature map from the RBPF-based SLAM process. Then, the candidate areas of the real robot pose are set around the matched features. The candidates are represented by two spots for the features having both position and orientation, while by a circle if they have only position. Finally, the real robot pose is determined at the intersection point. The candidate areas are realistically modeled by applying the observation error, and useless candidates are significantly reduced by considering the feature orientation. Several experiments in real environments validated the effectiveness of the proposed global localization scheme.",

Given a reference motion of the robot and the corresponding environment configuration, the spatial relationships between the robot body parts and the environment objects are extracted as a representation called the Interaction Mesh. Such a representation is then used in adapting the reference motion to an altered environment. By preserving the spatial relationships while satisfying physical constraints, collision-free and well balanced motions can be generated automatically and efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method can adapt different full body motions in significantly modified environments. Our method can be applied in precise robotic controls under complicated environments, such as rescue robots in accident scenes and searching robots in highly constrained spaces.",

        "abstract": "Direct transfer of human motion trajectories to humanoid robots does not result in dynamically stable robot movements due to the differences in human and humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics. We developed a system that converts human movements captured by a low-cost RGB-D camera into dynamically stable humanoid movements. The transfer of human movements occurs in real-time. As need arises, the developed system can smoothly transition between unconstrained movement imitation and imitation with balance control, where movement reproduction occurs in the null space of the balance controller. The developed balance controller is based on an approximate model of the robot dynamics, which is sufficient to stabilize the robot during on-line imitation. However, the resulting movements cannot be guaranteed to be optimal because the model of the robot dynamics is not exact. The initially acquired movement is therefore subsequently improved by model-free reinforcement learning, both with respect to the accuracy of reproduction and balance control. We present experimental results in simulation and on a real humanoid robot.",

For an arbitrary set of diffeomorphisms, this problem must be formulated as a generic search problem. We adapt established algorithms of the graph search family. In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and corresponding predicted observations. We describe several improvements that ameliorate performance: the introduction of better image similarities to use as heuristics; a method to reduce the number of expanded nodes by preliminarily identifying redundant plans; and a method to pre-compute composite actions that make the search efficient in all directions.",

        "abstract": "A human who uses a SEMG-based power assist robot suffers from unstable assistance due to noisy nature of SEMG signals. This study aimed at analyzing the quantitative stability of the human elbow movements during the power assistance. During self-paced elbow flexion in the sagittal plane, an exoskeleton robot provided the assistive torque that was proportional to the estimated human elbow torque using SEMG. Maximum finite time Lyapunov exponent (MFTLE), the average logarithmic rate of the divergence of neighboring trajectories, during elbow flexion assisted by the robot was computed as an index of movement stability. The results showed a trade-off between decrease of physical effort for the movements and the stability of the movements. The stability of the SEMG-based assistance by MFTLE deteriorated as the amount of the assistive torque was increased to the amount of the human torque, although the physical effort required by the user his forearm was decreased. This study can be used as a guide to determine the amount of SEMG-based assistive torque for maintaining the stability of the assisted movements.",

A key consideration is that the algorithm is suitable for real-time implementation on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The method begins by estimating the motion in the scene using regional phase correlation, and then fitting the positional predictions obtained using these regional motion vectors to an affine model representing the effect of camera motion on the background imagery. A combination of metrics, including phase correlation peak height (a confidence measure) and the error between the position predicted by the affine model and that obtained using the measured phase correlation vector, is used to indicate regions of interest where moving targets are present. The ability of the algorithm to detect approaching aircraft is analyzed using a number of aerial video sequences with different encounter geometries.",

Shallow-water environments, in particular, show complex and variable performance across physical space. This is a classic exploration vs. exploitation scenario, since choosing to visit new sites to learn their properties may be disadvantageous for cumulative data transmission if a better-performing site is already known with high confidence. Normal Gittins indices define a rule by which an optimal relay position can be chosen at each decision epoch, without assuming prior information and while pursuing the overall goal of maximizing total data transmission. We present results from shallow-water field experiments conducted with autonomous surface vehicles and acoustic modems transmitting data through a one-way, two-hop network in the Charles River Basin, Boston.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel estimation algorithm for filtering and regression with a number of advantages over existing methods. The algorithm has wide application in robotics as no assumptions are made about the underlying distributions, it can represent non-Gaussian multi-modal posteriors, and learn arbitrary non-linear models from noisy data. Our method is a generalisation of the Kernel Bayes' Rule that produces multi-modal posterior estimates represented as Gaussian mixtures. The algorithm learns non-linear state transition and observation models from data and represents all distributions internally as elements in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Inference occurs in the Hilbert space and can be performed recursively. When an estimate of the posterior distribution is required, we apply a quadratic programming pre-image method to determine the Gaussian mixture components of the posterior representation. We demonstrate our algorithm with two filtering experiments and one regression experiment; a multi-modal tracking simulation, a real tracking problem involving a miniature slot-car with an attached inertial measurement unit, and a regression problem of estimating the velocity field of a set of pedestrian paths for robot path-planning. Our algorithm compares favourably with the Gaussian process in the regression case, and a particle filter with learned process and observation models (the \u201cGP-BayesFilter\u201d particle filter).",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of object detection and pose estimation using 3D dense data in a multiple object library scenario. State-of-the-art object detection and pose estimation methods are able cope with background clutter and occlusion with acceptable noise levels in the single object scenario. However, with multiple object libraries, even moderate amount of noise lead to frequent object identity switches and serious pose estimation errors. To attenuate these effects, we propose a joint object-id and pose filtering approach using grid-based Recursive Bayesian Filters (RBF). The grid method considers as state variables the object label and its pose, and models the dynamics of the filter with two \u201cinertia\u201d parameters: one for the object label and the other for the object pose. Sensor noise characteristics are taken into account with an observation noise parameter. To allow real-time functionality we propose a selective update approach that dynamically reduces the set of hypotheses evaluated at run time. We present results in realistic scenarios and compare our approach with state-of-the-art approaches in a three object problem, with significant performance improvements.",

CPGs are modeled as autonomous differential equations, that generate the necessary limb movements to perform the walking gait of a biped robot. The search for the best set of CPG parameters is optimized by considering multiple objectives and according to a staged evolution. A sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the relationship between objectives, objectives and parameters, and allows to determine the functional meanings of the parameters. This resulting functional analysis enables to verify which parameters are relevant to the motor behaviors. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The different obtained walking gait solutions correspond to different trade-offs between the objectives.",

        "abstract": "Poor sensor data because of uncertainty and hardware limitations results in a robot misinterpreting the state of its surrounding environment, leading to bad decisions and eventually failure to successfully perform its desired tasks. These limitations can be overcome if a teammate robot with a better view shares its visual information. Our work aims to investigate why current approaches fail to effectively use teammate sensor data, propose an alternative where a teammate helps to better capture the state of the environment, and demonstrate that the robot can make better decisions when a teammate shares its perceptual data. Raw teammate sensor data is not meaningful unless provided a relative, geometric transform to place this data within another robot's own egocentric coordinates. There are few approaches that are able to discover this relative localization accurately in sparse environments while remaining computationally light. Our approach addresses these limitations by accumulating correspondence matches of objects over time from the overlapping views of two stationary robots to compute an accurate relative localization. We evaluate the benefits of teammate sensor data used with our computed relative localization with a challenging, time critical task where the robot's cameras alone are lacking. Our empirical results with two coordinating robots indicates that our approach is able to successfully take advantage of teammate robots with a better view within the challenging physical and hardware constraints of our robots.",

        "abstract": "The scheduling problem has been studied extensively in the literature. Many algorithms have been developed to operate with different types of processors and tasks. In the robotics domain, when considering each robot as a processor, some of these algorithms can be directly adapted. However, most of the existing algorithms can only handle single-robot tasks, or multi-robot tasks that can be divided into single-robot tasks. As the task requirements may only be partially known, and the available (heterogeneous) robots can dynamically change, robots may be required to cooperate tightly to share different capabilities (i.e., sensors and motors). In such cases, considering scheduling for individual robots is no longer sufficient, since the robots need to work at the coalition level. Although there exist a few algorithms that also support these more complex cases, they do not represent efficient solutions that can be adapted by various multi-robot systems in a convenient manner. In this paper, we propose heuristics to address the multi-robot task scheduling problem at the coalition level, which hides the details of robot specifications, thus allowing these heuristics to be incorporated straightforwardly. These heuristics are easy to implement and efficient enough to run in real time. We provide formal analyses and simulation results to demonstrate and compare their performances.",

Multi-sensor fusion is a suitable means to combine the advantages of different measurement principles. However, this may lead to out-of-sequence measurements, i.e., asynchronous measurements where the original order of the measurements is lost. High-performance out-of-sequence algorithms are therefore needed that do not depend on the order of the measurements. In addition, existence probabilities can increase the reliability of the fusion system especially in safety critical applications. This paper presents a novel approach to handle out-of-sequence measurements not only in state estimation, but also in existence estimation. The method is shown to result in equal or less computational costs than state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with real world data from crash tests.",

Whilst for many tasks knowing the positions of objects may be sufficient, tracking the identity of targets may also be desirable. When objects are well separated preserving identities is trivial, however, the identities of objects that pass close to one another may become confused. This paper considers methods to maintain the identities of tracked objects using a combination of LIDAR and video data. When objects are well separated, they are tracked using location information from the LIDAR. When objects move together and their identities cannot be resolved, interactions are recorded and later resolved using appearance models. A vision based approach is adapted for use with LIDAR data and a new method for identity reasoning is proposed. The methods are validated on a dataset comprising a total of 37906 manually labelled point cloud segments.",

        "abstract": "A solution to the relative scale problem where reconstructed moving objects and the stationary world are represented in a unified common scale has proven equivalent to a conjecture. Motion reconstruction from a moving monocular camera is considered ill posed due to known problems of observability. We show for the first time several significant motion reconstruction of outdoor vehicles moving along non-holonomic curves and straight lines. The reconstructed motion is represented in the unified frame which also depicts the estimated camera trajectory and the reconstructed stationary world. This is possible due to our Multibody VSLAM framework with a novel solution for relative scale proposed in the current paper. Two solutions that compute the relative scale are proposed. The solutions provide for a unified representation within four views of reconstruction of the moving object and are thus immediate. In one, the solution for the scale is that which satisfies the planarity constraint of the object motion. The assumption of planar object motion while being generic enough is subject to stringent degenerate situations that are more widespread. To circumvent such degeneracies we assume that the object motion to be locally circular or linear and find the relative scale solution for such object motions. Precise reconstruction is achieved in synthetic data. The fidelity of reconstruction is further vindicated with reconstructions of moving cars and vehicles in uncontrolled outdoor scenes.",

The proposed method is based on a combination of different recognition pipelines, each exploiting the data in a diverse manner and generating object hypotheses that are ultimately fused together in an Hypothesis Verification stage that globally enforces geometrical consistency between model hypotheses and the scene. Such a scheme boosts the overall recognition performance as it enhances the strength of the different recognition pipelines while diminishing the impact of their specific weaknesses. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmark datasets for object recognition comprising 35 object models and, respectively, 176 and 353 scenes.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of extending the flight duration of cooperative missions with multiple gliding fixed-wing UAVs by using the energy that comes from static soaring. We consider exploration missions where UAVs should pass through a set of Point of Interest (PoI) with the presence of thermals in the space. These thermals can be exploited to provide energy in terms of altitude for each gliding UAV. The objective of the mission is to extend the flight duration of each UAV to explore the environment without landing and decreasing the time to perform the mission. An algorithm named Bounded Recursive Heuristic Search (BRHS), based on Depth-First search techniques, is applied to the PoIs and to the UAVs. The main advantage is the real time application because of the low computational load. The paper presents a set of simulations and experiments have carried out in the airfield of La Cartuja (Seville, Spain).",

The contribution of this paper is to propose a centralized approach to network evolution. In this approach, a communication coordinator is responsible for determining the network topology. The robots periodically send their state information to the communication coordinator. In turn, the communication coordinator considers the individual communication payoff functions of all the robots, their current states and the current network simultaneously and finds a network topology acceptable to all the robots. It models the network topology formation as a pairwise game where it forms or severs pairwise links based on the improvement the resulting network offers the robot pairs relative to the current network. We show that with the assumed form of communication payoff functions, each pairwise game is ensured of convergence to a pairwise stable network. Furthermore, simulation results provide statistical results on the resulting network topology, the number of game moves and the processing time as well as comparative results with the proximity based approach.",

        "abstract": "Swing leg placement is vital to dynamic stability in legged robots and animals. The most common approaches to generating swing leg motions in robotics use either position or impedance tracking of defined joint trajectories. While these approaches suffice in humanoids, they severely limit swing leg placement under large disturbances in prosthetic limbs, for which stabilizing reactions cannot be planned centrally. We previously identified a control for a conceptual double-pendulum swing leg that does not require predefined trajectories to robustly place the leg into target points on the ground in the presence of large disturbances. We here develop a more detailed neuromuscular model of the human swing leg and interpret the identified control with local muscle reflexes. The resulting reflex control robustly places the swing leg into a wide range of landing points observed in human walking and running, and it generates similar patterns of joint torques and muscle activations. While we plan to take advantage of the comparison between the neuromuscular model and humans to further improve robust swing leg placement, the current results suggest an alternative to existing swing leg controls in humanoid and rehabilitation robotics which does not require central processing.",

In this study, two different mechanisms are used for forward and lateral motion: rotation of helices in the direction of the helical axis leads to forward motion in the viscous fluid, and rolling due to wall traction results with the lateral motion near the wall. Experiments are conducted using a magnetic helical swimmer having 1.5 mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter placed inside two different glycerol-filled channels with rectangular cross sections. The strength, direction and rotational frequency of the externally applied rotating magnetic field are used as inputs to control the position and direction of the micro swimmer in Y- and T-shaped channels.",

In the last decade, image-moments have been exploited in several visual servoing schemes for their ability to represent object region, object defined by contours or a set of discrete points. Despite the many recent advances, the choice of moment-based features to control the most critical Degrees Of Freedom (DOF), i.e those used to control the rotational motions around the x-axis and y-axis of the camera remains a key issue. In this paper, a new feature formula to control these critical DOF that does not depend on the object shape is proposed. The new features are computed from shifted moments and selected in order to provide nice invariant properties. Additionally, low order shifted moments can be exploited to minimize the impact of measurement noise on the control performances.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a new shank mechanism and mimicking the human-like walking in the horizontal and frontal plane. One of human walking characteristics is that the COM (Center Of Mass) motion in the lateral direction is as small as 30 mm. We assume that it is thanks to the human walking characteristics in the horizontal plane that the step width is as narrow as 90 mm and the foot rotation angle is 12 deg. To mimic these characteristics, we developed a new shank and implemented it in a humanoid robot WABIAN-2RIII. It has a parallel mechanism which mimics the shank's size of human. Thanks to its size almost the same as human's the robot is capable of realizing gait with the narrow step width of 90 mm and the foot rotation angle of 12 deg. We evaluated the performance of the shank using WABIAN-2RIII. The robot could realize stepping in place with lateral displacement of CoM within 34 mm, which is almost as small as that of human.",

        "abstract": "Biologically inspired Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) offer the capability to execute cyclic and/or explosive multi degree of freedom (DoF) motions efficiently by storing elastic energy. This paper studies the preconditions which allow to induce robust cyclic motions for strongly nonlinear, underactuated multi DoF robotic arms. By experimental observations of human motor control, a simple control law is deduced. This controller achieves intrinsic oscillatory motions by switching the motor position triggered by a joint torque threshold. Using the derived controller, the periodic behavior of the robotic arm is analyzed in simulations. It is found that a modal analysis of the linearized system at the equilibrium point allows to qualitatively predict the periodic behavior of this type of strongly nonlinear systems. The central statement of this paper is that cyclic motions can be induced easily in VIA systems, if the eigenfrequencies and modal damping values of the linearized system are well separated. Validation is given by simulation and experiments, where a human controls a simulated robotic arm, and the developed regulator controls a robotic arm in simulation and experiments.",

This paper proposes to address the challenges of online real-world mapping by building upon previous work on compact spatial representation and formulating a novel 3D mapping approach \u2014 the Normal Distributions Transform Occupancy Map (NDT-OM). The presented algorithm enables accurate real-time 3D mapping in large-scale dynamic environments employing a recursive update strategy. In addition, the proposed approach can seamlessly provide maps at multiple resolutions allowing for fast utilization in high-level functions such as localization or path planning. Compared to previous approaches that use the NDT representation, the proposed NDT-OM formulates an exact and efficient recursive update formulation and models the full occupancy of the map.",

        "abstract": "We believe the core of handling the complexity of coordinated multiagent search lies in identifying which subsets of robots can be safely decoupled, and hence planned for in a lower dimensional space. Our work, as well as those of others take that perspective. In our prior work, we introduced an approach called subdimensional expansion for constructing low-dimensional but sufficient search spaces for multirobot path planning, and an implementation for graph search called M*. Subdimensional expansion dynamically increases the dimensionality of the search space in regions featuring significant robot-robot interactions. In this paper, we integrate M* with Meta-Agent Constraint-Based Search (MA-CBS), a planning framework that seeks to couple repeatedly colliding robots allowing for other robots to be planned in low-dimensional search space. M* is also integrated with operator decomposition (OD), an A*-variant performing lazy search of the outneighbors of a given vertex. We show that the combined algorithm demonstrates state of the art performance.",

Our algorithm first decomposes the scene into a set of candidate mesh segments and then ranks each segment according to its \u201cobjectness\u201d - a quality that distinguishes objects from clutter. To do so, we propose five intrinsic shape measures: compactness, symmetry, smoothness, and local and global convexity. We additionally propose a recurrence measure, codifying the intuition that frequently occurring geometries are more likely to correspond to complete objects. We evaluate our method in both supervised and unsupervised regimes on a dataset of 58 indoor scenes collected using an Open Source implementation of Kinect Fusion [1]. We show that our approach can reliably and efficiently distinguish objects from clutter, with Average Precision score of .92. We make our dataset available to the public.",

This problem is an instance of the inverse motion planning problem, in which we solve for a configuration of the environment that makes desired trajectories likely. To calculate the probability that an object will take a particular trajectory, we model the physics of placing as a mixture model of simple object motions. Our algorithm searches over the possible configurations of the object and environment and uses this model to choose the configuration most likely to lead to a successful place. We show that this algorithm allows the PR2 robot to execute placements that fail with traditional placing implementations.",

We contribute a formulation of the object search by manipulation problem using visibility and accessibility relations between objects. We also propose a greedy algorithm and show that it is optimal under certain conditions. We propose a second algorithm which is optimal under all conditions. This algorithm takes advantage of the structure of the visibility and accessibility relations between objects to quickly generate optimal plans. Finally, we demonstrate an implementation of both algorithms on a real robot using a real object detection system.",

By modeling each cell with distributed springs and dampers, we discuss how many sensing points are necessary and sufficient for evaluating cell stiffness. We define the observability by the velocity of each cell through a micro-channel based upon the experimental observation that the equilibrium velocity of a cell varies corresponding to its stiffness. We conclude that for evaluating cell stiffness, two points are necessary and sufficient while using an infinitely long channel, and three are necessary and sufficient for judging whether cell stiffness is observable or not.

        "abstract": "Occupancy grids have been widely used for mapping with mobile robots for nearly 30 years. Occupancy grids discretize the analog environment and seek to determine the occupancy probability of each cell. Traditional occupancy grid mapping methods make two assumptions for computational efficiency and it has been shown that the full posterior is computationally intractable without these assumptions. This paper employs a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) known as Gibbs sampling to sample from the full posterior. By drawing many samples, we are able to capture the full posterior, which more accurately represents the uncertainty in the map due to sensor measurement error. The MCMC method is shown to compute the full posterior in a 1D toy example, and it is shown to be computationally tractable, though not online, for realistic 2D simulations.",

Experiments inside a water tank with an 8-arm robotic prototype successfully demonstrated the sculling-only gaits, attaining a maximum speed of approximately 0.2 body lengths per second. Similar trends were observed, as in the simulation studies, with respect to the effect of the kinematic parameters on propulsion.",

        "abstract": "We develop fast reinforcement learning (RL) framework using the approximated dynamics of a humanoid robot. Although RL is a useful non-linear optimizer, applying it to real robotic systems is usually difficult due to the large number of iterations required to acquire suitable policies. In this study, we approximate the dynamics using data from a real robot with sparse pseudo-input Gaussian processes (SPGPs). By using SPGPs, we estimated the probability distribution considering both the input vector and output signal variances. In real environments, since the observations from robotic sensors include large noise, SPGPs can suitably approximate the stochastic dynamics of a real humanoid robot. We use the approximated dynamics to improve the performance of a movement task in a path integral RL framework, which updates a policy from the sampled trajectories of the state and action vectors and the cost. We implemented our proposed method on a real humanoid robot and tested on a via-point reaching task. The robot achieved successful performance with fewer number of interactions with the real environment by using the proposed method than a conventional approach which dose not use the simulated dynamics.",

Given an automatic and self-contained procedure which allows the robot to calibrate itself without the need of external tools, we are interested in how to select the set of configurations that maximize calibration accuracy while minimizing calibration time. We experiment with the active calibration of a multi-sensorial humanoid's upper body and report that determinant-based criteria should be preferred when a greedy selection is used. In addition to criteria comparison, we further propose a new criterion for configuration selection. Its novelty stems from a direct treatment of the robot's end-effector tool variance. This is contrary to previous approaches which target the variance indirectly via calibration parameters. Our proposed objective function is derived as a compact formulation from the mean error of the robot's end-effector tool from which its variance can be computed using traditional criteria known from the theory of optimal experimental design (e.g. A-optimality).",

The planners are assumed to divide the total planning problem across some parameter space(s), such as task space, state space, action space, or time. Robotic applications have employed ensembles of planners for decades, although the concept has not been formally unified or analyzed until now. We focus on applications in multi-robot navigation and collision avoidance. We show that individual resolutionor probabilistically-complete planners that meet certain communication criteria constitute a (respectively, resolution- or probabilistically-) complete ensemble of planners. This ensemble of planners, in turn, guarantees that the robots are free of deadlock, livelock, and starvation.",

In these cases the pursuer has two options for recovering visual contact with the evader: to perform search over the possible locations where the evader might be moving, or to clear the environment, in other words to progressively search it without allowing the evader to move into locations that have already been cleared. It has been shown that in sufficiently complex environments a single pursuer having the same speed as the evader cannot clear the environment. In this work we prove that computing the minimum speed which enables a faster pursuer to clear a graph environment is NP-hard. In light of this result we provide an experimental comparison of randomized and deterministic search strategies on planar graphs, which has practical significance in search and rescue settings.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Concentric tube continuum robots provide an infinite-dimensional design space, consisting of individual tube space curves and other tube parameters. Even when design choices are made to restrict the design space to a small number of discrete parameters, ad hoc selection of parameter values to achieve coverage of a desired volume, in the presence of geometric workspace constraints, is essentially impossible - even for experienced researchers. General design algorithms proposed to date have focused on reaching a discrete set of specific points, and have made non-physical approximations in the robot model (most significantly assuming infinite torsional rigidity), to speed up model computation. In this paper, we extend prior algorithms to use more accurate models and incorporate volume-based objectives. These extensions are illustrated in a case study on the design of a concentric tube robot for endonasal pituitary surgery. We show that volume-based design optimization increases the reachable percentage of the surgical workspace by an average of approximately 50%, in comparison to various sets of manually selected design parameters. We conclude that volume-based objectives should be included in future multi-objective design optimization procedures for concentric tube continuum robots.",

The gravity compensation technique uses remote counterweights connected to the robot via a low-pressure hydraulic transmission. Low-friction diaphragm cylinders are used in order to provide very low residual friction. A two-stage balancing bench allows using a unique moving counterweight to adapt the balancing to a payload of up to 10 kg, that is the maximal payload of the gripper. The robot can be easily moved passively while being capable of physically assisting humans in the performance of tasks.",

Firstly, a novel coupled PD-control algorithm which yields uniform eigenfrequencies and properties in all directions of motion is introduced. The results of the linear model are compared to automated MBS-simulations. Afterwards, the stability range is compared to the actual measured stability range which is much smaller. Elasticity effects due to the platform and the joint stiffness are implemented in the MBS-model and evaluated. In the last step, we compare the simulated stability regions of the updated MBS-models to the measured boundaries.",

The co-registration of two images is useful in mobile robotics for determining motion over time. These camera measurements can constrain a robot's relative poses so that the trajectory and map can be estimated in a technique known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Here, we comment on the importance of propagating uncertainty in both feature extraction and camera calibration in visual pose-graph SLAM. We derive an improved pose covariance estimate that leverages the Unscented Transform, and compare its performance to previous methods in both simulated and experimental trials. The two experiments reported here involve data from a camera mounted on a KUKA robotic arm (where a precise ground-truth trajectory is available) and a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) for large-scale autonomous ship hull inspection.",

Such affordance models capture the interdependencies between properties of multiple objects, executed actions, and effects of those actions on objects. Recently it was shown how to learn such models from observed video demonstrations of actions manipulating several objects. This paper extends that work and employs those models for sequential tasks. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we employ affordance models sequentially in order to recognize the individual actions making up a demonstrated sequential skill or high level concept. Second, we utilize the models of concepts to plan a suitable course of action to replicate the observed consequences of a demonstration. For this we adopt the framework of relational Markov decision processes. Empirical results show the viability of the affordance models for sequential manipulation skills for object placement.",

During this task, the mechanical systems can be subject to large forces for short duration (impacts). In space servicers, these impacts may render the capturing of a target impossible without the use of undesirable fuel-consuming maneuvers. This paper presents an approach for minimizing impact reactions, using the Center of Percussion (CoP), a characteristic of rigid bodies rotating around an axis. This work generalizes and delineates the exact requirements for its use. Application of CoP in multibody systems is demonstrated using the Newton-Euler Algorithm. Implementation guidelines are discussed. Simulations of a planar space robot system, and a three-dimensional PUMA-like manipulator on a satellite base confirm the benefit of using the CoP during tasks that include impacts.",

        "abstract": "Stereo-based visual odometry algorithms are heavily dependent on an accurate calibration of the rigidly fixed stereo pair. Even small shifts in the rigid transform between the cameras can impact on feature matching and 3D scene triangulation, adversely affecting pose estimates and applications dependent on long-term autonomy. In many field-based scenarios where vibration, knocks and pressure change affect a robotic vehicle, maintaining an accurate stereo calibration cannot be guaranteed over long periods. This paper presents a novel method of recalibrating overlapping stereo camera rigs from online visual data while simultaneously providing an up-to-date and up-to-scale pose estimate. The proposed technique implements a novel form of partitioned bundle adjustment that explicitly includes the homogeneous transform between a stereo camera pair to generate an optimal calibration. Pose estimates are computed in parallel to the calibration, providing online recalibration which seamlessly integrates into a stereo visual odometry framework. We present results demonstrating accurate performance of the algorithm on both simulated scenarios and real data gathered from a wide-baseline stereo pair on a ground vehicle traversing urban roads.

        "abstract": "A human's center of mass (CoM) trajectory is useful to evaluate the dynamic stability during daily life activities such as walking and standing up. To estimate the subject-specific CoM position in the home environment, we make use of a statically equivalent serial chain (SESC) developed with a portable measurement system. In this paper we implement a constrained Kalman filter to achieve an online estimation of the SESC parameters while accounting for the human body's bilateral symmetry. This results in constraining SESC parameters to be consistent with the human skeletal model used. The proposed identification method can inform the subject or the therapist, in real-time, about the quality of the on-going CoM estimation. This information can be helpful to reduce the identification time and establish a personalized protocol. A Kinect is used as a markerless motion capture system for measuring limb orientations while the Wii board is used to measure the subject's center of pressure (CoP) during the identification phase. CoP measurements and Kinect data were recorded for four able-bodied subjects. The recorded data was then given to the proposed recursive algorithm to identify the parameters of the SESC online. A cross-validation test was performed to verify the identification performance. The results for these subjects are shown and discussed.",

An online learning method for reservoir computing is exploited for this task. This online learning method does not require a separate teaching data collection phase; thus, it has the potential to achieve autonomy in soft robots.

        "abstract": "In this paper a novel approach to kinematics learning and task space control, under switching contexts, is presented. Such non-stationary contexts may appear in many robotic tasks: in particular, the changing of the context due to the use of tools with different lengths and shapes is herein studied. We model the robot forward kinematics as a multi-valued function, in which different outputs for the same input query are related to actual different hidden contexts. To do that, we employ IMLE, a recent online learning algorithm that fits an infinite mixture of linear experts to the online stream of training data. This algorithm can directly provide multi-valued regression in a online fashion, while having, for classic single-valued regression, a performance comparable to state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. The context varying forward kinematics is learned online through exploration, not relying on any kind of prior knowledge. Using the proposed approach, the robot can dynamically learn how to use different tools, without forgetting the kinematic mappings concerning previously manipulated tools. No information is given about such tool changes to the learning algorithm, nor any assumption is made about the tool kinematics. To our knowledge this is the most general and efficient approach to learning and control under discrete varying contexts. Some experimental results obtained on a high-dimensional simulated humanoid robot provide a strong support to our approach.",

        "abstract": "Bipedal humanoid robots will fall under unforeseen perturbations without active stabilization. Humans use dynamic full body behaviors in response to perturbations, and recent bipedal robot controllers for balancing are based upon human biomechanical responses. However these controllers rely on simplified physical models and accurate state information, making them less effective on physical robots in uncertain environments. In our previous work, we have proposed a hierarchical control architecture that learns from repeated trials to switch between low-level biomechanically-motivated strategies in response to perturbations. However in practice, it is hard to learn a complex strategy from limited number of trials available with physical robots. In this work, we focus on the very problem of efficiently learning the high-level push recovery strategy, using simulated models of the robot with different levels of abstraction, and finally the physical robot. From the state trajectory information generated using different models and a physical robot, we find a common low dimensional strategy for high level push recovery, which can be effectively learned in an online fashion from a small number of experimental trials on a physical robot. This learning approach is evaluated in physics-based simulations as well as on a small humanoid robot. Our results demonstrate how well this method stabilizes the robot during walking and whole body manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Several potentially important science targets have been observed in extreme terrains (steep or vertical slopes, possibly covered in loose soil or granular media) on other planets. Robots which can access these extreme terrains will likely use tethers to provide climbing and stabilizing force. To prevent tether entanglement during descent and subsequent ascent through such terrain, a motion planning procedure is needed. Abad-Manterola, Nesnas, and Burdick [1] previously presented such a motion planner for the case in which the geometry of the terrain is known a priori with high precision. Their algorithm finds ascent/descent paths of fixed homotopy, which minimizes the likelihood of tether entanglement. This paper presents an extension of the algorithm to the case where the terrain is poorly known prior to the start of the descent. In particular, we develop new results for how the discovery of previously unknown obstacles modifies the homotopy classes underlying the motion planning problem. We also present a planning algorithm which takes the modified homotopy into account. An example illustrates the methodology.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We address the problem of automatically segmenting dynamic objects in an urban environment from a moving camera without manual labelling, in an online, self-supervised learning manner. We use input images obtained from a single uncalibrated camera placed on top of a moving vehicle, extracting and matching pairs of sparse features that represent the optical flow information between frames. This optical flow information is initially divided into two classes, static or dynamic, where the static class represents features that comply to the constraints provided by the camera motion and the dynamic class represents the ones that do not. This initial classification is used to incrementally train a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier to segment dynamic objects in new images. The hyperparameters of the GP covariance function are optimized online during navigation, and the available self-supervised dataset is updated as new relevant data is added and redundant data is removed, resulting in a near-constant computing time even after long periods of navigation. The output is a vector containing the probability that each pixel in the image belongs to either the static or dynamic class (ranging from 0 to 1), along with the corresponding uncertainty estimate of the classification. Experiments conducted in an urban environment, with cars and pedestrians as dynamic objects and no prior knowledge or additional sensors, show promising results even when the vehicle is moving at considerable speeds (up to 50 km/h). This scenario produces a large quantity of featureless regions and false matches that is very challenging for conventional approaches. Results obtained using a portable camera device also testify to our algorithm's ability to generalize over different environments and configurations without any fine-tuning of parameters.",

This allocation problem is a more complex allocation problem in the presence of a queue time restriction. In this paper, this problem is formulated and solved to determine the optimal allocation of testers and SIU's to wafer products over a planning horizon, such that overall WIP throughout the planning horizon is minimized. The optimal solution also comprehends restrictions on the amount of wafers that may be shipped to other testing sites and replenishment policies regarding new SIU's.",

        "abstract": "A properly designed elastic actuation can increase the jumping height that a legged robot can reach. In this paper we compare the two most popular conceptual soft actuator designs, parallel elastic (PEA) and series elastic (SEA), in the task of maximizing the jumping height. Such task is translated into an optimal control problem. For a simplified version of the problem an analytical solution is provided, while a problem with more realistic constraints (e.g. the linear torque-speed motor characteristic is taken into account) is stated as a convex optimization problem and numerically solved. The results show that: (i) given the power of the motor there exists an optimal constant stiffness that maximizes the performance for both the SEA and the PEA; (ii) the optimal stiffness depends on the task terminal time, the inertial parameters of the system and the reduction ratio of the motor; (iii) in the condition considered the SEA behaves better than the PEA.",

The actuator is capable of effectively managing the storage and release of the potential energy of the compliant element by the appropriate control of the clutch subsystem. Controlling the timing of the energy storage/release in the elastic element is exploited for improving motion control in this research. This paper analyses how this class of actuation systems can be used to maximize the link velocity of the joint. The dynamic model of the joint is derived and an optimal control strategy is proposed to identify optimal input reference profiles for the actuator (motor position/velocity and clutch activation timing) which permit the link velocity maximization. The effect of compliance of the joint on the performance of the system is studied and the optimal stiffness is analyzed.",

The thrust output of this device depends greatly on the nature of the expelled jet, with greater output occurring for jets which form a single coherent vortex ring rather than a vortex ring with a trailing wake. The average thrust output as well as the jetting efficiency are maximized with respect to the thruster's nozzle diameter and jet velocity program. The appropriate constraints of the problem are defined including a dynamic constraint to ensure that the propulsive jet forms a single vortex ring. It is shown that the average thrust output under these constraints reaches a maximum when the nozzle radius is set to a critical value, and that using an orifice nozzle decreases propulsive efficiency at low Reynolds numbers.",

Our contribution is three-fold: first, we describe a simple method to automatically generate minimum bounding capsules around exact robot body geometries represented by meshes. Second, we use the bounding capsules to implement distance constraints for an optimal control problem solver and achieve (self-)collision avoidance. Finally, we propose a complete two-stage framework for optimal motion planning on complex robots. This framework is successfully applied to generate optimal collision-free trajectories both in simulation and on the humanoid robot HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "The passive dynamics of actuators may impose serious limitations to the performance of a system. Existence of inertia for example makes it impossible for the actuators to react immediately. A throwing mechanism (with electric motors) is composed of two inertias (object and motor) that decreases the performance of the system and can not be overcome with software control. But, we can use other elements (like a spring) to make the motor inertia a benefit to improve the performance of the system. Moreover, when the object is directly connected to the motor, the maximum velocity that the object can achieve is limited to the maximum velocity that can be provided by the motor. Previous research shows that passive dynamics is not always harmful, and can increase the performance of a mechanism. Here, we will extract mathematical formula that gives us the required optimum value for stiffness and/or damping of the system to give us the optimal performance given physical limitations.",

        "abstract": "For robots that are redundant with respect to a given task, we present an optimal differential kinematic inversion method in the presence of hard bounds on joint range, joint velocity, and joint acceleration. These hard bounds specify the robot motion capabilities that cannot be exceeded at any time. On the other hand, scaling of the desired task trajectory is allowed whenever the robot capabilities are insufficient to execute the original task. For a problem formulated in this way, we have recently presented the Saturation in the Null Space (SNS) algorithm that produces an efficient solution, based on Jacobian pseudoinversion and recovery in the null space of the saturation effects of a reduced number of joint velocity commands. To investigate the optimality properties of the SNS algorithm, we recast the problem as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, in which the joint velocity norm as well as the task scaling are to be minimized. Its solution leads to a variant of the original algorithm, the Optimal Saturation in the Null Space (Opt-SNS). The Opt-SNS guarantees an optimal solution also when the basic SNS fails to do so and improves the numerical performance over the state-of-the-art QP solver. The possible existence of discontinuous solutions for the formulated problem is avoided by the introduction of a task scaling margin. The extension to the multi-task case is also presented. Simulation results for the 7R lightweight KUKA LWR IV robot illustrate the properties and computational efficiency of the new algorithm.",

        "abstract": "For robots to effectively interact with the real world, they will need to perform complex tasks over long time horizons. This is a daunting challenge, but recent advances using hierarchical planning [1] have been able to provide leverage on this problem. Unfortunately, this approach makes no effort to account for the execution cost of an abstract plan and often arrives at poor quality plans. This paper outlines a method for dynamically improving a hierarchical plan during execution. We frame the underlying question as one of evaluating the resource needs of an abstract operator and propose a general way to approach estimating them. We ran experiments in challenging domains and observed up to 30% reduction in execution cost when compared with a standard hierarchical planner.",

The presented work involves the use of an overarching (centralized) airspace optimization model, formulated analytically as a network-based model with side constraints describing a time-expanded network model of the terminal airspace in which the UAVs navigate to one or more (possibly moving) landing zones. This model generates optimal paths in a centralized manner such that the UAVs are properly sequenced into the landing areas. The network-based model is \u201cgrown\u201d using agent-based simulation with simple flocking rules. Relevant measures of performance include, e.g., the total time necessary to land the swarm.

        "abstract": "Solving complex robot manipulation tasks requires to combine motion generation on the geometric level with planning on a symbolic level. On both levels robotics research has developed a variety of mature methodologies, including geometric motion planning and motion primitive learning on the motor level as well as logic reasoning and relational Reinforcement Learning methods on the symbolic level. However, their robust integration remains a great challenge. In this paper we approach one aspect of this integration by optimizing the motion primitives on the geometric level to be as consistent as possible with their symbolic predictions. The so optimized motion primitives increase the probability of a \u201csuccessful\u201d motion-meaning that the symbolic prediction was indeed achieved. Conversely, using these optimized motion primitives to collect new data about the effects of actions the learnt symbolic rules becomes more predictive and deterministic.",

Asynchronous lip postures in a robot speech gives most human listeners strongly negative impressions of fakeness, horror and awkwardness. Some misperception might happen while the speech listeners are hearing one voice but seeing another different mouth pattern. A 2-DOF oral mechanism is developed to perform lip synchronization for an android robot with speaking capabilities in this study. Its functional specification is determined through some preliminary investigations. After merging two types of classical mechanism designs, it can generate 6 essential lip postures for speech matching. The realistic effect on lip synchronized speech of this 2-DOF system is close to that of the Multi-DOF ones. The effectiveness of the lip-synchronization of the new simplified oral mechanism has been demonstrated in verification experiments.",

Our approach allows a robot to \u201clook behind\u201d an occluder and re-acquire its target. To allow efficient planning, we avoid exhaustive mapping of the 3D occluder into configuration space, and instead use informed samples to strike a balance between target search and information gain. A particle filter continuously estimates the target location when it is not visible. Meanwhile, we build a simple but effective map of the occluder's extents to compute potential occlusion-clearing motions using very few calls to efficient approximations of inverse kinematics. Our mixed-initiative cost function balances the goal of directly locating the target with the goal of gaining information through mapping the occluder. Monte-Carlo optimization with efficient data-driven proposals allows us to approximate one-step solutions efficiently. Experimental evaluation performed on a realistic simulator shows that our method can quickly obtain clear views of the target, even when occlusions are persistent and significant camera motion is required.",

        "abstract": "The use of rescue robots in disaster response has become increasingly common, but few of them can operate on harsh amphibious terrain, especially on soft terrain. To access such challenging environments, we have proposed a novel eccentric paddle mechanism (ePaddle) which exhibits high environmental adaptability and can achieve six major types of gait, such as wheel-like rolling, two legged walking gaits, wheel-paddle-integrated rolling, and aquatic paddling gaits. In this paper, we present the details of the paddle trajectory generation method for ePaddle to access soft terrain. On such conditions, the paddle can operate as a lug to generate additional pull and lift forces that improve traction performance and prevent wheel sinkage than using wheel-like rolling. We adopt the passive pressure theory to model the pull and lift forces acting on the paddle; these forces are determined by soil parameters and the inclination angle, sinkage length, and moving direction angle of the paddle. Based on this model, we propose a motion planning strategy to control the inclination angle and protruded length of the paddle to generate required pull and lift forces and weaken any fluctuations in them. Then, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed method by using simulations.",

The key contributions of our work are a series of architectural innovations that address the challenge of robust multithreading even for scenes with large motions and rapidly changing imagery. Our design is extensible for three or more parallel CPU threads. The system uses 3D-2D correspondences for robust pose estimation across all threads, followed by local bundle adjustment in the primary thread. In contrast to prior work, epipolar search operates in parallel in other threads to generate new 3D points at every frame. This significantly boosts robustness and accuracy, since only extensively validated 3D points with long tracks are inserted at keyframes. Fast-moving vehicles also necessitate immediate global bundle adjustment, which is triggered by our novel keyframe design in parallel with pose estimation in a thread-safe architecture. To handle inevitable tracking failures, a recovery method is provided. Scale drift is corrected only occasionally, using a novel mechanism that detects (rather than assumes) local planarity of the road by combining information from triangulated 3D points and the inter-image planar homography. Our system is optimized to output pose within 50 ms in the worst case, while average case operation is over 30 fps. Evaluations are presented on the challenging KITTI dataset for autonomous driving, where we achieve better rotation and translation accuracy than other state-of-the-art systems.",

A model-free and chattering-free second order sliding mode controller is proposed, which enforces an invariant manifold for all time such that the generalized velocity tracks the spatial velocity field. A constructive simple and intuitive method to design this velocity field is built upon a fuzzy aggregation of orthogonal vectors to guide the end-effector subject to a dissipative map. Stability properties in the sense of Lyapunov establish the fast and yet smooth tracking with typical robustness of sliding modes. In this way, the closed-loop system exhibits the mildness of PVFC but it evades the subtle complexities of the original approach PVFC. A simulation study is discussed, and experimental results highlight the characteristics of the proposed approach.",

Given the addition or removal of edges from the game graph describing a problem (essentially transition rules in a GR(1) specification), we apply a \u03bc-calculus formula to a neighborhood of states to obtain a \u201clocal strategy\u201d that navigates around the invalidated parts of an original synthesized strategy. Our method may thus avoid global resynthesis while recovering correctness with respect to the new specification. We illustrate the results both in simulation and on physical hardware for a planar robot surveillance task.",

        "abstract": "In order to be able to replace a human operator, a robotic manipulation system needs to deal with a variety of possible actions. These actions may be more or less constrained in their motion profile and in the accuracy of the transport goals. The robotic system can make use of some of this variation to simplify the control to improve the efficiency of the generated motion. Nevertheless, the human's intention behind the manipulation may not change. We introduce the Elastic Power Path to optimize paths with respect to efficient control in the context of abstractly represented tasks. Our experiments show, that the proposed Elastic Power Path is an efficient method to achieve this aim. The magnitude and the number of turnarounds of the accelerations along the path are significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "With navigation algorithms reaching a certain maturity in the field of mobile robots, the community now focuses on more advanced tasks like path planning towards increased autonomy. While the goal is to efficiently compute a path to a target destination, the uncertainty in the robot's perception cannot be ignored if a realistic path is to be computed. With most state of the art navigation systems providing the uncertainty in motion estimation, here we propose to exploit this information. This leads to a system that can plan safe avoidance of obstacles, and more importantly, it can actively aid navigation by choosing a path that minimizes the uncertainty in the monitored states. Our proposed approach is applicable to systems requiring certain excitations in order to render all their states observable, such as a MAV with visual-inertial based localization. In this work, we propose an approach which takes into account this necessary motion during path planning: by employing Rapidly exploring Random Belief Trees (RRBT), the proposed approach chooses a path to a goal which allows for best estimation of the robot's states, while inherently avoiding motion in unobservable modes. We discuss our findings within the scenario of vision-based aerial navigation as one of the most challenging navigation problem, requiring sufficient excitation to reach full observability.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Operating micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) outside of the bounds of a rigidly controlled lab environment, specifically one that is unstructured and contains unknown obstacles, poses a number of challenges. One of these challenges is that of quickly determining an optimal (or nearly so) path from the MAVs current position to a designated goal state. Past work in this area using full-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has predominantly been performed in benign environments. However, due to their small size, MAVs are capable of operating in indoor environments which are more cluttered. This requires planners to account for the vehicle heading in addition to its spatial position in order to successfully navigate. In addition, due to the short flight times of MAVs along with the inherent hazards of operating in close proximity to obstacles, we desire the trajectories to be as cost-optimal as possible. Our approach uses an anytime planner based on A* that performs a graph search on a four-dimensional (4-D) (x,y,z, heading) lattice. This allows for the generation of close-to-optimal trajectories based on a set of precomputed motion primitives along with the capability to provide trajectories in real-time allowing for on-the-fly re-planning as new sensor data is received. We also account for arbitrary vehicle shapes, permitting the use of a non-circular footprint during the planning process. By not using the overly conservative circumscribed circle for collision checking, we are capable of successfully finding optimal paths through cluttered environments including those with narrow hallways. Analytically, we show that our planner provides bounds on the sub-optimality of the solution it finds. Experimentally, we show that the planner can operate in real-time in both a simulated and real-world cluttered environments.",

The higher level planner uses modified generalized Voronoi diagrams to guarantee finding a connected path from the start to the goal if a collision-free path exists. The lower level planner considers uncertainty of the observed obstacles in the environment and assigns repulsive forces based on their distance to the robot and their positional uncertainty. The attractive forces from the Voronoi nodes and the repulsive forces from the uncertainty-biased potential fields form a hybrid planner we call Voronoi Uncertainty Fields (VUF). The proposed planner has two strong properties: (1) bias against uncertain obstacles, and (2) completeness. We analytically prove the properties and run simulations to validate our method in a forest-like environment.",

In the robotic area coverage problem, the goal is to explore and map a given target area in a reasonable amount of time. This goal necessitates the use of minimally redundant overlap trajectories for coverage efficiency; however, visual SLAM's navigation estimate will inevitably drift over time in the absence of loop-closures. Therefore, efficient area coverage and good SLAM navigation performance represent competing objectives. To solve this decision-making problem, we introduce perception-driven navigation (PDN), an integrated navigation algorithm that automatically balances between exploration and revisitation using a reward framework. This framework accounts for vehicle localization uncertainty, area coverage performance, and the identification of good candidate regions in the environment for loop-closure. Results are shown for a hybrid simulation using synthetic and real imagery from an autonomous underwater ship hull inspection application.",

These global features do not require any segmentation, matching or tracking steps. The analytical form of the interaction matrix is developed in closed form for these features. Results from experiments carried out with photometric moments have been presented. The results validate our modelling and the control scheme. They perform well for large camera displacements and are endowed with a large convergence domain. From the properties exhibited, photometric moments hold promise as better candidates for IBVS over currently existing geometric and pure luminance features.",

        "abstract": "In developing autonomous solutions for mapping and localization, one problem that often needs to be dealt with is determining when an area is revisited despite having poor or no prior information on the relative alignment error. There are well-formulated approaches for recognizing such matches using the rich information in camera data; however, it is a much more challenging problem using lidar sensors alone. Most existing approaches employ a pairwise place comparison of place descriptors and thus finding matches requires linear time per place. We instead propose the use of a keypoint voting approach to achieve sub-linear matching times. A constant number of nearest neighbor votes per keypoint are queried from a database of local descriptors and aggregated to determine likely place matches. It becomes critical to analyze the distributions of vote scores such that a suitable threshold for matching scores can be determined a priori, so that the system is not overwhelmed by false positives nor starved for true matches. We have empirically determined that the vote scores follow a log-normal distribution, and we are able to fit a parametric model of its hyper-parameters based on the number of neighbors, the number of keypoints in a place, and the total number of keypoints in the database. We demonstrate the performance of our system in a variety of large scale 3D lidar datasets using data collected from a continually scanning handheld lidar sensor, and also on two publicly available lidar datasets.",

        "abstract": "Most visual simultaneous localization and mapping systems use point features as their landmarks and adopt point-based feature descriptors to recognize them. Compared to point landmarks, however, lines have strength in conveying the structural information of the environment. Despite the benefit, they have not been widely used because lines are more difficult in detecting, tracking, and recognizing, and this delayed the use of lines as landmarks. In this paper, we propose a place recognition algorithm using straight line features, which enables reliable loop closure detections in large complex environments under significant illumination changes. A vocabulary tree trained with mean standard-deviation line descriptor is used in finding the candidate matches between keyframes, and a Bayesian filtering framework enables reliable keyframe matching for large-scale loop closures. The proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art point-based methods using scale-invariant feature transform or speeded up robust features. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the others in challenging indoor environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a coverage path planning (CPP) method for inspection of 3D natural structures on the ocean floor charted as 2.5D bathymetric maps. This task is integral to many marine robotics applications, such as microbathymetry mapping and image photo-mosaicing. We consider an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with hovering capabilities imaging the ocean floor with an orientable sensor, such as a camera or a sonar. While standard lawnmower-type surveys at constant altitude are well-suited for covering effectively planar areas, two major problems arise when tracing such paths over high-relief terrain. First, the sudden depth changes required by such paths imply very costly motions, as moving in the vertical axis is expensive for most AUVs. Second, some time is required to adjust the vehicle depth after a sudden change in the relief, resulting in a varying distance from the target surface which deteriorates the overall quality of the collected imaging data. The method proposed in this paper accounts for these facts and generates different coverage patterns according to terrain's relief, resulting in a well-suited coverage path for imaging tasks. The proposed CPP method is fast and easy to implement, and provides a valuable tool for planning coverage paths in marine environments. We tested the proposed method on a real-world bathymetric dataset of a lava tongue obtained during recent sea trials in the Santorini caldera in Greece and compares favorably to a standard lawnmower-type survey path.",

To address model uncertainty systematically, we propose to use Bayesian reinforcement learning and cast it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We present a simple algorithm for offline POMDP planning in the continuous state space. Offline planning produces a POMDP policy, which can be executed efficiently online as a finite-state controller. This approach seamlessly integrates planning and learning: it incorporates learning objectives in the computed plan, which then enables the robot to learn nearly optimally online and reach the goal. We evaluated the approach in simulations on two distinct tasks, acrobot swing-up and autonomous vehicle navigation amidst pedestrians, and obtained interesting preliminary results.",

        "abstract": "On the path to full autonomy, robotic agents have to learn how to manipulate their environments for their benefit. In particular, the ability to design structures that are functional in overcoming challenges is imperative. The problem of automated design of functional structures (ADFS) addresses the question of whether the objects in the environment can be placed in a useful configuration. In this work, we first make the observation that the ADFS problem represents a class of problems in high dimensional, continuous spaces that can be broken down into simpler subproblems with semantically meaningful actions. Next, we propose a framework where discrete actions that induce constraints can partition the solution space effectively. Subsequently, we solve the original class of problems by searching over the available actions, where the evaluation criteria for the search is the feasibility test of the accumulated constraints. We prove that with a sound feasibility test, our algorithm is complete. Additionally, we argue that a convexity requirement on the constraints leads to significant efficiency gains. Finally, we present successful results to the ADFS problem.",

The robot uses a Kalman filter to maintain an estimate of the field value, and to compute the error covariance matrix of the estimate. A new randomized path planning algorithm is proposed to find a periodic trajectory for the sensing robot that tries to minimize the largest eigenvalue of the error covariance matrix over an infinite horizon. The algorithm is proven to find the minimum infinite horizon cost cycle in a graph, which grows by successively adding random points. The algorithm leverages recently developed methods for periodic Riccati recursions to efficiently compute the infinite horizon cost of the cycles, and it uses the monotonicity property of the Riccati recursion to efficiently compare the cost of different cycles without explicitly computing their costs.

The method is based on modifying a standard graph-based navigation approach to keep an additional state variable that encodes topological information about the path. The topological information is represented by a sequence of virtual sensor beam crossings. By considering classes of beam crossing sequences to be equivalent under certain equivalence relations, we obtain a general method for planning with topological constraints that subsumes existing approaches while admitting more favorable representational characteristics. We provide experimental results that validate the approach and show how the planner can be used to find loop paths for autonomous surveillance problems, simultaneously satisfying minimum-cost objectives and in dynamic environments. As an additional application, we demonstrate the use of our planner on the PR2 robot for automated building of 3D object models.",

The approach finds policies with bounded suboptimal expected cost and scales well with the number of people, only disambiguating between the trajectories of people when necessary.

While planners for the NAMO domain exist, they typically assume a deterministic environment or rely on discretization of the configuration and action spaces, preventing their use in practice. In contrast, we propose a planner that operates in real-world conditions such as uncertainty about the parameters of workspace objects and continuous configuration and action (control) spaces. To achieve robust NAMO planning despite these conditions, we introduce a novel integration of Monte Carlo simulation with an abstract MDP construction. We present theoretical and empirical arguments for time complexity linear in the number of obstacles as well as a detailed implementation and examples from a dynamic simulation environment.",

We develop an anytime branch and bound algorithm to efficiently search this transition system, and compute optimal strategies which prescribe task allocation and schedules in response to all possible outcomes of uncontrollable events. Several examples are presented and results from numerical simulation of a vehicle routing problem are discussed.",

The proposed actuator realizes high-speed reciprocating motion by the moving part which has multiple rollers moves smoothly along the flexible hollow shaft. An effective application of this actuator is its use in endoscope robots and tether robots because cables of cameras or sensors can be passed inside the actuator by using the hollow structure. First, we discuss the physical model of the actuator pressurized in the resting state, and we provide an analysis of the generated force of the actuator. The model relates the generated force to the relevant design parameters such as the applied pressure, the material of the pressure chamber, the size of the moving part, etc. Second, we describe the measurement experiment of the generated force, and we show the validity of our model by comparing the experimental results with the analysis results. Third, we present the motion evaluation using a prototype of the actuator. We found that the maximum velocity of the moving parts is 9 m/s and that the moving parts can move smoothly even if the actuator is curved. Finally, we present the drive mechanism that uses the actuator, as an application example.",

We show that it is possible to register 3D data in two different coordinate systems using any combination of three point/plane primitives (3 planes, 2 planes and 1 point, 1 plane and 2 points, and 3 points). Our algorithm uses the minimal set of primitives in a RANSAC framework to robustly compute correspondences and estimate the sensor pose. As the number of planes is significantly smaller than the number of points in typical 3D data, our RANSAC algorithm prefers primitive combinations involving more planes than points. In contrast to existing approaches that mainly use points for registration, our algorithm has the following advantages: (1) it enables faster correspondence search and registration due to the smaller number of plane primitives; (2) it produces plane-based 3D models that are more compact than point-based ones; and (3) being a global registration algorithm, our approach does not suffer from local minima or any initialization problems. Our experiments demonstrate real-time, interactive 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces using a hand-held Kinect sensor.",

It allows for an effective estimation of the dynamics of the generation of dirt and for making predictions about the absolute dirt values. We propose two efficient cleaning policies that are based on the estimated dirt distributions and can easily be adapted to different needs of potential users.

Using an active depth sensor for segmentation of the objects and 2d edge analysis for pose estimation, we are able to provide accurate identification and position. The proposed method is evaluated on a Microsoft Kinect and also on a PR2 robot. Results show that the algorithm is robust and accurate enough for robotic grasping and that it can be used in practical applications like table cleaning.",

Our descriptors are generated using a combination of 2D image data and 3D contextual shape data, resulting in a set of semi-local descriptors containing rich appearance and shape information for both edge and texture structures. This is achieved by defining feature space relations which describe the neighborhood of a descriptor. By quantitative evaluations, we show that our descriptors provide high discriminative power compared to state of the art approaches. In addition, we show how to utilize this for the estimation of the alignment pose between two point sets. We present experiments both in controlled and real-life scenarios to validate our approach.",

This technology turns out to be beneficial in many classes of minimally invasive procedures. However, one of the barriers to the practical use of a concentric-tube robot is the design of a real-time control scheme. In previous work by the authors, a computationally efficient torsionally compliant kinematic model of a concentric-tube robot was developed. Using this computationally fast technique and deriving the robot's Jacobian, a new position control approach is proposed in this paper. This mechanism provides computational efficiency as well as good tracking accuracy. To evaluate the performance, experiments were conducted, and the results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of enabling the robot's tip to perform trajectory tracking in real time.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on optimal and seamless guidance of robotic manipulators, in both pre- and post-grasp phases, to capture and stabilize a tumbling and drifting free-floating object. All dynamics parameters of the object are assumed to be unknown with the exception its mass and the trace of the inertia matrix. In the pre-grasping phase, an optimal trajectory is planned to intercept a grasping point on the target with zero relative velocity subject to acceleration limit and adequate target alignment while minimizing the fly time and/or distance. In the post-grasping phase, the manipulator damps out the targets's angular and linear momentums as quickly as possible subject to the constraint that the magnitude of the exerted force and torque remain below their pre-specified values. The unknown parameters in addition to the relative linear and angular velocities of the target needed for the motion planning are estimated by a Kalman filter estimator. Finally, an end-to-end validation of the robotic operation for grasping and stabilizing a tumbling/drifting free-floating object using the proposed robot motion planning scheme is presented by combination of experimental and simulation results.",

        "abstract": "For maximum maneuverability, terrestrial robots need to be able to turn precisely, quickly, and with a small radius. Previous efforts at turning in legged robots primarily have used leg force or velocity modulation. We developed a palm-sized legged robot, called TAYLRoACH. The tailed robot was able to make rapid, precise turns using only the actuation of a tail appendage. By rapidly rotating the tail as the robot runs forward, the robot was able to make sudden 90\u00b0 turns at 360 \u00b0s\u22121. Unlike other robots, this is done with almost no change in its running speed. We have also modeled the dynamics of this maneuver, to examine how features, such as tail length and mass, affect the robot's turning ability. This approach has produced turns with a radius of 0.4 body lengths at 3.2 body lengths per second running speed. Using gyro feedback and bang-bang control, we achieve an accuracy of \u00b1 5\u00b0 for a 60\u00b0 turn.",

        "abstract": "Precision tracking is important for predicting the behavior of other cars in autonomous driving. We present a novel method to combine laser and camera data to achieve accurate velocity estimates of moving vehicles. We combine sparse laser points with a high-resolution camera image to obtain a dense colored point cloud. We use a color-augmented search algorithm to align the dense color point clouds from successive time frames for a moving vehicle, thereby obtaining a precise estimate of the tracked vehicle's velocity. Using this alignment method, we obtain velocity estimates at a much higher accuracy than previous methods. Through pre-filtering, we are able to achieve near real time results. We also present an online method for real-time use with accuracies close to that of the full method. We present a novel approach to quantitatively evaluate our velocity estimates by tracking a parked car in a local reference frame in which it appears to be moving relative to the ego vehicle. We use this evaluation method to automatically quantitatively evaluate our tracking performance on 466 separate tracked vehicles. Our method obtains a mean absolute velocity error of 0.27 m/s and an RMS error of 0.47 m/s on this test set. We can also qualitatively evaluate our method by building color 3D car models from moving vehicles. We have thus demonstrated that our method can be used for precision car tracking with applications to autonomous driving and behavior modeling.",

        "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is a probabilistic method for predicting human manipulation intention from image sequences of human-object interaction. Predicting intention amounts to inferring the imminent manipulation task when human hand is observed to have stably grasped the object. Inference is performed by means of a probabilistic graphical model that encodes object grasping tasks over the 3D state of the observed scene. The 3D state is extracted from RGB-D image sequences by a novel vision-based, markerless hand-object 3D tracking framework. To deal with the high-dimensional state-space and mixed data types (discrete and continuous) involved in grasping tasks, we introduce a generative vector quantization method using mixture models and self-organizing maps. This yields a compact model for encoding of grasping actions, able of handling uncertain and partial sensory data. Experimentation showed that the model trained on simulated data can provide a potent basis for accurate goal-inference with partial and noisy observations of actual real-world demonstrations. We also show a grasp selection process, guided by the inferred human intention, to illustrate the use of the system for goal-directed grasp imitation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In order to act socially compliant with humans, mobile robots need to show several behaviors that require the prediction of people's motion. For example, when a robot avoids a person, it needs to respect the human's personal space [1] and the avoidance behavior needs to be smooth, so that it is understandable to the interaction partner. To achieve this, the robot needs to reason about future paths a person is likely to follow. Because humans adapt their avoidance behavior to the robot's motion, the proposed method performs lifelong learning of the people's behavior while it adapts its own behavior to their motion. The human avoidance behavior is modeled by a discrete, multi-modal, spatio-temporal distribution over the people's future occurrences. This prediction is based on the people's positions and their velocities relatively to the robot and the obstacle situation of the robot's environment. The proposed prediction method is significantly better than a simple linear prediction. Particularly, for tactical decisions, like whether to avoid a moving person on the left or on the right side, this approach is well suited. Furthermore, when the humans get used to a robot, also a long-term change of the human behavior towards the robot can be learned by our approach.",

The sensor is a thin-film type capacitive one with a multiple cell structure capable of measuring normal and shear forces at contacts simultaneously. The structure of the sensor is determined via numerical optimization for maximizing sensitivity and based on the results, a prototype is fabricated by employing the silk-screening method. The characteristics of the sensor are evaluated with a multi-axial sensor calibration set-up and the sensitivities for two directional shear forces and a normal forces are measured to be 10.1, 10.3 and 6.1%, respectively. In this study, the feasibility of the sensor is confirmed as the proof-of-concept. In our future studies, a miniaturized pair of the proposed sensor will be embedded to a surgery grasper for in vitro validation.",

The controller was implemented on a powered prosthesis prototype and evaluated on a healthy subject by means of able-bodied adapters on a treadmill walking at 1.2 m/s (4.3 km/h). The ankle joint kinematics provided by the powered prosthesis were compared to that provided by a passive (dynamic elastic response) prosthesis, and both compared to the typical kinematics of healthy gait. The comparison indicates the powered prosthesis better reproduces the kinematics of healthy gait, relative to the passive prosthesis. The torque, energy transfer, and power provided by the powered prosthesis were additionally compared to that of a typical healthy subject.",

        "abstract": "Doppler navigation is one of the most widely practiced navigation methods for underwater robotic vehicles, yet its accuracy is limited both by sensor calibration and by the accuracy of the vehicle's attitude measurement. This paper reports a method to improve the dynamic attitude estimation for underwater vehicles employing Doppler sonar and low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) attitude and heading reference systems (AHRSs). Our approach employs three-axis velocity measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) to estimate acceleration to provide corrections to the AHRS accelerometer signals that improve the dynamic estimates of vehicle roll and pitch. We report an implementation of this approach with a nonlinear complementary filter to estimate the vehicle attitude dynamically. We report the results of an in-water comparative experimental evaluation of the proposed and previously reported attitude estimation methods using low-cost MEMS AHRSs. We also report an experimental evaluation of the effect of the attitude estimation accuracy on the spatial accuracy of three-dimensional Doppler navigation of underwater vehicles.",

An empirical model for traction force as a function of slip ratio, robot speed and robot weight for micro-patterned PDMS on synthetic tissue is developed using data collected from the ATM platform. The model is then used to predict traction force at different speeds and weights, and is verified experimentally. The mean percent error between the empirical model and the data used to develop the model is 2.1% (min 0.051%, max 6.5%). The mean error between the traction force predicted by the model and the data used to verify the prediction is 5.9% (min 0.0035%, max 21%).

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the modeling and experimental identification of six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) coupled nonlinear second order plant models for low-speed, fully-actuated, and neutrally buoyant open-frame underwater vehicles. We report a comparative experimental evaluation of six different candidate plant models whose unknown plant parameters are estimated from data obtained in free-motion vehicle trials. We report an experimental evaluation of the performance of each of the six different 6-DOF coupled non-linear finite-dimensional plant models for underwater vehicles estimated by total least squares (TLS) by comparing the mean absolute error between the experimentally observed vehicle velocities and the velocities obtained by a numerical simulation of the experimentally identified plant models. We also report a cross-validation which evaluates the ability of a plant model to accurately reproduce observed plant velocities for experimental trials differing from the trial from which the plant model parameters were estimated. We conclude that plant models including fully parametrized coupled quadratic drag terms perform best overall in cross-validation. This study has the following contributions: It is the first reported experimental 6-DOF fully-coupled plant model identification and cross-validation of low-speed, fully-actuated, and neutrally buoyant underwater vehicles; it is the first experimental 6-DOF plant model identification for this class of underwater vehicles during free-flight experiments; and it is the first reported use of TLS to perform 6-DOF experimental plant model identification of an underwater vehicle.",

        "abstract": "In high-tech plants, the manufacturing stability and product quality are monitored through periodic sampling. As for those non-sampled workpieces, their quality is commonly monitored by a fault detection and classification (FDC) method. Nevertheless, it may fail to detect out-of-control (OOC) products if their corresponding manufacturing process parameters are all in-spec. In other words, unless those certain defected workpieces are selected for sampling measurements, they may not be detected through simply monitoring all the individual manufacturing process parameters. We have proposed a product quality fault detection scheme (FDS), which utilizes the classification and regression tree (CART) to build a single failure model (FML) for identifying the relationship between process parameters and OOC products. However, all the failure modes (FMs) are contained in the single FML, which makes it difficult to understand the causes of defected products. To remedy this problem, this paper develops an advanced fault detection scheme (AFDS). The AFDS builds the corresponding FM by CART for each individual failure cause and generates a FM manager via support vector machine (SVM) to manage all the FMs. Finally, the dual-phase concept is adopted to run the AFDS for achieving on-line real-time fault detection.",

A fusion of audio data (from the microphone array), odometry information and the laser range scan data (from the robot) was used to precisely localize and map the audio sources in an environment. An audio map is created while the robot is autonomously navigating through the environment by continuously generating audio scans with a steered response power (SRP) algorithm. Using the poses of the robot, rays are cast in the map in all directions given by the SRP. Then each occupied cell in the geometric map hit by a ray is assigned a likelihood of containing a sound source. This likelihood is derived from the SRP at that particular instant. Since the localization of the robot is probabilistic, the uncertainty in the pose of the robot in the geometric map is propagated to the occupied cells hit during the ray casting. This process is repeated while the robot is in motion and the map is updated after every audio scan. The generated sound maps were reused and the changes in the audio environment were updated by the robot as it identifies these changes.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for bin-picking for objects without assuming the precise geometrical model of objects. We consider the case where the shape of objects are not uniform but are similarly approximated by cylinders. By using the point cloud of a single object, we extract the probabilistic properties with respect to the difference between an object and a cylinder and consider applying the probabilistic properties to the pick-and-place motion planner of an object stacked on a table. By using the probabilistic properties, we can also realize the contact state where a finger maintain contact with the target object while avoiding contact with other objects. We further consider approximating the region occupied by fingers by a rectangular parallelepiped. The pick-and-place motion is planned by using a set of regions in combination with the probabilistic properties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by some numerical examples and experimental result.",

        "abstract": "Navigating an electrical wheelchair can be very challenging due to its large size and limited maneuverability. Additionally, target users often suffer from cognitive or physical disabilities, which interfere with safe navigation. Therefore, a robotic wheelchair that helps to drive can prove invaluable. Such a wheelchair shares the control with its human operator. Typically, robots excel in fine-motion control whereas users want to remain in charge. Hence, the robot should focus its help locally and let the user decide about global behavior. Further, an effective robot should understand the navigation plans of its user. It needs to consider the user's abilities to avoid frustrating the user with wrong assistance. In order to address these requirements, we propose a probabilistic framework to recognize local navigation plans in a user-specific way. The framework infers navigation plans online and provides a method to calibrate all model parameters from real driving data. It fuses past local information with a user-specific model to reason about how and where the user intends to navigate. We illustrate the validity of our approach by recognizing the local navigation plans of a spastic user driving in a daily environment.",

However, none is yet able to classify across all types of objects and the field of object recognition is thus still an open challenge. We propose an approach for object recognition and pose estimation that combines existing algorithms. Probabilistic methods are used to fuse the classification and pose estimation results, considering the error introduced by the measurements, actuators (sensor on manipulator) and algorithms. Since integration is one of the real challenges from the laboratory towards the real world, we demonstrate the approach in two fully integrated scenarios. We run the experiments on two platforms and focus on the distinction of few but similar objects.",

The proposed algorithm compounds swath profiles of the seafloor with dead reckoning localization to build surface patches. Then, a probabilistic implementation of the ICP is used to deal with the uncertainty of the robot pose as well as the measured points in a two-stage process including point-to-point and point-to-plane metrics. A novel surface adaptation using octrees is proposed to have ICP-derived methods working in feature-poor or highly unstructured areas typical of bathymetric scenarios. Moreover, a heuristic based on the uncertainties of the surface points is used to improve the basic algorithm, decreasing the ICP complexity to O(n). The performance of the method is demonstrated with real data from a bathymetric survey.",

        "abstract": "In the context of mobile robot path planning, a common strategy is to assume that the world is static and rely on heuristic approaches and obstacle avoidance to deal with the changes in the environment. When planning, not taking the potential changes of the environment into account usually leads to poor performances. In this paper we propose a probabilistic model that explicitly characterizes the traversability of the environment as a stochastic process. Furthermore, we present a path planning approach that exploits this traversability information to compute paths that minimize the expected travel time of the robot. Experimental results show that by explicitly modeling and reasoning about changes in the environment path planning performance can be improved.",

Second, we focus on the schedule of casts on the continuous casting machine that is subject to different types of setup operations. With the objective of minimizing the maximum completion time, the schedule of the continuous casting machine is modeled by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation. An example enlightens how a proper scheduling of the casts is of basic importance to obtain good system performances.",

With whole arm grasping, it is adaptive to objects of different sizes and shapes. Previously, we introduced a method for automatically computing grasping configurations of a continuum manipulator with three constant-curvature sections was introduced based on minimum bounding circles of object cross-sections. However, using minimum bounding circles (or circumcircles if they exist) alone may not result in tight and stable grasps. In this paper, we introduce an approach for progressively generating tight grasping configurations section by section to achieve a tight and force-closure whole arm grasp. This approach directly applies to n-section continuum manipulators and generates a force-closure grasping configuration efficiently without requiring minimum bounding circles of a target object.",

        "abstract": "Formal methods have recently been successfully applied to construct verifiable high-level robot control. Most approaches use a discrete abstraction of the underlying continuous domain, and make simplifying assumptions about the physical execution of actions given a discrete implementation. Relaxing these assumptions unearths a number of challenges in the continuous implementation of automatically-synthesized hybrid controllers. This paper describes a controller-synthesis framework that ensures correct continuous behaviors by explicitly modeling the activation and completion of continuous low-level controllers. The synthesized controllers exhibit desired properties like immediate reactiveness to sensor events and guaranteed safety of physical executions. The approach extends to any number of robot actions with arbitrary relative timings.",

        "abstract": "Formal methods based on the Markov decision process formalism, such as probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL), can be used to analyse and synthesise control policies that maximise the probability of mission success. In this paper, we consider a different objective. We wish to minimise time-to-completion while satisfying a given probabilistic threshold of success. This important problem naturally arises in motion planning for outdoor robots, where high quality mobility prediction methods are available but stochastic path planning typically relies on an arbitrary weighted cost function that attempts to balance the opposing goals of finding safe paths (minimising risk) while making progress towards the goal (maximising reward). We propose novel algorithms for model checking and policy synthesis in PCTL that (1) provide a quantitative measure of safety and completion time for a given policy, and (2) synthesise policies that minimise completion time with respect to a given safety threshold. We provide simulation results in a stochastic outdoor navigation domain that illustrate policies with varying levels of risk.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The CyberGrasp\u2122 is a well known dataglove-exoskeleton device combination that allows to render haptic feedback to the human fingers. Its design, however, restricts its usability for teleoperation through a limited control bandwidth and position sensor resolution. Therefore the system is restricted to low achievable contact stiffness and feedback gain magnitudes in haptic rendering. Moreover, the system prohibits simple adaption of its controller implementation. In this paper, the ExHand Box is presented, a newly designed back-end to widen the CyberGraspTM's bandwidth restrictions and to open it up for fully customized controller implementations. The ExHand Box provides a new computer, interface electronics and motor controllers for the otherwise unmodified CyberGloveand CyberGraspTM hand systems. The loop frequency of the new system can be freely varied up to 2 kHz and custom controllers can be implemented through an automatic code generation interface. System performance identification experiments are presented that demonstrate improved behavior in hard contact situations over a range of sampling periods. Maximum contact stiffnesses of up to 50kN/m in a stable condition are demonstrated, which is significantly higher than what could be achieved with the non-customized original system version. Moreover, a bilateral control experiment is conducted to demonstrate the new system's usability for generic teleoperation research. In this experiment a raycasting algorithm is introduced for pre-contact detection in order to compensate for high delay and jitter communication links between master and slave as they appear in an Ethernet network. It is demonstrated that the contact stiffness can be maintained in the order of magnitude of the system performance identification with a demonstrated stiffness of 41kN/m in a stable condition.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of time optimal path planning for a quadrotor helicopter evolving in a region of known winds. Usually, the flight control of quadrotors subject to wind disturbances challenge seeks to find the optimal control to keep track of a desired trajectory in a windy region. This approach has one major disadvantage: the quadrotor flight control has to compensate for trajectory deviations; therefore, the energy consumption becomes an issue. Most unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) navigation techniques use waypoints to accomplish their missions. In the framework of a waypoint based navigation, a promising path planning strategy would be a time optimal approach in which the UAV would take advantage of wind to reach its next waypoint; therefore, saving time and energy (under constant forward velocity constraint). A model separation is used to simplify the control of the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) dynamics of the quadrotor. Such approach allows to deal with quadrotor's 3D-motion through two subsystems: dynamic (altitude and MAV-relative forward velocity) and kinematic (nonholonomic navigation) subsystems. In terms of control, a hierarchical control scheme is used to stabilize dynamic and kinematic underactuated subsystems involved in the navigation task. The time optimal path planning is computed using a dynamic optimization method for continuous systems with some state variables specified at an unspecified terminal time. Results have been validated in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Different models are used in literature to approximate the complex dynamics of a humanoid robot. Many models use strongly varying model assumptions that neglect the influence of feet, discontinuous ground impact, internal dynamics and coupling between the 3D coronal and sagittal plane dynamics. Often motivation is lacking why a certain model should be chosen or why certain dynamical aspects may or may not be neglected. A simple model like a linear inverted pendulum with low computational cost is frequently used on-line in foot placement algorithms, where model inaccuracy may lead to low control performance. A full 3D multi-body model with higher computational cost is typically used off-line in a simulator, where model inaccuracy may lead to unreliable results. This paper contributes experimental validation of both types of models by comparing them to the real dynamics of the humanoid robot TUlip during balance recovery side-stepping. Hereto, we evaluate the aforementioned most common model assumptions. The validated multi-body model that we implemented in the ROS Gazebo simulator is released on-line.",

A series of metrics are introduced to quantify anthropomorphism and assess robot's ability to mimic the human hand. In order to quantify anthropomorphism we choose to compare human and robot hands in two different levels: comparing finger phalanges workspaces and comparing workspaces of the fingers base frames. The final score of anthropomorphism uses a set of weighting factors that can be adjusted according to the specifications of each study, providing always a normalized score between 0 (non-anthropomorphic) and 1 (human-identical). The proposed methodology can be used in order to grade the human-likeness of existing and new robotic hands, as well as to provide specifications for the design of the next generation of anthropomorphic hands. Those hands can be used for human robot interaction applications, humanoids or even prostheses.",

Sustainable revenue generation in such enterprises requires production in large quantities in order to lower the unit cost, and thus improving the marketability. Although this model has been successful and is being followed by most of the industries today, it also limits the scope for new, non-conventional products; especially in the early stages of development where manufacturing risks are higher. One way of reducing this risk can be through improving the reusability of the manufacturing hardware, thus allowing quick and inexpensive transition among different iterations and even different products with the same set of hardware. In this paper, we present such a novel and revolutionary solution for flexible manufacturing. Consisting of a unique set of hardware and software innovations, our proposed system offers a viable way to low volume manufacturing and low risk prototyping of novel product ideas. Called as the \u201cModular and Reconfigurable Manufacturing Cell (MRMC)\u201d, this proposed system enables quick and easy setting up of a fully automated robotic manipulation and assembly platform, optimized for specific products. The system relies on a novel and proprietary multifunctional interconnect design, built-in to various hardware modules of the system, and a distributed intelligence based self-locating software architecture to achieve almost any possible assembler configuration that is suitable for a specific set of tasks. Necessary and sufficient precision level is maintained via a novel precision optimized hybrid controller and path planner throughout the automation.

A particle filter together with a sensor model which characterizes the received signal strength (RSS) as well as the tag detection probability is used to create metric submaps for each topological node. The hybrid framework is highly scalable, simplifies path planning and promises precision and robustness. The algorithm requires only odometry and RFID measurements to localize the RFID tags with a relative accuracy of approximately 0.3 meters.

        "abstract": "3-D motion estimation is a fundamental problem that has far-reaching implications in robotics. A scene flow formulation is attractive as it makes no assumptions about scene complexity, object rigidity, or camera motion. RGB-D cameras provide new information useful for computing dense 3-D flow in challenging scenes. In this work we show how to generalize two-frame variational 2-D flow algorithms to 3-D. We show that scene flow can be reliably computed using RGB-D data, overcoming depth noise and outperforming previous results on a variety of scenes. We apply dense 3-D flow to rigid motion segmentation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We introduce ROS Commander (ROSCo), an open source system that enables expert users to construct, share, and deploy robot behaviors for home robots. A user builds a behavior in the form of a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) out of generic, parameterized building blocks, with a real robot in the develop and test loop. Once constructed, users save behaviors in an open format for direct use with robots, or for use as parts of new behaviors. When the system is deployed, a user can show the robot where to apply behaviors relative to fiducial markers (AR Tags), which allows the robot to quickly become operational in a new environment. We show evidence that the underlying state machine representation and current building blocks are capable of spanning a variety of desirable behaviors for home robots, such as opening a refrigerator door with two arms, flipping a light switch, unlocking a door, and handing an object to someone. Our experiments show that sensor-driven behaviors constructed with ROSCo can be executed in realistic home environments with success rates between 80% and 100%. We conclude by describing a test in the home of a person with quadriplegia, in which the person was able to automate parts of his home using previously-built behaviors.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents ROSlink, an open source project that aims at easing the integration of legacy systems with ROS (Robot Operating System). Its design principles provide a set of unique features that make it appealing for the interconnection of ROS with systems where ROS itself cannot be installed. First, ROSlink requires very limited changes to the legacy system. The project is self contained, bringing in no dependencies, which may be difficult to satisfy in a legacy system. Furthermore, with ROSlink any data type already in use in the legacy system can be employed for the communication of topics and service requests and responses. ROSlink allows run-time rerouting of the communication between the legacy system and ROS. Moreover, it empowers the legacy code with the ROS name remapping system, without enforcing any constraint on the command line parameters of legacy programs. Finally, by simply using a set of API that closely follow the ROS programming interface, ROSlink simplifies any successive porting of the code to a real ROS system. In this paper, the main design choices of ROSlink are discussed. A list of practical applications and tests where ROSlink was employed, as well as a short discussion on the project's future directions are then given.",

        "abstract": "Engine malfunctions during helicopter flight poses a large risk to pilot and crew. Without a quick and coordinated reaction, such situations lead to a complete loss of control. An autonomous landing system could react quicker to regain control, however current emergency landing methods only generate dynamically feasible trajectories without considering obstacles. We address the problem of autonomously landing a helicopter while considering a realistic context: multiple potential landing zones, geographical terrain, sensor limitations and pilot contextual knowledge. We designed a planning system to generate alternate routes (AR) that respect these factors till touchdown exploiting the human-in-loop to make a choice. This paper presents an algorithm, RRT*-AR, building upon the optimal sampling-based algorithm RRT* to generate AR in realtime and examines its performance for simulated failures occurring in mountainous terrain, while maintaining optimality guarantees. After over 4500 trials, RRT*-AR outperformed RRT* by providing the human 280% more options 67% faster on average. As a result, it provides a much wider safety margin for unaccounted disturbances, and a more secure environment for a pilot. Using AR, the focus can now shift on delivering safety guarantees and handling uncertainties in these situations.",

        "abstract": "The avoidance of train collisions is vital for human safety in railway transportation. Technical approaches are general train control or collision avoidance systems as well as semi-automated or fully autonomous trains. These systems rely on robust and exact train localization as well as an accurate map of the track network.We present Simultaneous Localization and Mapping relying exclusively on train-side sensors. RailSLAM, implemented as a probabilistic filter, uses measurements from multiple sensors and computes a track map. We rely heavily on sensors that are not affected by the harsh environmental conditions often experienced in this application, in particular a low-cost MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Rail vehicle localization methods based on these sensors require a dedicated map with detailed geometric track features in combination with the topological track connections. If this feature map does not exist apriori, it needs to be created. If it does, it may suffer from incompleteness, insufficient accuracy or outdated information. RailSLAM addresses the creation and maintenance of this special track map by a simultaneous estimation of the probabilistic geometric-topological feature-rich track map and the train state. A first proof of concept implementation of mapping is given based on the use of an Extended Kalman Filter with measurements from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and an IMU.",

The gains of these controllers are tuned to particular platforms, which makes transferring controllers from one UAV to other time-intensive. This paper formulates the problem of control-transfer from a source system to a transfer system and proposes a solution that leverages well-studied techniques in adaptive control. It is shown that concurrent learning adaptive controllers improve the trajectory tracking performance of a quadrotor with the baseline linear controller directly imported from another quadrotor whose inertial characteristics and throttle mapping are very different. Extensive flight-testing, using indoor quadrotor platforms operated in MIT's RAVEN environment, is used to validate the method.",

The first one is based on the neutral point condition and it prioritizes stabilization in one step. The second one is based on an optimal formulation which can include future steps in the cost function.

This paper addresses continuous and real-time hand gesture spotting, i.e., gesture segmentation plus gesture recognition. Gesture patterns are recognized by using artificial neural networks (ANNs) specifically adapted to the process of controlling an industrial robot. Since in continuous gesture recognition the communicative gestures appear intermittently with the non-communicative, we are proposing a new architecture with two ANNs in series to recognize both kinds of gesture. A data glove is used as interface technology. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed solution presents high recognition rates (over 99% for a library of ten gestures and over 96% for a library of thirty gestures), low training and learning time and a good capacity to generalize from particular situations.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) guided biopsy is a medical procedure routinely performed in clinical practice. This task could be performed by robotic systems to improve the precision in the execution and then the safety for the patient. Both robotic and human procedures could greatly benefit from real-time localization of the needle in US images. This information could guide the robot or the specialists to the correct target point avoiding critical structures. Unfortunately US data provide very low quality images of the needle making this task quite complex, even more if you want to perform the localization on-line during the image acquisition. In this work we present a needle localization method able to extract the needle orientation and the tip position in real time from B-mode US images. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a precise way we use an optical tracking system to measure the position and the orientation of the needle and the US probe. In such a way the comparison is not human dependent (i.e. there are no radiologists manually selecting the needle tip) and fully repeatable. The results show an improvement in term of localization accuracy compared to previous works in literature.",

        "abstract": "Most prior techniques for proximity computations are designed for synthetic models and assume exact geometric representations. However, real robots construct representations of the environment using their sensors, and the generated representations are more cluttered and less precise than synthetic models. Furthermore, this sensor data is updated at high frequency. In this paper, we present new collision- and distance-query algorithms, which can efficiently handle large amounts of point cloud sensor data received at real-time rates. We present two novel techniques to accelerate the computation of broad-phase data structures: 1) we present a progressive technique that incrementally computes a high-quality dynamic AABB tree for fast culling, and 2) we directly use an octree representation of the point cloud data as a proximity data structure. We assign a probability value to each leaf node of the tree, and the algorithm computes the nodes corresponding to high collision probability. In practice, our new approaches can be an order of magnitude faster than previous methods. We demonstrate the performance of the new methods on both synthetic data and on sensor data collected using a Kinect\u2122 for motion planning for a mobile manipulator robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "All existing methods for vision-aided inertial navigation assume a camera with a global shutter, in which all the pixels in an image are captured simultaneously. However, the vast majority of consumer-grade cameras use rolling-shutter sensors, which capture each row of pixels at a slightly different time instant. The effects of the rolling shutter distortion when a camera is in motion can be very significant, and are not modelled by existing visual-inertial motion-tracking methods. In this paper we describe the first, to the best of our knowledge, method for vision-aided inertial navigation using rolling-shutter cameras. Specifically, we present an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based method for visual-inertial odometry, which fuses the IMU measurements with observations of visual feature tracks provided by the camera. The key contribution of this work is a computationally tractable approach for taking into account the rolling-shutter effect, incurring only minimal approximations. The experimental results from the application of the method show that it is able to track, in real time, the position of a mobile phone moving in an unknown environment with an error accumulation of approximately 0.8% of the distance travelled, over hundreds of meters.",

The system tracks the needle using online image processing. We first propose a new algorithm capable of robustly detecting a needle from the moment it is inserted, without any a priori information on the insertion direction. By combining the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm with Kalman filtering in closed loop, we achieve robust real-time tracking of the needle. In addition, we propose a control scheme to automatically guide the ultrasonic probe in order to keep the needle within the field of view, while aligning its axis with the ultrasound beam. This method will ease the insertion of the needle by the operator, and allow the development of autonomous needle insertion by medical robots.",

Because vitreoretinal surgeons manipulate retinal structures on the back of the eye through ports in the sclera, voluntary and involuntary tool motion rotates the eye in the socket and causes movement to the microscope view of the retina. The dynamic nature of the surgical workspace during intraocular surgery makes mapping, tracking, and localizing vasculature in real time a challenge. We present an approach that both maps and localizes retinal vessels by temporally fusing and registering individual-frame vessel detections. On video of porcine and human retina, we demonstrate real-time performance, rapid convergence, and robustness to variable illumination and tool occlusion.",

        "abstract": "Needle insertion is one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive procedures. Visualization of the needle during insertion is key for either successful diagnosis or therapy. This work presents the real-time three-dimensional tracking of flexible needles during insertion into a soft-tissue simulant using a two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound transducer. The transducer is placed perpendicular to the needle tip to measure its position. During insertion the transducer is robotically repositioned to track the needle tip. Positioning of the transducer is accomplished by a compensator, that uses the needle insertion velocity corrected by needle tip velocities to determine out-of-plane motion. Experiments are performed to validate the needle tip pose during tracking. The maximum mean errors in needle tip position along the x-, y- and z-axes are 0.64 mm, 0.25 mm and 0.27 mm, respectively. The error in tip orientations (\u03b8-about the y-axis and \u03c6-about the z-axis) are 2.68\u00b0 and 2.83\u00b0, respectively. This study demonstrates the ability to compute the needle tip pose using a 2D ultrasound transducer. The tip pose can be used to robotically steer needles, and thereby improve accuracy of medical procedures.",

Within the European FP7 project \u201cCompanionAble\u201d (2008-2012) [1], we developed assistive technologies combining a mobile robot and smart environment with the aim to support these people and assist them living in their familiar home environment. For a final evaluation, user experience studies were conducted with volunteer users who were invited to a test home where they lived and freely used the robot and integrated system over a period of two days. Services provided by the companion robot include reminders of appointments (pre-defined or added by the users themselves or their informal carer) as well as frequent recommendations to specific activities, which were listed e.g. by their family carers. Furthermore, video contact with relatives and friends, a cognitive stimulation game designed especially to counter the progress of cognitive impairments, and the possibility to store personal items with the robot are offered. Recognition of the user entering or leaving the home is triggering situation specific reminders like agenda items due during the (expected) absence, missed calls or items not to be forgotten. Continuing our previous work published in [2], this paper presents detailed description of the implemented assistive functions and results of user studies conducted during April and May 2012 in the smart house of the Dutch project partner Smart Homes in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a formal approach to reciprocal collision avoidance for multiple mobile robots sharing a common 2-D or 3-D workspace whose dynamics are subject to linear differential constraints. Our approach defines a protocol for robots to select their control input independently (i.e. without coordination with other robots) while guaranteeing collision-free motion for all robots, assuming the robots can perfectly observe each other's state. To this end, we extend the concept of LQR-Obstacles (which is a generalization of Velocity Obstacles to robots with dynamics for collision avoidance among static obstacles) for reciprocal collision avoidance among multiple robots. We implemented and tested our approach in 3-D simulation environments for reciprocal collision avoidance of quadrotor helicopters, which have complex dynamics in 16-D state spaces. Our results show that our approach enables collision avoidance among over a hundred quadrotors in tight workspaces at real-time computation rates.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a symbolic and recursive calculation of the dynamic model of flexible parallel robots. In order to reduce the computational time, it is necessary to minimize the number of operators in the symbolic expression of the model. Some algorithms have been proposed for the rigid case, for parallel robots with lumped springs or for serial robots with distributed flexibilities, but to the best of our knowledge, nothing has been developed for parallel robots with distributed flexibilities. This paper aims at filling this gap. In order to minimize the number of operations, the Newton- Euler principle is used and combined with the principle of virtual powers. The Jacobian matrices defining the kinematic constraints are computed using recursive calculations that decrease the number of operators. The proposed algorithm is used to compute the elastodynamic model of a planar parallel robot. The obtained results, compared with those obtained with commercial softwares, show the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a cycling wheelchair that assists the movement of patients with impairment of lower extremities. The wheelchair is a pedal-driven system, similar to a bicycle, moved by the pedaling force of the patient's legs. Although the lower extremities of patients are impaired, they can use both legs to smoothly rotate the pedal. However, there are several barriers to use the cycling wheelchair in an outdoor environment such as steep slopes, steps, and obstacles. In this study, we develop a cycling wheelchair controlled by a regenerative brake system. The braking control provides several assistive functions including velocity control, gravity compensation, and step/obstacle avoidance. The regenerative brake system can also charge a battery during the braking control. However, in situations such as steep-slope climbing and emergency stopping, the regenerative brake cannot generate the required force/moment and an active control is required. In these situations, the control mode is altered from braking to active, and the assistive functions are invoked using the energy charged by the braking control. For safety reasons, we propose a passive motion control method of the cycling wheelchair, even if the wheelchair operates under active control. The proposed cycling wheelchair is validated in a series of experiments in this study.",

The salient feature of our proposal is a neuro-fuzzy schemes used to a single gain that multiplies the regressor-free PID structure.

        "abstract": "Real-world robots commonly have to act in complex, poorly understood environments where the true world dynamics are unknown. To compensate for the unknown world dynamics, we often provide a class of models to a learner so it may select a model, typically using a minimum prediction error metric over a set of training data. Often in real-world domains the model class is unable to capture the true dynamics, due to either limited domain knowledge or a desire to use a small model. In these cases we call the model class misspecified, and an unfortunate consequence of misspecification is that even with unlimited data and computation there is no guarantee the model with minimum prediction error leads to the best performing policy. In this work, our approach improves upon the standard maximum likelihood model selection metric by explicitly selecting the model which achieves the highest expected reward, rather than the most likely model. We present an algorithm for which the highest performing model from the model class is guaranteed to be found given unlimited data and computation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithm is often superior to the maximum likelihood learner in a batch learning setting for two common RL benchmark problems and a third real-world system, the hydrodynamic cart-pole, a domain whose complex dynamics cannot be known exactly.",

Considering the natural supervisory role of the UAV and the challenging (but realistic) assumption that the UAV-to-UGV measurements do not include the identities of the UGVs, we have adopted the PHD filter as a multi-target tracking technique. However, the standard version of this filter does not take into account odometric information coming from the targets, nor does it solve the problem of estimating their identities. Hence, we design ID-PHD, a modification of the PHD filter that is able to reconstruct the identities of the targets by incorporating odometric data. The proposed localization method has been successfully validated through experiments. Some preliminary results of a localization-based control scheme for the multi-robot system are also presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents new formulations in task-prioritization for dual-arms with multiple, conflicting tasks and experimental validations. An essential part of the proposed method is the use of relative Jacobian that treats the dual-arm as an equivalent single arm. As a result, three formulations are derived. The first formulation, called relative task prioritization, expresses a task prioritization at the acceleration level for a dual-arm, with multiple tasks, that is controlled as a single manipulator. The second formulation is an impedance control equation that allows direct control of the relative motion and impedance between two end-effectors. Our third formulation is a control law that combines relative task prioritization, impedance control, and time-delay estimation, which contributes to the ease of implementation of our proposed method. In the physical implementation, one arm draws a circle on a plate attached to the other arm in parallel with three subtasks. Then, intentional conflict among subtasks is induced. The experimental results show that when such conflict occurs, the higher priority task is guaranteed an immediate execution without influence from the lower priority task.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a remotely operated brachytherapy system for oral cancer. The purpose of the system is to reduce exposure dose to the operator by keeping him or her at a distance of 1m from radioactive 198Au sources. The system is designed to enable the operator to perform the same procedure as for conventional brachytherapy treatment without exposure dose. It consists of an applicator manipulator to implant 198Au seeds, a finger device to firmly grasp organs in the mouth, operational parts for both of them, and a base arm. The applicator manipulator and finger device are fixed on the base arm which is fixed on a radiation shield. The applicator manipulator is a serial manipulator with five degrees of freedom (DOF). The finger device is necessary because organs in the mouth are soft and flexible. Its finger and operational parts are identical three DOF parallel manipulators. This paper details preliminary experiments of grasping and insertion with the system. These experiments verify that an operator can grasp a tongue model with the finger device and can insert the applicator into it with the applicator manipulator. In our developed system, we also confirm that rotation of the applicator needle can reduce insertion force.",

        "abstract": "We propose to overcome a significant limitation of the KinectFusion algorithm, namely, its sole reliance upon geometric information to estimate camera pose. Our approach uses both geometric and color information in a direct manner that uses all the data in order to perform the association of data between two RGBD point clouds. Data association is performed by aligning the two color images associated with the two point clouds by estimating a projective warp using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. This projective warp is then used to create a correspondence map between the two point clouds, which is then used as the data association for a point-to-plane error minimization. This approach to correspondence allows camera tracking to be maintained through areas of low geometric features. We show that our proposed LKDA data association technique enables accurate scene reconstruction in environments in which low geometric texture causes the existing approach to fail, while at the same time demonstrating that the new technique does not adversely affect results in environments in which the existing technique succeeds.",

We claim that the usual state-of-the-art haptic interface, based on research motivated by robotic manipulator slaves and virtual haptic environments, does a poor job of reflecting dynamic forces of a mobile robotic vehicle to the user. This leads us to propose a novel force feedback user interface for mobile robotic vehicles with dynamics. An analysis of the closed-loop force-displacement transfer functions experienced by the master joystick for the classical and the new approach clearly indicate the advantages of the proposed formulation. Both the classical and the proposed approach have been implemented in the teleoperation of a quadrotor vehicle and we present quantitative and cognitive performance data from a user study that corroborates the expected performance advantages.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new motion planner, Search Tree with Resolution Independent Density Estimation (STRIDE), designed for rapid exploration and path planning in high-dimensional systems (greater than 10). A Geometric Near-neighbor Access Tree (GNAT) is maintained to estimate the sampling density of the configuration space, allowing an implicit, resolution-independent, Voronoi partitioning to provide sampling density estimates, naturally guiding the planner towards unexplored regions of the configuration space. This planner is capable of rapid exploration in the full dimension of the configuration space and, given that a GNAT requires only a valid distance metric, STRIDE is largely parameter-free. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant dimension-dependent performance improvements over alternative state-of-the-art planners. In particular, high-dimensional systems where the free space is mostly defined by narrow passages were found to yield the greatest performance improvements. Experimental results are shown for both a classical 6-dimensional problem and those for which the dimension incrementally varies from 3 to 27.",

Then real-time information obtained during the runtime is used to update the system model, verify and further revise the motion plan. The implementation and revision of the motion plan are performed in real-time. This framework can be applied to partially-known workspaces and workspaces with large uncertainties.

In this paper we propose a novel control scheme for contact tasks based on risk-sensitive optimal feedback control. It provides a systematic approach to adjust the trade-off between motion and force control under uncertainty. Following a previously acquired task model, the proposed approach provides both a variable stiffness solution and a motion reference adaptation. This control scheme achieves increased adaptability under previously unseen environmental variability. An implementation on a robotic manipulator validates the applicability and adaptability of the proposed control approach in two different manipulation tasks.",

It aims to overcome the limitation of potential field methods due to local minima caused by concave obstacles. The roadmap is incrementally constructed by a two-step procedure. Starting from a minimum, adjacent saddle-points are found using a local saddle-point search method. Then, the new saddle-points are connected to the minima by gradient descent. A numerical continuation algorithm from the computational chemistry literature is used to find saddle-points. It traces the valleys of the potential field, which are gradient extremal paths, defined as the points where the gradient is an eigenvector of the Hessian matrix. The definition of gradient bisectors is also discussed. The presentation conclude simulations in cluttered environments.",

        "abstract": "We consider mobile robot navigation in dense human crowds. In particular, we explore two questions. Can we design a navigation algorithm that encourages humans to cooperate with a robot? Would such cooperation improve navigation performance? We address the first question by developing a probabilistic predictive model of cooperative collision avoidance and goal-oriented behavior by extending the interacting Gaussian processes approach to include multiple goals and stochastic movement duration. We answer the second question with an extensive quantitative study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs completed), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. We find that the \u201cmultiple goal\u201d interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities near 1 person/m2, while a state of the art noncooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than 3 times as often as this multiple goal extension, and more than twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian processes. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used \u201cdynamic window\u201d approach fails for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. Based on these experimental results, and previous theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is important for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.",

When workspace representations, e.g. the reachability of an arm, are considered, additional quality information such as manipulability or self-distance can be employed to enrich the spatial data. In this work we present an approach of inverting such precomputed reachability representations in order to generate suitable robot base positions for grasping. Compared to existing works, our approach is able to generate a distribution in SE(2), the cross-space consisting of 2D position and 1D orientation, that describes potential robot base poses together with a quality index. We show how this distribution can be queried quickly in order to find oriented base poses from which a target grasping pose is reachable without collisions. The approach is evaluated in simulation using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III [1] and an extension is presented that allows to find suitable base poses for trajectory execution.",

This method was shown to be capable of sequential folding, angle-controlled folds, slot-and-tab assembly, and mountain and valley folds.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a robotic solution is proposed to deal with the challenges caused by lung motion during needle insertion. To accomplish this goal, a macro-micro robotic tool is designed to compensate for tissue motion using the macro part, while performing the needle insertion independently with the micro part. The main application of this work is for robotics-assisted lung tumor biopsy, where the combined motions of respiration and heartbeat may compromise success. An impedance-based controller keeps the macro reference coordinate in contact with the moving soft tissue using measurements from small pressure sensors mounted at the tip of the macro shaft. The micro part, mounted at the end of the macro robot, manipulates the needle in the harmonized reference coordinate system. Preoperative identification of ex vivo soft tissue is performed to estimate the dynamic behavior of the tissue. The controller is then synthesized based on the identified model. The effects of identification error and high frequency uncertainty are addressed in the control design. A prototype was built to evaluate the proposed approach using: 1) two Mitsubishi PA-10 robots, one for manipulating the macro part and the other for mimicking tissue motion, 2) one motorized linear stage to handle the micro part, and 3) a Phantom Omni haptic device for remote manipulation.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a soil penetration robotic system inspired by low friction penetration strategies in plant roots. Growth of cells at the root tip deforms soil, while sloughing cells in the cap create an interface between root and soil to reduce root-soil friction during penetration. A simple prototype, inspired by these root features and based on a tubular shaft and a soft continuum skin, was developed. The skin is kept inside the shaft and slips out and slides on its external body. This outward movement of the skin opens the soil in front of the tip and helps the system to penetrate. The skin covering the external body of shaft imitates the role of sloughing cells and provides low-friction interface between soil and shaft. Interaction between the external skin and soil gives to the system self-anchorage capabilities for the penetration. The performances of our robotic system were characterized during penetration in granular soils. The skin-soil interaction was found to be fundamental for 1) displacing the soil in front of the tip and 2) preventing backward movements of the robot by anchoring the posterior body to the soil. In order to exploit these effects some artificial hairs were added along the skin. The increased hair density (0.012 hairs/mm2) resulted in higher penetration depth of robot (about 30%).",

        "abstract": "Minimally Invasive Surgery of the throat is predominantly performed trans-orally. Although trans-oral (TO) access provides a scarless access into the airways, its outcomes are affected by complications, high cost, and long setup time. This paper investigates the clinical motivation for trans-nasal (TN) access to the throat and presents the design and hybrid position/compliant motion control of a rapidly deployable endo-nasal telerobotic system. The system exploits a unique \u22985 mm surgical slave with force sensing capabilities used to enable semi-automating the insertion process. Working channels allow the deployment of surgical tools such as a fiberscope, positioning sensors, grippers, suction tubes, cautery, and laser fibers. The treatment of vocal fold paralysis is chosen as a benchmark application and a feasibility study for collagen injection is conducted. Experiments on a realistic human intubation trainer demonstrated successful and safe TN deployment of the end-effector and the feasibility of robotic-assisted treatment of vocal nerve paralysis. We believe this system constitutes a first step toward low-cost office-based head and neck surgical procedures.",

        "abstract": "There has been a recent interest in utilizing contextual knowledge to improve multi-label visual recognition for intelligent agents like robots. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can give us labels, the correlation of labels, and the ontological knowledge about them, so we can automate the acquisition of contextual knowledge. In this paper we show how to use tools from NLP in conjunction with Vision to improve visual recognition. There are two major approaches: First, different language databases organize words according to various semantic concepts. Using these, we can build special purpose databases that can predict the labels involved given a certain context. Here we build a knowledge base for the purpose of describing common daily activities. Second, statistical language tools can provide the correlations of different labels. We show a way to learn a language model from large corpus data that exploits these correlations and propose a general optimization scheme to integrate the language model into the system. Experiments conducted on three multi-label everyday recognition tasks support the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, with significant gains in recognition accuracies when correlation information is used.",

        "abstract": "Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) techniques are increasingly used to address challenging problems in robotics, especially Multi-Vehicle Motion Planning (MVMP). A particular challenge in using this framework is encoding stochastic phenomena such as communication connectivity in the form of MINLP constraints. The main contribution of this paper is an analytical formulation of communication connectivity constraints using stochastic physical layer communication models. These constraints account for the log-normal channel shadowing in noisy communication environments and specify inter-vehicle connectivity in terms of the outage probability of communication. A method is developed to provably accord robustness to communication failure by specifying an upper bound on the outage probability in terms of the inter-vehicle communication range. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this formulation in the context of a realistic decentralized Multi-Vehicle Path Coordination (MVPC) scenario in which multiple robotic vehicles travel along predetermined fixed paths and are required to maintain communication connectivity during their transit. Conditions that affect the feasibility of the MVPC problem are formalized. Examples that assist in visualizing these conditions are provided.",

Most prior approaches assume a probabilistic model of uncertainty and maximize the expected value of covered area. We assume a worst-case model of uncertainty and-for a particular choice of coverage path-are still able to guarantee complete coverage. We begin by considering the special case in which the region to be covered is a single point. The machinery we develop to express and solve this problem immediately extends to guarantee coverage of a small subset in the workspace. Finally, we use this subset as a sort of virtual coverage implement, achieving complete coverage of the entire workspace by tiling copies of the subset along boustrophedon paths.",

        "abstract": "An autonomous aerial or underwater robot can create photo-maps using a downward looking camera to not only compute its odometry visually but also to provide a useful and intuitively understandable representation of the environment explored by it. The improved Fourier Mellin Invariant (iFMI) registration is a spectral registration method, which has specific benefits, especially high robustness in featureless scenarios, but it only allows registrations of 2D translations, rotation, and scale. The method is extended here to incorporate tilt using parallax information. To this end, we extend the well-known four-point algorithm for planar homography. We show that using the decomposition of the planar homography to compute the tilt is very noise-prone, and propose a way of increasing this accuracy based on a parallax to noise metric. Although our general approach can be used with local scale invariant image features, we implement the tilt-correction based on an extension of our frequency-based approach to determine the image motion-field. Two experiments are presented to show the efficacy and applicability of our approach: An analysis of a simulated data set with ground truth is used to quantify the robustness of our novel method relative to the same four-point method using only SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) features. A second data set is used to present similar results with real-world data.",

        "abstract": "Powered prosthetic hands are becoming increasingly functional through sensory feedback. However, when using electrical stimulation as sensory feedback for electromyographic (EMG) prosthetics, stimulation artifacts may cause EMG data noise. Electrical stimulation and EMG measurements are therefore performed using time-division methods in rehabilitation facilities. Under time-division methods, EMG levels cannot be acquired at the stimulation time. Highly functional prosthetic hands that can estimate grip force, however, use advanced signal processing and require detailed EMG information. EMG measuring cycle expansion may make grip force estimation unstable. We therefore developed a grip force estimation system using muscle stiffness and EMG as the estimation source signals. The estimation system consists of a muscle stiffness sensor, an EMG sensor and an estimation algorithm. We chose a tray holding task for the system evaluation. A weight is dropped on the tray and subjects are expected to control the tray's attitude. Grip force, EMG, and muscle stiffness are measured, and the measured and estimated grip forces are compared. The proposed algorithm estimates grip force with an error of just 18[N], which is 30% smaller than in EMG-only methods.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many online inference problems in robotics and AI are characterized by probability distributions whose factor graph representations are sparse. While there do exist some computationally efficient algorithms (e.g. incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) or Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE)) for performing online incremental maximum likelihood estimation over these models, they generally require that the distribution of interest factors as a product of Gaussians, a rather restrictive assumption. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of performing efficient incremental online estimation over sparse factor graphs in the non-Gaussian case. Our main result is a method that generalizes iSAM and RISE by removing the assumption of Gaussian factors, thereby significantly expanding the class of distributions to which these algorithms can be applied. The generalization is achieved by means of a simple algebraic reduction that under relatively mild conditions (boundedness of each of the factors in the distribution of interest) enables an instance of the general maximum likelihood estimation problem to be reduced to an equivalent instance of least-squares minimization that can be solved efficiently online by application of iSAM or RISE. Through this construction we obtain robust, computationally efficient, and mathematically correct incremental online maximum likelihood estimators for non-Gaussian distributions over sparse factor graphs.",

        "abstract": "Developing the perfect SLAM front-end that produces graphs which are free of outliers is generally impossible due to perceptual aliasing. Therefore, optimization back-ends need to be able to deal with outliers resulting from an imperfect front-end. In this paper, we introduce dynamic covariance scaling, a novel approach for effective optimization of constraint networks under the presence of outliers. The key idea is to use a robust function that generalizes classical gating and dynamically rejects outliers without compromising convergence speed. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our method on publicly available datasets. Compared to recently published state-of-the-art methods, we obtain a substantial speed up without increasing the number of variables in the optimization process. Our method can be easily integrated in almost any SLAM back-end.",

        "abstract": "The goal of our work is to provide a fast and accurate method to estimate the camera motion from RGB-D images. Our approach registers two consecutive RGB-D frames directly upon each other by minimizing the photometric error. We estimate the camera motion using non-linear minimization in combination with a coarse-to-fine scheme. To allow for noise and outliers in the image data, we propose to use a robust error function that reduces the influence of large residuals. Furthermore, our formulation allows for the inclusion of a motion model which can be based on prior knowledge, temporal filtering, or additional sensors like an IMU. Our method is attractive for robots with limited computational resources as it runs in real-time on a single CPU core and has a small, constant memory footprint. In an extensive set of experiments carried out both on a benchmark dataset and synthetic data, we demonstrate that our approach is more accurate and robust than previous methods. We provide our software under an open source license.",

We present empirical evaluation of this system's performance for various system configurations, and demonstrate that it can deliver high quality video at up to 15 Hz, with near-negligible communication latencies of 100 ms. We further characterize the corresponding end-to-end latencies, i.e. from time of image acquisition until time of display, and reveal optimized results of under 200 ms, which facilitates a wide range of applications such as underwater robot tele-operation and interactive remote seabed monitoring.",

To be more precise, we propose two effective control methods which are pre-shaping and object positioning using IR-NSPS for robust grasping by adjusting the gripper configuration in response to attitude error of up to \u00b145 deg and the position error of up to \u00b180 mm of the unknown object. The methods therefore can significantly increase the speed and effectiveness of grasping objects without requiring a specific approach that depends on a vision sensor. Furthermore, to demonstrate the advantages of pre-shaping and object positioning, object grasping experiments were performed using these two operations to grasp objects placed randomly on a tabletop.",

In order to tackle this, we propose a sliding mode controller based on a dynamic model which was obtained using the conformal geometric algebra approach (CGA). The CGA framework permits us to use lines, points, and other geometric entities, to obtain the Lagrange equations of the system. The references for the joints of the robot were bio-inspired in the kinematics of a walking human body. The first and second derivatives of the reference signal were obtained through an exact robust differentiator based on high order sliding modes.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a navigation algorithm that provides a low-latency solution while estimating the full nonlinear navigation state. Our approach uses Sliding-Window Factor Graphs, which extend existing incremental smoothing methods to operate on the subset of measurements and states that exist inside a sliding time window. We split the estimation into a fast short-term smoother, a slower but fully global smoother, and a shared map of 3D landmarks. A novel three-stage visual feature model is presented that takes advantage of both smoothers to optimize the 3D landmark map, while minimizing the computation required for processing tracked features in the short-term smoother. This three-stage model is formulated based on the maturity of the estimation of the 3D location of the underlying landmark in the map. Long-range associations are used as global measurements from matured landmarks in the short-term smoother and loop closure constraints in the long-term smoother. Experimental results demonstrate our approach provides highly-accurate solutions on large-scale real data sets using multiple sensors in GPS-denied settings.",

We newly introduce the convergence speed of the generated gait as a criterion for evaluation. Through mathematical and numerical investigations, we clarify the role and importance of deceleration effect in fast convergent gait generation. First, we generate ballistic gaits of the simplest 1-DOF active walker by applying a simple control torque, and show that the stance phase is destabilized in the case only of acceleration effect. Second, we propose another method for generating a fast convergent gait by adding deceleration effect and investigate the validity through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the cases taking joint viscosity and time delay into account and discuss the effects on the gait properties.",

Enabling robots to understand human route descriptions can simplify HRI situations in household or industrial settings. However, solving this problem requires handling the ambiguity present in route descriptions and the possible unreliability of the semantic perception capabilities of the robot. We address this problem by absorbing these uncertainties in a probability distribution measuring the likelihood of the different interpretations (paths) of a given route description and selecting its MAP solution. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of route descriptions transcribed into a suitable representation using standard information retrieval metrics. These performance measurements indicate that the method can correctly interpret route descriptions even in challenging environments.",

In this paper, we investigate SCARAB, a quadrupedal platform designed to rapidly traverse level, vertical, and inclined surfaces. This study extends previous work in which SCARAB's climbing performance was analyzed to demonstrate its ability to run effectively on level ground. We detail several modifications made to the platform to improve its capacity to both climb and run. This updated platform was used to investigate the influence of leg configuration and leg phasing on running performance and shows that SCARAB is able to run at speeds upward of 40cms-1. Furthermore, analysis of the dynamic characteristics shows similarity between those of the robot and the Lateral Leg Spring model, particularly for configurations that produce the highest running speeds. These results make SCARAB the first platform to effectively demonstrate horizontal plane dynamics quantitatively similar to this model, as well as the first to utilize two distinct dynamical locomotion modalities.",

Our aim is to develop a natural human-robot command interface using pointing gestures for human-robot interaction (HRI). We propose an interface based on the Kinect sensor for selecting by pointing (SEPO) in a 3D real-world situation, where the user points to a target object or location and the interface returns the 3D position coordinates of the target. Through our interface we perform three experiments to study precision and accuracy of human pointing in typical household scenarios: pointing to a \u201cwall\u201d, pointing to a \u201ctable\u201d, and pointing to a \u201cfloor\u201d. Our results prove that the proposed SEPO interface enables users to point and select objects with an average 3D position accuracy of 9:6 cm in household situations.",

This novel robot has a variable leg sprawl angle in the transverse plane to adapt its stiffness, height, and leg-to-surface contact angle. The sprawl angle can be varied from nearly positive 60 degrees to negative 90 degrees, enabling the robot to run in a planar configuration, upright, or inverted (see movie). STAR is fitted with spoke wheel-like legs which provide high electromechanical conversion efficiency and enable the robot to achieve legged performance over rough surfaces and obstacles, using a high sprawl angle, and nearly wheel-like performance over smooth surfaces for small sprawl angles. Our model and experiments show that the contact angle and normal contact forces are substantially reduced when the sprawl angle is low, and the velocity increases over smooth surfaces, with stable running at all velocities up to 5.2m/s and a Froude number of 9.8.",

To prevent accidents, it is important to identify sources of potential harm, to determine which of the persons in the robot's vicinity may be in greatest peril and to assess the type of injuries the robot may cause to this person. This survey starts with a review of the safety issues in industrial settings, where robots manipulate dangerous tools and move with extreme rapidity and force. We then move to covering issues related to the growing numbers of autonomous mobile robots that operate in crowded (human-inhabited) environments. We discuss the potential benefits of fully autonomous cars on safety on roads and for pedestrians. Lastly, we cover safety issues related to assistive robots.",

Most recently, sampling-based algorithms, such as the PRM* and RRT*, that guarantee asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost-sure convergence towards optimal solutions, have been proposed. Despite the experimental success of asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithms, their extensions to handle complex non-holonomic dynamical systems remains largely an open problem. In this paper, with the help of results from differential geometry, we extend the RRT* algorithm to handle a large class of non-holonomic dynamical systems. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in computational experiments involving the Dubins' car dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Reward learning from demonstration is the task of inferring the intents or goals of an agent demonstrating a task. Inverse reinforcement learning methods utilize the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to learn rewards, but typically scale poorly since they rely on the calculation of optimal value functions. Several key modifications are made to a previously developed Bayesian nonparametric inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that avoid calculation of an optimal value function and no longer require discretization of the state or action spaces. Experimental results given demonstrate the ability of the resulting algorithm to scale to larger problems and learn in domains with continuous demonstrations.",

It is found that the key to schedule it is to determine its robots waiting times. A resource-oriented Petri net model is developed for it such that the robot waiting times are well modeled. Based on the model, optimality conditions are derived and the scheduling problem is reduced to the determination of robot waiting times. By the derived conditions, an optimal one-wafer optimal periodic schedule for a multi-cluster tool can be obtained by scheduling its individual cluster tools one by one. Then, a highly efficient algorithm is proposed to compute it for an entire multi-cluster tool.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the design process and the dynamic control simulation of a new type of 4-DOFs parallel mechanism that can be used as an endoscopic surgical manipulator. The proposed mechanism, 2-PUU_2-PUS, is designed based on the parallel virtual chain concept and screw theory. Based on the structure analysis of the 4-DOF parallel mechanism, the inverse position equation is studied using the inverse analysis theory of kinematics. The design and the stress analysis of the mechanism are investigated using SolidWorks software. The virtual prototype of the parallel mechanism is constructed, and the dynamic simulation is performed using ADAMS\u2122 software. The system model utilizing PID and PI controllers has been built using MATLAB software. A more realistic simulation in accordance with a given bending angle and point to point control is implemented by the use of both ADAMS/MATLAB softwares. The simulation results showed that this control method has solved the coordinate control for the 4-DOF parallel manipulator so that each output is feedback to the four driving rods. From the results, the tracking performance is achieved. Other control techniques, such as intelligent ones, are recommended to improve the tracking performance and reduce the numerical truncation error.",

        "abstract": "We developed selective injection of a single particle sensor into a specific cell by optically-regulated cell adhesion and membrane fusion of liposome for intracellular measurement. Fluorescence sensor encapsulated in fusogenic liposome is fabricated by spontaneous transfer method. The liposome is consists of neural lipids and spiropyran (SP). SP is a photochromic chemical and used to control the surface potential of the liposome. The surface potential of the liposome is neutral under VIS illumination. On the other hand, the surface potential becomes positive by UV-induced photoisolation of the SP. Charged liposome adheres to the cell membrane by coulomb's force since the surface potential of the membrane is negative. The estimated coulomb's force is approximately several hundred pN. The particle sensor can contain various fluorescence indicators such as Rhodmaine B as temperature sensor. The sensor is manipulated by optical tweezers and contacted to the cell membrane. We evaluated encapsulation efficiency of the single sensor into the liposome and adhesion efficiency to cell membrane under UV illumination. We demonstrated the optically-controlled adhesion of the sensor to MDCK cell and observed the injected sensor by laser confocal fluorescence method. As results, we succeeded in injection of particle sensor into the cell cytoplasm and nucleus.",

Controllers have been proposed that exploit the null-space of redundant continuum manipulators, however studies of the nature of continuum robot null-spaces have not yet been done. In this paper, we first develop a convenient set of extensible, continuum manipulator forward kinematics and resolved-motion rate inverse kinematics. This allows us to analyze the null-space of 2-section, planar, extensible, redundant continuum manipulators to consider the underlying structure of general continuum robot self-motions and discuss their importance to real-world examples and applications.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of placing bearing sensors so as to estimate the location of a target in a square environment. We consider sensors with unknown but bounded noise: the true location of the target is guaranteed to be in a 2\u03b1-wedge around the measurement, where \u03b1 is the maximum noise. The quality of the placement is given by the area or diameter of the intersection of measurements from all sensors in the worst-case (i.e. regardless of the target's location). We study the bi-criteria optimization problem of placing a small number of sensors while guaranteeing a worst-case bound on the uncertainty. Our main result is a constant-factor approximation: We show that in general when \u03b1 \u2264 \u03a0/4, at most 9n* sensors placed on a triangular grid has diameter and area uncertainty of at most 5.88UD* and 7.76UA* respectively, where n*,UD* and UA* are the number of sensors, diameter and area uncertainty of an optimal algorithm. In obtaining these results, we present some structural properties which may be of independent interest. We also show that in the triangular grid placement, only a constant number of sensors need to be activated to achieve the desired uncertainty, a property that can be used for designing energy/bandwidth efficient sensor selection schemes.",

        "abstract": "Skin stretch is a novel haptic feedback method that can provide a human operator with information about the magnitude and direction of an applied force. To evaluate the potential for skin stretch feedback to be used as a sensory substitute for kinesthetic (force) feedback in robotic teleoperation systems, a study was conducted to measure the ability of users to discriminate environment stiffness using varying levels of fingerpad skin stretch instead of force feedback. A new, high-fidelity skin stretch feedback device was developed that imposes tangential fingerpad skin stretch in proportion to the intended level of force feedback. In psychophysical experiments, users received skin stretch feedback with magnitude proportional to the users' penetration depth into a virtual wall. Users' stiffness discrimination capability using skin stretch was comparable to that of using force feedback. Furthermore, larger skin stretch cues were perceived by users as portraying greater stiffness without any advance training, which indicates that skin stretch feedback would be an intuitive sensory substitute for force feedback. Thus, skin stretch feedback is a promising method for conveying kinesthetic force information in applications such as robot-assisted surgery, where high levels of force feedback may not be desirable due to stability or safety concerns.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel concept in the area of optimal grasp synthesis, confronting both geometric and mechanical constraints. Initializing from a locally optimal force distribution on some predefined feasible contact points, our method improves gradually the grasp quality avoiding simultaneously singularities and mechanical limitations. The proposed scheme implements sequential perturbations on the contact points and the wrist's position/orientation incorporating a post-optimality method in an iterative process to derive the consecutive optimal states. The main novelty of this work lies in the fact that only local information of the object's surface is required, which can be provided for instance by an appropriate tactile sensor suite. Finally, a simulation study on the DLR/HIT Hand II clarifies and verifies the efficiency of the approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Dependence on a team of robots to carry out the exploration missions has many benefits such as speeding up the missions; provided that the coordination among robots is maintained. Many circumstances can limit the communication, which is crucial for the coordination among robots (e.g. impenetrable barriers, high temperature etc.). A periodic rendezvous strategy is considered in this paper as a work around in order to overlap communication ranges of the robots. Attending these periodic rendezvous sessions requires that the robots interrupt their current exploration progress periodically and traverse back to the rendezvous points (i.e. Interruptibility). During their trips to these points, they do not gain new knowledge since they cross already explored parts of the area. Therefore, using rendezvous strategies improves the team behavior but has a negative impact on the time efficiency. The contribution of this paper is to mitigate this negative impact of Interruptibility on explorations while maintaining the coordination among robots. The mitigation algorithm is evaluated on several graphs and its performance is compared with other rendezvous approaches where the results are promising.",

Motion compensation consists of three main tasks; motion synchronization, image stabilization and shared control. The paper discusses a unifying framework under which the three tasks combine seamlessly. In this work, the planar 1-manifold case is considered, where a strip-wise affine map is performed to achieve image stabilization onto a canonical space, where shared control emerges naturally. A prototype teleoperation system is also described, implementing the algorithms. Experiments were performed with medically trained users, and the positive effect of motion compensation is analyzed.",

We approximate the arch structure by a rotational spring and model the human's foot skin with compression springs. The mimesis of the foot arch elasticity is realized by using compression springs. Regarding the characteristics of human's foot skin, first we develop a measuring equipment to measure the human's plantar transverse elasticity. We set the target value of the modulus of transverse elasticity of the foot skin to 11.2 N/mm, and we set the modulus of compression elasticity to 0.136 MPa, referring to a relevant study. The characteristics of human's foot skin are mimicked by using a super-soft urethane resin called Hitohada-gel with 8 mm thick. Through evaluation tests we confirmed that the shoes-wearable foot mechanism could mimic well the characteristics of human's foot arch and skin.",

        "abstract": "The problem of optimal feedback planning under prediction uncertainties among static obstacles is considered. A discrete-time stochastic state transition model is defined over a continuous state space. A relation to a continuous \u201cnearby\u201d deterministic model is proven for small time steps; the cost-to-go function of the stochastic model is approximated with that of the deterministic model, and the approximation error is found to be proportional to the time step. This motivates using numerical methods, which are vastly available for solving deterministic problems, to approximate the original stochastic problem. We demonstrate this application using a Simplicial Label Correcting Algorithm. This algorithms uses a piecewise linear discretization to compute the shortest-path plan on a simplicial complex. Additionally, the theoretical error bound between the approximate solution and the exact solution is derived and confirmed during numerical experiments. This paper provides a rigorous analysis as well as algorithmic and implementation details of the proposed model for the stochastic shortest path problem in continuous spaces with obstacles.",

The focus of the analysis is the problem of object acquisition. In comparison to many prior grasp analysis tools, the tool presented here models the dynamics of a hand, including actuation mechanisms, compliance and friction in an efficient formulation that permits one to evaluate variations in such quantities as phalange length, finger spacing, transmission ratios, and torsional joint stiffness when comparing hand designs. The analysis is demonstrated for a quasi-static object acquisition problem and leads to the computation of a vector space of three dimensional regions for which the hand will tend to center and stably grasp a compact object.",

Shrewbot uses a biomorphic 3-dimensional array of active whiskers and a model of action selection based on tactile sensory attention to explore a circular walled arena sparsely populated with simple geometric shapes. Datasets taken during this exploration have been used to parameterise an approach to localisation and mapping based on probabilistic occupancy grids.

        "abstract": "A novel robotic sensor is proposed to measure both the contact angle and the force acting between the tip of a surgical robot and soft tissue. The sensor is manufactured using a planar lithography process that generates microchannels that are subsequently filled with a conductive liquid. The planar geometry is then molded onto a hemispherical plastic scaffolding in a geometric configuration enabling estimation of the contact angle (angle between robot tip tangent and tissue surface normal) by the rotation of the sensor around its roll axis. Contact force can also be estimated by monitoring the changes in resistance in each microchannel. Bench top experimental results indicate that, on average, the sensor can estimate the angle of contact to within \u00b12\u00b0 and the contact force to within \u00b15.3 g.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In manipulation tasks, skills are usually modeled using the continuous motion trajectories acquired in the task space. The motion trajectories obtained from a human's multiple demonstrations can be broadly divided into four portions, according to the spatial variations between the demonstrations and the time spent in the demonstrations: the portions in which a long/short time is spent, and those in which the spatial variations are large/small. In these four portions, the portions in which a long time is spent and the spatial variation is small (e.g., passing a thread through the eye of a needle) are usually modeled using a small number of parameters, even if such portions represent the movement that is essential for achieving the task. The reason for this is that these portions are slightly changed in the task space as compared with the other portions. In fact, such portions should be densely modeled using more parameters (i.e., overfitting) to improve the performance of the skill because the movements of those portions must be accurately executed to achieve the task. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptively fitting these skills based on the temporal and the spatial entropies calculated by a Gaussian mixture model. We found that it is possible to retrieve accurate motion trajectories as compared with those of well-fitted models, whereas the estimation performance is generally higher than that of an overfitted model. To validate our proposed method, we present the experimental results and evaluations when using a robot arm that performed two tasks.",

We propose a new observer for attitude estimation based on proportional-integral (PI) compensator along with discontinuous switching function in the estimation of velocity to compensate the effect of linear acceleration. The convergence analysis of the proposed observer is studied using Barbalat's lemma based on a Lyapunov like positive definite function to guarantee asymptotic convergence. The performance of the observer is illustrated by simulation results which show the convergence behaviour of the proposed observer.",

        "abstract": "Surgery on a freely beating-heart is extremely difficult as the surgeon must perform the procedure while following the heart's fast motion. However, by controlling a teleoperated robot to continuously follow the heart's motion, the surgeon can operate on a seemingly stationary heart. The heart's motion is calculated from ultrasound images and thus involves a non-negligible delay estimated to be 100 ms that, if not compensated for, can cause the robot end-effector (i.e., the surgical tool) to collide with and puncture the heart. This research proposes the use of a Smith predictor to compensate for this time delay. The results suggest that this improves heart motion tracking as the mean absolute error, the difference between the surgeon's motion and the distance between the heart and surgical tool, and the mean integrated square error decreased.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Highly articulated robot locomotion systems, such as snake robots, present special motion planning challenges. They possess many degrees of freedom, and therefore are modeled by a high dimensional configuration space which must be searched to plan a path. Kinematic and dynamic constraints further complicate the selection of effective controls. Finally, snake robots often have multiple modes of interaction with the terrain as contacts are made and broken, leading to complex and imperfect motion models. We believe that the space of useful controls that provides desirable motions, however, is much smaller. Useful net motions for such systems are often generated via gaits, or cyclic motions in the shape space. Gaits transform a high-dimensional continuum search into a relatively tractable discrete search. In this paper, we put forward a framework which allows a planner to generate paths in a low dimensional work space and select among gaits, pre-planned motions in the robot's shape space. The contribution of this paper rests on the \u201cvirtual chassis\u201d which is a choice of body frame for the snake robot that allows the planner to efficiently select among and plan with gaits to direct the robot along the work space path. We demonstrate this planner running on a simulated snake robot navigating through a variety of clutter scenarios. The virtual chassis also has the benefit of allowing us to generalize notions of controllability to gait motions.",

        "abstract": "Motion sensing has played an important role in the study of human biomechanics as well as the entertainment industry. Although existing technologies, such as optical or inertial based motion capture systems, have relatively high accuracy in detecting body motions, they still have inherent limitations with regards to mobility and wearability. In this paper, we present a soft motion sensing suit for measuring lower extremity joint motion. The sensing suit prototype includes a pair of elastic tights and three hyperelastic strain sensors. The strain sensors are made of silicone elastomer with embedded microchannels filled with conductive liquid. To form a sensing suit, these sensors are attached at the hip, knee, and ankle areas to measure the joint angles in the sagittal plane. The prototype motion sensing suit has significant potential as an autonomous system that can be worn by individuals during many activities outside the laboratory, from running to rock climbing. In this study we characterize the hyperelastic sensors in isolation to determine their mechanical and electrical responses to strain, and then demonstrate the sensing capability of the integrated suit in comparison with a ground truth optical motion capture system. Using simple calibration techniques, we can accurately track joint angles and gait phase. Our efforts result in a calculated trade off: with a maximum error less than 8%, the sensing suit does not track joints as accurately as optical motion capture, but its wearability means that it is not constrained to use only in a lab.",

The sensor is composed of a sheet of elastomer that is embedded with fluidic parallel-plate capacitors. When the elastomer is pressed or sheared, the electrodes of the embedded capacitors come closer together or slide past each other, respectively, leading to a change in capacitance. The magnitude and direction of the shear deformation is established by comparing the change in capacitance of multiple embedded capacitors. We characterize the soft sensor theoretically and experimentally. Experiments indicate that 2D shear and pressure deformation can be discriminated with approximately 500 \u03bcm and 5 kPa sensitivity, respectively. The theoretical predictions and experimental results are in reasonable agreement. We also propose improvements to the fabrication method in order to facilitate integration of soft-matter sensing with wearable electronics.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a soft self-assembling modular matter, which is called SoftCubes where serially connected soft cubes can be extremely stretched by external tension and has a self-recovery capability to an originally designed 3-D shape. The developed soft modular matter has three main design features. First, entire modules of the 3-D assembled shape are serially connected. Such a structure allows all the modules to be disassembled and stretched by external tension. Second, the modules are made of soft stretchable elastomer. The soft-body of the modules provides a high flexibility and an extreme shape adaptation capability with the disassembled modules. Also, if the external tension is removed, the original 3-D shape is self-recovered by the elastic restoring force of soft-bodied modules. Finally, small permanent magnets are embedded in each module. The magnetic attraction between modules makes them self-assembled and precisely aligned with the neighbor modules in a lattice structure. The paper presents various analyses, simulations, and demonstrations about soft modular matter's shape reconfiguration to 1-D and self-recovery to 3-D. The designed soft modular matter could enable new applications as injectable medical implants and implantable modular devices.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental knowledge of the trade-off between sensor cooperation and autonomous vehicles' (AV) trajectory planning is pivotal towards characterizing the sensing capabilities of wireless sensor networks that employ AV for collecting the data and to ensure their successful integration in large scale sensor deployments. We formulate the problem of efficient data gathering as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that provides a joint optimization of AV trajectory and data-routing. Since MILP formulations are not scalable, we propose an approach to develop heuristics where the joint optimization is decoupled into three sub-problems. The first is to determine clusters of sensors with communication range limitations. The second is to efficiently connect the clusters. The third is to design the route inside the cluster that will minimize the cost of data collection. We characterize performance of the proposed heuristics through Monte-Carlo simulations. Performance is measured in terms of (a) the joint energy cost for cooperation and AV movement for different number of sensor nodes and communication ranges of these sensors, and (b) computational effort of the various heuristics. For small deployments, we compare the heuristics to the MILP global optimization and show that the gap between them can be lower than 2% for deployments as large as 18 nodes and typically below 25% for a wide range of scenarios.",

Existing approaches do not exploit the nature of such an environment. We have designed an algorithm which plans rapidly through free space and is efficiently guided around obstacles. In this paper we present SPARTAN (Sparse Tangential Network) as an approach to create a sparsely connected graph across a tangential surface around obstacles. We find that SPARTAN can navigate a vehicle autonomously through an outdoor environment producing plans 172 times faster than the state of the art (RRT*). As a result SPARTAN can reliably deliver safe plans, with low latency, using the limited computational resources of a lightweight aerial vehicle.",

This paper presents an alternative paradigm based on regularly shaped curved patches (paraboloids) that model local contact regions potentially compatible with e.g. a robot's toe, heel, or fingertip. These patches randomly sample the environment surface but are not required to strictly partition it. They are fit to neighborhoods of the range data and then validated for fit quality and fidelity to the actual data-extrapolations (like hole-filling) which are not directly supported by data are avoided. Two different neighborhood formation methods based on k-d tree and triangle mesh data structures are compared, and results are presented for 10 datasets taken in natural rocky terrain.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we defend the superior scalability of the Relative Bundle Adjustment (RBA) framework for tackling with the SLAM problem. Although such a statement was already done with the introduction of the sliding window (SW) solution to RBA [16], we claim that the map extension that can be maintained locally consistent for some fixed computational cost critically depends on the specific pattern in which new keyframes are connected to previous ones. By rethinking from scratch what we call loop closures in relative coordinates we will show the unexploited flexibility of the RBA framework, which allows us a continuum of strategies from pure relative BA to hybrid submapping with local maps. In this work we derive a systematic way of constructing the problem graph which lies close to submapping and which generates graphs that can be solved more efficiently than those built as previously reported in the literature. As a necessary tool we also present an algorithm for incrementally updating all the spanning-trees demanded by any efficient solution to RBA. Under weak assumptions on the map, and implemented on carefully designed data structures, it is demonstrated to run in bounded time, no matter how large the map becomes. We also present experiments with a synthetic dataset of 55K keyframes in a world of 4.3M landmarks. Our C++ implementation has been released as open source.",

        "abstract": "This paper employs the Human-Inspired Control framework in the formal design, optimization and implementation of controllers for 3D bipedal robotic walking. In this framework, controllers drive the robot to a low-dimensional representation, termed the partial hybrid zero dynamics, which is shaped by the parameters of the outputs describing human locomotion data. The main result of this paper is the use of partial hybrid zero dynamics in an optimization problem to compute physical constraints on the robot, without integrating the dynamics of the system, and while simultaneously yielding provably stable walking controllers for a 3D robot model. Controllers corresponding to various walking speeds are obtained through a second speed regulation optimization, and formal methods are presented which provide smooth transitions between walking speeds. These formal results are demonstrated through simulation and utilized to obtain 3D walking experimentally with the NAO robot.",

Although such coverage problems can be addressed by a decomposed approach where sensing locations are determined prior finding the sequence of their visits, the proposed approach is motivated by a solution of the problem in which sensing locations are simultaneously determined together with evaluation of the path connecting them in order to provide a cost effective inspection path. The proposed structure divides the space into elements that support determination of suitable sensing locations to cover the objects during solution of the multi-goal path planning.",

To avoid parasitic effects on the according force/torque sensor, e. g. due to friction in the trocar, a sensor integration as distal as possible is advisable. Since common sensor principles are based on wire or fibre connection and since an axisymmetrical instrument's distal end has to be actuated in at least one additional degree of freedom (DoF) for full dexterity inside the patient, cable (or fibre) break is a serious problem. A constraint guided spine-kinematics without rotatory DoF at its distal end is proposed to reduce the danger of cable (or fibre) break due to a curved flection instead of a sharply bending joint. The properties of a constraint spine-kinematics with one DoF adapted to the special requests of an in-house developed MIRS-system is presented, verification data acquired in a specially developed test bed are shown. The results seem suitable for MIRS applications and for a progress towards a 2 DoF solution with the presented constraint principle.",

More fundamentally, the difficulty lies in a wrench space that changes under deformation, with growing contact areas, and subject to varying slip/stick modes in these areas. This paper presents a grasping strategy by squeezing the object with two fingers. An analysis based on the finite element method (FEM) proves equilibrium and uniqueness of deformation during the action, and leads to a (improved) quadratic time deformation update from the displacements of as few as two contact nodes. An event-driven algorithm is then presented to track the contact regions during a squeeze, and determine the stick/slip mode of every node in contact. The contacts supply the constraints needed for deformation update using FEM. Several experiments with a Barrett Hand have been conducted for validation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The five-link biped is a simple, planar model of human-like walking in which scuffing can be avoided. In this paper, we focus on controller design and stability analysis for the important case of non-steady walking, toward such goals as avoiding obstacles on terrain or meeting specific requirements in speed or energetics. To achieve such tasks as new sensor information about upcoming terrain becomes available, control must be adjusted on-the-fly, preferably using a continuous family of controllers. Here, we present an illustrative case using only two, discrete sets of controllers and investigate the effect of switching between them on a stochastically rough terrain. Of note, we find that the tenth-order system dynamics of unsteady walking can be accurately represented as a Markov process, using only a sparse, quasi-2D mesh of discrete states. This transition matrix approach is then used to determine bounded limits on terrain noise for which guarantees of stability (i.e., never falling) may be given for a particular controller and for arbitrary switching between the controllers, as well as to estimate fall rates for cases where these bounds are exceeded. Our results also allow us to quantify the increase in stability gained by a simple policy of switching based on a noisy, single-step lookahead on terrain. This illustrative example, using two controllers that behave differently and allow for arbitrary switching, provides a framework for future work where tasks or requirements for biped walking are clearly defined and can only be achieved by a wider set of, or ideally a continuous range of, controllers.",

A review of stability condition via describing function analysis is first presented. The results show that while brakes are intrinsically stable, an active device is limited in terms of stiffness. The stability is however improved if the brake simulates a physical damping. Subsequently, the stability condition is obtained via passivity condition analysis. The results demonstrate that the stiffness is improved by engaging both actuators to create resistive forces and the passivity is respected assuming a passive virtual environment. An energy and a stiffness-bounding algorithms have been developed in order to assure the stability of the coupled system in this case. It has been tested and validated using a 1-DOF hybrid haptic device by the simulation of an unstable and an active virtual environments respectively . Experimental results show that the displayable stiffness is improved under stability conditions using the control method. Furthermore, it allows the hybrid system to simulate nonlinear and unstable virtual environments and the controller remains independent of the virtual environment model.",

Most control methods for rehabilitative robotics do not consider the closed-loop system stability in presence of uncertainty of nonlinear dynamics, and conflicting movements between patient and robots. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework which allows rigorous stability analysis of human-robot interaction in rehabilitative robotic system. Position-dependant stiffness and desired trajectory are proposed to resolve the possible conflicts in motions between patient and robot. The proposed method also realizes the assist-as-needed policy and possesses the ability to be customized for operations during different stages of patient recovery. In addition, the proposed controller handles human-robot interactions in such a way that correct movements are encouraged and incorrect ones are suppressed to make the training process more effective. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the controller.",

Especially, the method is popular to fabricate substrates for cell patterning in tissue engineering. However, a manual printing is difficult, because the stamp made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is easily deformed, and a printed pattern is also crushed. This study focused on the stiffness of PDMS stamp and discussed a micro-contact-printing controlled stamping force for a higher quality of pattern than that of manual. Considering in availability in medical or biological laboratory, the measurement method of stamp stiffness was developed by using a general microscope. The proposed stamping method gave a high printing-quality with 2.5% error of stamping area. Stamping setup controlling stamping force was developed, and a protein was patterned on a cell-culture substrate by the setup. By using the protein-patterned substrate, two-cell-patterned co-culture was successfully performed.",

The steerability of such vehicles depends on its posture and interaction between the vehicle and the ground. In previous research, kinematic models with slip information were derived for articulated multi-tracked vehicles. Such kinematic models, however, do not allow for the slippage of the vehicle that occurs when moving at a high speed or on a slippery surface. In this paper, we derive a dynamic model on which the frictional force is acting between the track shoes of each track of the vehicle and the ground for the slippery conditions. The frictional model neglecting static friction is given by a formula for the friction coefficient function proposed in the field of Teramechanics in order to mainly analyze slip behavior. The model is also used to analyze the steering properties, or steerability of the vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Real-time environmental depth perception and ego-motion estimation is essential for all mobile robotic systems. We present a system that computes high quality depth images with 0.5 MPixel resolution using Semi-Global Matching (SGM) and estimates the ego-motion by key frame based visual odometry fused with the data of an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The hardware includes a pair of cameras, a small Intel Core2Duo CPU board, a Spartan 6 FPGA board, an OMAP3530 ARM processor board as well as an IMU. The total weight of the experimental setup is 830 g and is, thus, also feasible for hand-held or flying platforms. Experiments show that the vision system runs at 14.6 Hz with a latency of around 250 ms and produces high quality depth images as well as reliable 6D ego-motion estimates. In the fusion algorithm of visual odometry and IMU data, time delays of the vision system are compensated and a system state estimate is available at the full data rate of the IMU which is important for system control. This paper presents the integration of different techniques into a fast, light weight, real-time system and validates its performance by experiments on real data.",

In this joint, silicone rubber cushions are employed to adjust the joint stiffness by controlling the pressure in the cushions. In this study, we constructed a basic control system to synchronize joint motion and stiffness with those of a human, for potential application in human-assistive robotic technologies. This system consists of a human-motion measurement tool, a system to control joint position, and a pneumatic control system for joint stiffness. Human joint stiffness was estimated by inputting electromyography signals into the mathematical musculoskeletal model proposed by Shin[9]; the result was inputted into the joint stiffness control unit. To synchronize the robot motion and joint stiffness with that of a human, we introduced a compensator into the joint stiffness control loop. This element recovers the delay and insufficient gain of a pneumatic system. Through several experiments, we confirmed that this basic control system satisfactorily follows human dynamic motion, reflecting the change in joint stiffness. In addition, the experimental results showed that the adjustment of joint stiffness is necessary for a robot to achieve human-like dynamic motion.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hierarchical mission planner where the state of the world and of the mission are abstracted into corresponding states of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Transitions in the MDP represent abstract motion actions that are planned by a lower level probabilistic planner. The cost structure of the MDP is multi-dimensional: each state-action pair is annotated with a vector of metrics such as time and resource requirements. A mission specification is divided into three parts: a temporal logic formula defined over state propositions, the choice of the primary cost, and constraints on the remaining secondary costs. The planning problem is formulated as finding the optimal policy of a Constrained Markov Decision Process with above mission specification. The resulting planning system is tested in a mission where an agent is tasked with a complex mission in a urban hostile environment.",

        "abstract": "In the literature, mobile robots featuring both omni-directional and rough-terrain mobility are typically realized by heavy and complicated mechanisms. In considering real outdoor applications, such as hazardous site-inspections or scientific investigations, however, it is desired to develop small and light-weight robots by focusing on the mechanical simplicity and toughness. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and to realize an omni-directional mobile robot on unpaved rough terrain by small, light-weight, simple mechanism. For this purpose, we propose a new concept of wheel structure as well as an omni-directional moving robot. The new wheel, named globular metal spring wheel and composed simply of several super-elasticity-material rods, has not only omni-directional functionality but also properties of light weight, mechanical simplicity and external shock absorbing function. With this globular wheel, a new omni-directional mobile robot, \u201cEggbeater\u201d, is also developed to evaluate the mobility performance. This paper presents our proposal and development of the globular metal spring wheel and the omni-directional rough-terrain mobile robot, and discusses performance evaluation experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new visual SLAM technique that not only integrates 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) pose and dense structure but also simultaneously integrates the colour information contained in the images over time. This involves developing an inverse model for creating a super-resolution map from many low resolution images. Contrary to classic super-resolution techniques, this is achieved here by taking into account full 3D translation and rotation within a dense localisation and mapping framework. This not only allows to take into account the full range of image deformations but also allows to propose a novel criteria for combining the low resolution images together based on the difference in resolution between different images in 6D space. Another originality of the proposed approach with respect to the current state of the art lies in the minimisation of both colour (RGB) and depth (D) errors, whilst competing approaches only minimise geometry. Several results are given showing that this technique runs in real-time (30Hz) and is able to map large scale environments in high-resolution whilst simultaneously improving the accuracy and robustness of the tracking.",

A machine vision algorithm was designed to recognize the hand gestures performed by the user. To ensure safe human-robot collaboration, tool-tip trajectories are planned and executed to avoid collisions with the user. Experiments were conducted to test the system when speech and gesture modalities were used to interact with the robot, separately and together. The average system times were compared while performing a mock surgical task for each modality of interaction. The effects of modality training on task completion time were also studied. It was found that training results in a significant drop of 12.92% in task completion time. Experimental results show that 95.96% of the gestures used to interact with the robot were recognized correctly, and collisions with the user were completely avoided when using a new active obstacle avoidance algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper concerns the reduction of energy use in manufacturing industry. If individual robot movements in a system are preprocessed using Dynamic Programming, one can attain a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) which models the energy consumption of the complete system. This model can then be solved to optimality using mathematical programming. We have previously shown proof of concept for this energy reduction method. In this paper, we apply state of the art MINLP methods to a number of problems in order benchmark their effectiveness. Algorithms used are Nonlinear Programming based Branch and Bound (NLP-BB), Outer Approximation (OA), LP/NLP based Branch and Bound (LP/NLP-BB) and Extended Cutting Plane (ECP). Benchmarks show that the NLP-BB does not perform well for nonlinear scheduling problems. This is due to the weak lower bounds of the integer relaxations. For scheduling problems with nonlinear costs, ECP and in particular LP/NLP-BB are shown to outperform both NLP-BB and OA. The resulting energy optimal schedules for the examples show a significant decrease in energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "The development of new mobile microrobotic swimmers, limited by low Reynolds dynamics and stiction effects in confined environments, should aim for efficient propulsion mechanisms in wet confined environments and more elaborated manipulation strategies. We first introduced a novel type of microrobots called MagPol (Magnetic Polarizable) integrated in a microfluidic chip controlled through magnetic waves. We developed a simple method analyzing rotational dynamics to characterize swimming performances inside microfluidic environments and provide experimental criteria to improve hydrodynamics of future designs. Magpols demonstrated their in-plane mobilities, with a maximum speed up-to 566 millimeters per second (1390 body lengths per second), and the completions of sophisticated trajectory through the microchannels, forward or backward. In addition to their enhanced planar mobilities, we newly demonstrated a backward towing technique by reversing intrinsic magnetic moment.",

        "abstract": "SLAM algorithms that can infer a correct map despite the presence of outliers have recently attracted increasing attention. In the context of SLAM, outlier constraints are typically caused by a failed place recognition due to perceptional aliasing. If not handled correctly, they can have catastrophic effects on the inferred map. Since robust robotic mapping and SLAM are among the key requirements for autonomous long-term operation, inference methods that can cope with such data association failures are a hot topic in current research. Our paper compares three very recently published approaches to robust pose graph SLAM, namely switchable constraints, max-mixture models and the RRR algorithm. All three methods were developed as extensions to existing factor graph-based SLAM back-ends and aim at improving the overall system's robustness to false positive loop closure constraints. Due to the novelty of the three proposed algorithms, no direct comparison has been conducted so far.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to an electro-sensible skin, some species of fish can feel the surrounding electric field generated by them-self or other fish. Known under the name of \u201celectric-sense\u201d, this ability allows these fish to navigate in confined surroundings. Based on a bio-inspired electric sensor, this article presents how this electric sense can be used for the navigation in formation of several underwater vehicles. The formation considered is a file, each vehicle is assumed to follow its predecessor at a given distance. In confined environment, the file formation is interesting since fish can follow the same safe path. Being based on the servoing of the electric measurements, these laws do not require the knowledge of the location of the agents. The underwater vehicle studied have non holonomic properties, their forward velocity has no lateral component. Depending on the choice of the controlled outputs (combination of electric measures) we will see that path followed by the follower agents can be different and a methodology to choose the output will be defined in order that all the agents follow the leader path in presence of curved motion of the leader. The influence of the number of electrodes is discussed. Simulation results illustrate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for synthesizing motions of a humanoid robot that receives an object from a human, with focus on a natural object passing scenario where the human initiates the passing motion by moving an object towards the robot, which continuously adapts its motion to the observed human motion in real time. In this scenario, the robot not only has to recognize and adapt to the human action but also has to synthesize its motion quickly so that the human does not have to wait holding an object. We solve these issues by using a human motion database obtained from two persons performing the object passing task. The rationale behind this approach is that human performance of such a simple task is repeatable, and therefore the receiver (robot) motion can be synthesized by looking up the passer motion in a database. We demonstrate in simulation that the robot can start extending the arm at an appropriate timing and take hand configurations suitable for the object being passed. We also perform hardware experiments of object handing from a human to a robot.",

In this paper a practical evaluation using adaptive filtering techniques to extract the properties from different environmental conditions, with the intention to increase the adaptability of the robot to different environments is presented. We use the well-known linear spring-dashpot model and fit its parameters to four different materials in order to establish which of the reviewed methods (the recursive and windowed least squares algorithms) perform better to describe the material properties. The results show that the recursive least squares provide better tracking performance while the windowed least squares gives a smoother response.",

        "abstract": "When the output observation noise is output-dependent, identifying the unknown system parameters becomes challenging. Traditional methods based on Mean Square Error, even the ones with corrections still have biased estimations in this case. Many practical cases such as bounded sensor, uncertainty of expression in human involved system identification, and even in physiological or biological model identification actually have this problem. In this paper, some algorithms were proposed to obtain the unbiased estimation of parameters for input-output-nonlinear but identification-linear system under output-dependent bounded noise. We utilized the truncated probability distribution to model the noise and gave the unbiased estimation algorithms of the system parameters as well as noise parameter if unknown. Asymptotic properties of the algorithms indicate that the algorithms converge to the true parameters. Besides illustrative numerical example, we also utilized the algorithm in a real world application to identify the personalized thermal comfort model using human noisy voting data. Results revealed the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In order to endow robots with human-like tactile sensory abilities, they must be provided with tactile sensors and intelligent algorithms to select and control useful exploratory movements and interpret data from all available sensors. Current robotic systems do not possess such sensors or algorithms. In this study we integrate multimodal tactile sensing (force, vibration and temperature) from the BioTac\u00ae with a Shadow Dexterous Hand and program the robot to make exploratory movements similar to those humans make when identifying objects by their compliance, texture, and thermal properties. Signal processing strategies were developed to provide measures of these perceptual properties. When identifying an object, exploratory movements are intelligently selected using a process we have previously developed called Bayesian exploration [1], whereby exploratory movements that provide the most disambiguation between likely candidates of objects are automatically selected. The exploration algorithm was augmented with reinforcement learning whereby its internal representations of objects evolved according to its cumulative experience with them. This allowed the algorithm to compensate for drift in the performance of the anthropomorphic robot hand and the ambient conditions of testing, improving accuracy while reducing the number of exploratory movements required to identify an object. The robot correctly identified 10 different objects on 99 out of 100 presentations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery assisted by robots is characterized by the restriction of feasible motions of the manipulator link constrained to move through the entry port to the patient's body. In particular, the link is only allowed to translate along its axis and rotate about the entry point. This requires constraining the manipulator motion with respect to a point known as Remote Center of Motion (RCM). The achievement of any surgical task inside the patient's body must take into account this constraint. In this paper we provide a new, general characterization of the RCM constraint useful for task control in the minimally invasive robotic surgery context. To show the effectiveness of our formalization, we consider first a visual task for a manipulator with 6 degrees of freedom holding an endoscopic camera and derive the kinematic control law allowing to achieve the visual task while satisfying the RCM constraint. An example of application of the proposed kinematic modeling to a motion planning problem for a 9 degrees of freedom manipulator with assigned path for the surgical tool is then proposed to illustrate the generality of the approach.",

The exoskeleton device is an inherently compliant actuated system that was implemented based on the series elastic actuation (SEA) to provide improved and intrinsically soft interaction behaviour. Details of the exoskeleton design are presented. A detailed musculoskeletal model was developed and experimentally identified in order to map electromyographic signals to the antagonistic muscle torques, acting on the human knee joint. The estimated muscle torques are used in order to determine the user's intent and joint stiffness trend. These reference signals are exploited by a novel Tele-Impedance controller which is applied to a knee exoskeleton device to provide assistance and stiffness augmentation to the user's knee joint. Experimental trials of a standing-up motion task were carried out for evaluation of the proposed control strategy. The results indicate that the proposed knee exoskeleton device and control scheme can effectively generate assistive actions that are intrinsically and naturally controlled by the user muscle activity.",

In our system, the angle of the finger of the robot hand is controlled according to the angle of the operator's finger, and the position of the robot arm is controlled according to the position of the operator's arm. Simultaneously, the operator feels the environmental force as detected by the touch sensor attached to the robot hand, resulting in so-called bilateral master/slave control. To date, there have been a few studies of bilateral master/slave systems that use a multi-fingered humanoid robot hand in communication networks with delay caused by physical distance. The purpose of our study was to achieve tele-operation with bilateral master/slave control between the operator's hand/arm and the multi-fingered humanoid robot hand/arm using the Internet with delay caused by distance. For our experiment, the operator was in the USA, and the multi-fingered humanoid robot hand/arm and object were in Japan. Using our system, the operator could successfully grasp and move an object while he felt the reaction force from the object. This technology can applicable to tele-operation such as feeling the hardness and weight of the stone which exist in the moon, on the ground etc.",

The missions are specified as rich, temporal logic statements about the satisfaction of the properties. The main objective is to be able to synthesize, test, and evaluate control policies for complex aerial missions. Our testbed consists of quadrotors, a motion capture system that provides precise and continuous position information of the quadrotor, projectors that can emulate dynamically changing environments, physical obstacles, and computers that control the quadrotor, the motion capture system, and the projectors. Our computational approach is hierarchical. At the bottom level, we partition the environment and construct an abstraction in the form of a finite transition system such that the quadrotor can execute its transitions by using low level feedback controllers. At the top level, we draw inspiration from LTL model checking and use a value iteration algorithm to determine an optimal control policy that guarantees the satisfaction of the specification under nondeterministically changing properties. We illustrate the approach for the particular case of a surveillance mission in a city-like environment.",

To evaluate our approach, we present results using an online binocular visual SLAM system that uses place recognition for both robustness and multi-session operation. Additionally, to enable large-scale indoor mapping, our system automatically detects elevator rides based on accelerometer data. We demonstrate long-term mapping in a large multi-floor building, using approximately nine hours of data collected over the course of six months. Our results illustrate the capability of our visual SLAM system to map a large are over extended period of time.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to improving precision and reliability of odometry of skid-steer mobile robots by means inspired by robotic terrain classification (RTC). In contrary to standard RTC approaches we do not provide human labeled discrete terrain categories but we classify the terrain directly by the values of coefficients correcting the robot's odometry. Hence these coefficients make the odometry model adaptable to the terrain type due to inherent slip compensation. Estimation of these correction coefficients is based on feature extraction from the vibration data measured by an inertial measurement unit and regression function trained offline. Statistical features from the time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet features were explored and the best were automatically selected. To provide ground truth trajectory for the purpose of offline training a portable overhead camera tracking system was developed. Experimental evaluation on rough outdoor terrain proved 67.9\u00b17.5% improvement in RMSE in position with respect to a state of the art odometry model. Moreover, our proposed approach is straightforward, easy for online implementation, and low on computational demands.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile robots and vehicles with active articulated elements are well suited to drive on irregular and rough terrain because they are able to adjust their center of mass and decrease the risk of tip over or other accidents. The articulated mechanism, however, is usually constrained by the actuator's bandwidth, making it difficult for the vehicle to compensate for abrupt changes in terrain profile. In this paper we propose a terrain model-based control method to improve stability when traversing terrains with varying slopes, depressions, and rises. A model predictive control approach takes into account actuator bandwidth to anticipate interactions with the terrain and control the articulated elements to prevent tipping over. The method is applied to an autonomous orchard platform where workers stand while conducting production tasks on the trees, adjusting the platform height and increasing its stability. The feasibility is illustrated via numerical simulations performed with the MD Adams/Car software and Matlab, with both artificial and natural terrain data. Challenging yet realistic terrain profiles are considered to demonstrate the control effectiveness in preventing the platform from tipping over and therefore improving the workers' and the vehicle's safety.",

        "abstract": "As robots are increasingly employed for distributed missions, an important problem that needs to be solved is the Autonomous Recharging Problem (ARP); that is, effectively planning and coordinating when, where, and how to recharge robots to maximize operational efficiency. In this paper, we define the ARP and clearly describe the relevant technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to solve the ARP. These challenges include individual awareness about energy for each robot, correlating task execution to its impact on battery life, designing and implementing static and mobile recharging stations, optimizing individual worker robots schedules to ensure extended operations, and coordinating a team of worker and recharging robots to effectively share available recharging resources. In this paper we also describe an initial implementation of a market-based solution to the ARP that scales with the number of tasks as well as with the number of robots, and schedules workers' tasks to coordinate with recharging tasks. The developed solution has been evaluated in simulation and on Pioneer P3DX mobile robots executing transportation tasks in an indoor environment. Results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state of the art in recharging strategies.",

One of the possible reasons for the slow progress is the focus of the research efforts on high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The resulting tactile sensor prototypes are presented as laboratory prototypes with no or little chance to be successfully integrated into a robotic system. In order to enable the operation of an artificial skin on a robotic system in real-world applications the conflict of goals between high sensitivity and an overload-proof, collision tolerant, design needs to be solved. Within this paper we present a stretchable tactile surface sensor as a major functional component of an artificial skin setup that is able to unite the required sensitivity with the ability to withstand collisions. The results of first experiments regarding sensitivity and the ability of the DLR Artificial Skin setup to withstand high impact forces are presented.",

This loss of haptic information compromises the safety of the procedure and must be overcome through training. Determining the skill level of trainees is critical for ensuring patient safety. The objective of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of force information for skills assessment during MIS. Experiments were performed using a set of sensorized instruments capable of measuring instrument position and tissue interaction forces. The results show that experience level has a strong correlation with force-based metrics. The proposed metrics can be automatically computed, are completely objective, and measure important aspects of performance.",

Clearly, the bar lengths of this kind of assembly are not independent as we cannot assign arbitrary values to them. This dependency can be algebraically expressed as a closure condition fully expressed in terms of bar lengths. This paper is devoted to its derivation and to show how its use simplifies the position analysis of many well-known serial and parallel robots thus providing a unifying treatment to apparently disparate problems. This approach permits deriving the univariate polynomials, needed for the closed-form solution of these position analysis problems, without relying on trigonometric substitutions or difficult variable eliminations.",

This omnidirectional gear is driven by spur gears that are perpendicular. When one spur gear rotates to drive the omnidirectional gear, the other slides between the teeth of the omnidirectional gear and vice versa. In this paper, we introduce gears with passive rollers to reduce the frictional resistance with a mechanism including smooth rolling motion of conical or flat passive rollers, which can boost the power transmission efficiency of the omnidirectional driving gear system. We also confirmed another useful function of this gear with passive rollers as a worm wheel to transmit power from a worm gear with higher energy efficiency than an ordinary worm wheel.",

The method uses an information gain metric based on the uncertainty of the object's pose to determine the next best touching action. Intuitively, the optimal action is the one that is the most informative. The action is then carried out and the state of the object's pose is updated using an estimator. The method is further extended to choose the most informative action to simultaneously localize and estimate the object's model parameter or model class.

Because an exact analysis of even the simplest algorithm is computationally intractable, we derive an approximate bound leading to performance curves useful to answer design questions (how many robots are needed to get a certain performance guarantee?) or analysis questions (what is the probability of success given a certain deadline and number of robots?) Simulations show that the bounds are sharp and provide a useful tool to predict team deployment performance and tradeoffs.",

        "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces open a direct channel between a brain and a robot. This channel is commonly used to provide direct and active input to the robot, resulting in a tele-operation system. We argue in favor of a more passive brain-machine interface as a means for human-robot interaction. There, the brain signals of the human interaction partner are constantly monitored and decoded to detect particular states that correlate with events in the robot's behavior. Such a state can be surprise due to a strange or erroneous robot action. We review three studies that we conducted with our own EEG-based brain-robot interface framework. The interface is active, that is, we directly control humanoid robots in different application scenarios in a semi-autonomous manner. Our results show that automated and unconscious components in the EEG are the most robust and acceptable for the user. These are exactly the components that are useful for a passive interface. Finally, we present a pilot study where we extract correlates of human surprise from an interaction with a real humanoid robot. We show that, currently in offline analysis, we are able to extract similar components used in the structured, stimulus based active interfaces. We pinpoint the issues that need to be solved, such as a more reliable real-time decoding of brain signals from real-world interaction situations.",

In this work, we present a new method to independently control multiple sub-mm microrobots in three dimensions (3D) using magnetic gradient based direct pulling as the 3D motion generation method. This is accomplished through the use of geometrically or magnetically distinct microrobots which assume different magnetization directions in a rotating magnetic field. Such diversity in design allows for different magnetic forces to be exerted on each, enabling path following with less than 370\u00b5m mean path deviation for a set of two microrobots of size 350\u00b5m and 1500\u00b5m. This addressability method could be used for the 3D control of a team of microrobots inside microfluidic channels or in the human body for localized therapy or diagnostics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Time-optimal path following considers the problem of moving along a predetermined geometric path in minimum time. In the case of a robotic manipulator a convex reformulation of this optimal control problem has been derived previously [1]. However, the bang-bang nature of the time-optimal trajectories results in near-infinite jerks in joint space and operational (Cartesian) space. For systems with un-modeled flexibilities, this usually results in excitation of the resonant frequencies, hence in unwanted vibrations and acceleration peaks, contributing to a tracking error. These vibrations can be reduced by imposing jerk constraints on the trajectory [2]. However, these jerk constraints destroy the convexity of the time-optimal control problem. The present paper proposes an efficient sequential convex programming (SCP) approach to solve the corresponding non-convex optimal control problem by writing the non-convex jerk constraints as a difference of convex (DC) functions. We illustrate the developed approach by means of experiments with a seven d.o.f. robot. Furthermore, numerical simulations illustrate the fast convergence of the proposed method in only a few SCP iterations, confirming the efficiency and practicality of the proposed framework.",

The effectiveness of needle-based access often requires very accurate targeting of the needle tip within tissue. We designed a device that uses suction to fixate tissue during robotic needle insertion and measured its ability to improve targeting accuracy and decrease tissue deformation in artificial and ex vivo tissue. The deformation of the tissue was tracked in ultrasound images to evaluate the device's performance. The device was particularly effective at fixating ex vivo tissue with an attached skin layer and decreased tissue deformation by up to 96%. When accessing an embedded target within tissue, suction fixation reduced the targeting error by over 1 mm in chicken breast without a membrane and over 2 mm in chicken breast with an attached skin. Suction fixation could be used to improve the accuracy of robotic needle insertion through the skin and into internal organs with capsules.",

A central aspect of behaviour-based systems is the interaction between the behaviours, as a lot of the functionality of a system typically arises from this interaction. Hence, verification has to deal with the specialities of behaviour interaction. Previous work has introduced a concept for modelling behaviour-based systems as networks of finite-state automata and for applying model checking as verification technique. As the manual verification of large networks is tedious and errorprone, the work at hand introduces a concept for assisting developers by partly automating the verification process. The applicability of the presented approach is demonstrated using the behaviour-based control system of an autonomous bucket excavator.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling a network of locally interacting mobile agents, subject to a set of non-local topology constraints, towards a group flocking objective. As opposed to switching network links directly in the space of discrete graphs, yielding a divide in spatial configuration and communication topology, we regulate topology through mobility, enabling adjacent agents to retain or deny links spatially on the basis of constraint satisfaction. Specifically, we propose a distributed formulation consisting of a switching control and smooth potential fields for local link discrimination and flocking, coupled with consensus-based coordination over proposed topology changes, yielding transitions in communication that respect non-local constraints and correspond to agent configuration. An analysis of the interplay between the topology consensus and constraint composition, together with a Lyapunov-like convergence argument guarantees the flocking, collision avoidance, and constraint satisfaction properties of the system. Finally, simulations of a novel constrained coordination scenario highlight the correctness and applicability of our proposed methods.",

Joint torque sensing is one of the key techniques for achieving high-performance robot control, especially for robots working in unstructured environments. The proposed joint torque estimation technique uses link-side position measurement along with a proposed harmonic derive model to realize stiff and sensitive torque estimation.

We use a hybrid systems framework to characterize the dynamic transitions of a planar \u201clegged\u201d rigid body from rest on level ground to a fully aerial state. The various contact conditions fit together to form a topologically regular structure, the \u201cground reaction complex\u201d. The body's actuated dynamics excite multifarious transitions between the cells of this complex, whose regular adjacency relations index naturally the resulting \u201cleaps\u201d (path sequences through the cells from rest to free flight). We exhibit on a RHex robot some of the most interesting \u201cwords\u201d formed by these achievable path sequences, documenting unprecedented levels of performance and new application possibilities that illustrate the value of understanding and expressing this vocabulary systematically.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new paradigm for reactive wall-following by a planar robot taking the form of an actively steered sensor model that augments the robot's motion dynamics. We postulate a foveated sensor capable of delivering third-order infinitesimal (range, tangent, and curvature) data at a point along a wall (modeled as an unknown smooth plane curve) specified by the angle of the ray from the robot's body that first intersects it. We develop feedback policies for the coupled (point or unicycle) sensorimotor system that drive the sensor's foveal angle as a function of the instantaneous infinitesimal data, in accord with the trade-off between a desired standoff and progress-rate as the wall's curvature varies unpredictably in the manner of an unmodeled noise signal. We prove that in any neighborhood within which the third-order infinitesimal data accurately predicts the local \u201cshape\u201d of the wall, neither robot will ever hit it. We empirically demonstrate with comparative physical studies that the new active sensor management strategy yields superior average tracking performance and avoids catastrophic collisions or wall losses relative to the passive sensor variant.",

        "abstract": "Augmented-Reality (AR) displays increase surgeon's visual awareness of high-risk surgical targets (e.g., the location of a tumor) by accurately overlaying pre-operative radiological 3-D model onto the intra-operative laparoscopic video. Existing AR systems lack in accuracy and robustness against frequent illumination changes, camera motions, and organ occlusions, which rapidly cause the loss of image (anchor) points, and thus the loss of the AR display after a few seconds. In this paper, we present a new AR system, which represents the first step toward long term and accurate augmented surgical display. Our system leverages feature matching to automatically recover the overlay by predicting the image locations of a high number of anchor points that were lost after a sudden image change. Additionally, a weighted sliding-window least-squares approach is also used to increase the accuracy of the AR display over time. The effectiveness of the proposed system in maintaining a long term, stable, and accurate augmentation has been tested over a set of real partial-nephrectomy laparascopic monocular videos from a DaVinci surgical robot.",

        "abstract": "For the purposes of achieving Autonomous Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAAR) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), this paper presents the use of a visual tracking algorithm based on direct methods and image registration techniques, with the aim of solving the drogue tracking problem in order to obtain vision-based relative position estimations of the aircrafts for the probe and drogue refuelling method. Proposed vision-based AAAR approaches to date have explored the use of features (such as corners, painted marks, or LEDs) to detect and estimate the relative motion of either the receiver or the tanker aircraft, with the drawback that sometimes this requires the installation of specific hardware on-board. Conversely, the strategy we propose to use does not require the installation of additional hardware on-board. The strategy is based on a hierarchical implementation of an image registration technique: the Inverse Compositional Image Alignment ICIA. Real images and real flight hardware (probe and drogue) are used to test the algorithm using a robotic testbed that simulates the motion of the aircrafts (the tanker and the receiver) during the refuelling task. Results show that the tracking algorithm is robust to fast motion, changes in appearance, and situations where part of the drogue is occluded or is outside of the field of view of the camera. Additionally, results show that robust position estimations at real-time frame rates are obtained, proving that the technique is fast enough to form the basis for automated aerial refuelling sensing capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Lab-on-a-chip technology scales down multiple laboratory processes to a chip capable of performing automated biochemical analyses. Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) is a digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology that uses patterned electrodes for droplet manipulation. The main limitations of EWOD devices are the restrictions in volume and motion of droplets due to the fixed size, layout, and addressing scheme of the electrodes. Optoelectrowetting on dielectric (OEWOD) is a recent technology that uses optical sources and electric fields for droplet actuation on a continuous surface. We describe an open surface light-actuated OEWOD device that can manipulate droplets of multiple volumes ranging from 1 to 50 \u00b5L at voltages below 45 V. To achieve lower voltage droplet actuation than previous open configuration devices, we added a dedicated dielectric layer of high dielectric constant (Al2O3 with \u03b5r of 9.1) and significantly reduced the thickness of the hydrophobic layer. The device is capable of transporting droplets at speeds as high as 12 mm/sec using a data projector as an optical source. We developed a multiple axis contact pad design to apply lateral electric fields along different axes to achieve multi-axis droplet movement. We demonstrated microfluidic operations including droplet merging, mixing, and parallel droplet motion. Further, the OEWOD device is capable of droplet transportation using a tablet computer's LCD screen as an optical source.",

A study of the finite element analysis is established and utilized to improve the mechanism weaknesses under some inevitable external forces to ensure the minimum structure deformation.

A flexible, multi-scale test-bed, developed for use in conjunction with these primitives, is described first. The approach and motion primitives are then discussed. An autonomous micromanipulation and assembly task is described and manipulation plans using the methodology are generated and experimentally executed.

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a high-speed pick-and-place method for cell-assembly applications. Besides range of motion and accuracy, rapidness of a manipulation system is an important parameter, which is so far underrated in related studies. To achieve high-speed micromanipulation, obtaining 3D positions of both the target microobject and the end effector rapidly is necessary. In addition, controlling the vibration of the end effector, which is greater at high speed, is another arduous task. We propose a new fast detection algorithm for both the target microobject and the end effector for achieving high-speed control of the system. Moreover, to realize the stable control for very fast movements, the vibration of the system is compensated. High-speed control of the microhand system is demonstrated with preliminary experiments consisting of pick-and-place actions of 40 to 60 \u03bcm microspheres; we aimed at performing a manipulation task in 1 second. Comparison with similar studies shows the merit of the proposed automated high-speed micromanipulation system.",

In this paper, we address the problem under the additional constraint that a pose estimate from the current location of the camera to the reference location is to be estimated. This requires robust feature matching to estimate corresponding points, and not just image-level matching, as is often done in the literature. We present a method to learn a matching function from training data that is representative of the lighting variations to be modeled, under weak assumptions. Lighting variation in the image descriptors is modeled using a probability distribution on the discretized descriptor space. Results are presented on a live visual SLAM system in outdoor environments and in an indoor simulated environment, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic climbing robots have shown vertical speeds that approach those of the fastest climbing animals, but to date, no work has been conducted on directional control or maneuverability while climbing for these platforms. Directional control in animals during high-speed terrestrial running utilizes altered leg kinematics and leg specialization, however, little work has been done to classify biological strategies for maneuverability in the scansorial regime. To gain insight on how alterations of leg kinematics effect maneuverability during high-speed climbing, we propose three methods for directional control and implement them on a high-speed, dynamic climbing robotic platform. These methods alter the leg kinematics of the platform through asymmetrically changing the foot placement, center of mass, and leg length. We show that heading angles of up to 37\u00b0 off of vertical are possible while only decreasing the vertical ascension rate by 20%.",

In this paper, we introduce Gasbot, a robotic platform that aims to automatize methane emission monitoring in landfills and biogas production sites. The distinctive characteristic of the Gasbot platform is the use of a Tunable Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensor. This sensor provides integral concentration measurements over the path of the laser beam. Existing gas distribution mapping algorithms can only handle local measurements obtained from traditional in-situ chemical sensors. In this paper we also describe an algorithm to generate 3D methane concentration maps from integral concentration and depth measurements. The Gasbot platform has been tested in two different scenarios: an underground corridor, where a pipeline leak was simulated and in a decommissioned landfill site, where an artificial methane emission source was introduced.",

        "abstract": "Appearance-based batch nonlinear optimization techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have been highly successful in assisting robot motion estimation. Traditionally, these techniques are applied in a single privileged coordinate frame, which can become computationally expensive over long distances, particularly when a loop closure requires the adjustment of many pose variables. Recent approaches to the problem have shown that a completely relative coordinate framework can be used to incrementally find a close approximation of the full maximum likelihood solution in constant time. However, due to the nature of these discrete-time techniques, the state size becomes intractable when challenged with high-rate sensors. We propose moving the relative coordinate formulation of SLAM into continuous time by estimating the velocity profile of the robot. We derive the relative formulation of the continuous-time robot trajectory and formulate an estimator for the SLAM problem using temporal basis functions. Although we do not yet take advantage of large-scale loop closures, we intentionally use a relative formulation to set the stage for future work that will close loops in constant time. We show how the estimator can be used in a window-style filter to incrementally find the batch solution in constant time. The estimator is validated on a set of appearance-based feature measurements acquired using a two-axis scanning laser rangefinder over a 1.1km trajectory.",

The proposed tracking algorithm is based on a probabilistic generative model that incorporates observations of the point cloud and the physical properties of the tracked object and its environment. We propose a modified expectation maximization algorithm to perform maximum a posteriori estimation to update the state estimate at each time step. Our modification makes it practical to perform the inference through calls to a physics simulation engine. This is significant because (i) it allows for the use of highly optimized physics simulation engines for the core computations of our tracking algorithm, and (ii) it makes it possible to naturally, and efficiently, account for physical constraints imposed by collisions, grasping actions, and material properties in the observation updates. Even in the presence of the relatively large occlusions that occur during manipulation tasks, our algorithm is able to robustly track a variety of types of deformable objects, including ones that are one-dimensional, such as ropes; two-dimensional, such as cloth; and three-dimensional, such as sponges. Our implementation can track these objects in real time.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a textureless object segmentation approach for autonomous service robots acting in human living environments. The proposed system allows a robot to effectively segment textureless objects in cluttered scenes by leveraging its manipulation capabilities. In our pipeline, the cluttered scenes are first statically segmented using state-of-the-art classification algorithm and then the interactive segmentation is deployed in order to resolve this possibly ambiguous static segmentation. In the second step the RGBD (RGB + Depth) sparse features, estimated on the RGBD point cloud from the Kinect sensor, are extracted and tracked while motion is induced into a scene. Using the resulting feature poses, the features are then assigned to their corresponding objects by means of a graph-based clustering algorithm. In the final step, we reconstruct the dense models of the objects from the previously clustered sparse RGBD features. We evaluated the approach on a set of scenes which consist of various textureless flat (e.g. box-like) and round (e.g. cylinder-like) objects and the combinations thereof.",

In the proposed algorithm, the amount of the traction or braking force on each driving wheel can be determined so as to generate a desired tangential force, yaw moment and centripetal force independently. The algorithm considers omni-directional steering command and is capable of handling both traction and braking force commands. The algorithm is applicable on vehicles with at least three independent driving wheels. Simulations have been conducted to illustrate the use of the proposed force distribution method in enhancing vehicles stability.",

Using the flatness property, a trajectory generation method is presented that enables finding nominal trajectories with various constraints that not only result in minimal load swing if required, but can also cause a large swing in the load for dynamically agile motions. A control design is presented for the system specialized to the planar case, that enables tracking of either the quadrotor attitude, the load attitude or the position of the load.

To overcome the limitations of kinematic planning algorithms in dynamic tasks, we propose a three-step approach to the synthesis of trajectories under the principle of least action. This is motivated by neuroscientific findings on human effort minimization in motor tasks. A trajectory is generated by optimized sequencing of optimal motion primitives. The benefits of the proposed method for physical human-robot cooperation are demonstrated in human user studies in a 2D cooperative transport task in a virtual maze.",

However, several manufactures and research groups are still working in the improvement of the control strategies and path smoothing algorithms. In this paper, a new trajectory generation approach for autonomous vehicles in urban scenarios, considering parametric equations, is proposed. An algorithm that considers Bezier curves and circumference parametric equations for a real vehicle, specifically in roundabout and urban intersections is presented. This approach is generated in real time and can be adapted to dynamic changes in the route. A smooth trajectory generator computationally efficient and easily implementable is proposed. Moreover, this new trajectory generator reduces the control actions, generated with to a fuzzy controller. Some trials have been performed in an urban circuit with promising performance.",

This work considers the problem of predicting the attitude and configuration angles of the platform from terrain representations that are often incomplete due to occlusions and sensor limitations. Using Gaussian Processes (GP) and exteroceptive data as training input, we can provide a continuous and complete representation of terrain traversability, with uncertainty in the output estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that focuses on exploiting the explicit correlation in vehicle attitude and configuration during operation by learning a kernel function from vehicle experience to perform GP regression. We provide an extensive experimental validation of the proposed method on a planetary rover. We show significant improvement in the accuracy of our estimation compared with results obtained using standard kernels (Squared Exponential and Neural Network), and compared to traversability estimation made over terrain models built using state-of-the-art GP techniques.",

This paper discusses the design, dynamic modeling, and kinematic simulation of a compact two-axis bend sensor constructed from layers of carbon black filled polyurethane for determining the bending angle of a cable-driven continuum robotic endoscope. The sensor is flexible (<0.8 mN/degree), high strain (>10% strain), compact, and does not require external reference equipment. The sensor is able to bend in 180 degrees in all directions, produces two-axis outputs that are linear up to 120 degrees of bending and has a response time less than 9 ms. This paper explores the use of the sensor for controlling the tip position of a robotic endoscope and detecting external forces. The design outlined in this paper has many possible applications in robotic endoscopes, surgical tools, snake-like robots and soft material robotics.",

        "abstract": "Accurate pose estimation relies on high-quality sensor measurements. Due to manufacturing tolerance, every sensor (camera or lidar) needs to be individually calibrated. Feature-based techniques using simple calibration targets (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) have become the dominant approach to camera sensor calibration. Existing lidar calibration methods require a controlled environment (e.g., a space of known dimension) or specific configurations of supporting hardware (e.g., coupled with GPS/IMU). Leveraging recent state estimation developments based on lidar intensity imagery, this paper presents a calibration procedure for a two-axis scanning lidar using only an inexpensive checkerboard calibration target. In addition, the proposed method generalizes a two-axis scanning lidar as an idealized spherical camera with additive measurement distortions. Conceptually, this is not unlike normal camera calibration in which an arbitrary camera is modelled as an idealized projective (pinhole) camera with tangential and radial distortions. The resulting calibration method, we believe, can be readily applied to a variety of two-axis scanning lidars. We present the measurement improvement quantitatively, as well as the impact of calibration on a 1.1-km visual odometry estimate.",

Biological data suggest that legs regulate energy production and removal via muscle activation, and therefore the conservative SLIP model cannot fully explain the robustness of many legged animals during running and hopping gaits. In this work we consider the active SLIP model, an energetically non-conservative version of the SLIP model with series actuation. In particular, we propose a strategy for actuator displacement to add/remove energy from the system, and to analytically solve part of its dynamics. Additionally, we develop a control strategy for online actuator displacement to drive the system to a desired state, even in the presence of terrain perturbation.",

        "abstract": "Learning the flight model for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) involves estimating stability and control parameters from flight data. A non-parametric approach to perform this task is to use Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGPs). It has many benefits, including not having to know a prior model structure, captures any dependencies embodied in the outputs and learns the system noise. However, the main drawback of this approach is the heavy computational cost which makes it prohibitive to learn the model from large test flight data sets. In addition, DGPs do not capture any non-stationary behavior in the aerodynamic coefficients. This paper presents a novel approach to address these issues while maintaining all the other benifits that was gained using DGPs. The proposed algorithm uses an additive sparse model that combines global and local Gaussian processes to learn a multi-output system. We demonstrate that having a combined approximation makes the model suitable for all regions of the flight envelope. To capture the global properties we introduce a new sampling method to gather information about the output correlations. Local properties were captured using a non-stationary covariance function with KD-trees for neighbourhood selection. This makes the model scalable to learn from high dimensional large-scale data sets. Finally, the method explained in this paper was demonstrated in several examples using real flight tests from a delta-winged UAV.",

In contrast to traditional image-based visual servo, the proposed solution does not require a known value of camera focal length for the computation of the image Jacobian. Instead, it is estimated at run time from the observation of the tracked target. The technique is shown to outperform classical visual servoing schemes in situations with noisy calibration parameters and for unexpected changes in the camera zoom. The method's performance is demonstrated both in simulation experiments and in a ROS implementation of a quadrotor servoing task. The developed solution is tightly integrated with ROS and is made available as part of the IRI ROS stack.",

When we develop algorithms for grasping with robotic hands it is not enough to assume the best estimate of the environment - if there is a measure of uncertainty we need to account for it. This paper presents a control law which augments a grasp controller with the ability to prefer known or unseen regions of an object; this leads to the introduction of two motion primitives: an explorative and exploitative grasp. We integrate this control law in a framework for iterative grasping and implement a tactile exploration scenario. The experimental results confirm that using the notion of uncertainty in the control loop yields better models and does it faster than an uninformed controller.",

We numerically show that non-instantaneous DLS motion emerges after the instant of landing of the swing leg if the knee-joints are free and semicircular feet have a sufficient radius. Furthermore, we numerically analyze the tendency of the emergence of DLS motion according to the robot's physical parameters and shapes.",

This information is to be used for state feedback control of the dynamically unstable system. Three incremental encoders (attached to the omniwheels that drive the ball of the robot) as well as three rate gyroscopes and accelerometers (attached to the robot's main body) are used as sensors. For the presented method, observability is proven analytically for all essential states in the system, and the algorithm is experimentally evaluated on the Ballbot Rezero.",

        "abstract": "The building of an object-level knowledge base is the foundation of a new methodology for many perception tasks in artificial intelligence, and is an area that has received increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, to mine category shape patterns directly from a large urban environment, thus constructing a category structure base. Conventionally, category patterns are learned from a large collection of object samples, but automatic object collection requires prior knowledge of category structures. To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, we learn shape patterns from raw segmentations, and then refine these segmentations based on the pattern knowledge. In the process, we solve two challenging problems of knowledge mining. First, as some categories have large intra-category structure variations, we design an entropy-based method to determine the structure variation for each category, in order to establish the correct range of sample collection. Second, because incorrect segmentation is unavoidable without prior knowledge, we propose a novel unsupervised method that uses a pattern competition strategy to identify and subtract shape patterns formed by incorrectly segmented objects. This ensures that shape patterns are meaningful at the object level. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for category structure mining in a large urban environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of evaluating and estimating the mechanical robustness of footholds for legged robots in unstructured terrain. In contrast to approaches that rely on human expert knowledge or human defined criteria to identify appropriate footholds, our method uses the robot itself to assess whether a certain foothold is adequate or not. To this end, one of the robot's legs is employed to haptically explore an unknown foothold. The robustness of the foothold is defined by a simple metric as a function of the achievable ground reaction forces. This haptic feedback is associated with the foothold shape to estimate the robustness of untouched footholds. The underlying shape clustering principles are tested on synthetic data and in hardware experiments using a single-leg testbed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a robust algorithm that generates an efficient and accurate dense 3D reconstruction with associated semantic labellings. Intelligent autonomous systems require accurate 3D reconstructions for applications such as navigation and localisation. Such systems also need to recognise their surroundings in order to identify and interact with objects of interest. Considerable emphasis has been given to generating a good reconstruction but less effort has gone into generating a 3D semantic model. The inputs to our algorithm are street level stereo image pairs acquired from a camera mounted on a moving vehicle. The depth-maps, generated from the stereo pairs across time, are fused into a global 3D volume online in order to accommodate arbitrary long image sequences. The street level images are automatically labelled using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework exploiting stereo images, and label estimates are aggregated to annotate the 3D volume. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI odometry dataset and have manually generated ground truth for object class segmentation. Our qualitative evaluation is performed on various sequences of the dataset and we also quantify our results on a representative subset.",

        "abstract": "Several variants of incremental sampling-based algorithms have been recently proposed in order to optimally solve motion planning problems. Popular examples include the RRT* and the PRM* algorithms. These algorithms are asymptotically optimal and thus provide high quality solutions. However, the convergence rate to the optimal solution may still be slow. Borrowing from ideas used in the well-known LPA* algorithm, in this paper we present a new incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm based on Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), denoted by RRT# (RRT \u201csharp\u201d), which also guarantees asymptotic optimality, but, in addition, it also ensures that the constructed spanning tree rooted at the initial state contains lowest-cost path information for vertices which have the potential to be part of the optimal solution. This implies that the best possible solution is readily computed if there are some vertices in the current graph that are already in the goal region.",

In this work, the inertial effect of swinging a dynamic tail was studied as a method to achieve these rapid turns. An analytic model of a robot with a reaction wheel tail was developed to determine the effect of varying system parameters such as tail motor voltage, coefficient of friction, and tail inertia on inertial turning performance. This model was also validated experimentally using a modified off-the-shelf miniature legged robot. The same trends seen in the analytic study were also found in the experiments varying motor voltage, coefficient of friction, and tail inertia.",

Platooning formation is ensured using a global decentralized control strategy supported by inter-vehicle communications. A large motion flexibility is achieved according to a manual guidance mode, i.e. the path to follow is inferred online from the motion of the manually driven first vehicle. For this purpose, a visual SLAM algorithm that relies on monocular vision is run on the lead vehicle and coupled with a trajectory creation procedure. Both the map and trajectory updates are shared online with the following vehicles and permit them to derive their absolute location with respect to a common reference trajectory from their current camera image. Full-scale experiments with two urban vehicles demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",

Already existing minimal solutions require exhaustive algebraic derivations. In contrast, our novel minimal solution is solved in a straightforward manner using the Gr\u00f6bner basis method. Existing n-point solutions are mostly based on iterative optimization schemes. Our n-point solution is non-iterative and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of computational efficiency. Our results present an evaluation against state-of-the-art single-camera algorithms, and a comparison of different multi-camera setups. It demonstrates the superior noise resilience achieved when using multi-camera configurations, and the efficiency of our algorithms. As a further contribution, we illustrate a possible robotic use-case of our non-perspective orientation computation algorithms by presenting visual odometry results on real data with a non-overlapping multi-camera configuration, including a comparison to a loosely coupled alternative.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel technique for estimating initial 3D poses in the context of localization and Visual SLAM problems. The presented approach can deal with noise, outliers and a large amount of input data and still performs in real time in a standard CPU. Our method produces solutions with an accuracy comparable to those produced by RANSAC but can be much faster when the percentage of outliers is high or for large amounts of input data. On the current work we propose to formulate the pose estimation as an optimization problem on Lie groups, considering their manifold structure as well as their associated Lie algebras. This allows us to perform a fast and simple optimization at the same time that conserve all the constraints imposed by the Lie group SE(3). Additionally, we present several key design concepts related with the cost function and its Jacobian; aspects that are critical for the good performance of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Graceful motion in vehicle steering is an important issue. Generally, this problem can be solved by controller design or planning a path in a real time. However, it may need the system to carry on more computing effort or make a compromise between the tracking accuracy and motion smoothness. In this paper, a multi-tiered model based steering control strategy is proposed for considering vehicle kinematics and dynamics simultaneously. In this strategy, the kinematic controller applies motion trajectory generation as basis to produce a set of hierarchal manifolds that gradually converge tracking errors by providing softer yaw rate commands. To minimize steady-state error caused by path curvature discontinuity, an integrator is embedded to these manifolds. A robust output feedback dynamic controller is designed to reject modeling errors and disturbances caused by side slip estimation from a robust observer. Steering rate is applied as the control input by considering steering actuator capabilities to replace traditional steering angle commands. Simulations and experiments validate control performance with a full-size passenger vehicle.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, driver-assistance systems have emerged as one major possibility to increase comfort and safety in road traffic. Still, cost is one major hindrance to the widespread use of safety systems such as lane-change or blind spot warning. To facilitate the widespread adoption of such safety systems, thus increasing safety for all traffic participants, the use of cost-efficient components is of crucial importance. Within this work we investigate the use of cost-efficient, widely used ultrasonic sensors for the tracking of passing-by vehicles at high velocities. Therefore, a particle filter with some mixture tracking capabilities is implemented to fuse the signals from 6 us-sensors. The main focus of this work lies on the development of a more detailed sensor model that is used in this particle filter. Additionally, a strategy to take into account object-visibility w.r.t. the different sensors is outlined. The derived concept is evaluated experimentally in real road traffic. The applicability of the tracking result in context of lane-change-decision-aid and blind-spot-surveillance systems is analyzed.",

To discuss the working principle, two vibration-driven locomotion systems are considered. Due to the complex dynamics of the applied tensegrity structures with pronounced mechanical compliance, the movement performance of both systems is highly dependent on the driving frequency. By using single-actuation, the system design and also their control can be kept simple. The movement of the robots is depending on their configuration uniaxial bidirectional or planar. The working principle of both systems is discussed with the help of transient dynamic analyses and verified with experimental tests for a selected prototype.",

This is a major problem for robot navigation in many indoor environments due to the prevalence of glass paned doors, windows, and even glass walls, as well as mirrors and polished metal surfaces. Current formulations of occupancy grid mapping make the assumption that objects in the environment are detectable from all angles. However, glass and other specular surfaces are invisible to LIDAR at most angles and so become washed out as \u201cnoise\u201d. We modify the standard occupancy grid algorithm to allow for mapping objects that are only visible from certain view angles, by tracking the subset of angles from which objects are reliably visible. We show that these angles can be determined reliably with a single pass through the environment, and that the information can be used to map both diffuse and specular surfaces.",

The viewpoint planner is used for the guard robot to watch a certain object such as human continuously. Rather than continuously follows the object, moving the guard robot using the viewpoint planner has many benefits such as reducing the movement and the energy used by the robot. Our viewpoint planner exploits the topology feature of the environment, which is extracted using a skeletonization technique to get a set of viewpoints. We search for escaping gaps from which the target may go out of the robot's sight, and make the movement model of the target and the robot to determine the predicted time of the worst case escape of the target. We then plan the action for the robot based on the geodesic model and escaping gaps. Simulation results using 3D simulator are provided to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our algorithm.",

The feedback signals computed for the unicycle are transformed to inputs that are suited for the locomotion system of the humanoid, producing a natural, human-like behavior. Experimental results for the humanoid robot NAO are presented to show the validity of the approach, and in particular the successful extension of the controller to turns and junctions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a vision-based path following algorithm for a non-holonomic wheeled platform capable of keeping the vehicle on a desired path using only a single camera. The algorithm is suitable for teach and replay or leader-follower implementations where the desired path is represented by a collection of images obtained along the path. The algorithm makes use of the 1D trifocal tensor to estimate parameters required for the path following controller through a structure from motion approach. Our algorithm provides the benefits of a position-based visual servoing method without having to explicitly recover the 3D structure of the environment. By using the trifocal tensor, the proposed algorithm overcomes several problems usually associated with visual servoing techniques. The singularities commonly encountered with image-based visual servoing and epipolar methods are eliminated; and the unknown scale problem is also resolved by incorporating the scale into the control parameters. This simultaneously removes the velocity dependence of the controller gains and the need for odometric sensors on the platform. In addition, we also propose a novel method of resolving the ambiguities often associated with structure from motion when using the 1D trifocal tensor. The proposed algorithm is validated using both simulated and experimental results where robustness to a large degree of feature noise is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the development of a rotorcraft micro aerial vehicle (MAV) system capable of vision-based state estimation in complex environments. We pursue a systems solution for the hardware and software to enable autonomous flight with a small rotorcraft in complex indoor and outdoor environments using only onboard vision and inertial sensors. As rotorcrafts frequently operate in hover or nearhover conditions, we propose a vision-based state estimation approach that does not drift when the vehicle remains stationary. The vision-based estimation approach combines the advantages of monocular vision (range, faster processing) with that of stereo vision (availability of scale and depth information), while overcoming several disadvantages of both. Specifically, our system relies on fisheye camera images at 25 Hz and imagery from a second camera at a much lower frequency for metric scale initialization and failure recovery. This estimate is fused with IMU information to yield state estimates at 100 Hz for feedback control. We show indoor experimental results with performance benchmarking and illustrate the autonomous operation of the system in challenging indoor and outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel vision-based teleoperation control framework for a team of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Our control law allows a remote human user to teleoperate the team with some useful haptic feedback, while also ensuring the UAV-UGV coordination via the camera installed on the UAV (and seeing the UGV) and the velocity limitation of the UGV. For this, we first elucidate a geometric condition for the UAV and UGV velocities to ensure the UAV-UGV coordination by driving the image feature of the UGV to converge to a desired one on the image surface, while also guaranteeing that the UGV's velocity, which is often much slower than that of the UAV, is under a certain specified bound. The UAV is then tele-controlled to track the teleoperation command as close as possible, yet, only to the extent permissible by this geometric condition. Simulation is performed to illustrate the theory.",

This paper presents a new vision-based controller for controlling a nonholonomic mobile robot to track a desired trajectory without directly measuring its position. A novel adaptive estimator is embedded into this new controller to estimate global position of the mobile robot online using natural visual features measured by a vision system, and its orientation and velocity measured by odometry/inertia/magnetic sensors. It is proved by Lyapunov theory that the proposed controller gives rise to asymptotic tracking of a desired trajectory and convergence of the position estimation to the actual position.

        "abstract": "We investigate a new approach to vision based mapping, in which single image structure recognition is used to derive strong priors for initialisation of higher-level primitives in the map. This can reduce state size and speed up the building of more meaningful maps. We focus on plane mapping and use a recognition algorithm to detect and estimate the 3D orientation of planar structures in key frames, which are then used as priors for initialising planes in the map. The recognition algorithm learns the relationship between such structure and appearance from training examples offline. We demonstrate the approach in the context of an EKF based visual odometry system. Preliminary results of experiments in urban environments show that the system is able to build large maps with significant planar structure at average frames rates of around 60 fps whilst maintaining good trajectory estimation. The results suggest that the approach has considerable potential.",

        "abstract": "The estimation of human attention has recently been addressed in the context of human robot interaction. Today, joint work spaces already exist and challenge cooperating systems to jointly focus on common objects, scenes and work niches. With the advent of Google glasses and increasingly affordable wearable eye-tracking, monitoring of human attention will soon become ubiquitous. The presented work describes for the first time a method for the estimation of human fixations in 3D environments that does not require any artificial landmarks in the field of view and enables attention mapping in 3D models. It enables full 3D recovery of the human view frustum and the gaze pointer in a previously acquired 3D model of the environment in real time. The study on the precision of this method reports a mean projection error \u22481.1 cm and a mean angle error \u22480.6\u00b0 within the chosen 3D model - the precision does not go below the one of the technical instrument (\u22481\u00b0) This innovative methodology will open new opportunities for joint attention studies as well as for bringing new potential into automated processing for human factors technologies.",

For this, the hand controller takes top priority. The head controller is designed to keep both the hand and object in the eye field of view. For robustness, a secondary task of joint limit avoidance is implemented using the redundancy framework and a large projection operator proposed recently. For safety, joint velocity scaling is implemented. The implementation on REEM is done using the ROS and ViSP middleware. The results presented show simulations on Gazebo and experiments on the real robot. Furthermore, results with the real robot show how visual servoing is able to overcome some deficiency in REEM's kinematic calibration.",

The dynamics of a quadrotor is unique in that a dual axis accelerometer mounted parallel to the propeller plane provides measurements that are directly proportional to vehicle velocities in that plane. By exploiting these dynamic characteristics, we show that all vehicle states, including the absolute scale, become observable in all motion patterns. This distinguishes our method with other visual-inertial fusion methods, which either assume zero accelerometer bias, or require \u201csufficiently exciting\u201d motion, such as non-zero acceleration, to ensure observability of the scale. The advantages of our method over existing visual-inertial fusion algorithms are proved through a theoretical analysis using Lie Derivatives and verified by extensive simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for visualizing comprehensive work tendency using a frequency plot map of the end-point of a manipulator as a fundamental study of work analysis using long-term data for human-operated work machines. A visualization system requires high generality and commonality to enable to extract various characteristics to be extracted on an arbitrary time scale independently of the work machine specifications, work contents and environment, and machine operator. The proposed framework meets this requirement by first creating a two-dimensional end-point plot map with its origin fixed at the yaw joint of the manipulator to deal with arbitrary usage conditions. It then extracts arbitrary characteristics by using hierarchical feature extraction filters, including binary, quantity, and advanced filters, defined by three kinds of essential data: operation, movement, and load. Finally, it quantifies the filtered map by gridding and normalization to visually grasp its frequency distribution. Two experiments in which the work environments and completion time differed were conducted using an instrumented hydraulic arm. Results indicated that the comprehensive work tendency revealed by using the proposed framework corresponds to the actual work results independently of the various conditions.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in physically interactive and surgical robotics, the active deformation of compliant objects remains an open problem. The main obstacle comes from the difficulty to identify/estimate the object's deformation properties. This paper presents a new visually servoed deformation controller for unknown elastic objects. The control law is designed using the passivity-based framework. The proposed method exploits visual feedback to iteratively estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, avoiding any identification steps. We prove that even in the presence of inexact estimations, the controller ensures input-to-state stability (i.e. dissipativity) with respect to time-varying disturbances. Finally, an experimental study with several deformation tasks is presented to validate the theory.",

        "abstract": "The paper aims at building a computer vision system for automatic image labeling in robotics scenarios. We show that the weak supervision provided by a human demonstrator, through the exploitation of the independent motion, enables a realistic Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and achieves an automatic image labeling. We start by reviewing the underlying principles of our previous method for egomotion compensation [1], then we extend our approach removing the dependency on a known kinematics in order to provide a general method for a wide range of devices. From sparse salient features we predict the egomotion of the camera through a heteroscedastic learning method. Subsequently we use an object recognition framework for testing the automatic image labeling process: we rely on the State of the Art method from Yang et al. [2], employing local features augmented through a sparse coding stage and classified with linear SVMs. The application has been implemented and validated on the iCub humanoid robot and experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contribution of the paper is twofold: first we overcome the dependency on the kinematics in the independent motion detection method, secondly we present a practical application for automatic image labeling through a natural HRI.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "People tend to unconsciously attribute personality traits to all kinds of technology including robots. But what personality do they want robots to have? Previous research has found support for two contradicting theories: similarity attraction and complementary attraction. The similarity attraction theory implies that people prefer a robot with a similar personality to their own (e.g., an extroverted person prefers an extroverted robot). According to the complementary attraction theory, people prefer a robot's personality opposite to their own (e.g., extroverted people prefer an introverted robot). In contrast to both theories, we argue that what is considered an appropriate personality for a robot depends on the task context. In a 2\u00d72 between-groups experiment (N=45), we found trends that indicated similarity attraction for extrovert participants when the robot was a tour guide and complementary attraction for introverted participants when the robot was a cleaner. These trends show that preferences for robot personalities may indeed depend on the context of the robot's role and the stereotype perceptions people hold for certain jobs. Robot behaviors likely need to be adapted not in complimentary or similarity to the users' personality but to the users' expectations about what kind of personality and behaviors are consistent with such a task or role.",

Significant allowances for tuning, coupled with careful implementation of a broad phase collision detection scheme is required to make dynamic simulation useful for practical applications. A recently developed formulation method is presented herein that is more robust, and not dependent on broad-phase collision detection or system tuning for its behavior. Several uncomplicated benchmark examples are presented to give an analysis and make a comparison of the new Polyhedral Exact Geometry time-stepping method with the well-known Stewart-Trinkle time-stepping method. The behavior and performance for the two methods are discussed. This includes specific cases where contemporary time-steppers fail, and how they are ameliorated by the new method presented here. The goal of this work is to complete the groundwork for further research into high performance simulation.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid service robots performing complex object manipulation tasks need to plan whole-body motions that satisfy a variety of constraints: The robot must keep its balance, self-collisions and collisions with obstacles in the environment must be avoided and, if applicable, the trajectory of the end-effector must follow the constrained motion of a manipulated object in Cartesian space. These constraints and the high number of degrees of freedom make whole-body motion planning for humanoids a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an approach to whole-body motion planning with a focus on the manipulation of articulated objects such as doors and drawers. Our approach is based on rapidly-exploring random trees in combination with inverse kinematics and considers all required constraints during the search. Models of articulated objects hereby generate hand poses for sampled configurations along the trajectory of the object handle. We thoroughly evaluated our planning system and present experiments with a Nao humanoid opening a drawer, a door, and picking up an object. The experiments demonstrate the ability of our framework to generate solutions to complex planning problems and furthermore show that these plans can be reliably executed even on a low-cost humanoid platform.",

A Gaussian distribution is used to determine uncertainty in the time-varying wind fields. We use a Markov Decision Process to plan a path based upon the uncertainty of the Gaussian distribution. Simulation results are presented to compare the direct line of flight between a start and target point with our planned path for energy consumption and time of travel. The result of our method is a robust path using the most visited cell while sampling the Gaussian distribution of the wind field in each cell.",

        "abstract": "Palpating tissues and organs to identify hidden tumors or to detect buried vessels is not a viable option in laparoscopic surgery due to lack of force feedback. So far, research toward restoring tactile and kinesthetic sensations in minimally invasive surgery has focused on the distal sensing element or on the proximal rendering of haptic cues. In this work we present a pilot study to assess the feasibility of wireless tissue palpation, where a magnetic device is deployed through a standard surgical trocar and operated to perform tissue palpation without requiring a dedicated entry port. The setup consists of a wireless intra-body device and an external robotic manipulator holding a load cell and a permanent magnet. Embedded in the wireless cylindrical device (12.7 mm in diameter and 27.5 mm in height) is a sensing module, a wireless microcontroller, a battery and a permanent magnet. This preliminary study assessed the precision in reconstructing the indentation depth based on magnetic field measurements at the wireless device (i.e., 0.1 mm accuracy). Experimental trials demonstrated the effectiveness of wireless vertical indentation in detecting the elastic modulus of three different silicone tissue simulators (elastic modulus ranging from 50 kPa to 93 kPa), showing a maximum relative error below 3%. Finally, wireless palpation was used to identify differences in tissue stiffness from a lump embedded into a porcine liver. The reported results have the potential to open a new paradigm in the field of palpation devices, where direct physical connection across the abdominal wall is no longer required.",

        "abstract": "Roboticists are faced with new challenges in robotic-based manufacturing. Up to now manufacturing operations that require both high stiffness and accuracy have been mainly realized with computer numerical control machine tools. This paper aims to show that manufacturing finishing tasks can be performed with robotic cells knowing the process cutting conditions and the robot stiffness throughout its Cartesian workspace. It makes sense that the finishing task of large parts should be cheaper with robots. However, machining robots have not been adapted for such operations yet. As a consequence, this paper introduces a methodology that aims to determine the best placement of the workpiece to be machined knowing the elastostatic model of the robot and the cutting forces exerted on the tool. Therefore, a machining quality criterion is proposed and an optimization problem is formulated and solved. The KUKA KR270-2 robot is used as an illustrative example throughout the paper.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of worst-case performance by a mobile sensor network (MSN) when some of the nodes in the network fail. We formulate the problem as a game in which some subset of the nodes act in an adversarial manner, choosing their motion strategies to maximally degrade overall performance of the network as a whole. We restrict our attention in the present paper to a target detection problem in which the goal is to minimize the probability of missed detection. We use a partitioned cost function that is minimized when each sensor executes a motion strategy given by Lloyd's algorithm (i.e., each agent moves toward the centroid of its Voronoi partition at each time instant), and when the probability of missed detection for each functioning sensor increases with the distance between sensor and target for correctly functioning sensors; adversarial nodes in the network are unable to detect the target, and move to maximally increase the probability of missed detection by the properly functioning sensors. We pose the problem as a multi-stage decision process, and use forward dynamic programming over a finite horizon to numerically compute optimal strategies for the adversaries. We compare the resulting strategies to a greedy algorithm, providing both system trajectories and evolution of the probability of missed detection during execution.",
