        "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated framework for recognizing 3D human posture from 2D images. A flexible combinational algorithm motivated by the novel view expressed by Cyr and Kimia (2004) is proposed to generate the aspects of 3D human postures as the posture prototype using features extracted from the collected 2D images sampled at random intervals from the viewing sphere. Frequency and phase information of the posture are calculated from the Fourier descriptors (FDs) of the sampled points on the posture contour as the main and assistant features to extract the characteristic views as the aspects. Moreover, a modified particle filter is applied to improve the robustness of human posture recognition for continuous monitoring. Experimental trials on synthetic and real sequences have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "For the Oxford Aerial Tracking System (OATS) we are developing a robot helicopter that can track moving ground objects. Here we describe algorithms for the device to perform path planning and trajectory prediction. The path planner uses superquadratic potential fields and incorporates a height change mechanism that is triggered where necessary and in order to avoid local minima traps. The goal of the trajectory prediction system is to reliably predict the target trajectory during occlusion caused by ground obstacles. For this we use two artificial neural networks in parallel whose retraining is automatically triggered if major changes in the target behaviour pattern are detected. Simulation results for both systems are presented.",

        "abstract": "Fully autonomous control of ultra-light indoor airplanes has not yet been achieved because of the strong limitations on the kind of sensors that can be embedded making it difficult to obtain good estimations of altitude. We propose to revisit altitude control by considering it as an obstacle avoidance problem and introduce a novel control scheme where the ground and ceiling is avoided based on translatory optic flow, in a way similar to existing vision-based wall avoidance strategies. We show that this strategy is successful at controlling a simulated microflyer without any explicit altitude estimation and using only simple sensors and processing that have already been embedded in an existing 10-gram microflyer. This result is thus a significant step toward autonomous control of indoor flying robots.",

        "abstract": "In medical diagnostic imaging, an X-ray CT scanner or a MRI system have been widely used to examine 3D shapes or internal structures of living organisms or bones. However, these apparatuses are generally very expensive and of large size. A prior arrangement is also required before an examination, and thus, it is not suitable for an urgent fracture diagnosis in emergency treatment. This paper proposes a method to estimate a patient-specific 3D shape of a femur from only two fluoroscopic images using a parametric femoral model. Firstly, we develop a parametric femoral model by statistical analysis of a number of 3D femoral shapes created from CT images of 51 patients. Then, the pose and shape parameters of the parametric model are estimated from two 2D fluoroscopic images using a distance map constructed by the level set method. Experiments using synthesized images and fluoroscopic images of a phantom femur are successfully carried out and the usefulness of the proposed method is verified.",

The proposed method allows real-time haptic interaction even in the case of classical molecular simulation which implies notoriously long computation time. These simulations are classically used by the pharmaceutical industry (Sanofi-Aventis) and are based on the energetic description of atoms to estimate the interaction between a ligand and a protein. The haptic control scheme uses wave variables for a stable and robust teleoperation, and a transcription of the calculated energy into forces and torques for the manipulation of a flexible ligand around the binding site of a flexible molecule. This method can then be used with any energetic force field using a minimization process, thus avoiding the fastidious optimization of molecular simulation programs.",

It is equipped with sensors and electronics to achieve phototaxis, which can be seen as a minimal level of control autonomy. A novel 0.2g Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator for steering control has been specifically designed and integrated to keep the overall weight as low as possible. In order to characterize autonomous operation of this robot, we developed an experimental setup consisting of a launching device and a light source positioned 1m below and 4m away with varying angles with respect to the launching direction. Statistical analysis of 36 autonomous flights demonstrate its flight and phototaxis efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the control of locomotion in a robot hexapod. The approach is based on the WalkNet structure, which in turn is based on the neural control structure of the insect Carausius morosus. Though the WalkNet structure has been shown to function well in kinematic (i.e., non-dynamic) simulations, the authors found that the approach to coordinated control of hexapedal locomotion entailed several significant problems when simulated in the presence of dynamic effects, including gravitational effects, inertial dynamics, and ground contact dynamics. As such, the authors propose several variations on the WalkNet structure that provides stable and robust locomotion in the presence of dynamics, while still maintaining the attributes of WalkNet coordinated control, including self-selection of gait and associated emergent behaviors. The approach is simulated in the presence of dynamics and shown to provide stable gait with emergent characteristics.",

The system switches among CBR behaviours depending on a local grid built around the robot from sonar sensor readings. The main advantage of the proposed system is that it can easily adapt to any robot and environment, learning, both by training and by its own experience. The method has been successfully tested in real environments with a Pioneer robot equipped with 8 frontal sonar sensors.",

We consider robot joints that implement the variable impedance actuation (VIA) paradigm. The VIA has been demonstrated to be an effective mean to achieve high performance while constantly keeping injury risks to humans by accidental impacts below a given threshold. The paper describe possible implementations of the VIA concept which use the Antagonistic Actuation (AA) in three different arrangements. This study follows a previously reported paper dealing with safety. Here a detailed comparative dependability and performability analysis in front of possible specific failure modes is conducted, whose results provide additional and useful guidelines for design of safe and dependable actuation systems for physical human-robot interaction.",

In the first approach, the perceptual processing is primarily bottom-up, with visual object recognition entirely preceding localization. In the second, significant top-down information is incorporated, with vision and localization being intertwined. That is, the processing of vision is highly dependent on the robot's estimate of its location. The two approaches are implemented and tested on a Sony Aibo ERS-7 robot, localizing as it walks through a color-coded test-bed domain. This paper's contributions are an exposition of two different approaches to vision and localization on a mobile robot, an empirical comparison of the two methods, and a discussion of the relative advantages of each method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach that enables heterogeneous robots to automatically form groups as needed to generate both strongly-cooperative and weakly-cooperative multi-robot task solutions in the same application. The fundamental contribution of this work is the layering of our low-level coalition formation algorithm for generating strongly-cooperative task solutions, with high-level, traditional task allocation methods for weakly-cooperative task solutions. At the low level, coalitions that generate strongly-cooperative multi-robot task solutions are formed using our ASyMTRe-D approach that maps environmental sensors and perceptual and motor schemas to the required flow of information in the robot team, automatically reconfiguring the connections of schemas within and across robots to form efficient solutions. At the high level, a traditional task allocation approach is used to enable individual robots and/or coalitions to compete for weakly-cooperative task assignments through task allocation. We introduce the site clearing task to motivate the work, and then formalize the problem. We then present the approach of layering ASyMTRe-D with task allocation. We validate the approach on a team of robots with the site clearing task. We believe the resulting approach is a flexible system that can handle a broad range of realistic multi-robot applications beyond what is possible using other existing approaches.",

The methods of route generation for WMRs usually utilize complex algorithms, which require global information of the workspace or mapping of the nearby environment. Hence they are not very efficient for formation based motion of large collections of small entry-level agents. In this work a path generation method is developed for synthesizing non-holonomic paths for small unicycle WMRs, and then is integrated into simple geometrical formations for extension to navigation of relatively large groups of small agents. Our technique is based on a computationally low-cost algorithm; and works effectively for transfer of many robots in obstacle cluttered environments. The efficiency of our technique is verified by simulation results.",

        "abstract": "One of the main elements of probabilistic localization and SLAM is the probabilistic sensor model (also known as the observation likelihood function). However, when dealing with very accurate sensors like laser range scanners, most approaches artificially inflate the uncertainty in the range measurements and assume conditional independence between the individual ranges of the scan to compute this likelihood function. In this paper we propose an alternative method where each sample in the scan can contribute an accurate estimation according to both its real uncertainty and its compatible correspondences with a given map. These likelihood values of individual measurements are fused via a linear opinion pool (LOP), a method from consensus theory. Our approach results in a more precise likelihood function than others and excels in robustness in dynamic environments. To validate our research we provide systematic comparisons with other proposals in the context of localization with particle filters.",

This multilevel approach allows the management of complementary and redundant data which come from two perception systems: an omnidirectional vision sensor and a laser telemeter. The originality of this architecture is its ability to manage and propagate uncertainties from low level data until a high level information of danger given to the driver. The first part concerns the data sensor. The second part deals with the quantification of the uncertainties of the detected vehicles, followed by a determination of situations of danger and the evaluation of their level of dangerousness with the aim of supplying the driver with an indicator of global danger around the vehicle.",

Such decision-based search tasks are relevant to many research areas, including mobile robot missions, visual search and attention, and event detection in sensor networks. The effect of control strategies in search problems on decision-making quantities, namely time-to-decision, is investigated in this work. We present a Bayesian framework in which the objective is to improve the decision, rather than the sensing, using different control policies. Furthermore, derivations of closed-form expressions governing the evolution of the belief function are also presented. As this framework enables the study and comparison of the role of control for decision-making applications, the derived theoretical results provide greater insight into the sequential processing of decisions. Numerical studies are presented to verify and demonstrate these results",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of the pose recovery of a straight homogeneous circular cylinder (SHCC) from its apparent contour in a single 2-D image. In many real-world situations, one may encounter cylindrical objects especially in man-made structures. Object models based on surfaces of revolution, in particular cylinders, are suitable for many fields, like the automatic assembly, the human motion capture and also in medical image-based robotic guidance. To model the geometry of a SHCC, we first introduce a singular matrix which represents this degenerate quadric and we show it can be expressed with the Plucker coordinates of its symmetry axis. We demonstrate that the perspective projection of a SHCC is related to the pose parameters and for this model-based pose estimation problem, we present a degenerate conic-based fitting method which has some connections with the estimation of the fundamental matrix. We provide a closed-form solution for the pose determination (4 dof). Compared to earlier works in this field, the proposed approach exhibits some geometric properties of SHCCs, it can deal with partial occlusions of apparent contours and it provides an efficient direct pose solution for the symmetry axis. Simulated data and real images are used to validate the fitting and pose computation. Finally, to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method to deal with apparent contours in a poor structured environment, we apply this work to the localization of instruments used in laparoscopic surgery.",

The purpose of such a device is to compensate a surgeon for a portion of the loss of haptic and tactile feedback experienced during robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Initially, a testing facility for validating the concept ex-vivo was developed and used to characterize two different testing modalities - static (1-DOF) tissue indentation and rolling (2-DOF) tissue indentation. As part of the static indentation experiments a mathematical model was developed to classify tissue condition based on changes in mechanical response. The purpose of the rolling indentation tests was to detect tissue abnormalities, such as tumors, which are difficult to isolate under static testing conditions. During such tests, the test-rig was capable of detecting simulated miniature buried masses at depths of 12mm. Based on these experiments a portable device capable of carrying out similar tests in-vivo was developed. The device was designed to be operated through a trocar port and its key feature is the ability to transition between static indentation and rolling indentation modalities without retracting and changing the tool.",

With respect to classical methods for numerical evolution of optimal feedback synthesis via dynamic programming which are based on both input and state discretization, our method exploits the lattice structure naturally imposed on the reachable set by input quantization. A generalized Dijkstra algorithm can be used to obtain sub-optimal (optimal up to the lattice resolution) feedback laws, for chained-form vehicles with n-trailers, in an effective way.",

The drawbacks of the traditional weighting method in optimization for generating the Pareto optimal set are discussed and an alternate approach using dynamic programming is proposed. The two approaches are implemented on the model of a 7-DOF redundant manipulator with the end-effector moving along a prescribed trajectory, while the joint trajectories are required to minimize two particular criteria. The results illustrate that the dynamic programming approach provides a better approximation of the Pareto optimal set and a more flexible and predictable framework to control the objective vectors.",

Only the information of the upper bound of system knowledge is required to select the suitable scaling factors and coefficients of sliding surface for the proposed controller so that an acceptable performance is achieved. Since the target car is dynamic and the tracking car possesses dynamics, a grey prediction for the pose of the target car is employed to plan an effective reference command for the tracking car to enhance the performance of target tracking.

The mechanism of FRT is so simple that it only needs a urethane flat tube and some water pressure. No valves or switches are required. Applying constant water pressure results in periodic oscillation of the tube. The frequency is proportional to the flow rate of the water and inversely proportional to the tube length. By contacting the tube with a motor shaft, the motor rotates due to the periodic tube oscillation. Thus, we succeeded in rotating the motor without using any electricity. There are many possible applications with FRT, and we are developing a wearable massage device which makes people feel comfortable and improves their circulation of the blood.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm for haptic interaction with an adaptive simulation of articulated-body dynamics. Our algorithm has a multi-threaded structure, which allows us to separate the force feedback computation from the adaptive dynamics simulation. The algorithm we propose for force feedback computation has a logarithmic complexity in the number of degrees of freedom in the articulated body. We have implemented our approach and tested it on a 3.0GHz dual processor Xeon PC. The preliminary benchmarks presented here demonstrate that our multi-threaded approach, as well as the logarithmic complexity of the force feedback computation, allow us to interact in a stable way with large articulated bodies that have complex dynamics (such as articulated-body models of proteins). Whatever the update rate of the adaptive simulation loop, the force feedback computation is performed in a few tens of microseconds.",

The framework consists of i) a feasibility test, and ii) a comparison methodology using prioritized task dependent performance objectives. This framework is applied to a bilateral teleoperation system including an uncertain human operator and environment in a practical case study. The validity of the proposed quantitative framework is confirmed through experiments. The proposed framework can be used as a tool to design bilateral teleoperation systems, especially when there are constraints in designing drive mechanisms and choosing sensory configurations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design of an anthropomorphic 21 degree-of-freedom, 9 degree-of-actuation arm prosthesis for use by transhumeral amputees. The design leverages the power density of pneumatic actuation with the energy density of liquid propellants to obtain a self-powered dexterous prosthesis in which all of the requisite power, actuation, and sensing is packaged within the volumetric envelope of a normal human arm. Specifically, the arm utilizes a monopropellant as a gas generator to power nine pneumatic-type actuators that drive an elbow, three wrist degrees-of-freedom, and a 17 degree-of-freedom compliant hand. The design considerations discussed in this work include the design of compact, low-power servovalves; the choice of actuators based on energetic requirements of a normal arm; the design of compact elbow and wrist joints with integrated position and force sensing; and the components of the compliant hand design. The liquid-fueled prosthesis is expected to approach the dexterity of an anatomical arm and is projected to deliver half of the force and power output of an average human arm.",

Our extensions greatly increase the flexibility with which teammates can both plan and coordinate with each other; consequently, we can apply Hoplites to a wider range of domains and plan coordination between robots more efficiently. We apply our framework to the constrained exploration domain and compare Hoplites in simulation to competing distributed and centralized approaches. Our results demonstrate that Hoplites significantly outperforms both approaches in terms of the quality of solutions produced while remaining computationally competitive with much simpler approaches. We further demonstrate features such as scalability and validate our approach with field results from a team of large autonomous vehicles performing constrained exploration in an outdoor environment",

We show that the geometry of the formation imposes a bound on the maximum admissible curvature of leader trajectory. A peculiar feature of the proposed strategy is that the followers position is not rigidly fixed with respect to the leader reference frame but varies in suitable cones centered in the leader reference frame. Our approach also applies to hierarchical multirobot formations described by rooted tree graphs. Simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.",

Our main contribution is to establish the global asymptotic stability of the controlled system by using Lyapunov direct method and LaSalle's invariance principle. We provide explicit conditions on the regulator gains to ensure global asymptotic stability. The proposed controller does not utilize the modeling information in the control formulation, and thus permits easy implementation.

The system helps emulate a real ultrasound examination condition at hospital, which is enhanced with augmented CT and/or MRI images.

The compliance and damping of natural muscles plays an important role in natural human gait. Conducting polymers actuators and other smart structure actuators can store energy by means of inherent mechanical compliance that traditional DC motor actuators do not possess. This paper presents a method for optimizing the inherent compliance and damping of the actuators in order to minimize the active control effort required to generate a natural human gait. A simplified kinematic model of the design is evaluated using biomechanical joint angle and ground reaction force (GRF) data to yield the desired force versus displacement characteristics of the posterior and dorsal actuators. Numerical simulations illustrate the multifunctional nature of the PPy actuators and the overall power requirements of the system during the stance phase of walking gait.",

        "abstract": "Localisation is one of the most important tasks to be accomplished in order to realize the complete autonomy of a mobile robot. In this paper, a new strategy for global localisation is proposed. Applying this method a robot is able to safely initialise its position or relocalise itself in case of recovery of pose tracking failure. The algorithm presented adopts a hybrid approach. First a particle filter is used to generate hypotheses on the possible pose supposing that no movements are allowed to avoid collisions. Thereafter safe trajectories are planned and executed to reduce the remaining ambiguities while the hypotheses are monitored and validated by a set of parallel extended Kalman filters. The novelty of this approach stands on the ability to generate the pose hypotheses without any feature-based knowledge. As a consequence, a landmark-based description of the environment is no longer required for the algorithm execution.",

Modeling this motion, which is only dynamically stable, is of importance for legged robot operation and for quadrupedal animal motion estimation. Derived from an eight-step galloping cycle, this study presents a kinetic hybrid model in which the states vary based on the principal forces present. As compared to foot contact, or kinematic, hybrid quadruped models this reduces the maximum number of possible states from 120 to 6 and provides an alternative to foot contact monitoring. This approach was tested on a trotting quadruped robot equipped with an inertial sensor aided by video. This was processed using an EKF estimator framework to give attitude estimates at rates of up to 250 Hz with 5deg error.",

        "abstract": "The microinjection is a common technique in genetic engineering for transferring genetic material into a cell. It is normally performed on a micromanipulation system that usually consists of an inverted microscope, a micromanipulator, a micropipette and an injector. Manual microinjection is a conventional and widespread practice. However, this approach suffers from low success rate, poor efficiency, and high probability of contamination. We have developed a micromanipulation system for automatic batch microinjection by automating the key process of penetration in a microinjection. The microinjection system automatically identifies and penetrates each embryo/cell with a constant and fast speed, and in doing so, eliminates the possibility of contamination caused by manual operations. The effectiveness of this force-controlled system has been experimentally demonstrated in the tasks of automatic identification and penetration zebrafish embryos, which are widely used as a model for studying vertebrate development and genetics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper deals with the visual servoing of textured surfaces inside the human abdomen with a laparoscope for the robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The well-known image-based visual servoing (IBVS) is one of the most common approaches used for model-based servoing. When no CAD model is available, the efficient second-order minimization (ESM) tracking developed by Malis (2002, 2004) for grey-level images is one of the powerful recent techniques which is extended here to color images so as to handle occluded parts of the region of interest (ROI). Firstly, the ROI is splitted into small areas and a histogram-based color feature comparison of image areas is presented. For each frame and for each area, a metric based on the Bhattacharyya criterion is used to select the contributing areas for the computation of the planar homography between views. Secondly, since for any MIS technique, the endoscopic lens is passing through an insertion point on the abdominal wall, a specific control strategy is developed to perform the ESM tracking with a 4-DOF surgical robot. The method presented in this paper has been validated with several video sequences. Experimental results show that the tracking method is efficient even with more than 75 % of the tracked ROI occluded. Finally, the model-free visual servoing has been performed with the AESOP surgical robot and a training box. Even if the convergence rate is a little bit slow, the desired region is always reached.",

However, the lack of haptic feedback in these robotic systems using long teleoperated instruments has negatively affected the surgeon's ability to palpate tissue and diagnose it as healthy or unhealthy. This paper describes our design of a modular, automated laparoscopic grasper with tri-directional force measurement capability. The grasper can measure normal grasping forces, as well as, sideways manipulation forces during grasping and palpation tasks. Additionally, a modular design allows for easy conversion between surgical modalities (e.g., grasping, cutting, and dissecting). Calibration of the force sensors and initial testing of the prototype has shown its ability to accurately measure tool-tissue interaction forces.",

Completion of tasks such as exploration of unknown or hazardous environments often requires discrete changes in the controls and motions of the robot in order to adapt to different terrains or maintain operability during partial failures or other mishaps. The contribution of this work toward this objective is the development of an efficient motion planner for a hybrid robotic system. The controls and motion equations of the robot could change discretely in order to enable the robot to operate in different terrains. The framework in this paper blends discrete searching with sampling-based motion planning for continuous state spaces and is well-suited for robotic systems modeled as hybrid systems with numerous discrete modes and transitions. This multi-layered approach offers considerable improvements over existing methods addressing similar problems, as indicated by the experimental results.",

The primary contribution of this work is the derivation of a measurement model that is able to express the geometric constraints that arise when a static feature is observed from multiple camera poses. This measurement model does not require including the 3D feature position in the state vector of the EKF and is optimal, up to linearization errors. The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we propose has computational complexity only linear in the number of features, and is capable of high-precision pose estimation in large-scale real-world environments. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in extensive experimental results, involving a camera/IMU system localizing within an urban area.",

        "abstract": "High-fidelity haptic interaction in multi-user environments over general Ethernet-based local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN) can be challenging but has promising applications. Under typical network traffic conditions, the 1kHz real-time control rate suggested in the literature for stable haptic simulation is well above that achievable by conventional network protocols such as the UDP and TCP/IP. To overcome this limitation, a decentralized multi-rate control approach is proposed in which local force-feedback loops are executed at higher rates than data packet transmission between the user workstations. Mathematical models for stability and performance analysis of such multi-rate haptic control systems are presented. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate improved performance and stability for the distributed control architecture when compared with a centralized controller.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "By active stereo we mean a stereo vision system that allows for independent panning and tilting for each of the two cameras. One advantage of active stereo in relation to regular stereo is the former's wider effective field of view; if an object is too close to the camera baseline, the depth to the object can still be estimated accurately by panning the cameras appropriately. Another advantage of active stereo is that it can yield a larger number of depth measurements simultaneously for each position of the platform on which the camera system is mounted. Panning and tilting over a large angular range, while being the main reason for the advantages of active stereo, also make it more challenging to calibrate such systems. For a calibration procedure to be effective for active stereo, the estimated parameters must be valid over the entire range of the pan and tilt angles. This paper presents a new approach to the calibration of such vision systems. Our method is based on the rationale that an active stereo calibration procedure must explicitly estimate the locations and the orientations of the pan and tilt rotating axes for the cameras through a closed-form solution. When these estimates for the axes are combined with the homogeneous transform relationships that link the various coordinate frames, we end with a calibration that is valid over a large variation in the pan and tilt angles.",

        "abstract": "Most successful works in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) aim to build a metric map under a probabilistic viewpoint employing Bayesian filtering techniques. This work introduces a new hybrid metric-topological approach, where the aim is to reconstruct the path of the robot in a hybrid continuous-discrete state space which naturally combines metric and topological maps. Our fundamental contributions are: (i) the estimation of the topological path, an improvement similar to that of Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) and FastSLAM in the field of metric map building; and (ii) the application of grounded methods to the abstraction of topology (including loop closure) from raw sensor readings. It is remarkable that our approach could be still represented as a Bayesian inference problem, becoming an extension of purely metric SLAM. Besides providing the formal definitions and the basics for our approach, we also describe a practical implementation aimed to real-time operation. Promising experimental results mapping large environments with multiple nested loops (~30.000 m2, ~2Km robot path) validate our work.",

An important part of calibration process is measuring the actual pose of some parts of the robot. Many sensors have been used for measuring, for some of them, extra objects need installing on the robot, so it's possible to implement extra accuracy problems. While choosing coordinate measure machine as the measure equipment, a new pose measure method is proposed. The major advantage of this method is neither extra objects nor definite points are needed, so it's more feasible to realize the coordinate measure machine's strength. The planes for calibration can be directly machined on the end-effector, so the assembly errors are avoided completely.

Since solder paste inspection systems usually occupy a large space in vertical direction, we designed a mirror box that can re-direct the transmission of fringe pattern. In this way, a new parallel solder paste inspection device with a significant reduction in the vertical constraint is developed. We also developed a hybrid weighting algorithm that applied the distance and fringe contrast to acquire the height of solder pastes. Furthermore, we developed an algorithm that generates the 2-D image from the fringe pattern images during the 4-steps algorithm. It gives benefit (time for solder paste inspection) to traditional approach that uses some special lighting systems to create the 2-D image. Experimental results show our device can inspect the 20mm times 20mm PCB area within 2 seconds and the maximum standard deviation for the average height is 3 mum.",

This paper proposes a bilateral teleoperation system for spinal fusion, BiTESS-II, to accomplish the goals. We developed an end effector that can substitute the surgeon's manual operation and a novel closed-loop type slave robot that can exert strong reaction force to complete gimleting and screwing tasks. Master devices are used to control the position and orientation of the slave robot and to generate haptic information identical to that of the slave side. A novel force reflection method without force sensors allowed to design the end effector simple and light. BiTESS-II is among the first human guided teleoperation system for spinal fusion with an adequate end effector. The performance of the BiTESS-II was verified by experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel flexural-based nano-positioning actuator that has a positioning accuracy of 10 nm (limited by encoder resolution) throughout a range of 3 mm. A new dual-magnet configuration is introduced to enhance this electromagnetically driven actuator in achieving 60 N/Amp in a compact configuration. In addition, a constant and evenly distributed magnetic flux density is obtained throughout 11 mm of air gap. A new mathematical model is presented to accurately predict the behavior of magnetic field within the effective air gap of this configuration. Complete analytical models for this actuator's electromagnetic drive and flexural-bearing support element are presented. Lastly, a prototype of this actuator is developed for validating the established analytical models and verifying the claimed capabilities.",

        "abstract": "The prostate is a small exocrine gland in men responsible for production of the liquid component of the seminal fluid. In North America, prostate cancer accounts for over 300,000 new cases and 40,000 deaths each year and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Low-dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy is gaining interest as a viable treatment option for prostate cancer due to its low side effects and high benefits. The present manual approach for brachytherapy needle insertion and the inherent flexibility of the needles make it extremely difficult to achieve accurate and consistent dosimetry. In this paper, we present a new 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator capable of performing percutaneous needle insertion. The manipulator can perform orientation, insertion and rotation of the needle and linear motion of the plunger to drop radioactive seeds at targeted locations. The manipulator is an integral part of a system utilizing a mechanically rotated side-fire transducer to create 3D ultrasound images of the organ and utilizing 3D SLICER software to visualize those images. Experiments conducted in agar phantoms reveal an average RMS targeting error of 1.45mm at an average insertion depth of 75.78mm proving the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed robotic system for percutaneous needle insertion.",

        "abstract": "Consider a biped evolving in the sagittal plane. The unexpected rotation of the supporting foot can be avoided by controlling the zero moment point or ZMP. The objective of this study is to propose and analyze a control strategy for simultaneously regulating the position of the ZMP and the joints of the robot. If the tracking requirements were posed in the time domain, the problem would be underactuated in the sense that the number of inputs would be less than the number of outputs. To get around this issue, the proposed controller is based on a path-following control strategy previously developed for dealing with the underactuation present in planar robots without actuated ankles. In particular, the control law is defined in such a way that only the kinematic evolution of the robot's state is regulated, but not its temporal evolution. The asymptotic temporal evolution of the robot is completely defined through a one degree of freedom subsystem of the closed-loop model. Simple analytical conditions, which guarantee the existence of a periodic motion and the convergence towards this motion, are deduced.",

Implementing such maneuvers in real-time entails heuristic controllers founded on a grasp of the dynamics. We present here an analysis of the mechanics of biped running and a control strategy for stable running. By expounding on the direction of the ground-reaction forces and utilizing an impulse representation of the contact phase, we present a tractable model of the mechanics. This model motivates the control strategy and provides a basis for extending the strategy to more general systems. The control strategy consists of a simple set of three rules, where the key rule considers the leg-length upon liftoff. This rule offers a simple control for both steady-state and accelerated running. We present the equilibrium running index as a characterization of biped running. It relates the parameters affecting running and has broad applicability to biological and robotic systems. The control strategy was verified in simulation and the results are presented.",

        "abstract": "Outside of the laboratory, accurate models of ground impact dynamics are either difficult or impossible to obtain. Instead, a rigid ground model is often used in gait and controller design, which simplifies the system model and allows attention to remain focused on other aspects of running. In real-world terrain this simplification may overlook important dynamic effects. Immediately following a foot touchdown event, sensitivity to ground stiffness is at its highest and at the same time the accuracies of state estimates are at their lowest. Even if ground stiffness is known and state estimates are accurate, actuator bandwidth limitations make immediate compensation difficult. Taking inspiration from nature, we propose a novel solution to attenuate the effects of unexpected ground stiffness changes using a unified control system comprised of hardware passive dynamics and open-loop software control policies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a physical implementation of random peer-to-peer (RP2P) communication for use in a multiple-robot system and analyze its performance. Traditionally, multiple-robot systems have either broadcast all of their inter-robot communication or have avoided explicit communication altogether. RP2P communication, on the other hand, allows efficient system-level communication while retaining the error-correction capabilities of peer-to-peer connections. We demonstrate that RP2P communication can be implemented with off-the-shelf components. MRS as large as ten robots are investigated and it is demonstrated that message rates as high as 50 messages/second are easily achievable using TCP connections and 802.11B wireless network interfaces.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a practical algorithm for evader detection and tracking using one or more pursuers. The solution employs two advanced data structures. The first one is the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT). It is constructed randomly but evenly distributed to generate a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space. The second data structure is the k-dimensional tree (Kd-Tree). Upon completion of the RRTs construction, their vertices are inserted in a Kd-Tree. At the tracking phase, the Kd-Tree will be queried repeatedly for retrieving the set of potential locations to be used by each pursuer in order to monitor or track an evader. Thus, the usage of the Kd-Tree will reduce the querying cost, during tracking, to a logarithmic time. A lazy collision detection strategy is used to resolve collisions with obstacles at runtime. As a result unnecessary checks are eliminated and hence improving the system performance. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

The primary concern of the paper is how to resolve the redundancy in the global configuration space when the movable joint angles are considerably restricted. First, a parameterized inverse kinematic solution for a 7 DOF manipulator model is derived. Second, how the joint limits affect the inverse kinematic solution is examined to explicitly identify the feasible solution under the joint limits. Then, an analytical redundancy resolution method for avoiding the joint limits is developed. Finally, kinematic simulations show that the method is effective for avoiding the joint limits as well as expanding the reachable region of the manipulator's tip.",

The types of exoskeletal assistive devices for such patients were categorized into several groups based on required functions which are derived from the patients' condition. One of the categories, \"joint motion compensator\" is a novel concept taking into consideration the difference between active-ROM (range of motion) and passive-ROM of joints, and with regard to one of subgroups of this category called \"joint motion amplifier\", a prototype device which amplifies the motion of index-finger PIP (proximal interphalangeal) joint was constructed and verification experiments for pinching objects were conducted. The results revealed that it was feasible to pick up and pinch objects which were not so small or thin enough to be picked without nails, and also was possible for the device to hold such objects as strongly as human hands do.",

Improvements of network distributed monitoring system using IEEE1394 cameras with high performance and high resolution have been done in order to extend the application of system. Robot technology middleware (RTM) was used in the developed system. By using RTM, we can develop cameras functional elements as \"RT software components\" that can be implemented by different programming languages, run in different operating system, or connected in different networks to inter-operate. It is also easy to create comprehensive robot system application by re-using existing modules thus facilitating network-distributed software sharing and improving the cost of writing and maintaining software.",

The effectiveness of the method is verified by simulation results.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores several novel approaches to solve the Morris water maze task. In this spatial memory task, the robot must learn how to associate perceptual information with a particular location to aid in navigating to the goal. A self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is used to discretize the perceptual space. The robot must then learn to associate these perceptual states with an action used to navigate through the environment. Two navigational approaches are proposed. The first approach involves computing a probabilistic graph between SOFM nodes and then searching the graph to locate a path to the goal. The second approach uses temporal difference learning to learn the association between an SOFM node and an action that will direct it to the goal. The paper compares the effectiveness of these two approaches and discusses their respective utility.",

This method characterizes the object to be tracked using a MOG (mixture of Gaussians) based appearance model and a chamfer-matching based shape model. A selective updating technique for the models is employed to accommodate for appearance and illumination changes. Meantime, the mean shift algorithm is embedded as the prior information into the Bayesian framework to give a heuristic prediction in the hypotheses generation process, which also alleviates the great computational load suffered by the conventional Bayesian tracker. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with some existing works, the proposed algorithm has a better adaptability to changes of the object as well as the environments.",

        "abstract": "Legged locomotion excels when terrains become too rough for wheeled systems or open-loop walking pattern generators to succeed, i.e., when accurate foot placement is of primary importance in successfully reaching the task goal. In this paper we address the scenario where the rough terrain is traversed with a static walking gait, and where for every foot placement of a leg, the location of the foot placement was selected irregularly by a planning algorithm. Our goal is to adjust a smooth walking pattern generator with the selection of every foot placement such that the COG of the robot follows a stable trajectory characterized by a stability margin relative to the current support triangle. We propose a novel parameter-ization of the COG trajectory based on the current position, velocity, and acceleration of the four legs of the robot. This COG trajectory has guaranteed continuous velocity and acceleration profiles, which leads to continuous velocity and acceleration profiles of the leg movement, which is ideally suited for advanced model-based controllers. Pitch, yaw, and ground clearance of the robot are easily adjusted automatically under any terrain situation. We evaluate our gait generation technique on the Little-Dog quadruped robot when traversing complex rocky and sloped terrains.",

The motion of the tracking vehicle is decomposed into two components - a component normal to the wind direction and a component tangential to the wind direction. The tangential component is controlled with a strategy that moves upwind when odor is detected and moves gradually downwind when odor is lost. The normal component of velocity is controlled by two different algorithms. The first algorithm controls the rate of turning in the plane normal to the wind direction as a function of concentration. The second algorithm controls the rate of turning and the magnitude of the normal component of velocity as a function of the time derivative of concentration. Both algorithms display the potential to declare the location of an odor source in a three-dimensional space.",

Motion safety is a taken-for-granted and ill-defined notion in the Robotics literature and the primary contribution of this paper is to propose three safety criteria that helps in understanding a number of key aspects related to the motion safety issue. A number of navigation schemes used by robotic systems operating in the real-world are then evaluated with respect to these safety criteria. It is established that, in all cases, they violate one or several of them. Accordingly, motion safety, especially in the presence of moving objects, cannot be guaranteed (in the sense that these robotic systems may end up in a situation where a collision inevitably occurs later in the future). Finally, it is shown that the concept of inevitable collision states introduced by Fraichard and Asama (2004) does respect the three above-mentioned safety criteria and therefore offers a theoretical answer to the motion safety issue.",

Among them, the robot's ability to localise itself turns out to be critical. The research community has provided, through the years, different methodologies to face the localisation problem, such as the Kalman Filter or the Monte Carlo Integrations methods. In this paper a different approach relying on a specialisation of the genetic algorithms is proposed. The novelty of this approach is to take advantage of the complex networks theory for the spatial deployment of the population to more quickly find out the optimal solutions. In fact, modelling the search space with complex networks and exploiting their typical connectivity properties, results in a more effective exploration of such space.",

Real-time vision based feedback from a CCD camera mounted to a high resolution optical microscope is used to track particle positions relative to the tip and target position. Tip-particle system is modeled in 2D as a nonholonomic differential drive robot. Effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated through experiments performed using a single goal position as well as linking a series of target positions to form a single complex trajectory.

In this system, the varying focal lengths of the camera are allowed and can be obtained without any further assumptions. Finally, we give some experimental results to validate this method.",

        "abstract": "Efficient, reliable and flexible handling is still very challenging in micromanipulation and micro-assembly. In this paper, we propose an original thermally actuated gripper based on the use of ice to manipulate submerged artificial micro-objects sized under 100 mum. Manipulating in liquid surroundings can indeed be more interesting than in dry conditions. A comparative analysis on the impact of dry and liquid media on surface forces, contact forces and hydrodynamic forces shortly given first shows it. Concerning the use of ice for micromanipulation, cryogenic grippers are a flexible solution. Nevertheless, as they currently work in air, water must be provided by an external device and capillary force occurs during the release. Our submerged freeze microgripper takes advantages of the aqueous surroundings for the handling process as explained. The thermal principle, based on the Peltier effect, the characteristics of the microgripper prototype and the first micromanipulation tests are also presented. To control and optimize the heat exchanges in the developed gripper, a static thermal model using electrical analogy has been developed and validated for the Peltier elements and a 3D heat sink of the gripper. Further work will focus on the dynamic equivalent electric model.",

The simulators examined cover a wide spectrum of vehicles including unmanned aerial vehicles, both full scale and micro size; unmanned surface and subsurface vehicles; and unmanned ground vehicles. The majority of simulators use simple numerical simulation and simplistic visualization using custom OpenGL code. An emerging trend is to used modified commercial game engines for physical simulation and visualization. The game engines that are commercially available today are capable of physical simulations providing basic physical properties and interactions between objects. Newer and/or specialized engines such as the flight simulator X-Plane or Ageia PhysX and Havok physics engines, are capable of simulating more complex physical interactions between objects. Researchers in need of a simulator have a choice of using game engines or available open source and commercially available simulators, allowing resources to be focused on research instead of building a new simulator. We conclude that it is no longer necessary to build a new simulator from scratch.",

The algorithm relies on discrete target detections (e.g., laser \"hits\") and a simple model of the targets to be tracked (e.g. a human is modeled in 2-D as a circle). The algorithm is evaluated in the context of a 4 versus 4 basketball game (8 targets) using 4 SICK LMS291 laser scanners as input. Our evaluations show that the sensor system correctly reports the number of targets roughly 99% of the time. We also demonstrate use of the tracker with two video datasets of multiple changing numbers of ants and fish, respectively.",

Specifically, the force-position (F-P) architecture is applied during the constrained motion, while the position-position (P-P) architecture is applied during the free space motion. Perfect transparency can be achieved in theory. In addition, the controller is robust to model uncertainties and disturbances, and it does not need to switch the control modes of the master and the slave controllers during the transition between the free space motion and the constrained motion. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bilateral controller.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a SLAM framework which is based on an algorithm that combines an unscented particle filter (UPF) and unscented Kalman filters (UKFs). A UPF is used to estimate robot's poses and the UKFs are used to represent landmark positions. UPF can estimate robot poses more consistently and accurately than generic particle filters (PFs), especially when models are highly non-linear or noises are not Gaussian. UKF can update landmarks more accurately compared to popular EKF's when highly non-linear observation models are used. In addition, our algorithm avoids the calculation of the Jacobian for both motion model and the observation model, which could be extremely difficult for high order systems. The calculation cost of a UPF is on the same order of magnitude as a particle filter (PF), which uses Kalman filters to generate proposal distributions, and the calculation cost of a UKF is equivalent to an EKF. As a result, our SLAM framework is more accurate than other popular SLAM frameworks while its efficiency is maintained. Simulation results are shown to validate the performance goals.",

        "abstract": "Conventionally, joint angles are used as parameters for a spatial chain with spherical joints, where they serve very well for the study of forward kinematics (FK). However, the inverse kinematics (IK) problem is very difficult to solve directly using these angular parameters, on which complex nonlinear loop closure constraints are imposed by required end effector configurations. In a recent paper, our newly developed anchored triangle parameters were presented and shown to be well suited for the study of IK problems in many broad classes of linkages. The focus of that paper was the parameterization of non-singular solutions; among many specific types of IK problems, only one, that of a spatial chain with spherical joints imposing 5 dimensional constraints, was developed in detail. Here we present a unified approach to the solutions of that and two other types of IK problems. The critical concepts in our approach - the geometric formulation in anchored triangle parameters, and the application of loop deformation spaces - are general for all IK problems, and especially useful for redundant systems. For the three IK problems addressed in this paper, we demonstrate convexity properties of the set of IK solutions. We also give detailed descriptions of the parameterization of singular deformations. Similar ideas apply readily to linkages involving multiple loops.",

        "abstract": "We describe an interaction paradigm for controlling a robot using hand gestures. In particular, we are interested in the control of an underwater robot by an on-site human operator. Under this context, vision-based control is very attractive, and we propose a robot control and programming mechanism based on visual symbols. A human operator presents engineered visual targets to the robotic system, which recognizes and interprets them. This paper describes the approach and proposes a specific gesture language called \"RoboChat\". RoboChat allows an operator to control a robot and even express complex programming concepts, using a sequence of visually presented symbols, encoded into fiducial markers. We evaluate the efficiency and robustness of this symbolic communication scheme by comparing it to traditional gesture-based interaction involving a remote human operator",

In this paper, we study the problem of finding an optimal policy for controlling a robot in a partially observable domain, where the model is not perfectly known, and may change over time. We present an algorithm called MEDUSA which incrementally learns a POMDP model using queries, while still optimizing a reward function. We demonstrate effectiveness of the approach for a simple scenario, where a robot seeking a person has minimal a priori knowledge of its own sensor model, as well as where the person is located.",

These tools allow physicians to visualize the positions of organs, plan surgical interventions, and carry out more comprehensive post operative monitoring. A childbirth simulator provides a risk-free training and research tool for comparing various techniques that use obstetrical instruments or validating new methods. This paper presents a new teaching method to place forceps blades for obstetricians using an instrumented childbirth simulator. The proposed method is based on a physical simulator coupled with a computer graphics interface. Another aspect of this paper is to provide understanding marks to quantify the progression during a training. A first one allows to study the path in space and to quantify their repeatability, a second one allows to compute the error to a reference gesture defined by an expert. Both marks are complementary. Two novices were trained and they manage to have a more repeatable gesture and above all to become closer to a reference gesture, i.e. to reduce the injury linked to the use of forceps during instrumental deliveries.",

The proposed control design addresses visual servo of 'eye-in-hand' type systems. The control of the position and orientation dynamics are decoupled using a visual error based on a spherical centroid data, along with estimation of the gravitational inertial direction. The error used compensates for the poor conditioning of the Jacobian matrix seen in earlier work in this area by introducing a non-homogeneous gain term adapted to the visual sensitivity of the error measurements. A nonlinear controller is derived for the full dynamics of the system.

        "abstract": "Remote surgery is one of the most desired applications in the context of recent advanced medical technologies. For a future expansion of remote surgery, it is important to use conventional network infrastructures such as Internet. However, using such conventional network infrastructures, we are confronting time-delay problems of data transmission. In this paper, a remote surgery experiment between Japan and Thailand using a research and development Internet is presented. In the experiment, the image and audio information was transmitted by a newly developed low latency CODEC system to shorten the time-delay. By introducing the low latency CODEC system, the time-delay was shortened compared with the past remote surgery experiments despite the longer distance. We also conducted several network measurements such as a comparison between TCP/IP and UDP/IP about the control signal transmission.",

The robotic part was totally developed by people at the IAS-lab and at IT+Robotics according to Guatti's concept. This work is the result of the meeting of robotics and art. The video shows that the robot is able to locate people in the environment, to navigate toward them avoiding the obstacles and to approach them as a polite waiter will do. In fact, the sculpture represents a waiter and a waitress (actually their suits, the statue do not have a body, they represent empty suits). The waiters chat among them (by play different pre-recorded voice files) while wandering in the environment. Once the robot locates a person and get close to her, it asks the customer one out of different pre-recorded questions. The more likely is: Would you like a drink?, that is the title of the sculpture.",

        "abstract": "The lateral rollover of quad bikes represents a significant part of severe accidents in the field of agricultural work. The specificities of such vehicles (small wheelbase, track and weight, as well as high speed), together with the terrain configuration (off-road environment) prevent from describing rollover occurrence as it is proposed for car-like vehicles. In particular, sliding effects significantly affects the evaluation of the rollover risk. This paper proposes a rollover risk indicator dedicated to off-road vehicles, taking into account the environment properties and more particularly the grip condition and its variation. It is based on the prediction of the lateral load transfer relying on vehicles models including sliding effects. This indicator can be run on-line when the vehicle is moving. It allows anticipating a potential danger, and could then be used to design security systems. Performances of this indicator are demonstrated using the multibody dynamic simulation software Adams.",

The method is intuitive, provably stable, and shown to be viable through various experimental results conducted on our test platform, the CSIRO Autonomous Tractor.",

It consists of an easily fabricated miniaturized thermal probe that senses the additional convective heat transfer associated with the occurrence of mechanical slip. The fabrication procedures and the operating principle for the device are described in detail. A simple experimental setup was used to test the effectiveness of the proposed device. Tests were performed with varying velocities on four materials of differing thermal properties and surface roughnesses. The results show that slip can be effectively detected by the proposed sensor with a response times which can be as low as 6.3 ms. The performance of the device can be further improved when used in conjunction with a separate pressure sensor and by using more accurate methods of electrical resistance measurement.",

The platform has two actuating devices (linear and angular) and the motion control problem is dual to that of nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots. The main control objective is to keep the walker close to the platform center. We first recall global kinematic control schemes developed at the velocity level, i.e., with the linear and angular velocities of the platform as input commands. Then, we use backstepping techniques and the theory of cascaded systems to move the design to control laws at the acceleration level. Acceleration control is more suitable to take into account the limitations imposed to the platform motion by the actuation system and/or the physiological bounds on the human walker. In particular, the availability of platform accelerations allows the analytical computation of the apparent accelerations felt by the user.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a new kinematic and a dynamic model for a 3-degree-of-freedom Gantry-Tau parallel kinematic robot are presented. Similar to an earlier proposed kinematic model, the dynamic model is based on the assumption of parallel actuator axes and constant end-effector orientation. The new kinematic model takes into account rotations of actuator axes which do not affect the end-effector orientation. Results from a calibration experiment show an improved positioning accuracy of the new kinematic model. A more general model of the robot including possible geometric inaccuracies causing deviations from the model assumptions has been developed in the modeling language Modelica. In a simulation, the proposed dynamic model is tested as a feedforward term in a control application and is found to improve the tracking performance considerably.",

The simulation uses a model derived from the frequency response analysis of SMA. Although the large-scale response has hysteresis and nonlinearities, small-signal frequency response analysis is possible on SMA wires, with detectable force response at frequencies up to 100 Hz. The model has been demonstrated to accurately predict closed-loop behaviour. A high performance force control system using PID control is also demonstrated. Results show fast convergence, and excellent setpoint and tracking accuracy with practically no sign of limit cycles. Experimental results in this paper are the first to have demonstrated stable and accurate response with good rejection of large motion disturbances.",

With their own strengths and weaknesses, low-level fusion of these two sensors complements each other. We combine these two sensors to perform motion estimation and 3D reconstruction simultaneously and precisely. We develop a motion estimation scheme appropriate for this sensor system. In the proposed method, the motion between two frames is estimated using three points among the scan data, and refined by nonlinear optimization. We validate the accuracy of the proposed method using real images. The results show that the proposed system is a practical solution for motion estimation as well as for 3D reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new image-based approach to tracking the 6dof trajectory of a stereo camera pair using a corresponding reference image pairs instead of explicit 3D feature reconstruction of the scene. A dense minimisation approach is employed which directly uses all grey-scale information available within the stereo pair (or stereo region) leading to very robust and precise results. Metric 3D structure constraints are imposed by consistently warping corresponding stereo images to generate novel viewpoints at each stereo acquisition. An iterative non-linear trajectory estimation approach is formulated based on a quadrifocal relationship between the image intensities within adjacent views of the stereo pair. A robust M-estimation technique is used to reject outliers corresponding to moving objects within the scene or other outliers such as occlusions and illumination changes. The technique is applied to recovering the trajectory of a moving vehicle in long and difficult sequences of images.",

Without the assistance of strobe, medical doctors can not see what is really happening in real time, since the frequency of air jet is even more than the range of human dynamic eye sight. After explaining the basic principle, we show a couple of experiments for both artificial and real human lungs. Through these experiments, we newly found that the ASI is really helpful for discovering tumors or other diseases hidden in internal organs. Movies are available in Website.",

One particular challenge arising with this technique is generalization of demonstrations in order to get a generic description of the task. In this paper a new methodology for solving this problem is proposed. The main part of the algorithm exploits principles known from fluid dynamics.",

Minimal control synthesis (MCS) methods have a number of attractive features: no a priori knowledge of the robot structure is required; e.g., no need for parameter identification, no precise adjustment of control parameters is necessary and proven stability. After a brief summary of the basic MCS algorithm, we introduce the new algorithm, which provides a more robust environment in terms of gain wind-up protection. A proof of stability is also provided, together with simulation studies upon serial link manipulators, which demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm, even under severe test conditions.",

Our approach relies on an embedded roadmap in the sensor network that always contains safe paths. The roadmap is adaptive, i.e., it adapts its topology to changing dangers. Mobile robots in the environment use the roadmap to reach their destinations. We evaluated the performance of embedded roadmap both in simulations using realistic conditions and with real hardware. Our results show that the proposed navigation algorithm is better suited for sensor networks than traditional navigation field based algorithms. Our observations suggest that there are two drawbacks of traditional navigation field based algorithms, (i) increased power consumption, (ii) message congestion that can prevent important danger avoidance messages to be received by the robots. In contrast, our approach significantly reduces the number of messages on the network (up to 160 times in some scenarios) while increasing the navigation performance.",

By using speech in HRI in real world environments, we have to deal with mostly high and varying background noise, reverberation and also with different sound sources superimposing speech and other noises. Therefore, for real world scenarios a suitable signal preprocessing is essential. In this paper, we present a part of the artificial auditory system implemented on the mobile interaction robot HOROS using only two low cost microphones. We combined neural voice activity detection (VAD) and adaptive noise reduction which are essential aspects for HRI using mobile robot systems in changing and populated real-world environments. In the result, our system is able to robustly react on speech signals from its human interaction partner while ignoring other sound sources. Experiments show a significantly improved ASR performance in demanding environments making the system suitable for the use in real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The problem of an effective coordination of multiple autonomous robots is one of the most important tasks of the modern robotics. In turn, it is well known that the learning to coordinate multiple autonomous agents in a multiagent system is one of the most complex challenges of the state-of-the-art intelligent system design. Principally, this is because of the exponential growth of the environment's dimensionality with the number of learning agents. This challenge is known as \"curse of dimensionality\", and relates to the fact that the dimensionality of the multiagent coordination problem is exponential in the number of learning agents, because each state of the system is a joint state of all agents and each action is a joint action composed of actions of each agent. In this paper, we address this problem for the restricted class of environments known as goal-directed stochastic games with action-penalty representation. We use a single-agent problem solution as a heuristic approximation of the agents' initial preferences and, by so doing, we restrict to a great extent the space of multiagent learning. We show theoretically the correctness of such an initialization, and the results of experiments in a well-known two-robot grid world problem show that there is a significant reduction of complexity of the learning process.",

The static nodes are able to take sensor readings continuously in place, while the mobile robot is able to move and sample at multiple locations. The measurements from the robot and the static nodes are used to reconstruct an underlying scalar field. The algorithm presented in this paper accepts the measurements made by the static nodes as inputs and computes a path for the mobile robot which minimizes the integrated mean square error of the reconstructed field subject to the constraint that the robot has limited energy. We assume that the field does not change when robot is taking samples. In addition to simulations, we have validated the algorithm on a robotic boat and a system of static buoys operating in a lake over several km of traversed distance while reconstructing the temperature field of the lake surface",

        "abstract": "The exploration problem is a central issue in mobile robotics. A complete coverage is not practical if the environment is large with a few small hotspots, and the sampling cost is high. So, it is desirable to build robot teams that can coordinate to maximize sampling at these hotspots while minimizing resource costs, and consequently learn more accurately about properties of such environmental phenomena. An important issue in designing such teams is the exploration strategy. The contribution of this paper is in the evaluation of an adaptive exploration strategy called adaptive cluster sampling (ACS), which is demonstrated to reduce the resource costs (i.e., mission time and energy consumption) of a robot team, and yield more information about the environment by directing robot exploration towards hotspots. Due to the adaptive nature of the strategy, it is not obvious how the sampled data can be used to provide unbiased, low-variance estimates of the properties. This paper therefore discusses how estimators that are Rao-Blackwellized can be used to achieve low error. This paper also presents the first analysis of the characteristics of the environmental phenomena that favor the ACS strategy and estimators. Quantitative experimental results in a mineral prospecting task simulation show that our approach is more efficient in exploration by yielding more minerals and information with fewer resources and providing more precise mineral density estimates than previous methods.",

        "abstract": "In many applications of robot manipulators, the end-effector is required to make contact with environment. In these applications, it is necessary to control not only the position but also the interaction force between the robot end-effector and environment. Most research so far on motion and force tracking control has assumed that the kinematics and constraint surface are exactly known. In this paper, we propose a visually-servoed adaptive Jacobian controller for motion and force tracking control with structural uncertainties in kinematics, dynamics and constraint surface. It is shown that uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors can be guaranteed. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control law.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel affect-sensitive human-robot interaction framework for rehabilitation of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The overall aim is to enable the robot to detect and respond to the affective cues of the children in order to help them explore social interaction dynamics in a gradual and adaptive manner. The first part of the proposed framework, namely the 'affect recognition' module is developed in detail in this paper. Two tasks are designed to elicit the affective states of liking, anxiety, and engagement that are considered important in autism rehabilitation. Affective cues are inferred from psychophysiological analysis that uses subjective reports of the affective states from a therapist, a parent, and the child himself/herself. Comprehensive physiological indices are investigated that may correlate with the affective states of children with ASD. A support vector machines based affect recognizer is designed that yielded reliable prediction with approximately 83% success when using the therapist's reports. This is the first time, to our knowledge, such a human-robot interaction framework for autism rehabilitation is proposed. This is also the first time that the affective states of children with ASD have been experimentally detected via physiology-based affect recognition technique.",

        "abstract": "Robots that use cycloidal gears, belts, or long shafts for transmitting motion from the motors to the driven rigid links display visco-elastic phenomena that can be assumed to be concentrated at the joints. For the design of advanced, possibly nonlinear, trajectory tracking control laws that are able to fully counteract the vibrations due to joint elasticity, full state feedback is needed. However, no robot with elastic joints has sensors available for its whole state, i.e., for measuring positions and velocities of both motors and links. Several nonlinear observers have been proposed in the past, assuming different reduced sets of measurements. We introduce here a new observer which uses only motor position sensing, together with accelerometers suitably mounted on the links of the robot arm. Its main advantage is that the error dynamics on the estimated state is independent from the dynamic parameters of the robot links, and can be tuned with standard decentralized linear techniques (locally to each joint). We present an experimental validation of this observer for the three base joints of a KUKA KR15/2 industrial robot and illustrate the control use of the obtained results.",

        "abstract": "Growing new robotic applications in agriculture, food-processing, assisted surgery and haptics, which requires handling of highly deformable objects, present a number of design challenges; among these are methods to analyze deformable contacts. Recently, meshless methods (MLM), which inherit many advantages of finite element method (FEM) and yet need no explicit mesh structure to discretize geometry, have been proposed as an attractive alternative to FEM for solving engineering problems where automatic re-meshing is needed. This paper offers an adaptive MLM (automatically inserting nodes into large error regions) for solving contact problems. We employ the sliding line algorithm with the penalty method to handle contact constraints; it does not rely on small displacement assumptions and thus, it can solve non-linear contact problems with large deformation. Along with three practical applications, we validate the method against results computed using commercial FEM software and analytical solutions.",

Its main focus is on the automatic generation and parameterization of the assembly sequence, which should provide maximal robustness with respect to positioning errors of the robot and residual position uncertainties of vision based object localization. The assembly utilizes active or passive compliance of the robot in order to align the parts automatically. Success of the automatic alignment, i.e. the convergence of the assembly process can be guaranteed using the means of regions of attraction (ROA). The planning optimizes the assembly trajectories and parameters in such a way that the ROA is maximized for a given part geometry. For the convergence analysis, passivity properties of the robot and the environment are used. The method is validated through extensive experiments and can be successfully applied also for the automated assembly planning with passive compliance devices, as widely used today in industrial automation.",

Outliers are rejected a posteriori during a pose estimation process, and then the structure of the scene is reconstructed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for computing robustly and simultaneously the 3D camera displacement, the scene structure and the illumination changes directly from image intensity discrepancies. In this way, instead of depending on particular features, all possible image information is exploited. That problem is solved by using an efficient second-order optimization procedure and thus, high convergence rates and large domains of convergence are obtained. Furthermore, a new solution to the visual SLAM initialization problem is given whereby no assumptions are made either about the scene or the camera motion.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter approach is an effective means to estimate the full SLAM posterior. The approach provides for the use of raw sensor measurements directly in SLAM, thus obviating the need to extract landmarks using complex feature extraction methods and data association. In this paper a solution framework based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RB) and genetic algorithms (GA) is proposed for recovering the full SLAM posterior using raw exteroceptive sensor measurements, i.e. without landmarks. The resultant Rao-Blackwellized genetic algorithmic filter (RBGAF) permits the uses of any arbitrary measurement model unlike FastSLAM with scan matching. Since the proposed method represents the environmental map state for each robot trajectory using a population of chromosomes as opposed to grids, RBGAF is much more memory efficient than DP-SLAM. Memory efficiency is further enhanced through the exploitation of dynamic data structures for representing the maps and the robot trajectories. This makes the proposed RBGAF very suitable for large scale SLAM in 3D environments. Further, the proposed method's provision for adaptation of chromosome lifetime/group sizes and its ability to incorporate alternative map representations makes it adaptable to varied environments and different sensors. Simulation and experimental results obtained in an outdoor environment using a laser measurement system are presented to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.",

A prototype portable device has been implemented, consisting of a pedometer and a standard white cane, on which a laser range finder and a 3-axis gyroscope have been mounted. A novel pose estimation algorithm has been developed for robustly estimating the heading and position of a person navigating in a known building. The basis of our estimation scheme is a two-layered extended Kalman filter (EKF) for attitude and position estimation. The first layer maintains an attitude estimate of the white cane, which is subsequently provided to the second layer where a position estimate of the user is generated.

        "abstract": "An inevitable collision state (ICS) for a robotic system is a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory followed by the system is, a collision with an obstacle eventually occurs. The ICS concept takes into account both the dynamics of the robotic system and the future motion of the moving objects of the environment. For obvious safety reasons, a robotic system should never ever end up in an ICS hence the interest of the ICS concept when it comes to safely drive robotic systems in dynamic environments. In theory, determining whether a given state is an ICS requires to check for collision all possible future trajectories of infinite duration that the robotic system can follow from this particular state! In practise, it is fortunately possible to build a conservative approximation of the ICS set by considering only a finite subset of the whole set of possible future trajectories. The primary contribution of the paper is a general principle to select the subset of trajectories based upon the concept of imitating maneuvres, i.e., trajectories leading the robotic system to duplicate the behaviour of the environment objects (fixed or moving), it is shown how a good approximation of the ICS set can be obtained. The second contribution of the paper is an ICS-Checker for a car-like vehicle moving in a dynamic environment. This ICS-Checker integrates the above-mentioned selection principle. It is efficient and could be used in practise to compute truly safe motions for a car-like vehicle amidst moving objects.",

This paper proposes a new method, based on the analysis of the error function being minimized. It considers that the correspondences are not independent (the same measurement being used in more than one correspondence), and explicitly utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, which are not assumed to be independent either. The validity of the approach is verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate than previous methods and its computational load is negligible. The ill-posedness of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled for under-constrained situations by performing an observability analysis; in the analyzed cases the method still provides a good estimate of the error projected on the observable manifold.",

Such a capacity is required in some of the most important industrial robotic tasks, like the cutting or welding of commercial plates. Previous work has shown how a calibration-free, vision-based method can be combined with an optimal geodesic-mapping approach, in order to generate an optimal trajectory that traces a previously defined path, stored as a CAD model, over an arbitrary, curved surface. The application of this technique in the case of non-developable surfaces did not achieve closure when a closed-trajectory was attempted. This paper presents a methodology for successfully achieving closure of a given closed-path, when this is traced over a non-developable surface. The proposed technique was tested using an industrial robot and a vision-based system that included structured lighting for image-analysis simplification. The results of these experiments are reported herein.",

        "abstract": "A human can control dynamic properties of his/her own body naturally and effectively according to tasks by utilizing the perceived information of environmental characteristics. If dynamic properties of human movements depending on environmental characteristics can be described quantitatively, there would be expected to design and develop a novel human-machine system in which an operator can manipulate more comfortably. This paper discusses a design methodology of human-machine systems integrating human motor characteristics. A vehicle interface system manipulated by the foot is focused on, and mechanical impedance properties of human lower extremities during maintained leg posture are investigated according to the leg posture and the foot force",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The main purpose of this study is to apply the mechanism of human weight perception to multimedia applications. When a start and the goal points are given in the human motion, the velocity profile has a unimodal profile including the acceleration and deceleration zones. In such case, it is widely said that the motion control becomes more accurate in the deceleration zone for the final approach. Hence, it is assumed that the sensing ability also improves. This study challenges to confirm the hypothesis with weight stimuli generated by a force display device. As a preliminary experiment, this study confirms that our device enables the evaluation of human perception by tracing Weber's experiment in virtual reality; the obtained difference threshold (DL: Differenz Limen) almost agrees with the previous results. The difference threshold is a very important factor, which means perceptual threshold for weight changes. We further attempt to clarify the mechanism of the human weight perception for sudden weight changes during the lifting process. Based on individual lifting profiles, this study suddenly changes the load force in the two zones, and examines the difference thresholds of each subject. The results demonstrate that the human weight perception tends to become more sensitive in the deceleration zone during the lifting process. These results also imply the effectiveness of force display devices for physical experiments.",

The underlying algorithm is rooted on a solid probabilistic foundation and is guaranteed to converge asymptotically, unlike many existing popular approaches. Moreover, it is efficient in storage and computation. The new algorithm carries out filtering only in the marginal filtering space, thereby allowing for the recursive computation of low variance estimates of the map. The paper provides mathematical arguments and empirical evidence to substantiate the fact that the new method represents an improvement over the existing particle filtering approaches for SLAM, which work on the joint path state space.",

In the science museum, we exhibited humanoid robots. Visitors were invited to wear RFID tags to interact with the robots. Visitor behavior was simultaneously observed using 20 RFID readers, distributed throughout the entire floor, that roughly measured the distances of nearby tags. We integrated the outputs from all RFID readers to estimate visitor trajectories that were used to analyze three perspectives: space, visiting patterns, and relationships. Regarding space, we identified crowded and uncrowded areas. We found several typical visiting patterns, such as visited at every exhibit and directly going to robot area. We also identified atypical visiting behavior. Regarding relationships, for example, we estimated 68% coverage of group-member relationships with 91% reliability.",

        "abstract": "Many sampling methods for motion planning explore the robot's configuration space (C-space) starting from a set of configuration(s) and incrementally explore surrounding areas to produce a growing model of the space. Although there is a common understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques, metrics for analyzing the incremental exploration process and for evaluating the performance of incremental samplers have been lacking. We propose the use of local metrics that provide insight into the complexity of the different regions in the model and global metrics that describe the process as a whole. These metrics only require local information and can be efficiently computed. We illustrate the use of our proposed metrics to analyze representative incremental strategies including the rapidly-exploring random trees, expansive space trees, and the original randomized path planner. We show how these metrics model the efficiency of C-space exploration and help to identify different modeling stages. In addition, these metrics are ideal for adapting space exploration to improve performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to electronic compassing for robot in an indoor environment. Operation of compass (magnetometer) is assumed on a mobile robot that is capable to traverse a complete circular path. The electronic compass is used to estimate a robot absolute heading with respect to the magnetic North. This is only compass approach where an evaluation of quality of calibration and magnetic environment is important as much as calibration itself. In this method, compass is able to detect the external magnetic interference and estimate it numerically. The approach also relates to automatic calibration and requires one full 360-degree rotation and multiple points for further analysis. This enhanced calibration procedure is performed in the magnetic field domain and implemented using a non-iterative algebraic technique. The quality of calibration is a function of input data goodness and how successful is the fitting procedure. The magnetic environment evaluation is performed by the distortion factor that is calculated at the end of calibration and helps to estimate quantitatively local external magnetic distortions and their influence on a heading measurement. The validity of this approach has been verified experimentally by using robot with electronic compass.",

        "abstract": "The passive dynamic control (\"PDC\") is a new mechanical system control method using variable passive elements with less energy and more safety. In the study described in this paper, the PDC is applied to a pneumatic cylinder for positioning control. When an object is stopped in the intermediate position by a pneumatic control and an electromagnetic friction brake, the unbalance force is cut to zero and the balanced state is achieved. Thus, high-rigidity positioning is achieved and the object can be moved to the next position. In this paper, the authors also propose a method of improving the internal pressure control precision for the cylinder.",

However, this paper proves rigorously that in the real world, the unavoidable assembly and manufacturing errors will cause overconstrained parallel manipulators to lose degree of freedoms, or even unable to be assembled if they are composed of purely clearance-free pairs (e.g., preloaded pairs). Introducing joint clearance is an essential and efficient way for the correct functioning and easy assembly of overconstrained parallel manipulators.",

        "abstract": "A diversity of action-perception applications relies on 2D information to perform 3D tasks. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is one of these applications. It requires a high degree of sensory-motor skills to overcome the disengagement between action and perception caused by the physical separation of the surgeon with the operative site. The integration of body movements with visual information serves to assist the surgeon providing a sense of position. Our purpose in this paper is to present the exterior orientation as a tool in assisted interventions locating the instruments with respect to the surgeon. An enhanced perception is obtained by augmenting the 2D information imposing position and orientation data through a human-machine interface. Applying motion analysis in a sequence of images and having knowledge of the 3D transformations implemented to the instrument, we show it is possible to estimate its orientation with only two different rotations and also its position in the case its length information is supplied.",

In the first part of the study, an application has been developed to extract fixed templates from image files; the application extract the principal edges in the images to build output trajectories (templates) that are used by haptic interface controller, after that, the user can \"fill\" the virtual templates with the assistance of the force feedback capabilities of the interface. Based on the obtained results for fixed templates, a second application was developed; the user can generate interactive templates indicating where he/she desires to put a geometrical template (circle, line or arc) inside the haptic interface's workplace; once that the position of the template is defined, the interface shows its position graphically and then user can fill it assisted by the haptic interface force feedback.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Automation has long been recognized as an important goal in AFM (atomic force microscope) nanomanipulation research. For the precise manipulation of small particles with sizes on the order of 10 nm, however, automation has remained an elusive goal, primarily because of the spatial uncertainties associated with the positioning mechanisms of the AFM and with the manipulation process itself. Extensive user intervention has been necessary for the construction of desired nanostructures with the AFM, resulting in very low throughput, and severely limiting the complexity of structures that could be built with a reasonable amount of time and labor. This paper describes a fully automatic system for building arbitrary planar patterns of nanoparticles by AFM manipulation. Given an initial, random distribution of particles on a substrate surface and a desired pattern to be formed with them, a planner determines the paths required to perform the manipulation operations. The output of the planner is a sequence of primitive commands for positioning and pushing operations involving motion along line segments. The primitive commands are executed through software that compensates for thermal drift, creep and hysteresis. Experimental results presented here show that the system can build in minutes a pattern that normally would take an experienced user a whole day to construct interactively.",

For the purpose, many researches have been devoted to the development of location sensing techniques employing the latest in RFID or GPS. However, it has not yet become possible to attain high accuracy in those techniques, particularly in cluttered or dynamically changing environments. In this paper, we propose a novel location sensing RFID reader equipped with a dual directional antenna that communicates with controllable RF transponders. The dual directional antenna estimates the direction of arrival (DOA) of signals from various transponders by using the ratio of the received strength between two antennas. This enables the robot to continuously monitor the changes in the ratio and find its way to the target transponder. To verify the validity of the proposed system in real environments populated with unknown obstacles, we perform detailed experiments using simulations and hardware implementations. Specifically, the target acquisition and docking guidance are demonstrated in a multiple transponder environment under various circumstances.",

Borrowing some techniques from industrial automation, we developed a robust system capable of presenting any stored tool in 700ms or less. Tools are positively retained in a sterilizable carousel in a compliant manner designed to accomodate misalignment during tool exchange. RFID equipment is integrated into the system and the tools so that tools can be inventoried and presented by function or serial number instead of rack position. The resulting device has completed testing and integration into the Trauma Pod system and met all its design requirements.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve reliable autonomous control in advanced robotic systems like entertainment robots, assistive robots, humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles, sensory data needs to be absolutely reliable, or some measure of reliability must be available. Bayesian statistics can offer favorable ways of accomplishing such robust sensory data pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian way of dealing with outlier-infested sensory data and develop a \"black box\" approach to removing outliers in real-time and expressing confidence in the estimated data. We develop our approach in the framework of Bayesian linear regression with heteroscedastic noise. Essentially, every measured data point is assumed to have its individual variance, and the final estimate is achieved by a weighted regression over observed data. An expectation-maximization algorithm allows us to estimate the variance of each data point in an incremental algorithm. With the exception of a time horizon (window size) over which the estimation process is averaged, no open parameters need to be tuned, and no special assumption about the generative structure of the data is required. The algorithm works efficiently in realtime. We evaluate our method on synthetic data and on a pose estimation problem of a quadruped robot, demonstrating its ease of usability, competitive nature with well-tuned alternative algorithms and advantages in terms of robust outlier removal",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The use of the World Wide Web for robot teleoperation is growing in the last years due mainly to the pervasiveness of Internet and Web browsers, although Web interfaces usually use Ethernet networks that exhibit time unpredictability. Most recent research in the area has been focused on improving time predictability of the network under delays, jitter, and no guaranteed bandwidth. However, we believe that: i) not only the network, but every component in the interfaced system exhibit time unpredictability; and ii) improving time predictability is not the only solution: adapting the interfaced system to unpredictable conditions is also a possibility. In this paper we consider a Web interfaced robot as a set of control loops and describe and implement a hysteresis controller for regulating the flow of information through the loops as a method to satisfy the system time requirements under some unpredictable and varying conditions. For demonstrating the goodness of our algorithm, we: a) compare it with a near-optimal one automatically generated through reinforcement learning, and b) show an implementation of the algorithm for the direct teleoperation of a service mobile robot, obtaining a better behavior than the same system without flow regulation.",

        "abstract": "We describe a fast method to relocalise a monocular visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) system after tracking failure. The monocular SLAM system stores the 3D locations of visual landmarks, together with a local image patch. When the system becomes lost, candidate matches are obtained using correlation, then the pose of the camera is solved via an efficient implementation of RANSAC using a three-point-pose algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method within visual SLAM: (i) we show tracking can reliably resume after tracking failure due to occlusions, motion blur or unmodelled rapid motions; (ii) we show how the method can be used as an adjunct for a proposal distribution in a particle filter framework; (iii) during successful tracking we use idle cycles to test if the current map overlaps with a previously-built map, and we provide a solution to aligning the two maps by splicing the camera trajectories in a consistent and optimal way.",

Mission related objectives are tempered by the need to consider the effect of a sequence of maneuvers on the motion of the towed array which is thought not to tolerate sharp bends or twists in sensitive material. We describe and motivate an architecture for autonomy structured on the behavior-based control model augmented with a novel approach for performing behavior coordination using multi-objective optimization. We provide detailed in-field experimental results from recent exercises with two 21-inch AUVs in Monterey Bay California.",

        "abstract": "Distributed, high-density spatiotemporal observations are proposed for answering many river related questions, including those pertaining to hydraulics and multi-dimensional river modeling, geomorphology, sediment transport and riparian habitat restoration. In spite of the recent advancements in technology, currently available systems have many constraints that preclude long term, remote, autonomous, high resolution monitoring in the real environment. We present here a case study of an autonomous, high resolution robotic spatial mapping of cross-sectional velocity and salt concentration in a river basin. The scientific objective of this investigation was to characterize the transport and mixing phenomena at the confluence of two distinctly different river streams - San Joaquin River and its tributary Merced River. Several experiments for analyzing the spatial and temporal trends at multiple cross-sections of the San Joaquin River were performed during the campaign from August 21-25, 2006. These include deterministic dense raster scans and in-field adapted experimental design. Preliminary analysis from these experiments illustrating the range of investigations is presented with the focus on adaptive experiments that enable sparse sampling to provide larger spatial coverage without discounting the dynamics in the phenomena. Lessons learned during the campaign are discussed to provide useful insights for similar robotic investigations in aquatic environments.",

The control manoeuvre uses visual information to estimate the AUV relative position and attitude in relation to the ASV and steers the ASV in order to dock with the AUV. The AUV is assumed to be at surface with only a small fraction of its volume visible. The system implemented in the autonomous surface vehicle ROAZ, developed by LSA-ISEP to perform missions in river environment, test autonomous AUV docking capabilities and multiple AUV/ASV coordinated missions is presented. Information from a low cost embedded robotics vision system (LSAVision), along with inertial navigation sensors is fused in an extended Kalman filter and used to determine AUV relative position and orientation to the surface vehicle The real time vision processing system is described and results are presented in operational scenario.",

The vision system is centered around Geyer et al.'s recursive multi-frame planar parallax algorithm (2006), which accurately estimates 3D structure using geo-referenced images from a single camera, as well as a modular and efficient mapping and terrain analysis module. The vision system determines the best trajectory to cover large areas of terrain or to perform closer inspection of potential landing sites, and the flight control system guides the vehicle through the requested flight pattern by tracking the reference trajectory as computed by a real-time MPC-based optimization. This trajectory layer, which uses a constrained system model, provides an abstraction between the vision system and the vehicle. Both vision and flight control results are given from flight tests with an electric UAV.",

        "abstract": "In this paper an approach for control of autonomously flying robots with vertical take off and landing capabilities (VTOL) is presented. After reviewing that the motion description for different VTOL-robots is very similar, the general control scheme for VTOL-robots is presented. This scheme is based on linearisation and decoupling using inversion of the system model blocks. To compensate the model uncertainties and disturbances two additional parts are included into the controller: a reduced state observer based on a robot motion model as well as a disturbances observer and compensator for orientation control. The presented approach was applied to two different VTOL-robots: a helicopter and a quad-rotor. In real flight experiments it was verified that the presented general but simple controller provides sufficient performance for a wide range of practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Parallel manipulators might be severely damaged while crossing parallel singularities, because the actuator forces required to keep the platform on a given trajectory might approach infinity. It is thus important to know whether a desired pose of the platform in the workspace can be reached through a singularity-free path or not, and, in the first case, which path should be followed. This paper presents a new numerical procedure for 3UPU and 3UPS spherical wrists, which is able to count and identify the disjoint regions into which the workspace is partitioned by the singularity surface and to assess to which region any two points of the workspace belong. If the two points belong to the same region, a singularity-free path connecting them is found.",

We solve the problem of finding the minimum-length barrier in the case of variable bounded-range line-of-sight sensors in a two-dimensional polygonally-bounded region. We do this by building a graph of candidate barriers that could potentially be in the minimum barrier. The dual of this graph shows the connectivity of the free space. We thus reduce the problem to the network flows maximum-flow/minimum-cut problem.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an investigation into the adaptive control of autonomous mobile sensor platforms for providing oceanographic sampling. Mobile sensor platforms provide an ability to rapidly sample oceanographic data of interest for real-time input into ocean environmental models with the goal of reducing the modeling uncertainty by introducing selected sampled data. The major objective of this paper is to describe the autonomy architecture developed to support adaptive sampling. This architecture consists of an open-source distributed autonomy architecture and an approach to behavior-based control of autonomous vehicles using multiple objective functions that allows reactive control in complex environments with multiple constraints. Experimental results are provided for an adaptive ocean thermal gradient tracking application performed by an autonomous surface craft in Monterey Bay. These results highlight not only the suitability of autonomous sensor platforms for providing adaptive sampling of the ocean environment but, also, the suitability of our behavior-based autonomy approach and distributed autonomy architecture for providing a simple, flexible, and scalable method for autonomous sensor platform control. The paper concludes with an overview of future adaptive sampling experiments planned with autonomous underwater sensor platforms using the same methodology.",

In this first paper a new method for calculating the dynamic stiffness (frequency response) of parallel kinematic machines (PKMs) with six links, or Hexapods, is presented. The method assumes that each link and universal joint can be described by a mass-spring-damper model and calculates the transfer function from a Cartesian force or torque to Cartesian position or orientation. The new method has been used to benchmark two versions of the Gantry-Tau PKM, a relatively new PKM which has been designed to achieve a large workspace to installation space ratio, while at the same time achieve higher static and dynamic stiffness compared to serial-type industrial robots. The benchmark results presented in this paper show that these goals can be achieved in large sections of the workspace envelope. The benchmark also shows that machining centre specifications can be met if the location and dimensions of the work objects are known at the design stage.",

By using monocular algorithms on both cameras, the advantages of mono-vision (bearing-only, with infinity range but no 3D instant information) and stereo-vision (3D information only up to a limited range) naturally add up to provide interesting possibilities, that are here developed and demonstrated using an EKF-based monocular SLAM algorithm. Mainly we obtain: a) fast 3D mapping with long term, absolute angular references; b) great landmark updating flexibility; and c) the possibility of stereo rig extrinsic self-calibration, providing a much more robust and accurate sensor. Experimental results show the pertinence of the proposed ideas, which should be easily exportable (and we encourage to do so) to other, more performing, vision-based SLAM algorithms.",

        "abstract": "With the success of randomized sampling-based motion planners such as probabilistic roadmap methods, much work has been done to design new sampling techniques and distributions. To date, there is no sampling technique that outperforms all other techniques for all motion planning problems. Instead, each proposed technique has different strengths and weaknesses. However, little work has been done to combine these techniques to create new distributions. In this paper, we propose to bias one sampling distribution with another such that the resulting distribution out-performs either of its parent distributions. We present a general framework for biasing samplers that is easily extendable to new distributions and can handle an arbitrary number of parent distributions by chaining them together. Our experimental results show that by combining distributions, we can out-perform existing planners. Our results also indicate that not one single distribution combination performs the best in all problems, and we identify which perform better for the specific application domains studied",

        "abstract": "In this paper, based on a passivity framework, admittance-type and hybrid-type delay-compensated communication channel models are introduced, which warrant different bilateral control architectures for wave-based teleoperation under time delay. We utilize wave transforms and signal filtering for passivating the delayed-communication channel and passivity/stability conditions are derived using scattering theory based on an end-to-end model of the teleoperation system rather than the communication channel alone. Contrary to a commonly held view, it is proven that the teleoperation system can remain stable when force measurement data of the master and the slave manipulators interactions with the operator and the remote environment are used. Experimental results on a soft-tissue task for a hybrid-type architecture and for round-trip delays of 60 msec and 600 msec show that using slave-side force measurements considerably enhances teleoperation transparency.",

We develop a systematic approach for synthesizing behaviors at the macroscopic level that can be realized on individual robots at the microscopic level. Our methodology is inspired by a dynamical model of ant house hunting [1], a decentralized process in which a colony attempts to emigrate to the best site among several alternatives. The model is hybrid because the colony switches between different sets of behaviors, or modes, during this process. At the macroscopic level, we are able to synthesize controllers that result in the deployment of a robotic swarm in a predefined ratio between distinct sites. We then derive hybrid controllers for individual robots using only local interactions and no communication that respect the specifications of the global continuous behavior. Our simulations demonstrate that our synthesis procedure yields a correct microscopic model from the macroscopic description with guarantees on performance at both levels",

We developed a wearable interface for controlling awakening time named \"BRAC (biological rhythm based awakening timing controller)\". BRAC could estimate bio-rhythm by pulse wave from finger tip and send awake signal to user. An ordinary alarm clock operates according to set times that have to be set in advance. However, humans have a rhythm in their sleep, which affects one's sleep depth and wake-up timing. We consider the simplest way to control or reset human's bio-rhythm or life style is to optimize the awakening timing and the sleeping hours. We examined the relationship between controlling awakening timing based on autonomous nerve rhythm and equilibrium function. Our findings suggest indicate that the prototype \"BRAC\" could evaluate user's biological rhythm and awakes user at the time optimized for physical function of equilibrium.",

        "abstract": "Passive dynamics plays an important role in legged locomotion of the biological systems. The use of passive dynamics provides a number of advantages in legged locomotion such as energy efficiency, self-stabilization against disturbances, and generating gait patterns and behavioral diversity. Inspired from the theoretical and experimental studies in biomechanics, this paper presents a novel bipedal locomotion model for walking and running behavior which uses compliant legs. This model consists of three-segment legs, two servomotors, and four passive joints that are constrained by eight tension springs. The self-organization of two gait patterns (walking and running) is demonstrated in simulation and in a real-world robot. The analysis of joint kinematics and ground reaction force explains how a minimalistic control architecture can exploit the particular leg design for generating different gait patterns. Moreover, it is shown how the proposed model can be extended for controlling locomotion velocity and gait patterns with the simplest control architecture.",

It is then shown that, in the case of a pair of planer fingers with two and three joints and a 2-D rigid object with parallel or non-parallel flat surfaces, there exists a sensory-motor coordinated control signal constructed by using only the knowledge of finger kinematics and measurements of finger joints such that it realizes secure grasping in a dynamic sense. This shows that a pair of robot fingers can grasp a thing securely in a blind manner.

We propose Brick& Mortar, an algorithm for the autonomous exploration of unknown terrains by a team of mobile nodes, referred to as agents. Because of the unreliability and short range of wireless communications in an indoor environment we suggest that agents communicate indirectly with each other by tagging the environment. Agents have no prior knowledge of the terrain map, but are able to coordinate in order to explore a variety of terrains with different topological features. In our experimental evaluation, we show that Brick&Mortar significantly outperforms the competing algorithms, namely Ants and Multiple Depth First Search, in terms of exploration time. The observed performance benefits suggest that our algorithm is suitable for safety-critical applications that require rapid area coverage for real-time event detection and response.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, the concept of broadcast feedback for stochastic cellular control systems is expanded to a system with nonuniform cellular length and nonuniform transition probability. The cellular control architecture was originally inspired by skeletal muscles comprising a vast number of tiny functional units, called sarcomeres. The output of the actuator system is an aggregate effect of numerous cellular units, each taking a bistable ON-OFF state. A central controller broadcasts the error between the aggregate output and a reference input. Rather than dictating the individual units to take specific states, the central controller merely broadcasts the overall error signal to all the cellular units uniformly. In turn each cellular unit makes a stochastic decision with a state transition probability, which is modulated in relation to the broadcasted error. Stability conditions of the broadcast feedback system are obtained by using a stochastic Lyapunov function. It is demonstrated that, even in the presence of the distribution of the cell length and/or the distribution of the transition probability generated in each cell, the aggregate output of the cellular units can track a given trajectory stably and robustly.",

The objective of the team is to build a multi-attribute map of the world by performing information fusion. A decentralized approach to information fusion is adopted to achieve the system properties of scalability and survivability. Decentralization imposes constraints on the design of the architecture and its implementation. We show how a component-based software engineering approach can address these constraints. The architecture is implemented using Orca - a component-based software framework for robotic systems. Experimental results from a deployed system comprised of an unmanned air vehicle, a ground vehicle, and two human operators are presented. A section on the lessons learned is included which may be applicable to other distributed systems with complex algorithms. We also compare Orca to the player software framework in the context of distributed systems.",

        "abstract": "Particle filters have been applied with great success to various state estimation problems in robotics. However, particle filters often require extensive parameter tweaking in order to work well in practice. This is based on two observations. First, particle filters typically rely on independence assumptions such as \"the beams in a laser scan are independent given the robot's location in a map\". Second, even when the noise parameters of the dynamical system are perfectly known, the sample-based approximation can result in poor filter performance. In this paper we introduce CRF-filters, a novel variant of particle filtering for sequential state estimation. CRF-filters are based on conditional random fields, which are discriminative models that can handle arbitrary dependencies between observations. We show how to learn the parameters of CRF-filters based on labeled training data. Experiments using a robot equipped with a laser range-finder demonstrate that our technique is able to learn parameters of the robot's motion and sensor models that result in good localization performance, without the need of additional parameter tweaking.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a method that requires only a single projected point to calibrate a pair of cameras attached to pan-tilt units (PTUs) in a hand-eye robot configuration. Most existing calibration methods require either a set of known calibration locations or a large number of corresponding image features. These requirements usually imply human intervention, which complicates the calibration procedure. Rather than using multiple points in the workspace, the proposed algorithm uses a single stationary point generated by aiming a laser at a planar surface for the entire calibration. The single point provides a high intensity feature that is easy to extract from the image. To exercise all of the PTU and camera degrees of freedom, a large number of random robot/PTU configurations are computed automatically and 60 configurations, where both cameras can extract the single calibration point, are retained. As a result, this approach minimizes image processing requirements and virtually eliminates the correspondence problem. Using the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear minimization algorithm, the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters for the pan-tilt axes along with the internal and external parameters of the cameras are computed. This method requires no human intervention, employs simple image processing to detect the high intensity laser point, and produces a triangulation error of roughly 3mm at a range of 1m.",

The novel scheme guarantees that the camera is always oriented such that the object of interest is in the field of view and that any reference point set corresponds indeed to a feasible camera pose. No camera calibration is necessary. As a novelty, this work is planning a camera motion, hence yielding compact paths in robot work space. The proposed planner is compared to others by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Motion capture systems are used to obtain motion data such that humanoid robots or computer graphics (CG) characters can behave naturally. However, it has proven to be hard not only to modify the capture data without losing its reality but also to search for the required capture data in a lot of capture data. In this paper, we provide a solution to these problems based on our previous work on symbolization of motion patterns for developing humanoid intelligence. Similar motion sequences in the database are abstracted as a symbol, which will be applied to searching motion patterns in the database similar to a given motion. This paper also introduces a method for building a stochastic symbol-word mapping model utilizing the word labels provided by the operator during motion capture sessions. This model converts a input sequence of words into a sequence of symbols, and then allows the capture database both to be searched for capture data corresponding to the input (a sequence of words) and to provide the users with new motion data generated by the symbols. Finally, we apply analogy of symbols to establishing the database in order to provide an appropriate motion data in response to an unsupervised sequence of words and then demonstrate the validity of analogy theory.",

In this paper, casting and winding manipulation of hyper-flexible manipulators (HFM) is considered. The HFM is modeled and analyzed as an underactuated multi-link system connected by non-elastic passive joints. An iterative revision method of parameter identification and state estimation is proposed. The method obtains highly credible parameters and state profiles from comparatively roughly visually sampled data using dynamic simulation. Succeeded and failed results of casting motion are analyzed by simulation and an energy-like function of position and velocity of HFM tip is defined. A control method to determine actuation timing to efficiently increase the energy-like function is proposed.",

        "abstract": "NASA's future lunar and martian missions will require a suite of advanced robotic systems to complete tasks during precursor visits and to assist humans while present on the surface. The Centaur is a new mobile, dexterous manipulation system designed with this future role in mind. Centaur combines the sophisticated upper body dexterity of NASA's humanoid, Robonaut, with a rugged and versatile four-wheeled base. This combination allows for robotic use of human tools and interfaces in remote locations by incorporating design improvements to the existing Robonaut that target the challenges of planetary field work: rough terrain, a varied environment (temperature, dust, wind, etc.), and distance from human operators. An overview of Centaur's design is presented focusing on the features that serve to mitigate the above risks and allow the robot to perform human-like tasks in unstructured environments. The success of this design is also demonstrated by the results of a recent coordinated field demonstration in which Centaur, under both teleoperated and autonomous control, cooperated with other NASA robots.",

        "abstract": "We tackle a fish-catching task under a visual feedback hand-eye system with catching net. The fishes change escaping trajectory or speed up when being threatened as the net attached at hand approaches to them. Furthermore, as the time of tracking and catching process flows, the fish can somewhat get accustomed to the hand motion pattern and gradually find out new strategies on how to escape from the bothering net. For example, the fish can swim slowly along the pool edge where the net is forbidden to enter or keep a reasonable distance from the net as if it knows the visual servoing system bears steady state error by constant speed escaping. For the sake of such innate ability being widely existed in animal's behavior, the catching operation becomes tough and some effective intelligent method needs to be conceived to go beyond the fish's intelligence. The purpose of this research is to construct intelligent system to be able to exceed the fish's intelligence to survive. Then we embed chaotic motion into the hand motion of robot, and we have shown the chaotic net motion can overcome the fish escaping strategies",

The video demonstrates that the City-Climber robots can operate on virtually any kind of smooth or rough surfaces and have the capabilities to move on the ground, climb walls, and transit between them. The modular design achieves both fast motion of each module on planar surfaces and smooth transition between the surfaces by a set of two modules. The video also displays the Fluent simulation results of the aerodynamic attraction with the aim to optimize the design. DSP-based control system is introduced which enables the robot to operate both manually and autonomously.",

The technique utilizes a support vector machine classifier to form class boundaries in a feature space composed of statistics related to inertial and (optional) wheel speed measurements. The proposed algorithm is validated using experimental data collected with an autonomous robot operating in an outdoor environment. Additionally, two detector fusion techniques are proposed to combine the outputs of multiple immobilization detectors. One technique is proposed to minimize false immobilization detections. A second technique is proposed to increase overall detection accuracy while maintaining rapid detector response. The two fusion techniques are demonstrated experimentally using the detection algorithm proposed in this work and a dynamic model-based algorithm. It is shown that the proposed techniques can be used to rapidly and robustly detect mobile robot immobilization in outdoor environments, even in the absence of absolute position information.",

This is because the light intensity decreases with the distance from objects in water by light attenuation. Robots on the ground or in air usually recognize surrounding environments by using images acquired with cameras. The same is/will be true of underwater robots. However, recognition methods in air based on image processing techniques may become invalid in water because of light attenuation. Therefore, we propose a color registration method of underwater images. The proposed method estimates underwater environments where images are acquired, in other words, parameters essential to color registration, by using more than two images. After estimating parameters, color registration is executed with consideration of light attenuation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments.",

The objective is to calculate the gaze direction and simultaneously plan the trajectory of the robot over a given time horizon, so that localization and map estimation errors are minimized while the unknown environment is explored. Most existing approaches perform a greedy optimization for the trajectory generation only over the next time step and usually neglect the limited field of view of visual sensors and consequently the need for gaze direction control. In the proposed approach an information-based objective function is used, in order to perform multiple step planning of robot motion, which quantifies a trade-off between localization, map accuracy and exploration. Relative entropy is used as an information metric for the gaze direction control. The result is an intelligent exploring mobile robot, which produces an accurate model of the environment and can cope with very uncertain robot models and sensor measurements",

The framework allows selection of \"good\" features for each cue, along with factors of their \"goodness\" to select the best combination form. Two particle filter based trackers, which use edge and texture features, run independently. The output of the master tracker is computed using democratic integration using the \"goodness\" weights. The final output is used as apriori for both tracker in the next iteration. Finally, particle filters are used to deal with non-Gaussian errors in feature extraction / prior computation. Results are shown for planar object tracking",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Monitoring ocean dynamics is extremely difficult due to its enormous physical dimensions and the wide range of spatio-temporal scales involved in its dynamical behaviour. It has been recently proposed that the most efficient way to monitor the ocean is through networks of small, intelligent and cheap robotic platforms. Drifting profiling floats and gliders were developed in this context. Floats move with the currents meanwhile they periodically sample the water column through controlled immersions. Conversely, gliders are underwater autonomous vehicles with controllable motion at sea. Both platforms are extensively employed in oceanography due to their high autonomy. A network called Argo of around 3000 profiling floats spreads out around the world's ocean. Glider networks are starting to settle down at smaller scale in different places. The advent of these networks and the still scarce resources for ocean sampling, create a demand for quantitative tools for optimizing their use. In this work, the problem of optimally merging networks of profiling floats and gliders is considered. Specifically, a genetic algorithm is employed to find optimal glider trajectories to get together an unevenly distributed network of floats the best quality of the sampled field. A measure of the quality of the oceanographic field (objective function to minimize) is defined in terms of the mean formal error obtained from an optimum interpolation scheme. Results show that the quality of the sampled field can be greatly improved by merging both networks if the resolution of glider observations is adequately selected. The spatial lag between glider observations is related to the geometry of the network of profiling floats and must be order of the grid spacing obtained from the mean data spacing of the network of floats.",

However, theoretical performance and a proper taxonomy of optimization objectives have remained scarce until recent studies. Implementations from different authors have not been compared in common grounds and in light of these recent findings. In this paper we address this lack of comparative experimentation, providing simulation results on a large real life based scenario and in random worlds. Two intuitive optimization objectives, minimum total resource usage and minimum total time, are evaluated in object searching missions. A method for flexible tailoring of the bidding rules is presented and new insight is gained on the effect of using hybrid criteria for the optimization objective.",

        "abstract": "In current conventional method, the sewer pipe inspection is undertaken using a cable-tethered robot with an on-board video camera system, completely, tele-operated by human operator. All commercial sewer inspection robots have platforms with poor mobility functions so that those robots are only capable to move into the straight pipes. Inspecting the sewage pipes using the state of the arts inspection methods by the current robots is costly, mostly human cost, and not fast enough to check and inspect the amount of sewage pipes will grow stronger than it has actually happened, specially in Japan. In order to realize inexpensive and effective inspection system, an autonomous pipe inspection method should be introduced to improve the inspection efficiency by reducing the time and manpower in the inspection process. The development of a fully autonomous pipe inspection system, requires design and development of an un-tethered mobile robot equipped with the required sensors using for autonomous pipe assessment and damage detection, and capability of navigating, completely, autonomously inside of sewer networks including different types of pipe-bends such as curves and junctions. KANTARO, presented in this paper, is the prototype of a passive-active intelligent, fully autonomous, un-tethered robot which has an intelligent modular architecture in its sensor and mechanism. KANTARO prototype robot, including a novel passive-active intelligent moving mechanism, can move into the straight pipe and pass various kinds of pipe bends without need to any intelligence of the controller or sensor reading. In order to realize a fully autonomous inspection robot, we also developed a small and intelligent 2D laser scanner for detecting of the navigational landmarks, independently with the main computer system, and fusion with a fish eye camera to assess the pipe state and fault detection.",

In this paper we discuss the configuration control and recalibration of a different class of reconfigurable robots, one which is equipped with lockable cylindrical joints with no actuators or sensors. Such a robot can be as versatile and agile as a hyper-redundant manipulator, but with a simpler, more compact, lighter design. A passive joint becomes controllable when the robot forms a closed kinematic chain and the joint lock is released. After reconfiguration, the values of the passive joints are computed from the value of the active joints using inverse kinematics of the closed chain. That problem is solved using a globally uniformly asymptotically stable scheme based on closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK). An asymptotically stable reconfiguration controller is also devised that takes the robot from one configuration to another by directly regulating the values of the passive joints. The controller has a rather simple structure, which only relies on the robot gravity and kinematics models. Conditions for the observability and the controllability of the passive joints are also derived in detail, and some numerical results are reported.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Affordable and competitive industrial automation is of key importance for small and medium enterprises, in Europe and elsewhere. A key factor is the introduction of new robot automation concepts that ease fast deployment and extend available task repertoire. The Gantry-Tau manipulator is a new robot concept. In contrast to other parallel kinematic manipulators (PKMs), it has a large working range. The high stiffness makes it ideal for a wide range of tasks such as grinding, deburring, and cutting. An additional aspect of such a PKM is the modularity, which in this work has been studied in terms of possibilities for assembly and mechanical reconfiguration at the end-user site, integration of such a kinematically different robot with a standard industrial controller, and new needs for methods/tools to support simple (re)configuration. What is needed for fully utilizing the modularity of the concept in typical SME manufacturing scenarios? A range of software tools and methods were found to be useful and necessary for efficient engineering and integration. For experimental evaluation, a full-scale prototype robot was designed and built, the kinematic software was developed and integrated into the ABB kinematics software, robot CAD software was adapted to the configuration needs, and both simulations and physical experiments were carried out. Our findings make us believe that enhanced software tools should be integrated on a higher symbolic (or meta-) level to better support transformation of data and code generation, but also that the Gantry-Tau type of robot (with adequate software support) will bring a new dimension of flexibility into SME manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "The contact tonometer is commonly used for measuring the internal eye pressure to diagnose glaucoma. However, the conventional eye pressure measurement is valid only under the assumption that all subjects have the same structural eye stiffness. This paper challenges to measure the contact area between the probe and the cornea in addition to the corneal deformation for considering the individual differences in the structural eye stiffness. Prior to the experiment, a spherical model of an eye is developed and the analytical eye stiffness is introduced. The experiment is conducted based on the contact method where a contact probe is pressed on an anesthetized cornea. The deformation of the cornea and the contact area are captured by cameras during the experiment. The experimental results show that the measured stiffness nicely matches the analytical solution based on the constructed model. However, some subjects have different relationships between the displacement and the contact area even with similar estimated eye pressures. This suggests that the structural eye stiffness should be considered for more precise diagnoses of glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning and adaptive motor control have enabled efficient techniques for online learning of stationary plant dynamics and it's use for robust predictive control. However, in realistic domains, system dynamics often change based on unobserved external contexts such as work load or contact conditions with other objects. Previous multiple model approaches to solving this problem are restricted to finite, discrete contexts without any generalization and have been tested only on linear systems. We present a framework for estimation of context through hidden latent variable extraction - solely from experienced (non-linear) dynamics. This work refines the multiple model formalism to bootstrap context separation from context-unlabeled data and enables simultaneous online context estimation, dynamics learning and control based on a consistent probabilistic formulation. Most importantly, it extends the framework to a continuous latent model representation of context under specific assumptions of load distribution",

Our goal is to ensure a good viewing condition and good illumination of an object to perform vision-based task (recognition, tracking, etc.). Within the visual servoing framework, we propose solutions to two different issues: maximizing the brightness of the scene and maximizing the contrast in the image. Solutions are proposed to consider either a static light and a moving camera, eitheror a moving light and a static/moving camera. The proposed method is independent of the structure, color and aspect of the objects. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images are finally presented.",

Finally, a control method incorporating the first and second steps, and which prevents overload at vulnerable tissue, is shown.

We analyze the singularity of PRP braking torques, and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that impedance characteristics is realized on PRP with human's pushing. This allows a PRP to track a 2D path which includes motion perpendicular to human's pushing direction without using servo motors, and multi-PRPs to work cooperatively on handling a single object with orientation control for avoiding collision with obstacles. Experimental results are shown to illustrate the validity of the proposed concept.",

        "abstract": "The matrix vasoconstriction device (MVD) is a scalable mechanism than can control the fluid flow through a vascular network with n2  wet shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators using 2n+2 constrictors (control elements). This vascular network delivers hot and cold fluid to conductively heat and cool shape memory alloy (SMA) muscles embedded in compliant vessels. The MVD mimics smooth muscles found in biological systems by constricting fluidic vessels to prevent flow. When released, the MVD does not add any fluidic resistance to the system, which has reduced the effective fluid resistance of the vascular network to 20% of the previous vascular system controlled by solenoid valves, therefore increasing the flow rate by a factor of 5. With the MVD's increased flow rates, a cycling rate of one Hz has been achieved for a single actuator. The MVD has (2n - 1)2 possible configurations, which allow fluid flow through a single or multiple vessels at the intersection of one or more released row and column constrictors. As the number of released vessels increases, the total fluid resistance of the system decreases and the total flow through the system increases. Releasing all the constrictors, the flow through a 4 times 4 array can produce 3.5 actuations per unit time (where the unit time is the time necessary to drive a single actuator). This paper examines the operation of the MVD as it controls the ternary fluid flow (hot, cold, no flow) to an n times n array of wet SMA actuators operating independently and operating columns of actuators that are connected mechanically series with each other",

        "abstract": "Remote manipulation tasks in the small scale can often not be performed autonomously, due to the unstructured nature of the environments and the limited capabilities of sensor and localization technologies. For these tasks, teleoperated systems are used, in which the human operator is integral part of the control. In time-delayed teleoperation, the operator gradually adopts discrete control strategies, such as 'move-and-wait'. In this paper, we present and compare three different control strategies for driving a nanomanipulation system with direct vision feedback. Two strategies are based on a fixed step size to move the manipulator, while the third uses a variable step size. The strategies are compared on a 2D fine positioning task. Experimental results are in agreement with Fitts' law and show that the third strategy, besides allowing movements of size ranging across several orders of magnitude, also allows to complete the fine positioning task in less time. The control strategies can be used in general to control vision-guided teleoperation systems affected by time delay.",

It shows that, when the constraints are linear, the controller can take advantage of linear programming algorithms (such as the simplex) to guarantee that the constraints will be satisfied. To illustrate the contribution of the approach, the control problem of a wheeled stair-climbing robot is considered. Masses supported by the robot have to be moved in order to avoid any sliding of the wheels. For such control problems where strong nonlinearities occur, conventional control methods fail to provide any reliable controller.",

According to the desired formation, a synchronization control goal is derived, based on which the position synchronization error is defined as differential position errors between very pair of two neighboring robots. A decentralized trajectory tracking controller is then developed with feedback of both position and synchronization errors, formed with a combination of feedforward and feedback controls. It is proven that this tracking controller can asymptotically converge both position and synchronization errors to zero. Simulations are performed on a group of twenty fully-actuated mobile robots in a switching task between different ellipse curves. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous control design for the formation control.",

In virtual reality with haptic feedback this kind of stimulation is not available because the haptic devices currently available allow to simulate a contact point force interaction thus preventing the deformation of the fingerpads. The aim of this work is that of proposing a novel contact model to augment the information conveyed during kinesthetic interaction with single-point haptic devices. We extended the classic god-point algorithm by using a pseudo-ellipsoidal force field that creates anisotropic compliance in the neighborhood of the contact point. We performed several experiments in order to verify that such contact model can provide information about contact surface orientation even in absence of vision and of free voluntary exploration. The main finding was that participants could identify the orientation of the contact surface when the compliance was maximum in the tangential plane by using small exploratory movements allowed by the penalty-based contact model.",

        "abstract": "A coverage algorithm is an algorithm that deploys a strategy as to how to cover all points in terms of a given area using some set of sensors. In the past decades a lot of research has gone into development of coverage algorithms. Initially, the focus was coverage of structured and semi-structured indoor areas, but with time and development of better sensors and introduction of GPS, the focus has turned to outdoor coverage. Due to the unstructured nature of an outdoor environment, covering an outdoor area with all its obstacles and simultaneously performing reliable localization is a difficult task. In this paper, two path planning algorithms suitable for solving outdoor coverage tasks are introduced. The algorithms take into account the kinematic constraints of an under-actuated car-like vehicle, minimize trajectory curvatures, and dynamically avoid detected obstacles in the vicinity, all in real-time. We demonstrate the performance of the coverage algorithm in the field by achieving 95% coverage using an autonomous tractor mower without the aid of any absolute localization system or constraints on the physical boundaries of the area.",

From the environment geometry analysis, we deduce a structure called navigation graph, which is the base to our method. After the description of this structure, we introduce a set of algorithms dedicated to answer navigation queries with a set of various solution paths and to execute the planned navigation in an efficient manner. We equally demonstrate method performance and robustness over several examples.",

        "abstract": "Automated transport of suspended objects is a subject of importance in many manufacturing, construction, and military applications. Suppression of the natural oscillation of payloads after a transport motion has been extensively studied, but generalized planar motion has yet to be examined. Obstacles in a crane or robot workspace may necessitate transport using a sequence of many linear segments or by a sequence of fewer curvilinear ones. The use of curvilinear motions in such cases may have the following advantages: (1) less error buildup in optimization due to the use of fewer segments, and (2) faster transport. We investigate parametrically-defined polynomial spatial paths optimized using dynamic programming. We present simulations and experimental evaluations of these optimizations.",

The fluid generates a powerful jet flow, which we call an ECF jet, when subjected to high DC voltage with highly non-uniform electric field, which means, it works as a fluid power source for mechanical components without bulky pumps. We introduce this attractive smart fluid to micromotors in this paper. Inside the motor is filled with the electro-conjugate fluid and a rotor has electrode pairs on the surface. By applying high DC voltage to the electrode pairs, the rotor rotates due to the ECF jet. In this paper, we design several types of electrode pairs and examine each influence on motor performances.",

        "abstract": "When using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a mobile robot with bearing-only measurements, it is crucial to correctly assign correspondences between measurements and registered features in the map, otherwise the filter diverges or becomes inconsistent. Conventional methods based on the Mahalanobis distance metric may produce data association ambiguities. Its reliability may further be degraded in bearing-only SLAM due to the limited amount of information delivered from the sensor. The data association process is cast here as that of making a decision based on the sensor measurement as whether to update the EKF or not. For this, cost functions are applied taking into account the interferences from other features. The proposed approach enhances robustness of the data association and consequently assures the performance of bearing-only SLAM. Results from simulations and experiments are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in a typical indoor scenario.",

The control law is adaptive in that it integrates sensor measurements to provide a converging estimate of the distribution of sensory information in the environment. It is decentralized in that it requires only information local to each robot. A Lyapunov-type proof is used to show that the control law causes the network to converge to a near-optimal sensing configuration, and the controller is demonstrated in numerical simulations. This technique suggests a broader application of adaptive control methodologies to decentralized control problems in unknown dynamical environments.",

        "abstract": "Classical path planning does not address many of the challenges of robotic systems subject to differential constraints. While there have been many recent efforts to develop motion planning algorithms for systems with differential constraints (MPD), very little has been said about the existence of exact algorithms. In other words, the decidability of MPD problems is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a partial answer to this question limiting ourselves to special cases where the trajectory functions of the systems under the finite-dimensional piecewise-continuous controls have a closed-form polynomial formulation. We define an abstract formulation for the MPD problem based on the concept of a control space. We provide an incremental decision algorithm to answer the decidability question and present sufficient conditions for problems to which this algorithm can be applied. Decidability results for several non trivial MPD problems are presented. For example, we show that the question of existence of a trajectory for a Dubin's car with a polygonal rigid body between two specified positions and orientations in a polygonal environment with a fixed and finite number of discontinuities in curvature is decidable.",

The information extracted from the homography are then used to design a control law which allow us to fully decouple rotational motions from translational motions. Real time experimental results using an eye-to-hand robotic system with a paracatadioptric camera are presented and confirm the validity of our approach.",

Control is achieved through the use of stigmergic potential fields, a form of cooperative motor schema behavior based upon mathematical functions that are associated with entities in the operational environment of the vehicle.

        "abstract": "Robot egomotion can be estimated from an acquired video stream up to the scale of the scene. To remove this uncertainty (and obtain true egomotion), a distance within the scene needs to be known. If no a priori knowledge on the scene is assumed, the usual solution is to derive \"in some way\" the initial distance from the camera to a target object. This paper proposes a new, very simple way to obtain such a distance, when a zooming camera is available and there is a planar target in the scene. Similarly to \"two-grid calibration\" algorithms, no estimation of the camera parameters is required, and no assumption on the optical axis stability between the different focal lengths is needed. Quite the reverse, the non stability of the optical axis between the different focal lengths is the key ingredient that enables to derive our depth estimate, by applying a result in projective geometry. Experiments carried out on a mobile robot platform show the promise of the approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present an analysis of a point mass, point foot, planar inverted pendulum model for bipedal walking. Using this model, we derive expressions for a conserved quantity, the \"orbital energy\", given a smooth center of mass trajectory. Given a closed form center of mass trajectory, the equation for the orbital energy is a closed form expression except for an integral term, which we show to be the first moment of area under the center of mass path. Hence, given a center of mass trajectory, it is straightforward and computationally simple to compute phase portraits for the system. In fact, for many classes of trajectories, such as those in which height is a polynomial function of center of mass horizontal displacement, the orbital energy can be solved in closed form. Given expressions for the orbital energy, we can compute where the foot should be placed or how the center of mass trajectory should be modified in order to achieve a desired velocity on the next step. We demonstrate our results using a planar biped simulation with light legs and point mass body. We parameterize the center of mass trajectory with a fifth order polynomial function. We demonstrate how the parameters of this polynomial and step length can be changed in order to achieve a desired next step velocity.",

        "abstract": "Microgrippers based on electrothermal actuation were designed and fabricated using the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process with 100mum thick silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer. The design requirements are restricted to basic manipulation tasks such as pick and place, and nonprehensile manipulation. This paper explores several electrothermal end-effectors which have been fabricated for serial and parallel microassembly. The end-effectors include three main building blocks: 1) Integrated and symmetrical actuators of V and U shapes. The symmetrical expansions on Chevron and hot arms allow combination of forward translations that amplify angular motion at the tips of a gripper. 2) A joule heating element based on a resistive V-shape electrothermal actuator. In 3D microassembly, the joining of a micropart is essentially performed by providing an integrated microheater device. 3) A force or position feedback sensing block based on self-straining or electrostatic principle. The integrated sensor can be calibrated for both position and force measurements. Serial heterogeneous assembly of meso and micro-scale objects is demonstrated using a 3D microassembly station. Black-box dynamical models for microgrippers are derived using experimentally obtained data, and performance variations due to the way the microgrippers are mounted onto the robot are discussed.",

An infrared (IR) diode is used to illuminate the workspace. A ball is attached to the tip of an intraocular shaft to reflect IR rays onto the PSDs. Instrument tip position is then calculated from the centroid positions of reflected IR light on the respective PSDs. The system can be used to assess the accuracy of hand-held microsurgical instruments and operator performance in micromanipulation tasks, such as microsurgeries. In order to eliminate inherent nonlinearity of the PSDs and lenses, calibration is performed using a feedforward neural network. After calibration, percentage RMS error is reduced from about 5.46 % to about 0.16%. The system RMS noise is about 0.7 mum. The sampling rate of the system is 250 Hz.",

The robot is designed to be capable of propelling itself through oscillations of a flexible caudal fin, like a real underwater fish. In particular, the caudal fin is driven by a mechanism actuated by a unique actuator called electrostatic film motor. In this paper, the dynamics of the electrostatic film motor are briefly introduced so as to well understand its characteristics and behavior. Based on the theoretical analysis and several design considerations inspired by biological concepts, we realize the fish-like robot actuated by an electrostatic film motor and propose swimming control methods for it. Experiments are carried out to confirm the validity of the original design and control. The current robot achieves fish-like maneuvering and approximate velocity of 0.018 m/s in dielectric liquid.",

This paper presents the design of the prosthesis prototype, which is in essence a two degree-of-freedom powered robot mechanically attached to a user, and describes an impedance-based control approach that coordinates the motion of the prosthesis and user for the control of level walking. The control approach is implemented on the prosthesis prototype, and experimental results are shown that indicate the effectiveness of the active prosthesis and control approach in restoring fully powered level walking to the user. Finally, an accompanying video demonstrates the functioning prosthesis in level walking.",

Despite the apparent similarities with hopping, jumping dynamics is peculiar and involve non-trivial issues on actuation powering, energy saving and stability. The \"Grillo\" robot described here is a quadruped, 50-mm robot that weights about 15 grams and is suited for a long-jumping gait. Inspired by frog locomotion, a tiny motor load the springs connected to the hind limbs. At take-off, an escapement mechanism releases the loaded springs. This provides a peak power output that can exceed several times the maximum motor power. In this way, the actuation and energy systems can be significantly reduced in weight and size. On the other hand, passive dynamics is exploited by compliant forelegs, that let to partially recover the impact energy in their elastic recoil. Equipped with a 0.2W DC motor, the robot is dimensioned to achieve a forward speed of 1.5 m/s, which corresponds to about 30 body length per second.",

        "abstract": "The commercial development of haptic devices is very promising. Existing systems are often 6-degree-of-freedom mechanisms equipped with a stylus that acts as a tool. They exhibit force feedback for 3 or 6 degrees of freedom of their end-effector, depending on whether only forces or both forces and torques are rendered. Some planar devices are also used but oddly, one-degree-of-freedom linear haptic devices are quite rare. This lack can probably be explained by the necessary mechanical transformations that are required to achieve linear motions with rotary motors. In this paper, we review several possible structures and present the design of a new one-degree-of-freedom linear haptic device with a limited number of joints and a compact design, compatible with rotary actuation. We evaluate this device in the telemanipulation context.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design of a new telepresence vision system developed to realize a higher immersive feeling for telemanipulation tasks. A new measure of 'permissible visual errors' was defined. Making use of this new measure, a minimal vision system is designed, containing only the strictly necessary DOF's (degrees of freedom) while keeping the vision errors below an experimentally obtained set of permissible errors. The result is a 4DOF camera system, containing two rotational joints (pan-tilt) and two prismatic joints (horizontal plane.) An evaluation of the system was done through a telemanipulation task using a unified hand/arm teleoperation testbed. It was found that during use of the vision system almost all visual errors remained within the permissible errors. The proposed vision system design framework suggests to break away from simply (and often blindly) mimicking human appearance. Although we only dealt with the vision system design, the same concept could be used when designing any other part of a robot.",

This robot will be capable of dynamic running using mechanical leg springs, as well as dynamic ballistic walking with human-like passive leg swing behavior. The BiMASC will enable the study of the role of both controllable compliance in running and will serve as a test platform for control strategies that utilize the leg springs and other natural dynamics of the robot. The mechanism is designed to behave in a dynamically \"clean\" manner, such that relatively simple mathematical models will accurately predict the robot's behavior. The availability of simple and accurate mathematical models will facilitate the design of controllers, accurate simulations, and the implementation of accurate model-based control on the robot.",

An augmented Jacobian describing the kinematics of the eye and the relative motion of each one of the two Intra-Ocular Dexterity Robots (IODR) is presented. Using this framework, the capabilities of this two-armed robot in performing dexterous intraocular operations are evaluated and compared to a similar robot without intra-ocular dexterity. The Kinematic Conditioning Index (KCI) for the proposed robot is shown to be significant. The results presented show an increase of approximately 33% and 47% in translational and rotational KCI respectively.",

Applications can be found in early detection of neuro-developmental disorders via a new generation of mechatronic toys for assessing the regular development of perceptual and motor skills in infants, in particular coordination of mobile and multiple frames of reference during manipulation. This paper focuses on the design of a novel mechatronic toy, shaped as a 5 cm (diameter) ball, i.e. small enough to be grasped with a single hand by a 1 year old child. The sensorized ball is designed to embed a kinematics sensing unit, able to sense both the orientation in 3D space and linear accelerations, as well as a force sensing unit, to detect grasping patterns during manipulation.

        "abstract": "The manipulation of flexible and limp sheet materials is a common requirement in many industrial manufacturing processes, however automation of even simple tasks involving these difficult to handle materials tends to be particularly problematic. The industrial manufacture of lasagne ready meals is one example of a process that has been almost completely automated except for the handling of the flexible lasagna pasta, which remains a highly repetitive and labour intensive manual task. In this paper a robotic end-effector is developed to enable the automatic handling of lasagna pasta sheets. The design of the end-effector is described and its performance evaluated through testing using a robot arm. The concept was further developed into a low cost fixed automation machine suitable for industrial use. The pneumatic pick and place type machine was able to pick a pasta sheet from a moving conveyor and place it into a plastic tray with a cycle time of less than 4 seconds.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and initial results for an autonomous jumping microrobot. At the millimeter size scale, jumping can offer numerous advantages for efficient locomotion, including dealing with obstacles and potentially even latching onto other larger mobile hosts. Robot design is divided into four primary areas: energy storage, actuation, power, and control. Like its biological inspiration, the flea, a jumping microrobot requires an energy storage system to store energy and release it quickly to jump. Silicone micro rubber bands have been fabricated and assembled into the microrobot for this task. To stretch these micro rubber bands, electrostatic inchworm motors are chosen as actuators due to their high forces, long throw, and low input power requirements. Finally, solar cells and a microcontroller have been chosen to power and control the microrobot. A small-scale version of this system has been prototyped with the solar cells and a simple 4-bit microcontroller driving an inchworm motor. Separately, an inchworm motor has been demonstrated pulling and storing 4.9 nJ of energy in a micro rubber band. Finally, initial tests with a probe-loaded robot prototype have demonstrated a microrobot which can potentially jump 1.2 cm straight up.",

The knee brace provides variable damping controlled in ways that foster motor recovery in stroke patients. A resistive, variable damper, electro-rheological fluid (ERF) based component is used to facilitate knee flexion during stance by providing resistance to knee buckling. Furthermore, the knee brace is used to assist in knee control during swing, i.e. to allow patients to achieve adequate knee flexion for toe clearance and adequate knee extension in preparation to heel strike. The detailed design of AKROD, the first prototype built, closed loop control results and initial human testing are presented here",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In laparoscopic surgery, surgeons can use only rod-shaped instruments that can be inserted through a trocar and therefore high technique is required. To overcome this problem, much work has been done to develop multi-degree-of-freedom forceps. However they are still inadequate to grasp, manipulate or push aside large internal organs, like a spleen, pancreas, and liver. This paper proposes mechanical hands with detachable fingers that can be assembled in the abdominal cavity, each of whose parts can be inserted through a trocar. Two types of such three-fingered hands are developed. The three fingers of one are dependently driven and those of the other are independently driven. For each hand, we show fixing and power transmission mechanisms. Power of each hand is transmitted from operator's hand to its fingers by connecting wires with a ball and socket. Experimental results verify that both hands can grasp large and oily objects like internal organs. One goal of this study is to develop simple hands that can be used as a retractor. The other goal is to develop skillful hands that can replace surgeons' hands in hand assisted laparoscopic surgery which is still invasive by making a 7-8cm incision to insert a human hand into the abdominal cavity.",

Our experiments give clear indication that the proposed scheme has a good performance in detecting such unusual events as vehicles running on red light and making forbidden turns.",

A network of static sensor nodes with limited communication and processing are deployed in a planar environment along with a mobile node which can both sense and move. As the mobile node moves through the environment, it computes the local spatial gradient of the field by communicating with its immediate neighbors in the static sensor network. The algorithm causes the mobile node to perform gradient descent on the scalar field till it arrives at a location on the desired contour. From this point onwards, the algorithm drives the mobile node to trace the desired contour without departing from it. Experiments in simulation indicate that the required contour is found with reasonable accuracy (between 80-90%) for networks with node degree of greater than or equal to six. Our results also indicate that the paths generated by our algorithm are near-optimal in terms of the distance traversed by the mobile node. Our preliminary experimental results with a physical robot show that our algorithm is feasible.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development and initial testing of a new and optimized version of a steady-hand manipulator for retinal microsurgery. In the steady-hand paradigm, the surgeon and the robot share control of a tool attached to the robot through a force sensor. The robot controller senses forces exerted by the operator on the tool and uses this information in various control modes to provide smooth, tremor-free, precise positional control and force scaling. The steady-hand manipulator reported here has been specifically designed with the unique constraints of retinal microsurgery in mind. In particular, the system makes use of a compact wrist design that places the bulk of the robot away from the operating field. The resulting system has high efficacy, flexibility and ergonomics while meeting the accuracy and safety requirements of microsurgery. We have now tested this robot on a biological model system and we report a protocol for reliably cannulating ~80 \u03bcm OD veins (the size of veins in the human retina) using the system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Emschergenossenschaft based in Germany is currently planning the Emscher sewer system, arguably the largest residential water management project in Europe in years to come. The Emschergenossenschaft engaged the Fraunhofer Institute for Factory Operation and Automation (IFF) in Magdeburg, Germany, as the general contractor to develop automatic inspection and cleaning systems to meet the requirements imposed by legal guidelines. The systems must operate continuously in a sewer line that has diameters ranging from 1400 to 2800 mm and is partially filled, 25% at minimum, all the time. To construct the Emscher sewer system, the Emschergenossenschaft favors a one-pipe line in long sections. A walk-through or inspection by personnel would be impossible in these sections. The Fraunhofer Institute IFF has developed prototypes of all systems for motion through the sewer and all sensor systems, thus achieving a new quality of inspection above and below the water line under these difficult conditions. This article describes significant project results and important components of inspection such as the inspection systems, pipe axis measurement, system positioning, and sensor systems for damage detection. Fundamental for the development of the inspection systems is the detail of the inspection, which goes far beyond the video inspection common today, and the ability to take comparative measurements throughout the sewer system's period of operation in order to track the development of damage.",

The new linear actuators developed have been installed in WL-16RII, and several experiments were conducted. Through experiments involving walking with a wide step length and ascending a stair with landing pattern modification control, the effectiveness of the actuator developed is confirmed.",

Furthermore, as a result of optimizing design parameters of the robot through computer simulation, we arrive at the optimal design parameters with 200 gf payload.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new bending mechanism with a screw drive mechanism, which enables omni-directional bending motion by rotating two linkages consisted of right-handed screw, universal joint and left-handed screw. We call this mechanism double-screw-drive (DSD) mechanism. DSD mechanism was applied to a robotic forceps manipulator for laparoscopic surgery. In the first prototype, by adding the third linkage to DSD mechanism and rotating this, opening and closing motions of a gripper was attained. In the second prototype, DSD forceps manipulator was enhanced so that its gripper can rotate. This is achieved by rotating the third linkage in DSD mechanism. On the other hand, the opening and closing motions of a gripper is attained by wire-drive. The developed DSD forceps manipulator realizes bending motion without using wires. Therefore, it has high rigidity, and it can bend 90 degrees in arbitrary direction. In order to control the developed DSD robotic forceps manipulator as teleoperation system, joy-stick type manipulator for remote control was built and servo system was constructed for each linkage. Servo experiments show the effectiveness of the constructed control system.",

We show that a 3-PPscr a* mechanism is generically undergoes 3-dimensional purely translational motion. Based on the 3-PPscr a* topology, an integrated optimal design on both architecture and geometry design is carried out. Using the formulation of maximizing effective cubic workspace, the Orthopod, which has three orthogonally arranged linear joint axes, is found to be the best in our settings. A prototype machine of the Orthopod is thus designed and manufactured.",

The SUSM is constructed from three ring-shaped stators and a spherical rotor, and has three degrees of freedom (DOF). It has good responsiveness, high positioning accuracy, and strong magnetic field compatibility. In the attitude sensing system, a flat mirror is built in the spherical rotor. Light is emitted to the mirror, and the reflection is caught by optical fibers. The light intensities captured by the optical fibers are processed by a neural network and are converted to attitude information for the spherical rotor. We describe a system comprising the SUSM and the attitude sensing system with its design derived from mechanics and optics. The prototype SUSM is 26mm in diameter and was actuated by the attitude sensing system. Position errors with respect to x and y axes are less than 0.5deg.",

        "abstract": "Surgeons, during a medical intervention, perform different kinds of manual tasks with dexterity and precision. In order to assure the success of the intervention, medical students are trained several years using training models so that they can perform such tasks with accuracy to avoid any possible risk to patients. However, current training models are merely designed to imitate the surgical procedure without providing any further information about the how well the task was done. For that reason; in this paper, the development of a suture/ligature training system is proposed to imitate surgical procedures as well as provide quantitative information of the learning progress of trainees. As a first approach, a training system was designed to simulate the suture and ligature tasks. The proposed training system includes a skin dummy with an array of embedded photo interrupters to detect the movement of the skin dummy; without requiring any modification on the surgical instrument. In this paper, different task parameters were proposed to understand trainees' learning progress and different experiments were carried out to identify the evaluation parameters that may provide useful information about how well the task was performed. As a result from the experiments, the evaluation parameters for the suture and ligature were determined. Finally, an evaluation function was proposed and further experiments were proposed to verify its effectiveness. From the results of the experiments, we could effectively distinguish quantitatively the differences of skill levels between surgeons and unskilled persons as well as identifying the learning progress of trainees by plotting the learning curve",

        "abstract": "Despite of a promising potential robots based on parallel kinematic structures have not yet found their way into industry on a large scale. One of the main reasons for that is a workspace to installation-space ratio, which usually is inferior to that of their serial counterparts. In this paper development and design issues of a triglide-robot based on the linear delta are presented. Using a workspace enlargement approach based on the use of several workspaces going along with different assembly modes of the structure's the workspace to installation-space ratio of this robot can be enhanced significantly. Additionally this paper is part of a joint effort of several authors to benchmark different kinematic structures using based-fixed linear drives against each other. Thus, the presented structure is characterized using standardized benchmark criteria.",

Initial tests on a 5-DOF robotic suit show a decrease in motion errors of over 20%, and an accelerated learning rate of 7%, both conservative given the system setup and statistically very significant (p les 0.01).

In their final stages of life, the pain is such that they cannot even roll over, one of the activities of daily life. With this in mind, in this research, we aim to develop equipment for patients with cancer bone metastasis to support roll-overs in terminal care. Specifically, the EMG signal, which is the input signal of the equipment, is discussed in this paper. The activities of four muscles affecting trunk movement were monitored during the process of rolling over. Following an EMG experiment with four subjects, the internal abdominal oblique (IO) muscle was seen to be active in the early stages of roll-over motion, although IO muscle was relatively prevalent in previous works. If we support roll-over at this point, the patient feels no pain, because the timing is detected before the strongest burden movement, which involves buoying the trunk and rotating the pelvis. Hence, the EMG signal of the IO muscle is suitable for the input of the signal to support roll-overs.",

        "abstract": "In bipedal walking, a trajectory is acceptable as long as it is repetitive and allows the foot to clear the ground, while allowing the biped to move forward. Since the actual trajectory followed by a biped is not as important, a biped having more than one passive joints can also meet the motion requirements. Due to physical constraints, a biped is under-actuated at the ground contact with the feet. A biped should exhibit limit cycles when moving continuously in an environment. In general, it is difficult to prove existence of limit cycles for nonlinear systems. In this work, we generate limit cycles for a class of nonlinear underactuated bipeds using differential flatness. A specific inertia distribution renders the biped design differentially flat. Differential Flatness allows generation of a family of limit cycles amenable to numerical optimization. The results are illustrated by two DOF biped.",

        "abstract": "Recent biological research suggests that reliable, agile climbing on smooth vertical surfaces requires controllable adhesion. In nature, geckos control adhesion by properly loading the compliant adhesive structures on their toes. These strongly anisotropic dry adhesive structures produce large frictional and adhesive forces when subjected to certain force/motion trajectories. Smooth detachment is obtained by simply reversing these trajectories. Each toe's hierarchical structure facilitates intimate conformation to the climbing surface resulting in a balanced stress distribution across the entire adhesive area. By controlling the internal forces among feet, the gecko can achieve the loading conditions necessary to generate the desired amount of adhesion. The same principles have been applied to the design and manufacture of feet for a climbing robot. The manufacturing process of these Directional Polymer Stalks is detailed along with test results comparing them to conventional adhesives.",

We developed a method to estimate the distance to the hidden object by applying acoustic diffraction of audible sound. Our method is based on time-of-flight (TOF), which has been used in ultrasound ranging systems. We determined the best frequency of audible sound and designed its optimal modulated signal for our system. We determined that the system estimates the distance to the hidden object as well as the obstacle. However, the measurement signal obtained from the hidden object was weak. Thus, interference from sound signals reflected from other objects or walls was not negligible. Therefore, we combined acoustical holography (AH) and TOF, which enabled a partial analysis of the reflection sound intensity field around the obstacle and hidden object. Our method was effective for ranging two objects of the same size within a 1.2 m depth range. The accuracy of our method was 3 cm for the obstacle, and 6 cm for the hidden object.",

In our formulation, each agent maintains a target estimate, and each agent moves so as to maximize the expected information from its sensor, relative to the current uncertainty in the estimate. The novelty of our approach is that each agent need only communicate with one-hop neighbors in a communication network, resulting in a fully distributed and scalable algorithm, yet the performance of the system approximates that of a centralized optimal solution to the same problem. We provide two fully distributed algorithms based on one-time measurements and a Kalman filter approach, and we validate the algorithms with simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates target tracking using a distributed particle filter over sensor networks. Gaussian mixture model is adopted to approximate the posterior distribution of weighted particles in this distributed particle filter. The parameters of Gaussian mixture model are exchanged between neighbor sensor nodes. Each node can obtain the Gaussian mixture model representing particle's posterior distribution through the parameter exchange. With the posterior distribution, the distributed particle filter can draw particles from it, predicted particles and observations, update particle weights, and re-sample particles based the predicted weights. The parameter exchange is key to implement the distributed operation. It is implemented by using an average consensus filter. Through this consensus filter, each sensor node can gradually diffuse its local statistics of weighted particles over the entire network and asymptotically obtain the estimated global statistics. The parameters of Gaussian mixture model can be calculated by using the estimated global statistics. Because the average consensus filter only requires that each sensor node communicate with its neighbors, the proposed distributed particle filter is scalable and robust. Simulations of tracking tasks in a sensor network with 100 sensor nodes are given.",

These properties cannot easily be detected from any single module, though they might readily be detected by combining the knowledge of multiple modules. Testing for distributed conditions is especially important in debugging or verifying the correctness of software for modular robots. We have developed a technique we call distributed watchpoint triggers which can efficiently recognize such distributed conditions. Our watchpoint description language can handle a variety of temporal, spatial, and logical properties spanning multiple robots. This paper presents that language, describes our fully-distributed, online mechanism for detecting distributed conditions in a running system, and evaluates the performance of our implementation. We found that the performance of the system is highly dependent on the program being debugged, scales linearly with ensemble size, and is small enough to make the system practical in all but the worst case scenarios",

The disturbance rejection by force control is useful not only for self-balance, but also for stable and safety physical interaction between human and humanoid robots. The core technique is passivity-based contact force control with gravity-compensation. This makes it easy to control the contact forces in a satisfactory dynamic range without canceling all non-linear terms. The disturbance rejection is located at the higher layer above the contact force controller. It is composed of three sub-controllers; 1) a balancing controller; 2) a stepping controller; and 3) the trigger. Numerical simulations and experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Although the method is incomplete in the sense that the self-collision between the limbs is ignored, a preliminary experimental result on a real humanoid platform demonstrates that the proposed method can actually make the robot recover the balance under large unknown external perturbations.",

        "abstract": "We argue that an ability to determine the reversibility of actions allows a robot to identify safe behaviors autonomously. We introduce a notion of reversibility model and give a definition of model refinement. We implement this on a real robot and observe that, when a reversibility model is refined by the addition of proximity sensors, obstacle avoidance emerges as a side-effect of avoiding irreversible actions. We interpret this as evidence of a deep connection between reversibility and safe behaviour. We also observe that, on the real robot, reversibilities are learned as efficiently as a dedicated reward function. We conclude that reversibility identification may provide an abstract and yet practical method of generating a variety of safe behaviours.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Control of a robot manipulator in contact with the environment is usually conducted by the direct feedback control system using a force-torque sensor or the indirect impedance control scheme. Although these methods have been successfully applied to many applications, simultaneous control of force and position cannot be achieved. Furthermore, collision safety has been of primary concern in recent years with emergence of service robots in direct contact with humans. To cope with such problems, redundant actuation has been used to enhance the performance of a position/force controller. In this paper, the novel design of a double actuator unit (DAU) composed of double actuators and a planetary gear train is proposed to provide the capability of simultaneous control of position and force as well as the improved collision safety. Since one actuator controls position and the other actuator modulates stiffness, DAU can control the position and stiffness simultaneously at the same joint. The torque exerted on the joint can be estimated without an expensive torque/force sensor. DAU is capable of detecting dynamic collision by monitoring the speed of the stiffness modulator. Upon detection of dynamic collision, DAU immediately reduces its joint stiffness according to the collision magnitude, thus providing the optimum collision safety. It is shown from various experiments that DAU can provide good performance of position tracking, force estimation and collision safety.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the dribbling control problem of an omnidirectional mobile robot. Because the movement of the dribbled object must be considered, dribbling control is more challenging than normal mobile robot motion control. A new feedback control algorithm, which steers a reference point to follow the desired movement and keeps the ball near to this point simultaneously, is proposed. To dribble a rolling ball along a given path, the robot should provide the ball with appropriate force by consecutive pushing operations when they travel in an environment with obstacles. Based on the analysis of the forces acting on the ball with respect to the mobile robot coordinate system, a constraint for robot movement in the dribbling process is also introduced. The simulation and real-world experiments address the performance of this control algorithm.",

A Gaussian radial basis function neural network is employed for function approximation, and its weights are estimated stochastically in real-time. In contrast to adaptive certainty equivalence controllers hitherto published for mobile robots, the proposed control law takes into consideration the estimates' uncertainty, thereby leading to improved tracking performance. The proposed method is verified by realistic simulations and Monte Carlo analysis.",

        "abstract": "Realization of an energy-efficient and high-speed dynamic walking has come to be one of the main subjects in the research area of robotic biped locomotion, and passive dynamic walking has been widely attracted as a clue to solve the problem. It has been empirically known that the effect of convex curve shape of foot, which characterizes passive-dynamic walkers, is important to increase walking speed. This paper then investigates the driving mechanism of compasslike biped robots and the rolling effect of semicircular feet are mainly investigated. We first analyze the mechanism of a planar fully-actuated compass-like biped model to clarify the importance of ankle-joint torque introducing generalized virtual gravity concept. In the second, a planar underactuated biped model with semicircular feet is introduced and we show that virtual passive dynamic walking by hip-joint torque only can be realized based on the rolling effect. We then compare with a flat feet model through linear approximation, and show that the rolling effect is equivalent to its virtual ankle-joint torque. Throughout this paper, we provide novel insights into how ZMP-free robots can generate a dynamic bipedal gait.",

Also, the focus has been on the effect of guidance of motion during a task, rather than on the learning of motion skills through repetition. We present a pseudo-admittance framework for HMCS design to guide the user's velocity in such tasks. Two different fixture design approaches are analyzed, implemented and compared. Three tests are then conducted, showing the fixtures' promise for both guiding and learning motions with dynamics",

The proposed technique suggests the possibility of taking advantage of the whole body motion in order to facilitate the lifting movement. In particular, the idea is to perform a preliminary motion in order to generate a momentum which is instantaneously transferred to the object as an impulsive force. This allows the humanoid to lift up an object that could not be lifted up only by continuous force. However an impulsive force may make the humanoid unstable. Then, we propose to set the center of percussion (CoPn) of the whole system at the center of the support polygon of the humanoid when it lifts up the object. We also propose a design method of a preliminary motion of the humanoid that generates a sufficient momentum to lift up an object without any slip, tumble and hop of the whole system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation and experiment.",

The dynamic model is developed based on the geometric model of extensible continuum robot manipulators with no torsional effects. The development presented in this paper is an extension of the dynamic model proposed by Mochiyama and Suzuki (2002) to include a class of extensible continuum robot manipulators. Numerical simulation results are presented for a planar 3-link extensible continuum robot manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Most of present work for autonomous navigation in dynamic environment doesn't take into account the dynamics of the obstacles or the limits of the perception system. To face these problems we applied the probabilistic velocity obstacle (PVO) approach (Kluge and Prassler, 2004) to a dynamic occupancy grid. The paper presents a method to estimate the probability of collision where uncertainty in position, shape and velocity of the obstacles, occlusions and limited sensor range contribute directly to the computation. A simple navigation algorithm is then presented in order to apply the method to collision avoidance and goal driven control. Simulation results show that the robot is able to adapt its behaviour to the level of available knowledge and navigate safely among obstacles with a constant linear velocity. Extensions to non-linear, non-constant velocities are proposed.",

        "abstract": "To solve decision making problems of multi-agent systems, researchers have devised complicated methods, which are expected to solve curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we go to the opposite extreme. We generate cooperative behavior of two soccer robots with a simple dynamic programming (DP), which was proposed in '50s. Through the example, the ability of DP on a recent computer is measured and evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. We then show that the simple structure of DP is useful in obtaining behavior of robots in a convincing way. In the implementation of DP, space that is spanned by eight variables for decision making is divided into 610 million states. DP solves the optimal actions of two robots in every division and creates a look-up table, which is called a state-action map. The ability of this state-action map is measured by simulation and the result is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic stability reflects the vehicle's ability to traverse uneven terrain at high speeds. It is determined from the set of admissible speeds and tangential accelerations of the center of mass along the path, subject to the ground force and geometric path constraints. This paper presents an analytical method for computing the stability margins of a planar all-wheel drive vehicle that accounts for soil parameters. It consists of mapping the ground force constraints to constraints on the vehicle's speeds and accelerations along the path. The boundaries of the set of admissible speeds and accelerations determine the static and dynamic stability margins, used to gage the traversability of the vehicle along the path. The first is the maximum feasible acceleration at zero speed, whereas the second is the maximum feasible speed. Both stability margins are demonstrated for a planar vehicle moving on a sinusoidal path.",

Next, we represent Lagrangian of the soft-fingered hand system that includes the elastic energy of the fingertip, the four constraints, and also gravity effect. Furthermore, we express equations of motion of the grasped object from the Lagrangian, and simulate the dynamic behavior of the object. Finally, we clarify that the position and posture of the object always converge to a corresponding point when a pair of fingers is freely activated.",

The moving obstacles are modelled as moving cells in the occupancy grid map and their motion is predicted by applying a procedure similar to the dynamic window approach. The collision points of the robot predicted trajectory and moving cells predicted trajectories form the new active obstacles in the environment, which should be avoided.

        "abstract": "Negotiations have been a widespread research topic in politics, economics, and management for decades. Recently, with the rapid growth of on-line bargains, automatic negotiations have become more and more important. Although many automatic negotiation strategies have been presented, most of them are focused on simple negotiations composed of independent multiple issues. These strategies can not be applied to realistic complicated negotiations made up of dependent multiple issues. Therefore, we propose a mechanism named joint genetic algorithm (JGA) to deal with e-negotiations of dependent multiple issues. In JGA, a joint search strategy is applied to find the satisfactory contract accepted by both parties, by means of the genetic algorithm to predict and learn opponent's preference. Experimental results show that JGA can facilitate to make a deal efficiently under different circumstances of conflict scenarios.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we describe divide and conquer SLAM (D&C SLAM), an algorithm for performing simultaneous localization and mapping using the extended Kalman filter. D&C SLAM overcomes the two fundamental limitations of standard EKF SLAM: 1.) the computational cost per step is reduced from O(n2) to O(n) (the cost full SLAM is reduced from O(n3) to O(n2)); 2.) the resulting vehicle and map estimates have better consistency properties than standard EKF SLAM in the sense that the computed state covariance adequately represents the real error in the estimation. Unlike many current large scale EKF SLAM techniques, this algorithm computes an exact solution, without relying on approximations or simplifications to reduce computational complexity. Also, estimates and covariances are available when needed by data association without any further computation. Empirical results show that, as a bi-product of reduced computations, and without losing precision because of approximations, D&C SLAM has better consistency properties than standard EKF SLAM. Both characteristics allow to extend the range of environments that can be mapped in real time using EKF. We describe the algorithm and study its computational cost and consistency properties.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at acquiring robust rotation, scale, and translation-invariant feature from a space-variant image by a fovea sensor. A proposed model of eccentricity compensator corrects deformation that occurs in a log-polar image when the fovea sensor is not centered at a target, that is, when eccentricity exists. An image simulator in discrete space remaps a compensated log-polar image using this model. This paper proposes unreliable feature omission (UFO) that reduces local high frequency noise in the space-variant image using discrete wavelet transform. It discards coefficients when they are regarded as unreliable based on digitized errors of the input image. The first simulation mainly tests geometric performance of the compensator, in case without noise. This result shows the compensator performs well and its root mean square error (RMSE) changes only by up to 2.54 [%] in condition of eccentricity within 34.08[deg]. The second simulation applies UFO to the log-polar image remapped by the compensator, taking its space-variant resolution into account. The result draws a conclusion that UFO performs better in case with more white Gaussian noise (WGN), even if the resolution of the compensated log-polar image is not isotropic.",

In this work we present the automatic localization of a wide variety of differently shaped objects scanned with a laser range sensor from one view in a cluttered setting. The daily-life objects are modeled using approximated superquadrics, which can be obtained from showing the object or another modeling process. Detection is based on a hierarchical RANSAC search to obtain fast detection results and the voting of sorted quality-of-fit criteria. The probabilistic search starts from low resolution and refines hypotheses at increasingly higher resolution levels. Criteria for object shape and the relationship of object parts together with a ranking procedure and a ranked voting process result in a combined ranking of hypothesis using a minimum number of parameters. Experiments from cluttered table top scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, feasible for real world object localization and robot grasp planning.",

Similar to prior kinodynamic planning methods, the sampled nodes in our roadmaps are generated based on dynamic simulation. Moreover, we bias these samples by using constraint forces designed to avoid collisions while moving toward the goal configuration. We adaptively reduce the complexity of the state space by determining a subset of joints that contribute most towards the motion and only simulate these joints. Based on these configurations, we compute a valid path that satisfies non-penetration, kinematic, and dynamics constraints. Our approach can be easily combined with a variety of motion planning algorithms including probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) and applied to articulated robots with hundreds of joints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several challenging benchmarks.",

A coarse global motion planner first computes a kinematically feasible obstacle-free path in a discretized 3D workspace which roughly satisfies the kinematic constraints of the UAV. Given a coarse global path, a fine local motion planner is used to compute a more accurate trajectory for the UAV at a higher level of detail. The local planner is iterated as the vehicle traverses and refines the global path as needed up to its planning horizon. We also introduce a new planning heuristic for 3D motions of fixed-wing UAVs based on 2D Dubins curves, along with precomputed sets of motion primitives derived from the vehicle dynamics model in order to achieve high efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Many compelling future surgical applications will be enabled by a new kind of surgical tool, capable of entering the human body through natural orifices or very small incisions and then reconfiguring into complex kinematic structures at the site of intervention. We describe a first step toward this goal - the development of a microactuator designed for use in surgical robots that are composed of large quantities of reconfigurable micro-robotic modules. The miniaturizable design proposed harnesses the Bourdon effect to convert electrolytic pressure into mechanical motion obtaining more than 400% displacement variation while consuming less than 0.5 W at less than 5 V. We describe the design, construction, and experimental results with our prototype microactuator.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Real-time emergent stop walking motion is necessary for humanoid robots. We propose a new emergent stop method using modification criteria map. The stable gait change is generated by adjusting the amount of the ZMP modification according to the timing of stop command. The modified ZMP trajectory is given so that the humanoid robot can change the current motion without falling down. The modification criteria are defined from the relation between the predicted ZMP trajectory using a preview controller and the support polygon. The preview controller employs table-cart model and it derives center of mass (CoM) trajectory from ZMP reference in real-time. We make the map of relation among the ZMP modification length, the modification timing and the timing of the stop command for stable gait modification. The robot can execute the best motion referring to the predefined map. In this method, the humanoid robot can stop immediately within one step or zero step to avoid a collision, if humans or objects appeared unexpectedly in front of the walking humanoid robot. The stop motion is typically divided two phase: single leg support phase and double leg support phase. In the single leg support phase, the next landing position and timing are decided according to command time of the stop signal. In the double leg support phase, the humanoid robot can stop anytime without changing standing position. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by experiment using a humanoid robot HRP-2.",

Especially the communication of those robots with a human operator is a complex task since more than 60% of human communication is conducted non-verbally by using facial expressions and gestures. Although several humanoid robots have been designed it is unclear how a control architecture can be developed to realize a robot with the ability to interact with humans in a natural way. This paper therefore presents a behavior-based emotional control architecture for the humanoid robot head ROMAN. The architecture is based on 3 main parts: emotions, drives and actions which interact with each other to realize the human-like behavior of the robot. The communication with the environment is realized with the help of different sensors and actuators which will also be introduced in this paper.",

        "abstract": "An encountered-type visual haptic display using flexible sheet is proposed; it allows users to feel like seeing and pushing virtual soft objects directly. Both edges of a translucent flexible sheet such as rubber is attached to two manipulators. They apply bias tension to the sheet by pulling it from both sides, thus varying the sheet compliance. A user can feel the compliance of a virtual soft object by pushing the sheet with his finger directly. The motion of the finger tip is measured by stereo cameras. The manipulators also change the pose of the sheet along the object's surface together with the finger tip motion. The user can touch different points of the object and feel like stroking it with his finger. This sheet is also used as a rear projection screen. From the measured finger tip position, the deformation of the object is calculated by FEM. An LCD projector projects the CG image of the deformed object stereoscopically on the sheet from its back. The user can see the 3D image through stereoscopic glasses and touch the image directly. A method of correcting the CG image distortion caused by the movement of the sheet and the depression of the pushed sheet is proposed. A virtual soft cylinder is expressed by a prototype display: the stroking of the cylinder and the correction of its 3D image are evaluated.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the energetic effects of adding springs at the passive ankles of a planar five-link, four-actuator walking biped robot. The energetic cost of walking with springs was determined by using a walking motion designed for the biped without springs added. The walking motion was then optimized for the presence of springs of various arbitrarily chosen stiffnesses and offset angles. The stability properties of the motions that resulted were checked. The energetic costs of walking and standing were then computed. It was found that standing with springs was more efficient, while walking was more costly than the same action without springs. Finally, the spring characteristics (stiffness and offset angle) and the motion were optimized simultaneously. The costs for walking and standing were computed, revealing that walking with springs was more efficient and standing was more costly than doing either without springs. A methodical approach to choosing the size of the feet based on this analysis of the spring characteristics is also presented.",

While minimizing the tracking energy consumption is proved to be NP-complete, an approximately optimal solution named breadth-first leader-follower strategy is presented. Nodes close to the target predicted position find their following nodes based on breadth-first search and lead them to cover the probable region where the target may exist next time instant. Meantime the overall network connectivity can be maintained. We have proved that the energy consumption of the nodes moving under the control of the proposed algorithm is within a scalar factor of the optimal consumption. Simulation has been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in different situations. The results show that our algorithm can yield good performance in target tracking while consuming little energy.",

SONE can be used as an algorithm for obtaining network topology by propagating reinforcement signals between the elements of a network. Traditionally, the analysis of fundamental features in SONE and their application to supervised learning tasks were difficult because the learning method of SONE was limited to reinforcement learning. Here the abilities of generalization, incremental learning, and temporal sequence learning were evaluated using a supervised learning method with SONE. Moreover, the proposed method enabled our SONE to be applied to a greater variety of tasks.",

        "abstract": "Portable, modular and extensible software allows robotics researchers to pool their resources by sharing algorithms, thus advancing research in the field of robotics at a faster rate than is possible under a non-collaborative model. The development and use of frameworks and middleware, allowing researchers to encapsulate robotic capabilities within a component structure, has traditionally been the focus of robotics software engineering research. Although components greatly enhance the software mechanism's portability, modularity and extensibility, they do not directly address the algorithmic issues confronting developers of robotics software. Software algorithms, implementing specific robotic capabilities, require input data and produce output results. As a rule, these input/output data representations are closely tied to a given algorithmic implementation and hence impose limitations on modularity and extensibility. This paper investigates the use of generic data representations to enhance software modularity and extensibility. Experiments, conducted on the DRDC raptor unmanned ground vehicle, compared the performance of algorithms based upon both generic and algorithm specific data representations. This research has determined that the performance penalty, resulting from generic data representations usage, is manageable by robotic platforms using current off-the-shelf computing platforms.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a control approach for an active robotic walking support system based on environment feedback. The support system is controlled using imposed apparent dynamics and its parameters are varied by the environment information. The environment information will not cause any motion but will only change the characteristics or maneuverability of the support system. This approach leads to a passive behavior for an active walking support system. In addition, the stability of the support system based on the apparent dynamics is also discussed. This is important as a guideline on what parameters to vary that will not cause instability to the system. Experimental results are presented to show the validity of the control algorithm with environment feedback.",

In electrostatic film motors, feeding power to slider is important for better output capability and positioning performance. However, the power feeding using electric cables sometimes cause mechanical disturbance to the motor motions. In the new electrostatic motor, the power to the slider is fed by electrostatic induction, thus removing electric cables that can cause mechanical disturbances. The proposed motor has a two-phase electrode in the slider and a four-phase electrode in the stator. In addition, both stator and slider have the induction electrodes so that electric power is transferred to the slider through the induction electrodes. The paper first analyzes the thrust force characteristics of the proposed driving-electrode configuration, and then analyzes the characteristics of voltage induction, both based on capacitance-network analysis. The analyzed result is verified by experiments that showed good agreements with the provided analysis.",

        "abstract": "We present an \"Artificial Neural Tissue\" (ANT) architecture as a control system for autonomous multirobot tasks. This architecture combines a typical neural-network structure with a coarse-coding strategy that permits specialized areas to develop in the tissue which in turn allows such emergent capabilities as task decomposition. Only a single global fitness function and a set of allowable basis behaviors need be specified. An evolutionary (Darwinian) selection process is used to derive controllers for the task in simulation. This process results in the emergence of novel functionality through the task decomposition of mission goals. ANT-based controllers are shown to exhibit self-organization, employ stigmergy and make use of templates (unlabeled environmental cues). These controllers have been tested on a multirobot resource-collection task in which teams of robots with no explicit supervision can successfully avoid obstacles, explore terrain, locate resource material and collect it in a designated area by using a light beacon for reference and interpreting unlabeled perimeter markings. The issues of scalability and antagonism are addressed.",

The proposed strategy consists in separating the path planning from the control algorithm. The path planning is done by computing the time optimal collision-free trajectory which takes into account the limitations on the linear and angular speeds of the vehicle. The position and shape of obstacles are computed by a vision algorithm using a single camera. A saturated controller based on integral sliding mode is designed to solve the tracking problem in the presence of input saturations and of the unknown disturbances. The effectiveness, perfect performance of obstacle avoidance, real-time and high robustness properties are demonstrated by experimental results.",

The goal of this work is to enable the task of navigating multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) over length scales of O(100 km), while maintaining error tolerances commensurate with conventional long-baseline transponder-based navigation systems (i.e., O(1 m)), but without the requisite need for deploying, calibrating, and recovering seafloor anchored acoustic transponders. Our navigation system is comprised of an acoustic modem-based communication/navigation system that allows for onboard navigational data to be broadcast as a data packet by a source node, and for all passively receiving nodes to be able to decode the data packet to obtain a one-way travel time pseudo-range measurement and ephemeris data. We present results for two different field experiments using a two-node configuration consisting of a global positioning system (GPS) equipped surface ship acting as a global navigation aid to a Doppler-aided AUV. In each experiment, vehicle position was independently corroborated by other standard navigation means. Initial results for a maximum-likelihood sensor fusion framework are reported.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The dynamics of a rigid body sliding on a frictional contact can have multiple solutions as well as sudden contact-mode transitions. This paper is concerned with dynamic jamming, an event where a sliding rigid body suddenly jamms and experiences an impact-like transition into free flying mode. Using a simple experiment that mimics a sliding rigid-body situation, dynamic jamming is recorded for the first time. The phenomenon occurs almost at the theoretical position-and-velocity prediction, indicating that this type of jamming is not a mere artifact of the rigid-body modeling paradigm. A new interpretation of dynamic jamming is offered in terms of the body's instantaneous acceleration center. Once this center reaches a graphically determinable jamming line, the body ceases its sliding mode and experiences a dynamic jamming event. Based on this insight, some ways to prevent dynamic jamming are discussed.",

We derive a kinematic model of a snake robot with introducing links without wheels and shape controllable points in the snake robot's body in order to make the system redundancy controllable. By using redundancy, it becomes possible to accomplish the main objective of controlling the position and the attitude of the snake robot head and the shape of the snake robot, and the sub-objective of the singular configuration avoidance. Simulations and experimental results show the validity of the control law and how snake robots move at the neighborhood of the singular configuration.",

Based on an analytical solution of an inverted pendulum model, the trajectories of the COG (Center of Gravity) and the ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) are parameterized by polynomials. Since their coefficients can be efficiently computed with given boundary conditions, this framework can provide a real-time walking pattern generator for humanoid robots. To handle the unexpected result caused by immediate changes of foot placement, we made single support periods as an additional trajectory parameter and the ZMP fluctuation was suppressed by mixing the oppsite phase of the ZMP error. The effectiveness of our method is shown by experiments of the humanoid robot HRP-2.",

We also present experimental results comparing acoustic localization with GPS for surface operation, and a comparison of acoustic and visual methods for underwater operation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two methods able to exploit the information at the loop closure in the SLAM problem. Both methods have three fundamental advantages. The first one is that to apply the loop closure constraint they do not require to compute any correlation among the features which are not observed simultaneously. The second advantage is that the loop closure constraint can be applied only once at the end (even after more than one loop) in a single step with low computational complexity. Hence, the computational complexity during the robot exploration is independent of the number of features. Finally, the third advantage is that the linearization does not affect the estimation process. This especially holds for the second method, which is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The first method is based on the extended Kalman filter. Simulations show that these approaches significantly outperform the conventional EKF based SLAM both in the computational cost and in the map precision.",

After a brief outline of the algorithm, we summarize the outcomes of several numerical experiments meant to explore extensively the incremental behavior of the algorithm while controlling the coherence parameters. In order to assess the efficacy and the potential of the approach, the performances are also discussed in the light of the results on H-Walk, an algorithm specifically designed to adapt to variable coherence.",

We named the intended purposes for a place \"space-human activity association\". Intended purposes for a place will be different depending on the purpose of activities, even if observed activities are almost the same. Therefore, estimation of space-human activity association is important for intelligent environments to design services provided for individual human according to his/her current situation. The spatial memory system enables human users to store computerized information into the real world by assigning a three-dimensional position to the information, and to retrieve the information by directly indicating the point using their own hands. In the spatial memory system, what associates computerized information with a three-dimensional position is called \"spatial-knowledge-tag (SKT)\". The users actively create SKTs based on their need. As a result, arranged SKTs in a specified environment correspond to activity histories of the users. Also, users' intended purposes for the environment are reflected in the arrangement. Therefore, classification of arranged SKTs leads to classification of human activities, and accordingly estimation of intended purposes for places. In this paper, we describe two approaches to classify human activities. More specifically, the first approach is a classification of arranged SKTs by using only SKTs' information. The second approach is a classification of arranged SKTs by using both SKTs' information and usage history of the spatial memory system. As a result, the classification based on usage history of the spatial memory system showed multiple activities in the same area. On the other hand, the first approach resulted in a single cluster in the same area. We, then, give numerical values to SKT's conten... Show More",

        "abstract": "Current motion planners, in general, can neither \"see\" the world around them, nor learn from experience. That is, their reliance on collision tests as the only means of sensing the environment yields a tactile, myopic perception of the world. Such short-sightedness greatly limits any potential for detection, learning, or reasoning about frequently encountered situations. As a result, it is common for current planners to solve and re-solve the same general scenarios over and over, each time none the wiser. We thus propose a general approach for motion planning, as well as a specific illustrative algorithm, in which local sensory information, in conjunction with prior accumulated experience, are exploited to improve planner performance. Our approach relies on learning viability models for the agent's \"perceptual space\", and the use thereof to direct planning effort. Experiments with three test agents show significant speedups and skill-transfer between environments.",

        "abstract": "Range images can provide an almost 3-dimensional description of a scene. Feature driven segmentation of range images has been primarily used for 3D object recognition, and hence the accuracy of the detected features is a prominent issue. Feature extraction on range images has proven to be a more complex problem than on intensity images due to both the irregular distribution of range image data and the nature of the features that are present in range images. Approaches to range image feature extraction are often scan line based approximations that carry a significant computational overhead and hence are not appropriate for real-time processing. This paper presents a design procedure for scalable first order derivative operators that can be used directly on irregularly distributed data. Hence the method is appropriate for direct use on range image data without the requirement of image preprocessing and could form the basis of algorithms of real-time robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the dynamic model of a robot with antagonistic actuated joints is presented, and the problem of full linearization via static state feedback is analyzed. The use of transmission elements with nonlinear relation between the displacement and the actuated force allows to control both the position and the stiffness of each joint. The main advantage of this actuation modality is that the achieved stiffness becomes a mechanical characteristic of the system and it is not the result of an immediate control action as in the classical impedance control scheme (Davison, 2003). Different examples of implementation of this kind of devices are known in literature, even if limited to one single joint (Kjita et al., 2003; Laumond and Kineocam, 2006; Mansard and Chaumette, 2004 and 2006) and the application of antagonistic actuated kinematic chains in the field of robotic hand design is under investigation (Stasse et al., 2006). After a brief review of the dependence of the properties of antagonistic actuation on the transmission elements characteristics, a scheme for simultaneous stiffness-position control of the linearized system is presented. Finally, simulation results of a two-link antagonistic actuated arm are reported and discussed.",

The sensor utilizes a digital fringe projection and phase shifting technique to provide real-time 2D and 3D sensory information of the environment. The proposed sensor is unique over current technologies, in that it can directly map rubble in 3D and in real-time at a frame rate of up to 60 fps. Furthermore, we propose the development of a novel 3D visual SLAM method utilizing both 2D and 3D images taken by the sensor for robust and reliable landmark identification, mapping and localization algorithms utilizing a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT)-based approach. Preliminary experiments show the potential of the proposed 3D real-time sensory system for such unknown cluttered USAR environments.",

The strategies, called fixed-lag roughening and the block proposal distribution, both exploit \"future\" information, when it becomes available, to improve the filter's estimation for previous time steps. Fixed-lag roughening perturbs trajectory samples over a fixed lag time according to a Markov chain-Monte Carlo kernel. The block proposal distribution directly samples poses over a fixed lag from their fully joint distribution conditioned on all the available data. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed strategies, especially the block proposal, yield significant improvements in filter consistency and a reduction in particle degeneracies compared to standard sampling techniques such as the improved proposal distribution of FastSLAM 2.",

The system consists of a magnetic nanocoil as a propeller (27 nm thick ribbon, 3 \u03bcm in diameter, 30-40 \u03bcm long) driven by an arrangement of macro coils. The macro coils generate a rotating field that induces rotational motion in the nanocoil. Viscous forces during rotation result in a net axial propulsion force on the nanocoil. Modeling of fluid mechanics and magnetics was used to estimate the requirements for such a system. The fabrication of the magnetic nanocoils and the system setup are explained. Experimental results from electromagnetic actuation of nanocoils as well as from their propulsion in both paraffin oil and water are presented. This is the first time a propulsion system of this size and motion-type has been fabricated and experimentally verified.",

        "abstract": "The problem of robot drilling presents a significant challenge, due to the comparatively low mechanical stiffness of typical serial industrial robots. This compliance makes the robot deflect due to the cutting forces, resulting in poor hole quality. Recently, functionality for high-bandwidth force control has found its way into industrial robot control systems. This could potentially open up the possibility of robotic drilling systems with improved performance, using only standard systems without costly extra hardware and calibration techniques. In this paper, we present methods and systems for force-controlled robot drilling, based on active suppression of drill sliding through a model-based force control scheme. The methods are validated in a number of drilling experiments using an industrial robot.",

We have developed a method of collision avoidance that can be used in three dimensions in much the same way as autonomous ground vehicles that navigate over unexplored terrain. Safe navigation is accomplished by a combination of online environmental sensing, path planning and collision avoidance. Here we report results with an autonomous helicopter that operates at low elevations in uncharted environments some of which are densely populated with obstacles such as buildings, trees and wires. We have recently completed over 1000 successful runs in which the helicopter traveled between coarsely specified waypoints separated by hundreds of meters, at speeds up to 10 meters/sec at elevations of 5-10 meters above ground level. The helicopter safely avoids large objects like buildings and trees but also wires as thin as 6 mm. We believe this represents the first time an air vehicle has traveled this fast so close to obstacles. Here we focus on the collision avoidance method that learns to avoid obstacles by observing the performance of a human operator.",

In this paper, we decompose the contact force space into four orthogonal subspaces, each with a clear physical interpretation. Based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI's) representations of grasping constraints, we address and formulate the active force closure and the active grasp feasibility problems as LMI feasibility problems. Combining the effects of both active and passive forces, we propose a new cost index for the whole hand grasping force optimization problem.

        "abstract": "In this paper, an attitude control strategy is developed for a high-speed quadruped trot. The forces in the trot are redistributed among the legs to stabilize the pitch and roll of the system. An important aspect of the strategy is that the controller works to preserve the passive dynamics of quadruped trotting that are accurately predicted by the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. A hybrid control strategy is presented which allows the quadruped to reach a speed of 4.75 m/s and turn at a rate of 20 deg/s in simulation under operator control. The discrete part of the controller runs once per trot step and outputs a stance thrust energy and hip angles for touchdown. The stance thrust energy accounts for losses during the step, especially at touchdown. Both the stance thrust energy and hip angles dictate the natural dynamics during stance. The force redistribution algorithm continuously operates during stance to stabilize the body's tilt axes, roll and pitch, with minimal effect on the prescribed natural dynamics. The 1.0 m/s increase in speed over previously presented work is largely due to the more dynamically-consistent force redistribution algorithm presented in this paper. The controller also tracks desired changes in heading, for which the biomimetic method of banking into a high-speed turn is also realized.",

Although strain gages have been widely used, a new sensing approach is desirable for applications that require greater robustness, design flexibility and immunity to electromagnetic noise. An exoskeletal force sensing robot finger was developed by embedding fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors into a polymer-based structure. Multiple FBG sensors were embedded into the structure to allow the manipulator to sense and measure both contact forces and grasping forces. In order to fabricate a three-dimensional structure, a new shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) process was explored. The sensorized SDM-fabricated finger was then characterized using an FBG interrogator. A force localization scheme is also described",

Robot physical dimensions and dynamics are considered in the control design, p times differential bump functions are introduced and incorporated into novel potential functions for control design. Despite the robot limited sensing ranges, no switchings are needed to solve the collision avoidance problem.",

In this paper, we propose a framework for applying the same techniques to visual imagery, matching visual frames with large numbers of point features. The relationship between frames is kept as a nonlinear measurement, and can be used to solve large loop closures quickly. Both monocular (bearing-only) and binocular vision can be used to generate matches. Other advantages of our system are that no special landmark initialization is required, and large loops can be solved very quickly.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A new method for calculating the collision free areas of a manipulator's configuration space (C-space) is demonstrated in this paper. Rather than mapping a point obstacle to an n-dimensional surface in the C-space, the dual problem is considered. That is, regions of the C-space that are guaranteed to be collision free are determined. Whilst some configurations that are collision free are not captured by this method, its speed and low memory usage make it ideal for motion planning in the C-space. It is especially useful for mobile manipulators such as wall climbing robots, where the surrounding terrain changes with each step the robot takes. Being able to compute the mapping of Cartesian to C-space representations of objects in real time is essential, as the workspace for these robots is not static and therefore cannot be precalculated. Once the free areas of C-space have been determined, more conventional path planning techniques which have been developed for point robots moving around forbidden areas can be used for the generation of a motion plan. This means that motion planning can be guaranteed to have an exhaustive search through all possible paths and return the lowest cost path - something that has previously been difficult to achieve with other manipulator motion planning techniques. The technique is demonstrated for a 2-degree of freedom planar manipulator, and will be extended in the future to apply to higher dimensional C-spaces. Further developments are suggested for further optimisation of the technique, most notably the idea of partitioning the C-space.",

However, the energy in the haptic system is not directly measurable, but estimated from some measured quantities such as force and velocity; therefore, the estimated energy is occasionally inaccurate. To resolve this problem, a new observer, working in the frequency domain, is proposed in this research. The observer quantifies the degree of instability of a haptic system, and a proposed controller generates variable damping in proportion to this quantitative instability. Especially, for a double layered virtual wall, the proposed methods were much faster in detecting haptic instability than other schemes, and successfully reduced unstable behavior.",

We first show the fingertip position and the object orientation for generating a desired velocity of the object under the friction independent collision. Once the object results in a pure translational motion whose direction is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of object, it is guaranteed that two fingers can always capture the object irrespective of friction coefficient. By using this nature, we show both 2-step and 3-step capturing strategies for a 2D stick-shaped object whose width is negligibly small. The 3-step capturing strategy can guide the object in an arbitrary direction, while the 2-step one can do it only in a particular direction. The 3-step capturing strategy is demonstrated by experiment for verifying our idea.",

A contact model is first needed to enable robot control achieving these goals. The model should be both accurate and simple enough to allow further system analysis. In this paper we propose a simple parametric contact model, based on the form of the Hertz-Walton model. We experimentally demonstrate that this contact model can be effectively used to predict contact forces for linear and near-linear loading paths. Finally, we briefly discuss the applicability of the presented contact model for snake robot climbing. The control of the snake robot is based on stabilizing a sequence of set points.",

The approach consists of moving the probe in order to minimize the relative position between a target imaging plane and the ultrasound plane observed by the probe of the moving tissue target. The problem is decoupled into motion out-of-plane and motion within plane. For the former, a new original method based on the speckle information contained in the images is developed. For the latter, an image region tracker is used to provide the in-plane motion. A visual servoing control scheme is then developed to perform the tracking robotic task. The method is validated on simulated motions of a probe on a static ultrasound volume acquired from a phantom.",

The mobile platform has 3 rotations (3R) driven by three actuators mounted on the fixed base. A method is proposed for structural synthesis of 3R-PWs with uncoupled motions and fully-isotropic based on the theory of linear transformations. A one-to-one correspondence exists between the actuated joint velocity space and the operational velocity space of the moving platform. The Jacobian matrix mapping the three vector spaces of 3R-PWs with uncoupled motions is a 3 times 3 diagonal matrix. We use the condition number and the manipulability ellipsoids for their performance analysis. The Jacobian matrix of the fully-isotropic 3R-PWs presented in this paper is the 3 times 3 identity matrix throughout their entire workspace. The condition number and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix being equal to one, the manipulator performs very well with regard to force and motion transmission capabilities. As far as we are aware, this paper presents for the first time solutions of fully-isotropic three-degree-of-freedom parallel wrists.",

        "abstract": "A stability analysis and controller synthesis methodology for an inverted robot arm system is proposed in this paper. This uncertain system is modeled by a state space Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model with linear nominal part and structure bounded parameter uncertainties in the state equations of each fuzzy rule. First, a sufficient condition on robust stability of the continuous perturbed time-delay affine T-S (CPTDATS) fuzzy models of inverted robot arm is proposed. Then, Hinfin-disturbance attenuation performance of the fuzzy models is analyzed. At last, a numerical example shows the use of the proposed approach on the stabilization and Hinfin-disturbance attenuation for the inverted robot arm systems.",

        "abstract": "Human gait is a kind of dynamic biometrical feature which is complex and difficult to imitate, it is unique and more secure than static features such as password, fingerprint and facial feature. Analyzing people walking patterns, their \"step-prints\", can lead to the recognition of personal identity. In this paper, we propose to design, build, calibrate, analyze, and use wearable intelligent shoes; then focus on classifying the wearers into authorized ones and unauthorized ones by modeling their individual gait performance. Firstly the intelligent shoes for collecting and modeling human gait to measure an unprecedented number of parameters relevant to gait are presented. Then we introduce cascade neural networks with node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering (CNN-NDEKF) from the paper by Nechyba and Xu (1997) to apply for modeling and classifier generation. Finally, the experimental results of learning algorithms and comparison are described and verify that the proposed method is valid and useful for human identification.",

        "abstract": "Blimps are a promising platform for aerial robotics and have been studied extensively for this purpose. Unlike other aerial vehicles, blimps are relatively safe and also possess the ability to loiter for long periods. These advantages, however, have been difficult to exploit because blimp dynamics are complex and inherently non-linear. The classical approach to system modeling represents the system as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on Newtonian principles. A more recent modeling approach is based on representing state transitions as a Gaussian process (GP). In this paper, we present a general technique for system identification that combines these two modeling approaches into a single formulation. This is done by training a Gaussian process on the residual between the non-linear model and ground truth training data. The result is a GP-enhanced model that provides an estimate of uncertainty in addition to giving better state predictions than either ODE or GP alone. We show how the GP-enhanced model can be used in conjunction with reinforcement learning to generate a blimp controller that is superior to those learned with ODE or GP models alone.",

We used salting-out gel-tools impregnated with Bromothymol Blue (BTB), which is a pH indicator. The gel-tool is made of hydrophilic photo-crosslinkable resin. The primary constituent of this photo-crosslinkable resin is polyethyleneglycol. A solution mixed with photo-crosslinkable resin, BTB, high concentrations of an electrolytic solution are stirred, and gel beads impregnated with BTB are obtained. Gel-tools are cured by UV-ray and adhere to the glass plate, but we can manipulate them by the optical tweezers. We can measure pH value locally from the color of gel-tool using calibrated color information in YCrCb color space. We succeeded in measuring local pH value with the pH sensing gel-tool by manipulating and locating it at the desired point in the microchip.",

However, one limitation of the theory of regions and its aforementioned derivatives is that they cannot be applied when the target behavior has a non-convex representation in the underlying state space. In this paper, we show how this problem can be circumvented by appropriately generalizing the employed class of the candidate policies.",

A collision between the mobile-sphere motion and an obstacle is predicted by computing its minimum translational distance. This distance parameterizes an intermediate configuration for the sphere, which is in contact with the obstacle or separated a configurable distance. Collision with a given obstacle is then avoided by forcing the mobile sphere to pass through a selected intermediate configuration. This paper describes a technique to reduce or to grow this configuration (sphere) in order to bring it into contact (or as close as desired) with a second obstacle. This fact provides the path planner some remarkable properties like it really generates a set of homotopic paths in narrow environments for not only a sphere but any other mobile object which always keeps inside the volume represented by the generated path.",

        "abstract": "Recently, active researches have been performed to increase a robot's intelligence so as to realize the dexterous tasks in complex environment such as in the street or homes. However, since the skillful human-like task ability is so difficult to be formulated for the robot, not only the analytical and theoretical control researches but also the direct human motion mimetic approach is necessary. In this paper, we propose that to realize the environmental interactive tasks, such as human care tasks, it is insufficient to replay the human motion along. We show a novel motion generation approach to integrate the cognitive information into the mimic of human motions so as to realize the final complex task by the robot.",

        "abstract": "Quasistatic multi-legged locomotion consists of a sequence of equilibrium postures where the mechanism supports itself against gravity while moving free limbs to new positions. A posture maintains equilibrium if the contacts can passively support the mechanism against gravity. This paper is concerned with computation and graphical characterization of equilibrium postures for mechanisms supported by frictional contacts in a three-dimensional gravitational field. For a given set of contacts, this problem reduces to the computing feasible region R, defined as the center-of-mass positions that maintain equilibrium while satisfying the frictional constraints. This paper continues a previous work by the authors, and provides a new method for computing the boundary of R for 3-contact stances. The paper also gives physical and geometric interpretations for the boundary of R and discusses its relation with the classical support polygon principle. Finally, the paper reports experimental results that validate the theoretical computation.",

It is an indispensable function for humanoid robots to get up by itself and some humanoid robots are able to get up by themselves, but the motion can start only from the states specified a prior.

The proposed method (l) determines the degree of similarity between the current falling state and predefined falling states using Mahalanobis distance, (2) generates a collision-free motion to the most similar state, and (3) plans a sequence of motions using a state transition graph.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of generating global feasible trajectories for nonholonomic mobile robots in the presence of moving obstacles. The global trajectory is composed of regional path segments, which are parametric polynomials incorporating collision avoidance criteria. Collision avoidance with moving obstacles is achieved by changing parameters of the regional trajectories, and the collision avoidance parameters are solutions to a second-order inequality and are obtainable analytically. To have a smooth global trajectory, we also develop a smooth irregular curve method to generate continuous boundary conditions to connecting regional trajectories. Steering control laws are constructed by means of differential flatness. The proposed technique works in dynamic environments where a set of global way-points are available, and the velocities of the obstacles are obtainable real time. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a force magnifying mechanism for a parallel jaw gripper that can exert a large grasp force. A parallel jaw gripper requires speed when opening and closing its jaws, and force when grasping an object. The proposed force magnifying mechanism consists of a slider, feed screws, gears, a lever, etc. It runs sequentially with only one DC-motor. Basically the motor rotates a feed screw to move its output jaw quickly to an object with a gear. When the output jaw makes contact with an object, the gear is loosened from a stopper and starts to move axially along the feed screw. Then it pushes a lever, which generates a large fingertip force. We have developed an 86g gripper with this mechanism and experimentally verified that it can grasp objects of various sizes with a large grasp force over 200N. It is also experimentally verified that the gripper can grasp and ungrasp an object reliably over 4500 times if machine lubricant is properly supplied.",

        "abstract": "Planning realizable and stable grasps on 3D objects is crucial for many robotics applications, but grasp planners often ignore the relative sizes of the robotic hand and the object being grasped or do not account for physical joint and positioning limitations. We present a grasp planner that can consider the full range of parameters of a real hand and an arbitrary object, including physical and material properties as well as environmental obstacles and forces, and produce an output grasp that can be immediately executed. We do this by decomposing a 3D model into a superquadric 'decomposition tree' which we use to prune the intractably large space of possible grasps into a subspace that is likely to contain many good grasps. This subspace can be sampled and evaluated in GraspIt!, our 3D grasping simulator, to find a set of highly stable grasps, all of which are physically realizable. We show grasp results on various models using a Barrett hand.",

In this paper, we present a new design for gravity balancing of the human leg using an external orthosis.

The major issues addressed in this paper are: (i) design for gravity balancing of the human leg and the orthosis, (ii) kinematic compatibility of the human leg and the external orthosis during walking, (iii) comparison of the joint torque trajectories of the human leg with and without external orthosis, and (iv) effects of variation of the link lengths and masses of the human leg on the inertia of the external orthosis. We illustrate feasible 2D and 3D designs of the external orthosis through computer simulations. Fabrication of this design will be the subject of future work.",

We present a new tree-based planner that explicitly deals with kinodynamic constraints and addresses the safety issues when planning under finite computation times, meaning that the vehicle avoids collisions in its evolving configuration space. In order to achieve good performance we incrementally update a tree data-structure by retaining information from previous steps and we bias the search of the planner with a greedy, yet probabilistically complete state space exploration strategy. Moreover, the number of collision checks required to guarantee safety is kept to a minimum. We compare our technique with alternative approaches as a standalone planner and show that it achieves favorable performance when planning with dynamics. We have applied the planner to solve a challenging replanning problem involving the mapping of an unknown workspace with a nonholonomic platform",

In consequence, a growing body of literature interrogates simplified \"template\" (Full and Koditschek, 1999; Ghigliazza et al., 2005) models - to date almost exclusively confined to sagittal- or horizontal-plane motion - with the aim of gaining insight into the design or control of the far messier reality. In this paper we introduce a simple bounding-in-place (\"BIP\") model as a candidate frontal plane template for straight-ahead level ground running and explore its use in formulating hypotheses about whether and why rolling motion is important in legged locomotion. Numerical study of left-right compliance asymmetry in the BIP model suggests that compliance ratios yielding lowest steady state roll suffer far longer disturbance recovery transients than those promoting greater steady state roll. We offer preliminary experimental data obtained from video motion capture data of the frontal plane disturbance recovery patterns of a RHex-like hexapod suggesting a correspondence to the conclusions of the numerical study.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of deploying a set of mobile sensor nodes of heterogeneous sensing ranges to give a large and connected coverage. A novel deployment algorithm based on the circle packing technique is given. It iteratively enhances the coverage area of the sensor network from an initial random deployment, while guarantees the absence of coverage hole and obstacle avoidance. The sensing area of each node is modeled as a circular disc while its radius is bounded by the corresponding sensing range limit. The problem of placing these circular discs to cover a field is intuitively transformed to the circle packing problem: given the specified combinatorics of tangency patterns of n circles, find the label R denoting the radii of these circles. Since a unique packing exists for any given set of triangulations and boundary conditions, we can always find the minimum sensing range required for every interior node to satisfy such packing conditions. Though an extension from tangency packing to overlap packing, the interstices among triples (which represent coverage holes) can be eliminated. We have proven that the maximum global scaling factor to vanish all possible interstices is alpha = 3^((1/2)/2. Based on a number of numerical simulations, we have verified that the proposed algorithm always yields sensor deployments of wide coverage and minimize the sensing ranges required for every interior sensing node to satisfy the packing and boundary conditions.",

        "abstract": "An increasingly common new modality in human-computer interaction is haptic interfacing, especially in the field of medical simulation. The order-of-magnitude difference in update rates between graphical deformable object simulations and haptic interfaces can be bridged using local low-order approximations. However, providing force feedback using local models complicates collision detection and response with the virtual tool, since the user interacts with lower-order proxies rather than the full simulated objects. A novel approach focusing on rolling contact with stick-slip friction is presented where all collision detection and response with the virtual tool is performed at the local level at the haptic time-scale, utilizing linearized low-order local models that approximate the behavior of the full model for the short time steps and small deformations involved.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a method for high precision relative localization using a single camera is proposed. The method provides pose estimates comparable in resolution to wheel odometry, but being independent of the kinematics and based on an exteroceptive sensor, is resistant to wheel slippage. The concept is based on extracting the planar transformations between frames from a sequence of ground images, which correspond to the change in robot pose. Results on a plain colored carpeted surface provide the proof of concept of the method as an alternative to wheel odometry. The contributions in this paper include a method to estimate the planar transformations between images to a high degree of precision (e.g., 0.01 degrees), and a method to calibrate the system using a ID calibration object and known motions of the robot.",

Real actuators are far from being ideal. In particular, only bounded velocities and torques can be realized for any given command. With reference to the kinematical model of a differential drive mobile robot, a known path following control law is modified to account for actuator velocity saturation. The proposed solution is experimentally shown to be particularly useful for high speed applications where accounting for actuator velocity saturation may have a large influence on performance.",

In this work, we focus our interest on high performance visual servoing. Our goal is to maximize the bandwidth of the visual loop. This means usually, considering the average dynamics of robots, that the use of a high speed camera is necessary. To achieve this goal, the model of the visual loop must be known with a good accuracy. This includes the dynamics of the robot and the dynamics of the vision system. The main objective of this work is to propose a new dynamic model for the vision sensor. The proposed model is validated by experiments. Ultrasonic motors are used in the experiments since they exhibit a very short response time and can be modeled by a simple transfer function, thus simplifying the decoupling between vision and actuation.",

The histogram representation effectively summarizes a map's salient features such that pairs of maps can be matched efficiently without any prior guess as to their alignment. The histogram matching algorithm has been enhanced in order to work well in outdoor unstructured environments by using entropy metrics, weighted histograms and proper thresholding of quality metrics. Thus our large-scale scan-matching SLAM implementation has a vastly improved ability to close large loops in real-time even when odometry is not available. Our experimental results have demonstrated a successful mapping of the largest area ever mapped to date using only a single laser scanner. We also demonstrate our ability to solve the lost robot problem by localizing a robot to a previously built map without any prior initialization.",

The idea of visual control used here is the usual approach where the desired position of the robot is given by a target image taken at that position. This target image is the only previous information needed by the control law to perform the navigation from the initial position to the target. The control law is designed by the input-output linearization of the system using elements of the homography as output. The contribution is a controller that deals with the nonholonomic constraints of the mobile platform needing neither decomposition of the homography nor depth estimation to the target.",

However, particle type ER fluids commonly have about 5-mili seconds response times. This delay needs to be taken into account when electric fields to energize ER fluids are controlled in real time. Especially, servo systems with ER fluid devices have a sampling time for the control loop that is about 1-mili second and so is shorter than the response time of ER fluids. Though the delay in this case has a great possibility of affecting on the performance or stability of servo systems, there is little research in this area that has mentioned the problem. In this paper, I investigated how this time delay affected damping performance and stability of this system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a human-oriented approach to the study of the biped gait for a humanoid robot. Starting from the analysis of the human lower-limbs, we gured out which features of the human legs are fundamental for a correct walking motion and can be adopted in the mechanical design of a humanoid robot. In particular we focus here on the knee, designed as a compliant human-like knee instead of a classical pin-joint. For the foot we tried to reproduce in a simple mechanical device the mobility and lightness of the human foot, which is very different from a flat surface and has a big impact on walking. We complete the presentation with considerations about the energy consumption of our humanoid design. In our approach the robot gains in adaptability and energetic ef ciency, which are the most challenging issues for a biped robot.",

        "abstract": "We describe a means of human robot interaction based not on natural language but on \"quasi symbols,\" which represent sensory-motor dynamics in the task and/or environment. It thus overcomes a key problem of using natural language for human-robot interaction - the need to understand the dynamic context. The quasi-symbols used are motion primitives corresponding to the attractor dynamics of the sensory-motor flow. These primitives are extracted from the observed data using the recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB) model. Binary representations based on the model parameters were implemented as quasi symbols in a humanoid robot, Robovie. The experiment task was robot-arm operation on a table. The quasi-symbols acquired by learning enabled the robot to perform novel motions. A person was able to control the arm through speech interaction using these quasi-symbols. These quasi symbols formed a hierarchical structure corresponding to the number of nodes in the model. The meaning of some of the quasi-symbols depended on the context, indicating that they are useful for human-robot interaction.",

This paper extends the state-of-the-art by developing an assistant which actively cooperates during the point-to-point transportation of an object. Besides using admittance control to react to interaction forces generated by its operator, the robot estimates the intended human motion and uses this identified motion to move along with the operator. The offered level of assistance can be scaled, which is vital to give the operator the opportunity to gradually learn how to interact with the system. Experiments revealed that, while the robot is programmed to adapt to the human motion, the operator also adapts to the offered assistance. When using the robot assistant the required forces to move the load are greatly reduced and the operators report that the assistance feels comfortable and natural.",

First, we apply a technique of 2D object segmentation that considers region similarity as an objective function and edge as a constraint with artificial intelligent used as a criterion function. The system can segment images more effectively than most of existing methods, even if the foreground is very similar to the background. Second, we propose a novel color perception model that shows similarity to human perception. The method outperforms many existing color reduction algorithms. Third, we propose a novel global orientation map perception using a radial basis function. Finally, we use the derived model along with the brush's position- and force-sensing to produce a visual feedback drawing. Experiments show that our system can generate good paintings including portraits.",

When slippage of the wheels can occur, WMRs can be modeled as hybrid systems. Model predictive control for such systems typically results in numerical methods of combinatorial complexity. We show that recently developed embedding techniques can be used to formulate numerical algorithms for the hybrid model predictive control (MPC) problem that have the same complexity as the MPC for smooth systems. We also discuss in detail the numerical techniques that lead to efficient and robust MPC algorithms. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

The prototype has evolved from the initial Computer Aided Design (CAD) model to become an operative AUV in the short period of seven months. The open frame and modular design principles together with the compatibility with other robots previously developed at the lab have provided the main design philosophy. Hence, at the robot's core, two networked computers give access to a wide set of sensors and actuators. The Gentoo/Linux distribution was chosen as the onboard operating system. A software architecture based on a set of distributed objects with soft real time capabilities was developed and a hybrid control architecture including mission control, a behavioural layer and a robust map-based localization algorithm made ICTINEUAUV the winning entry.",

        "abstract": "Many applications in mobile and underwater robotics employ 3D vision techniques for navigation and mapping. These techniques usually involve the extraction and 3D reconstruction of scene interest points. Nevertheless, in large environments the huge volume of acquired information could pose serious problems to real-time data processing. Moreover, In order to minimize the drift, these techniques use data association to close trajectory loops, decreasing the uncertainties in estimating the position of the robot and increasing the precision of the resulting 3D models. When faced to large amounts of features, the efficiency of data association decreases drastically, affecting the global performance. This paper proposes a framework that highly reduces the number of extracted features with minimum impact on the precision of the 3D scene model. This is achieved by minimizing the representation redundancy by analyzing the geometry of the environment and extracting only those features that are both photometrically and geometrically significant",

        "abstract": "In addition to possessing a number of other important properties, kinematically redundant manipulators are inherently more tolerant to locked-joint failures than non-redundant manipulators. However, a joint failure can still render a kinematically redundant manipulator useless if the manipulator is poorly designed or controlled. This paper presents a method for identifying a region of the workspace of a redundant manipulator for which task completion is guaranteed in the event of a locked-joint failure. The existence of such a region, called a failure-tolerant workspace, will be guaranteed by imposing a suitable set of artificial joint limits prior to a failure. Conditions are presented that characterize end-effector locations in this region. Based on these conditions, a method is presented that identifies the boundaries of the failure-tolerant workspace. Optimized failure-tolerant workspaces for a three degree-of-freedom planar robot are presented.",

Indeed, the variables needed for control (namely, the directions of the arms and forearms as well as the positions of the wrists) can be reconstructed from the forearms edges. Experimental validation of the reconstruction is given and simulation of the control with realistic noises is performed showing the validity of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Physicians perform percutaneous therapies in many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Image guidance promises to improve targeting accuracy and broaden the scope of needle interventions. In this paper, we consider the possibility of automating the guidance of a flexible bevel-tip needle as it is inserted into human tissue. We build upon a previously proposed nonholonomic kinematic model to develop a nonlinear observer-based controller. As a first step for control, we show that flexible needles can be automatically controlled to remain within a planar slice of tissue as they are inserted by a physician; our approach keeps the physician in the loop to control insertion speed. In the proposed controller, the distance of the needle tip position from the plane of interest is used as a feedback signal. Numerical simulations demonstrate the stability and robustness of the controller in the face of parametric uncertainty. We also present results from pilot physical experiments with phantom tissue under stereo image guidance.",

Using joint-level control complex planning algorithms are needed to accomplish tasks. For intuitive operation and hence short development times of applications high-level control interfaces are needed. Further-more, for many tasks it is desirable to de ne an impedance behavior in task space. In this paper a exible control law is proposed which offers object-level impedances for two-handed manipulation. The controller structure is based on the well-known compliance control law. The main contributions of this work are the way how to combine several potential functions for two-handed manipulation and the experimental validation of hand-arm coordination. The controller is implemented on DLR's humanoid manipulator Justin and its performance is demonstrated experimentally by unscrewing a can and motion of a grasped box.",

The VOR is a reflex eye movement control system that stabilizes the image on the retina of the eye during head movements in space. This stabilization helps maintain objects of interest approximately fixed on the retina during locomotion. In this paper we present the design and implementation of an artificial vestibular system, which drives a fully articulated binocular vision system for quadrupedal robots to maintain accurate gaze. The complete robot head has 9 degrees of freedom (DOF): pitch, yaw, and roll for the head and 3 DOF for left and right cameras. The SONY AIBOreg quadruped robot has been modified with additional hardware to emulate the vestibular system and the vestibulo-ocular reflex in primates.",

A feed-forward network trained with the error back-propagation algorithm was implemented to model the performance's expressiveness of a professional flutist. In particular, the note duration and vibrato were considered as performance rules (sources of variation) to enhance the robot's performance expressiveness. From the mechanical point of view, the vibrato and lung systems were re-designed to effectively control the proposed music performance rules. An experimental setup was proposed to verify the effectiveness of generating a new score with expressiveness from a model created based on the performance of a professional flutist. As a result, the flutist robot was able of automatically producing an expressive performance similar to the human one from a nominal score.",

        "abstract": "Quickly adapting the manufacturing system to the production of new or modified products is critical for manufacturers in order to stay competitive. For flexible manufacturing systems this typically implies modifications of the control programs. In previous work a framework for automatic generation of cell controllers has been developed. In this paper an implementation of the framework is presented. Important properties of the presented implementation are: the information from earlier design phases is reused; automatic code generation for faster development and reduced implementation errors; the supervisory control theory is used to generate control functions that are correct by construction; object oriented principles are used in order to allow the reuse of existing library functions. The implementation is generic in the sense that it may generate control programs for a number of target platforms, but in this paper the focus is on generating a control program for the Java platform. An industrial example of a reconfigurable manufacturing cell has been used in the implementation process and shows that the framework is feasible for large manufacturing systems.",

The method is based on a distance-filter constructed on the basis of an analysis of the set of solutions produced by the associations in the sensor configuration space. This leads to a robust strategy to filter all the associations that do not explain the principal motion of the scan (due to noise in the sensor, large odometry errors, spurious, occlusions or dynamic features for example). The experimental results suggest that the improvement of the data association leads to more robust and faster methods in the presence of wrong correspondences.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a method of increasing the quality of weak classifiers in the boosting context by using improved response modelling. The new method improves upon the results of a recent response binning approach proposed by Rasolzadeh et al. (2006). For experimental purposes the improved method is applied to the familiar Haar features as used by Viola and Jones in their face/pedestrian detection systems. However, the methods benefits are general and therefore not restricted to this particular feature type. Unlike many previous methods, this method is suitable for modelling multi-modal responses and is highly resistant to overfitting. It does this by adaptively choosing suitable support regions around the values taken by the standard response binning method. More accurate models are produced, with particular improvement around the final decision boundary. It is shown that the new method can be trained with one tenth of the training data required to achieve similar results on previous methods. This substantially lowers the overall training time of the system. The method's ability to consistently produce better hypotheses over a variety of pedestrian detection tasks is shown.",

        "abstract": "Crawler mechanisms have the advantage of stable navigation on uneven terrain; as a result, such mechanisms have been adopted for many types of locomotion of outdoor robots, including \"search and rescue robots\". However, crawler mechanisms always slip when tracking curved paths, and it generates a large accumulating positioning error in vehicles as opposed to conventional wheeled mobile robots. To measure the velocity of the vehicle correctly and improve the accuracy of the odometry, consideration of crawlers' slippage is very important. In this research, we propose a more accurate odometry method for crawler vehicles. In the proposed method, the vehicle can estimate the slip ratios using information from encoders (attached to the actuators) and gyro-sensors. The validity of the method was confirmed by experiments using our crawler vehicle.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel use of spectral clustering algorithms to support cases where the entries in the affinity matrix are costly to compute. The method is incremental - the spectral clustering algorithm is applied to the affinity matrix after each row/column is added - which makes it possible to inspect the clusters as new data points are added. The method is well suited to the problem of appearance-based, on-line topological mapping for mobile robots. In this problem domain, we show that we can reduce environment-dependent parameters of the clustering algorithm to just a single, intuitive parameter. Experimental results in large outdoor and indoor environments show that we can close loops correctly by computing only a fraction of the entries in the affinity matrix. The accompanying video clip shows how an example map is produced by the algorithm.",

Results are presented with and without inertial observations for different assumed initial ranges to features on the same dataset. When using only the camera, the scale of the scene is not observable. As expected, the scale of the map depends on the prior used to initialize the depth of the features and may drift when exploring new terrain, precluding loop closure. The results show that the inertial observations help to improve the estimated trajectory of the camera leading to a better estimation of the map scale and a more accurate localization of features.",

It is capable of operating in unknown and large scale environments and assumes no prior knowledge of the size, appearance or location of potential environmental features. Low cost inertial navigation units are found on most autonomous vehicles and a large number of smaller robots. Depending on the grade of the sensor, when used alone, inertial data for control and navigation will only be reliable for a matter of seconds or minutes. An algorithm is presented that simultaneously estimates relative feature location in sensor space and inertial position, velocity and attitude in world coordinates. Feature locations are maintained in sensor space to ensure measurement linearity. Image depth is represented by an inverse function which permits un-delayed feature initialization and improves linearity and convergence. It is shown that the resulting navigation solution is able to be constrained, providing results comparable to inertial-GPS systems. Results are presented for an autonomous aircraft operating in a large semi-structured environment.",

This holds all the more true in robotics, which frequently involves concurrency, extensive nondeterminisism, event-driven components, complex state machines, and difficult platform limitations. Inspired by the challenges we have encountered while attempting to debug software on simulated ensembles of tens of thousands of modular robots, we have developed a new debugging tool particularly suited to the characteristics of highly parallel, event- and state-driven robotics software. Our state capture and introspection system also provides data that may be used in higher-level debugging tools as well. We report on the design of this promising debugging system, and on our experiences with it so far.",

        "abstract": "Automation of transportation systems and promotion of the operations are becoming an international demand on seaport container terminals. For this issue, we propose an integrated design methodology. In other words, in addition to the design of the appropriate number of machines, efficient system layout, and system management models, we attempt to design machines' specifications, which are operating in an automated transportation system. The objective of this study is to maximize the system efficiency while minimizing the changes of the specifications. Therefore, we evaluate the specifications based on the system throughput of the constructed system; then, make clear the impacts of the specifications on the system. Finally, for imposed demands, we design highly efficient transportation systems. From the construction costs and design results, we show a need to take into consideration the machines' specifications.",

An outdoor estimation system based on Kalman filtering combines the inertial measurements with centimeter accuracy RTK-GPS measurements to provide essential posture, velocities, and perturbation information. The particular contribution of this paper is in designing an estimation system to be able to deal with WMR control problems in the presence of wheel skidding and slipping. The experimental results suggest that with careful modelling of WMR, the estimation scheme is able to provide reliable and high update rate information for WMR control applications in the presence of wheel skidding and slipping.",

Our previous research has studied the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) tools to assist a user in the generation of multi-robot missions. These tools, however, typically assume that the robots available for the mission are of the same type (i.e., homogeneous). We loosen this assumption through the integration of contract-net protocol (CNP) based task allocation coupled with a CBR-based mission specification wizard. Two alternative designs are explored for combining case-based mission specification and CNP-based team allocation as well as the tradeoffs that result from the selection of one of these approaches over the other.",

        "abstract": "Recent years are seeing a renewed interest in general multi-robot architectures, capable of automating coordination. However, few architectures explore integration of multiple coordination mechanisms. Thus the question of how to best integrate coordination mechanisms is left open. This paper focuses on the micro-kernel integration approach used in BITE (Bar Ilan Teamwork Engine), a multi-robot behavior-based architecture. This approach allows the developer to plug in coordination mechanisms (teamwork behaviors) to be used depending on the context of execution. BITE imposes constraints on the specification of taskwork behaviors, which allow BITE's control algorithm to automatically determine sequencing and task-allocation points during task execution. At such points, teamwork behaviors (known as interaction behaviors) are triggered to automate the coordination processes. We argue that BITE's approach is preferable to the methodology of existing architectures, and provide analysis of experiments in using BITE with Sony AIBO robots, to support our argument",

Different motion patterns from a wide variety of moving objects make motion modeling difficult. Accompanying with traditional motion modeling techniques, this paper introduces a scene interaction model and a neighboring object interaction model to respectively take long-term and short-term interactions between the tracked objects and its surroundings into account. With the use of the interaction models, anomalous activity recognition is accomplished easily. In addition, movestop hypothesis tracking is applied to deal with move-stop-move maneuvers. All these approaches are seamlessly inter-graded under the variable-structure multiple-model estimation framework. The proposed approaches have been demonstrated using data from a laser scanner mounted on the PAL1 robot at a crowded intersection. Interacting pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, cars and trucks are successfully tracked in difficult situations with occlusion.",

Enhanced novel algorithms to generate interior structures that show the result of a cut that is generated by the interaction between instrument and model is used as the underlining framework. The notion of a cross cutting is introduced and solved to offer a more realistic interactive environment for various virtual diagnostic and dissection tasks. Our simulator supports two types of cutting: \"cut-into\", an instrument penetrating simulated tissues, and \"cut through\", an instrument cutting through tissues. In either case, a groove is developed in the path where the cutting has taken place to reflect the depth of the cut. Generation of a groove introduces a challenging problem when two cuts cross in their paths. For example, when two cutting path intersects (i.e., an occurrence of cross cutting), the current structures involved in the proximity of the cuts do not simulate a realistic intersecting cross cut. Although many studies have represented solutions to surface mesh cutting, a solution to an interactive cross cutting has not been adequately addressed yet. This paper presents an algorithm that can be flexibly applied for the simulation of an interactive cross cutting on a surface-mesh. Such solution can be further applied to many applications involving surface mesh.",

The goal of our research is to provide users an ability to control the motion which appears physically correct, preserves the moving pattern of the original motion, and satisfies goals for a deformable object. In our approach, a user can select any part of the deformable structure, called control points, and can define target poses by moving control points. A user also can define target poses then our system automatically generates the motion path to achieve the target pose. With this technique patient specific organ simulation can be achieved by using a stream of image data. A series of sectional images can be the target poses. The optimal path generator computes the required control parameters that steer the intended node to the desired goal position while preserving the moving pattern of the original motion. It guarantees that the edited motion is physically conforming and natural.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently it has been shown that an inverse depth parametrization can improve the performance of real-time monocular EKF SLAM, permitting undelayed initialization of features at all depths. However, the inverse depth parametrization requires the storage of 6 parameters in the state vector for each map point. This implies a noticeable computing overhead when compared with the standard 3 parameter XYZ Euclidean encoding of a 3D point, since the computational complexity of the EKF scales poorly with state vector size. In this work we propose to restrict the inverse depth parametrization only to cases where the standard Euclidean encoding implies a departure from linearity in the measurement equations. Every new map feature is still initialized using the 6 parameter inverse depth method. However, as the estimation evolves, if according to a linearity index the alternative XYZ coding can be considered linear, we show that feature parametrization can be transformed from inverse depth to XYZ for increased computational efficiency with little reduction in accuracy. We present a theoretical development of the necessary linearity indices, along with simulations to analyze the influence of the conversion threshold. Experiments performed with with a 30 frames per second real-time system are reported. An analysis of the increase in the map size that can be successfully managed is included.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the issues of compliant control of a robot under contact constraints with a goal of using joint space based pattern generators as movement primitives, as often considered in the studies of legged locomotion and biological motor control. For this purpose, we explore inverse dynamics control of constrained dynamical systems. When the system is overconstrained, it is not straightforward to formulate an inverse dynamics control law since the problem becomes an ill-posed one, where infinitely many combinations of joint torques are possible to achieve the desired joint accelerations. The goal of this paper is to develop a general and computationally efficient inverse dynamics algorithm for a robot with a free floating base and constraints. We suggest an approximate way of computing inverse dynamics algorithm by treating constraint forces computed with a Lagrange multiplier method as simply external forces based on Featherstone's floating base formulation of inverse dynamics. We present how all the necessary quantities to compute our controller can be efficiently extracted from Featherstone's spatial notation of robot dynamics. We evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested approach on a simulated biped robot model",

        "abstract": "In this work we examine the control of center of mass and swing leg trajectories in LittleDog, a point-foot quadruped robot. It is not clear how to formulate a function to compute forward kinematics of the center of mass of the robot as a function of actuated joint angles because point-foot walkers have no direct actuation between the feet and the ground. Nevertheless, we show that a whole-body Jacobian exists and is well defined when at least three of the feet are on the ground. Also, the typical approach of work-space centering for redundancy resolution causes destabilizing motions when executing fast motions. An alternative redundancy resolution optimization is proposed which projects single-leg inverse kinematic solutions into the nullspace. This hybrid approach seems to minimize 1) unnecessary rotation of the body, 2) twisting of the stance legs, and 3) whole-body involvement in achieving a step leg trajectory. In simulation, this control allows the robot to perform significantly more dynamic behaviors while maintaining stability.",

        "abstract": "Prior papers have introduced steerable needles composed of precurved concentric tubes. The curvature and extent of these needles can be controlled by the relative rotation and translation of the individual tubes. Under certain assumptions on the geometry and design of these needles, the forward kinematics problem can be solved in closed form by means of algebraic equations. The inverse kinematics problem, however, is not as straightforward owing to the nonlinear map between relative tube displacements and needle tip configuration as well as to the multiplicity of solutions as the number of tubes increases. This paper presents a general approach to solving the inverse kinematics problem using a pseudoinverse solution together with gradients of nullspace potential functions to enforce geometric and mechanical constraints.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an iterative learning control (ILC) scheme for a class of redundant robot arms to acquire the desired control input signals that produce an endpoint trajectory specified in task space. The learning update law of control input signals is constructed only in task space by modifying the previous control input through adding linearly an endpoint velocity trajectory error. Although the dimension of the task space is strictly less than the DOF (Degrees-of-freedom) of the robot arm, the proposed method need neither consider any inverse kinematics problem nor introduce any cost function to be optimized and to determine the inverse kinematics (or dynamics) uniquely. Convergence of trajectory trackings to the specified one is shown by numerical simulations in both cases 1) free-endpoint motion and 2) constraint-endpoint motion with specified contact force. A theoretical proof of convergences in the case of free-endpoint motion is given on the basis of an approximated dynamics linearized around a desired solution in joint state space.",

Formalization introduces rigor into the discussion of the structure of embodied agent controllers. The paper deals with systems consisting of multiple agents executing jobs by: influencing the environment through effectors, gathering information from the environment through sensors and communicating with the other agents through communication channels. A paradigm shift is proposed: from building systems executing jobs, to agents acquiring resources (effectors and receptors) so that they can execute the jobs assigned to them. A supervisory controller coordinates the adequate sequencing of jobs and resolves contentions.",

In the forward pose kinematic, closed form solution adopting a new approach is presented. It is shown that the inverse and forward pose kinematic have sixteen and four different solutions, respectively. Moreover, closed form equations for the rate kinematic analysis are proposed.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Orthoglide is a Delta-type PKM dedicated to 3-axis rapid machining applications that was originally developed at IRCCyN in 2000-2001 to meet the advantages of both serial 3-axis machines (regular workspace and homogeneous performances) and parallel kinematic architectures (good dynamic performances and stiffness). This machine has three fixed parallel linear joints that are mounted orthogonally. The geometric parameters of the Orthoglide were defined as function of the size of a prescribed cubic Cartesian workspace that is free of singularities and internal collision. The interesting features of the Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. In this paper, a new method is proposed to analyze the stiffness of overconstrained Delta-type manipulators, such as the Orthoglide. The Orthoglide is then benchmarked according to geometric, kinematic and stiffness criteria: workspace to footprint ratio, velocity and force transmission factors, sensitivity to geometric errors, torsional stiffness and translational stiffness.",

Treatment of stroke patients is very intensive in the amount of training per patient per day. The treatment duration per patient combined with the total number of people suffering from a stroke makes rehabilitation therapy extremely costly. This makes devices that could reduce the costs of therapy attractive to rehabilitation centres. Currently there are robotic rehabilitation devices under development for both the upper and lower extremities. Our group focuses mainly on the recovery of gait after stroke. The LOPES robot is designed for use in training on a treadmill to accommodate for limited space of rehabilitation centres and easy access for the therapist to the patient. As a 'robotic therapist' it is meant to make rehabilitation more effective for patients and less demanding for therapists.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the landing motion of an articulated legged robot. Humans use a peculiar crouching motion to land safely which can be characterized by body stiffness and damping. A stiffness controller formulation is used to realize this human behavior for the robot. Using this method, the landing motion is achieved with only the desired body stiffness and damping values, without desired COG (Center of Gravity) or joint paths. To achieve soft landing, variable body stiffness and damping values were optimized. PBOT, which has four links with flexible joints was used for validation of the landing controller. A body stiffness and damping controller was used as an outer landing control loop and a fast subsystem controller for flexible joints was used as an inner force control loop. Simulations and experimental results about the landing motion are presented to show the performance of the body stiffness and damping controller.",

Additional fuzzy rule-sets are used to address spatial and temporal dependence in the reasoning process in order to arrive at a final score for each potential landing site. This landing score is used to retarget the spacecraft if the original landing site is found to be hazardous. Simulation studies are presented for illustration.",

Simulations are shown to verify the performance of the optimal trajectory controller. Data from real flight trials is presented to validate the inputs obtained from the trajectory planner to track a desired trajectory.

We assume the need to simultaneously plan and maintain paths for multiple tasks with respect to the current state of a moving robot in a dynamic environment. Our algorithm dynamically maintains a forest of trees by splitting, growing and merging them on the fly to adapt to moving obstacles and robot motion. In order to minimize tree maintenance, we only validate the task paths, rather than the entire forest. The root of the inhabited tree moves with the robot. Dynamic re-planning is integrated with tree and forest maintenance. Coupling the robot motion with the planner enables us to support multiple tasks, for example providing an \"escape\" path while moving to a goal. The robot is free to move along whichever task path it chooses. We highlight the work by showing fast results in simulated environments with moving obstacles.",

        "abstract": "This paper characterizes the information space of a robot moving in the plane with limited sensing. The robot has a landmark detector, which provides the cyclic order of the landmarks around the robot, and it also has a touch sensor, that indicates when the robot is in contact with the environment boundary. The robot cannot measure any precise distances or angles, and does not have an odometer or a compass. We propose to characterize the information space associated with such robot through the swap cell decomposition. We show how to construct such decomposition through its dual, called the swap graph, using two kinds of feedback motion commands based on the landmarks sensed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of automatic grasp generation for robotic hands where experience and shape primitives are used in synergy so to provide a basis not only for grasp generation but also for a grasp evaluation process when the exact pose of the object is not available. One of the main challenges in automatic grasping is the choice of the object approach vector, which is dependent both on the object shape and pose as well as the grasp type. Using the proposed method, the approach vector is chosen not only based on the sensory input but also on experience that some approach vectors will provide useful tactile information that finally results in stable grasps. A methodology for developing and evaluating grasp controllers is presented where the focus lies on obtaining stable grasps under imperfect vision. The method is used in a teleoperation or a programming by demonstration setting where a human demonstrates to a robot how to grasp an object. The system first recognizes the object and grasp type which can then be used by the robot to perform the same action using a mapped version of the human grasping posture.",

We present a novel probabilistic framework in which the visual information and the mechanical supervision interact to learn particular terrain types and their properties. The proposed method is applied to learning of rover slippage from visual information in a completely automatic fashion. Our experiments show that using mechanical measurements as automatic supervision significantly improves the visual-based classification alone and approaches the results of learning with manual supervision. This work will enable the rover to drive safely on slopes, learning autonomously about different terrains and their slip characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical state machines have proven to be a powerful tool for controlling autonomous robots due to their flexibility and modularity. For most real robot implementations, however, it is often the case that the control hierarchy is hand-coded. As a result, the development process is often time intensive and error prone. In this paper, we explore the use of an experts learning approach, based on Auer and colleagues' Exp3 (1995), to help overcome some of these limitations. In particular, we develop a modified learning algorithm, which we call rExp3, that exploits the structure provided by a control hierarchy by treating each state machine as an 'expert'. Our experiments validate the performance of rExp3 on a real robot performing a task, and demonstrate that rExp3 is able to quickly learn to select the best state machine expert to execute. Through our investigations in these environments, we identify a need for faster learning recovery when the relative performances of experts reorder, such as in response to a discrete environment change. We introduce a modified learning rule to improve the recovery rate in these situations and demonstrate through simulation experiments that rExp3 performs as well or better than Exp3 under such conditions.",

A torso is used to generate active power replacing gravity used in passive walk. Swing-leg control is introduced to create a steady gait. Numerical simulations show that a biped robot with knees and a torso can walk efficiently on level ground. When we choose an appropriate parameter of the swing-leg control, the biped robot can walk stably over a wide range of speed. Furthermore, the walking performance of the robot increases with the increase of the radius of circular feet.",

In this paper, we present the design of a novel hand-held robotic instrument that can be operated by the surgeon with one hand only, while standing at the operating table and acting on a traditional laparoscopic instrument with the other hand. Its main advantages are the low weight, achieved by dislocating the motors and using a flexible transmission, and the possibility to switch end-effector, changing the instrument type according to the phase of the intervention. The instrument can be used easily and rapidly, since it does not require long or complex set-up procedures. We describe the instrument design, the development of the first prototype and compare it to rigid instruments in the ability to approach sutures at various angles.",

Several approaches to kinematic analysis of continuum trunks complement a wide variety of available continuum robots.

The novel limiting-case analysis presented in this paper eliminates these problems, demonstrating that the unique causes of the problem are rooted in the continuum formulation and cannot be solved by traditional rigid-link singularity analysis. Three practical examples demonstrate the necessity of this analysis presented, enabling the trunk to successfully perform each task.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous navigation for wheeled mobile robots generally requires to plan a trajectory and to follow it while performing localization in the environment. In order to execute long-range motion, dead-reckoning localization is not precise enough and the robot must use landmark-based localization. Landmark-based localization can produce discontinuities in the robot position estimation, as it is well known with GPS systems, and perturb the trajectory following. If the robot is able to converge smoothly towards the trajectory, then these perturbations are easily managed. Otherwise, if the robot is more complex (for instance a multi-body mobile robot subject to several nonholonomic constraints) and navigates in a cluttered environment, we show that these perturbations can lead to collisions. The contribution of this paper is to state theoretically the problem and to propose a practical solution to trajectory following for multi-body wheeled mobile robots using landmark-based localization. This solution has been tested on a real robot towing a trailer.",

By requiring smooth and not analytic NF, the effect of each obstacle is exactly nullified outside a sensing zone around the obstacle (the only required parameter is the width of the sensing zone). This allows the computation of the navigation function using information from a single obstacle each time. We present simulations to verify the validity of this approach.",

We develop the diffusion model for a circular source and perform control theoretic analysis of the resulting FIM motion algorithm. While in our previous work we established that the source location is an equilibrium point of the system, in the present paper we show that due to the consistency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, the equilibrium point is unique. Simulations are presented that compare our motion algorithm to conventional concentration gradient motion algorithms. The simulations confirm that by using our motion algorithm, the circular biochemical source is located with a high degree of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Scaling down the module size of a self-reconfigurable robot will have a profound effect on the module's characteristics, e.g. strength to mass ratio. In this paper we explore how the characteristics of chains of modules, specifically locomotion velocity and best gait type, might change with the scale of those modules. The simulated experiments we report on here examine module sizes from (11\u03bcm to 698\u03bcm radius) and chain lengths from 3 to 30 modules. All gaits tested were based on central pattern generators optimized using a genetic algorithm and hill climbing. Our results show that scaling affects both the preferred type of gait as well as a chain's overall performance (average velocity). In summary, there is a tradeoff where larger scales face the challenge of overcoming gravity, while smaller sizes face the challenge of staying in contact with the ground and the friction it provides. We show that in between these two extremes lies a \"best\" module size for given environmental, physical, and engineering constraints.",

The repeat accuracy was much improved by visual feedback. Under P control, the prototype was shown to be highly robust against mechanical disturbance owing to its good mechanical compliance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents recent results in configuring a multiscale (macro-micro) robotic assembly platform with modular and reconfigurable characteristics. M3 is a multi-robot system capable of spanning across the macro-meso-micro scales, and has been specifically designed to package MOEMS (Micro Opto Electro Mechanical Systems). The emphasis on packaging (as opposed to assembly) is inclusive of the latter, but it also recognizes that bonding, sealing and attachment processes must also be controlled, and will greatly influence the reliability of the microsystem. The system components include precision robots, microstages, end-effectors and fixtures that accomplish assembly tasks in a shared workspace. The system components are systematically characterized in terms of accuracy and repeatability, and assembly plans are performed using kinematic identification, visual servoing, inverse kinematics, and dynamic vibration suppression. As an application packaging problem, various micro and meso scale parts are assembled into a MEMS device. The tolerance budget of assembly ranges from 4 microns to 300 microns, while the size of components in the assembly ranges from 126 microns to 30mm. Various end-effectors and fixtures have been designed for use with off-the-shelf hardware (robots and microstages) and were tested for precision performance. The robots are calibrated to accuracies of 10 microns or less. In this paper we present experimental results of precision robot calibration and visual servoing for fiber pigtailing with one of the robots within M3.",

        "abstract": "We explore an on-line problem where a group of robots has to reach a target whose position is known in an unknown planar environment whose geometry is acquired by the robots during task execution. The critical parameter in such a problem is the physical motion time, which, under the assumption of uniform velocity of all the robots, corresponds to length or cost of the path traveled by the robot which reached the target. The Competitiveness of an on-line algorithm measures its performance relative to the optimal off-line solution to the problem. While competitiveness usually means constant relative performance, this paper uses generalized competitiveness, i.e. any functional relationship between online performance and optimal off-line solution. Given an online task, its competitive complexity class is a pair of lower and upper bounds on the competitive performance of all online algorithms for the task, such that the two bounds satisfy the same functional relationship. We prove that in general any on-line navigation algorithm must have at least a quadratic competitive performance. This paper describes a new on-line navigation algorithm, called MRBUG (short for Multi-Robot BUG), which requires constant memory and has a quadratic competitive performance. Thus, the above mentioned problem is classified into a quadratic competitive class. Moreover, since MRBUG achieves the quadratic lower bound, it has optimal competitiveness. The algorithm performance is illustrated in office-like environments",

We focus on finite transition systems with inputs, which are often encountered when solving motion planning problems by using discrete quotients induced by a given partition of the state space. Our approach solves the problem conservatively using LTL games, and consists of the following three steps: (1) the original transition system is transformed into a transition system on which an LTL game can be played, (2) a solution of the LTL game on the new transition system is obtained, and (3) an interface between this solution and the initial transition system is constructed. The correctness of the method is ensured by design. The advantages and conservativeness of our approach are discussed and illustrated by simple examples.",

Empirically we show that our algorithm quickly generates plans for simulated articulated robots in a highly nonlinear search space of exponential dimension. RSC is a reverse-time search that samples future robot actions and constrains the space of prior object displacements. To optimize the efficiency of RSC, we identify methods for sampling object surfaces and generating connecting paths between grasps and placements. In addition to experimental analysis of RSC, this paper looks into object placements and task-space motion constraints among other unique features of the three dimensional manipulation planning domain.",

Under certain conditions, the problem is compounded when the payload creates a double-pendulum effect. This paper presents an input-shaping control method for suppressing double-pendulum payload oscillations. Local and teleoperation experiments performed on a portable tower crane are used to verify the effectiveness of the method. Data from these experiments show that operators performed manipulation tasks faster and safer when input shaping was utilized to reduce payload sway. Furthermore, the teleoperation delays did not degrade the input shaping effectiveness.",

This paper proposes a new map matching scheme that registers the visual information of consecutive robot positions and expresses the robot displacement in a common coordinate system. Local elevation maps of the environment are therefore retrieved from the 3D perception of a stereo camera. The proposed scheme consists of three main steps: feature point extraction from map data, matching of features points using triangle configurations and a voting procedure, and direct calculation of the robot displacement in six degrees of freedom using quaternions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by computer simulations with synthetic terrain and experiments with stereo perception.",

Precision sensors are used to measure magnetic force as a function of applied field. The system is first used to validate an existing model for the magnetic force on a soft-magnetic ellipsoid. Next, the magnetic force on a soft-magnetic assembled-MEMS microrobot as a function of the applied field is measured experimentally. Finally, a vision tracking system is integrated with the setup to measure the hydrodynamic properties of the microrobot. The coefficient of viscous friction for the microrobot is obtained experimentally.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new pneumatically driven underactuated hand with two fingers and 3 phalanxes per finger. Two evidences have led the design of this hand. Firstly, the use of pneumatic energy facilitates the underactuation of the hand, indeed a single T-connector suffices to share out one input among two outputs. Secondly, non-backdrivable mechanisms have to be used in the transmission of phalanx's motion so that the hand is capable of producing form-closed grasps. This latter design principle is justified using a newly developed method that permits to study the form-closure property of a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand. Moreover, the intriguing ejection phenomenon is avoided thanks to non-backdrivable mechanisms that prohibit any backward motion of phalanxes when correctly positioned. An original mechanism called the \"pneumatic parallelogram\" is described, it enables the hand to perform fine pinch grasps. Finally, the optimal design of both fingers is addressed with respect to the force-isotropy of the finger and the positiveness of phalanx forces",

This paper discusses the development of a wireless microrobot that can be manipulated inside a tube using an external magnetic field. The model microrobot utilizes an electromagnetic actuator as the servo actuator to realize movement in biomedical applications. The structure, motion mechanism, and characteristic evaluation of a driving fin used for propulsion have been discussed. The fishlike fin movement can be controlled via frequency adjustments to the alternate magnetic field. Vertical movement of the microrobot can be stopped at a specified location. Experimental results indicate that the microrobot can be controlled upward, downward, and also be suspended in water using frequency adjustments. The microrobot has a rapid response, and can correspond to the dirt adhering to the inner wall. This device will play an important role in both industrial and medical applications such as microsurgery.",

For mine searching missions, a BUAV must fly near the ground. Because there is severe limitation on the weight of equipment, such as sensors and actuators, most BUAVs are so-called under-actuated robots. For a BUAV to fly near the ground safely, a sophisticated obstacle avoidance algorithm that considers the kinematical constraints of under-actuated BUAV is needed. In developing the obstacle avoidance algorithm for under actuated robot, establishing a motion planning method is essential. To carry out applicable motion planning calculation for a BUAV, detail information about the wind velocity condition and geometry of obstacles in the mission environment is needed; however, it is very difficult to accurately estimate wind velocity distribution that is disturbed by the obstacles. In this paper, a method for estimating a rough wind condition near the ground considering the geometrical property of obstacles is proposed. The estimated rough wind condition is applied to the stochastic motion planning calculation based on dynamic programming (DP) in Markov decision process (MDP). The performance of the method is examined by computational fluid dynamical (CFD) simulation.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A method for evaluating reliance level of a virtual metrology system (VMS) is proposed. This method calculates a reliance index (RI) value between 0 and 1 by analyzing the process data of production equipment to decide if the virtual metrology result is reliable. A RI threshold is also defined in this method. If a RI value is higher than the threshold, the conjecture result is reliant; otherwise, the conjecture result needs to be further examined. In addition to the RI, the method also proposes process data similarity indices (SIs). The SIs are defined to evaluate the degree of similarity between the input set of process data and those historical sets of process data used to establish the conjecture model. Two kinds of SIs are included in the method: global similarity index (GSI) and individual similarity index (ISI). Both the GSI and ISI are applied to assist the RI in gauging the reliance level and locating the key parameter(s) that cause major deviation, hence the VMS manufacturability problem is resolved. An illustrative example with 300-mm semiconductor foundry production equipment in Taiwan is demonstrated in this work. The real experimental results show that this method is applicable to the VMS of (such as semiconductor and TFT-LCD) production equipment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem where a point robot in a 2D or 3D environment equipped with an omnidirectional range sensor of finite range D is asked to inspect a set of surface patches, while minimizing the sum of view cost, proportional to the number of viewpoints planned, and the travel cost, proportional to the length of path traveled. We call it the metric view planning problem with traveling cost and visibility range or metric TVPP in short. Via an L-reduction from the set covering problem to a two-dimensional metric TVPP, we show that the metric TVPP cannot be approximated within O(log m) ratio by any polynomial algorithm, where m is the number of surface patches to cover. We then analyze the natural two-level algorithm, presented by Danner and Kavraki (2002), of solving first the view planning problem to get an approximate solution, and then solving, again using an approximation algorithm, the Metric traveling salesman problem to connect the planned viewpoints. We show this greedy algorithm has the approximation ratio of O(log m). Thus, it asymptotically achieves the best approximation ratio one can hope for.",

Boxfish with its multiple fins can maneuver in confined spaces with a near zero turning radius and it has been found that its unusual boxy shape is responsible for a self correcting mechanism that makes its trajectories immune to water disturbances. The Micro Autonomous Robotic Ostraciiform (MARCO) project aims to apply these features in a novel underwater vehicle design. Miniature underwater vehicles with these characteristics have a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, ship wreck exploration, inline pipe inspection, forming sensor networks, etc. Tail fin hydrodynamics have been investigated experimentally using robotic flapper mechanisms to arrive at a caudal fin shape with optimal shape induced flexibility. Fluid simulation studies were utilized to arrive at the body shape that can result in self correcting vorticity generation. The robotic ostraciiform prototype was designed based on the above results. Ostraciiform locomotion is implemented with a pair of 2-DOF pectoral fins and a single DOF tail fin. The finalized body shape of the robot is produced by 3D prototyping two separate halves.",

The measurement range varies between around plusmn100 muN with a resolution of 20 nN and a linear output.

The approach is based on a graphical representation of robot poses and links between the poses. Links between the robot poses are established based on odomety and image similarity, then a relaxation algorithm is used to generate a globally consistent map. To estimate the covariance matrix for links obtained from the vision sensor, a novel method is introduced based on the relative similarity of neighbouring images, without requiring distances to image features or multiple view geometry. Indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that the approach scales well to large-scale environments, producing topologically correct and geometrically accurate maps at minimal computational cost. Mini-SLAM was found to produce consistent maps in an unstructured, large-scale environment (the total path length was 1.4 km) containing indoor and outdoor passages.",

        "abstract": "Computing optimal paths for mobile robots is an interesting and important problem. This paper presents a method to compute the shortest path for a differential-drive mobile robot, which is a disc, among piecewise smooth and convex obstacles. To obtain a well-defined notion of shortest, the total amount of wheel rotation is optimized. We use recent characterization of minimum wheel-rotation paths for differential-drive mobile robots with no obstacles. We reduce the search for the shortest path to the search on a finite nonholonomic visibility graph. Edges of the graph are either minimum wheel-rotation trajectories inside the free space or trajectories on the boundary of obstacle region. Vertices of the graph are initial and goal configurations and points on the boundary of obstacle region. We call the search graph a nonholonomic visibility graph because the jump condition of the Pontryagin maximum principle gives a necessary condition which is reminiscent of bitangency in well-known visibility graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first progress on the problem",

        "abstract": "Cable-based parallel manipulators (CPM) are light-weight manipulators that can reach high accelerations. The difference between the design of CPM and that of rigid-link parallel manipulators is that cables can only perform while under tension. Redundant limbs, such as extra cables, springs, or cylinders, can be used for applying forces on the mobile platform to generate cable tensions resulting in a redundantly actuated manipulator. To operate this manipulator, the actuator-force distribution amongst the cables and the redundant limbs needs to be determined. Actuator-force optimization techniques developed for rigid-link manipulators are unsuitable for CPM. In this study, a numerical procedure based on convex analysis and optimization is presented to calculate the minimum-norm solution that minimizes the 2-norm of actuator forces. The procedure is based on convex optimization that utilizes the Dykstra's alternating projection algorithm to reach to the optimum solution. This numerical method is successfully applied to 3- and 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) spatial CPMs to determine the optimum actuator forces for a given external load. This study addresses the static analysis in cable-based parallel manipulators in the language of convex analysis",

Even though the calibration of a catadioptric system includes the estimation of various parameters, in this paper we focus on the localization of the mirror. Since some previously proposed methods assume a single view point system, they have strong restrictions on the position and shape of the mirror. We propose a method that uses parallel lights to simplify the geometry of projection for estimating the position of the mirror, thereby not restricting the position or shape of the mirror. Further, we omit the translation process between the camera and calibration objects from the parameters to be estimated by observing some parallel lights from a different direction. We obtain the constraints on the projection and compute the error between the model of the mirror and the measurements. The position of the mirror is estimated by minimizing the error. We also test our method by simulation and real experiments, and finally we evaluate the accuracy of our method.",

        "abstract": "Most present localization algorithms are either range or vision-based. In many environments, only one type of sensor cannot often ensure successful localization; furthermore, using low-priced range sensors instead of expensive, but accurate, laser scanners often lead to poor performance. This paper proposes an MCL-based localization method that robustly estimates the robot pose with fusion of the range information from a low-cost IR scanner and the SIFT based visual information gathered using a mono camera. With sensor fusion, the rough pose estimation from range-based sensors is compensated by the vision-based sensors and slow object recognition can be overcome by the frequent update of the range information. In order to synchronize the two sensors with different bandwidths, the encoder information gathered during object recognition is exploited. This paper also suggests a method for evaluating localization performance that is based on the normalized probability of a vision sensor model. Various experiments show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the robot pose reasonably well and can accurately evaluate the localization performance.",

The method restricts the search space to the vertices of the obstacles, obviating the need to search the entire environment as in earlier GA-based approaches. The new approach is able to produce an off-line plan through an environment containing dynamic obstacles, and can also re-calculate the plan on-line to deal with any motion changes encountered. A particularly novel aspect of the work is the incorporation of the selection of robot speed into the GA genes. The results from a number of realistic environments demonstrate that planning changes in robot speed significantly improves the efficiency of movement through the static and moving obstacles.",

        "abstract": "This research aims to propose the method and equipment to preliminary-announce and indicate the surrounding people both the speed of motion and the direction of motion of the mobile robot that moves on a two-dimensional plane. This paper discusses the mobile robot PMR-6, in which the liquid crystal display (LCD) is set up on the mobile unit, and the state of operation at 1.5 s before the actual motion is indicated. The basis of the content to display is 'arrow' considering the intelligibility for people even at first sight. The speed of motion is expressed as the size (length and width) of the arrow and its color based on traffic signal. The direction of motion is described with the curved condition of the arrow. The characters of STOP are displayed in red in case of stop. The robot was exhibited to the 2005 International Robot Exhibition held in Tokyo. About 200 visitors answered to the questionnaires. The average of five-stage evaluation is 3.56 and 3.97 points on the speed and on the direction respectively, so the method and expression were evaluated comparatively intelligible. As for the gender, the females appreciated about the speed of motion than the males on the whole. Concerning the age, some of the younger age and the upper age admired highly about the direction of motion than the middle age.",

For sparse sensor networks, all the existing localization algorithms fail to work properly due to the lack of distance or connectivity data to uniquely calculate the geo-locations. In MSL, we use mobile sensors to add extra distance constraints to a sparse network, by moving the mobile sensors in the area of deployment and recording distances to neighbors at some intermediate locations. MSL can also be used for localizing and tracking mobile objects in a robotic or body sensor network. Experiments and evaluations of the new algorithm are provided.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the analytical development and preliminary experimental evaluation of a class of exact nonlinear full state model-based observers for underwater vehicle navigation. This class of observers exploits exact knowledge of the vehicle's nonlinear dynamics, the forces and moments acting on the vehicle, and disparate position and velocity measurements. The reported observer is novel in that it estimates the full state of the vehicle and employs Lyapunov techniques to show stability. The performance of the observer is evaluated using data from single degree-of-freedom experiments with a laboratory remotely operated vehicle. High-precision measurements from a 300kHz long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning systems serve as the basis for evaluating the performance of the observer. Error in the observer position estimate possesses a significantly lower standard deviation than measurements from 12kHz LBL systems alone. The performance of the observer is compared to the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the error in the position estimates of these two estimators found to be comparable. These experiments are, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of the experimental implementation of exact nonlinear dynamic model-based observers and their comparison to EKFs for underwater vehicle navigation.",

A novel tire traction/braking model is presented and used to calculate vehicle dynamic forces in an extended Kalman filter framework. Estimates of external forces and robot velocity are derived using measurements from wheel encoders, IMU, and GPS. Weak constraints are used to constrain the evolution of the resistive force estimate based upon physical reasoning. Experimental results show the technique accurately and rapidly detects robot immobilization conditions while providing estimates of the robot's velocity during normal driving. Immobilization detection is shown to be robust to uncertainty in tire model parameters. Accurate immobilization detection is demonstrated in the absence of GPS, indicating the algorithm is applicable for both terrestrial applications and space robotics.",

This synchronization requires reliable estimation of the organ's motion. In this paper, we present a new approach to motion estimation based on a state motion model for a partition of the heart's surface. Its motion behavior is described by a partial differential equation whose input function is assumed to be periodic. An estimator is used on one hand to predict future model states based on reconstruction of the input function and on the other hand to incorporate noisy spatially discrete measurements in order to improve state estimation. The model-based motion estimation is evaluated using a simple heart simulator. Measurements are obtained by reconstructing 3D position of markers on a pulsating membrane by means of a stereo camera system.",

Most devices make use of an articulated mechanical structure introducing distortions between the operator and the explored world. To assess the quality of the interface, this distortion must be identified. This paper deals with this issue and introduces the modeling and the identification of a 3 degrees of freedom haptic interface using inverse model and least squares method used in robotics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, the demand for a man-machine cooperative system, where the machine assists the human operator, is rapidly growing in the industrial fields. To meet this demand, the human model is required to design the suitable assist controller in the man-machine cooperative system. This paper presents a new human behavior model based on a piece-wise affine model which is a class of hybrid dynamical system, and apply it to a sliding task. Since the human behavior is considered to consist of several primitive motions expressed by continuous dynamics and a decision-making expressed by the discrete switch, it seems to be natural to introduce the hybrid system modeling. Particularly, the decision strategy for the number of discrete modes is addressed by using a hierarchical clustering technique, and the measured data are classified into several modes. Then, each primitive motion in each mode is identified based on the affine model. Finally, the switching conditions among modes are identified by applying support vector machine to the classified data. The obtained piece-wise affine model can quantitatively represent both primitive motions and decision-making in the human behavior",

Saccades and smooth pursuit in humans and primates are a significant class of ocular motions, which obey the so called Listing's Law, stating that admissible eye's orientations have always zero torsion during motion. In this paper we present a model of the eye plant proving that Listing's Law implementation is strongly related with the geometry of the eye and its actuation system (extraocular muscles). The proposed model has been used to provide the guidelines for the design of a tendon driven humanoid robot eye. Experimental tests, presented in this paper, validate the model by performing a quantitative comparison of the performance of the robot eye with physiological data measured in humans and primates during saccades.",

        "abstract": "Modular or re-configurable robots have been studied and developed over two decades. Most researches focus on mechatronic interfaces and re-configurable capabilities. However, less attention has been paid to dynamics and control. Consequently, the control performance of a modular robot has never been comparable with an integrated robot, due to the lack of proper handling of the dynamic interactions among the modules. In this paper, the application of the virtual decomposition control to modular robot manipulators is discussed. A high-speed databus with a data rate of 100 Mbps is used for necessary information exchange among the modules. The dynamics based control is fully handled by the local embedded controllers, whereas the host computer handles the kinematics related computation. The stability of the entire robot is rigorously guaranteed. This research aims at giving the modular robots the comparable control performance as the integrated robots, while keeping the fundamental feasibilities such as low cost for mass production, high flexibility, and easy use and expansion.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of computing pathways for a ligand to exit from the active site of a protein. Such problem can be formulated as a mechanical disassembly problem for two articulated objects. Its solution requires searching paths in a constrained high-dimensional configuration-space. Indeed, the ligand passageway inside the protein is often extremely cluttered so that current path planning techniques are unable to solve the disassembly problem in reasonable computing time. The techniques presented in this paper are based on the RRT algorithm. First we discuss some simple and general modifications of the basic algorithm that significantly improve its performance. Then we describe a new variant of the planner that treats ligand and protein degrees of freedom separately. This new algorithm outperforms the basic RRT, particularly for very constrained problems, and is able to handle models with hundreds of degrees of freedom. We analyze the effects of each RRT variant via several examples of different complexity. Although discussions and results of this paper focus on molecular models, the ideas behind the algorithms are general and can be applied to path planners for disassembling articulated mechanical parts.",

Pedestrians are recognized by detecting the braided styles, which is a typical appearance that could discriminate the data of moving feet with other mobile and motionless objects. Two experiments are conducted. One is at the laboratory environment, the purpose of which is to examine the algorithm in details. Another is at an exhibition hall, a populated and wide environment, the purpose is to examine whether the system could be applied for practical needs. It is a big challenge, while the system did well. Pedestrians in the exhibition hall at the moment of measurement are detected. Their motion trajectories are extracted, and associated to the background map, which is made of the motionless objects, and covers the whole exhibition hall.",

The aim is to design the fault indicators, two problems are considered. Firstly, the dynamics of clocks which monitor the system must be sensible to the behavior change resulting from a fault. Secondly, we must specify the inequality clocks constraints for which the system is normal as long as they are satisfied. We introduce the notion of acceptable system behavior modeled by stopwatch automata. This behavior is supervised by two clocks for each interruptible task of the system. The time sub-spaces in the stopwatch automaton locations delimit exactly the range of acceptable behavior. They are synthesized using an algorithm based on the reachability analysis techniques of stopwatch automata. One of the main results of designing this time space is the detection the system faults as early as possible.",

We propose an exhaustive pose-space search that finds all the plausible hypotheses efficiently using epipolar geometry. The obtained pose hypotheses are refined by the RBPF. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method successfully performed 3D SLAM with a small number of particles.",

A landmark initialization method that relies on the Plucker coordinates to represent a 3D line is introduced: a Gaussian sum approximates the feature initial state and is updated as new observations are gathered by the camera. Once initialized, the landmarks state is estimated along an EKF-based SLAM approach: constraints associated with the Plucker representation are considered during the update step of the Kalman filter. The whole SLAM algorithm is validated in simulation runs and results obtained with real data are presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For certain applications, field robotic systems require small size for cost, weight, access, stealth or other reasons. Small size results in constraints on critical resources such as power, space (for sensors and actuators), and computing cycles, but these robots still must perform many of the challenging tasks of their larger brethren. The need for advanced capabilities such as machine vision, application-specific sensing, path planning, self localization, etc. is not reduced by small-scale applications, but needs may vary with the task. As a result, when resources are constrained, it is prudent to configure the robot for the task at hand; both hardware and software. We are developing a reconfigurable computing subsystem for resource-constrained robots that allows rapid deployment of statically configured hardware and software for a specific task. The use of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) provides flexibility in hardware for both sensor interfacing and hardware-accelerated computation. In this paper, we describe a static reconfiguration architecture we call the morphing bus that allows the rapid assembly of sensors and dedicated computation through reusable hardware and software modules. It is a novel sensor bus in the fact that no bus interface circuitry is required on the sensor side - the bus \"morphs\" to accommodate the signals of the sensor",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We proposed in a previous paper [1] a hybrid two-layered approach for motion planning of multiple agents in static virtual environments, consisting of open spaces connected by multiple narrow passages. The discrete Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD) of the environment is used to identify narrow passages, and plan the global path of each agent independently of other agents' global paths. As each agent moves along its global path, the agent's path is locally modified using the hybrid technique of combining steering behaviors with Coordination Graphs (CG), where coordination graphs are used for deadlock avoidance in the narrow passages. The planner in the previous paper [1] was single threaded, and it was able to plan the motions of 30 agents moving around in a simple virtual environment with 3 narrow passages. If more agents are moving in a more complex virtual environment (i.e., with more narrow passages), we may not be able to construct and process all the coordination graphs in real-time. In this paper, we parallelize the single threaded planner in a supervisor-worker paradigm with Unix processes who communicate with each other using System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanism. We show that significant, scalable speedups are obtained by constructing and processing coordination graphs in parallel on a Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a methodology to drive the end effector of a robotic manipulator across the surface of an object in the workspace, and at the same time the manipulator can apply a force to the object, through its end-effector. Three typical tasks are considered, namely stabilization of the end effector over the object's surface and applying a specific force on it, motion planning and eventually trajectory tracking of the end effector across the object's surface. The proposed controllers utilize navigation functions and are based on the belt zone vector fields concept. The derived dynamic controllers are realized using an integrator backstepping methodology. The derived feedback based controllers guarantee global convergence and collision avoidance. The closed form solution provides fast feedback rendering the methodology particularly suitable for implementation on real time systems. The properties of the proposed methodology are verified through non-trivial computer simulations.",

In the first level, we use a background segmentation technique to identify foreground regions which include moving shadows. In the second step, pixel-based decisions are made by comparing the current frame with the background model to distinguish between shadows and actual foreground. In the third step, this result is improved using blob-level reasoning which works on geometric constraints of identified shadow and foreground blobs. Results on various indoor and outdoor sequences under different illumination conditions show the success of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Jumping and landing movements are characterized by large instantaneous forces, short duration, and a high uncertainty concerning take off and landing points. Such characteristics make conventional types of control and robot design inadequate. Here we present an approach to realize motor control of jumping and landing which exploits the synergy between control and mechanical structure. Our experimental system is a pneumatically actuated bipedal robot called \"Mowgli\". Mowgli's artificial musculoskeletal system consists of six McKibben pneumatic muscle actuators including bi-articular muscle and two legs with hip, knee, and ankle joints. Mowgli can reach jump heights of more than 50% of its body height and can land softly. Our results show a proximo-distal sequence of joint extensions during jumping despite simultaneous motor activity. Extensions in the whole body motion are caused by the compliance and the natural dynamics of the legs. In addition to the experiments with the real robot, we also simulated two types of open loop controllers for vertical jumping with disturbance. We found that the model controlled by open loop motor command through a muscle-tendon mechanism could jump robustly. The simulation results demonstrate the contribution of the artificial musculoskeletal system as a physical feedback loop in explosive movements.",

We introduce force torque maps, which are either computed automatically exploiting modern graphical processors or are measured by scanning forces and torques during contact motions. Subsequently, force torque maps are applied as model information during execution of real assembly tasks. Also, computer vision is included by comparing relative poses of features in virtual images with their real relative poses given from measured images. For fusion of these two (or more) different sensors we suggest to use particle filters. Experiments with variations of peg in hole tasks in a real work cell demonstrate our new approach to be very useful for the whole process chain from planning to execution.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of generating patrol paths for a team of mobile robots inside a designated target area. Patrolling requires an area to be visited repeatedly by the robot(s) in order to monitor its current state. First, we present frequency optimization criteria used for evaluation of patrol algorithms. We then present a patrol algorithm that guarantees maximal uniform frequency, i.e., each point in the target area is covered at the same optimal frequency. This solution is based on finding a circular path that visits all points in the area, while taking into account terrain directionality and velocity constraints. Robots are positioned uniformly along this path, using a second algorithm. Moreover, the solution is guaranteed to be robust in the sense that uniform frequency of the patrol is achieved as long as at least one robot works properly.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the operation of the queue-formation structure (or Q-structure) in multi-robot teams with limited communications. Information flow is divided into two time scales: (i) the fast time scale where the robots' reactive actions are determined based only on local communications, and (ii) the slow time scale, where information required is less demanding, can be collected over a longer time with intermittent information loss. Therefore, there is no need for global information at all times, reducing the overall communication load. In addition, a dynamic target determination algorithm, based on the Q-structure, is used to produce a series of targets that incrementally guide each robot into formation. It provides greater control over the distance between robots on the same queue for better formation scaling. An analysis of the convergence of the system of robots is provided. Simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the scheme.",

We model a set of interacting Dubins vehicles with fixed turning angle and speed. We perform simulations for a large number of agents and we show experimental realizations of the model on a testbed with a small number of vehicles. In both cases, critical thresholds exist between coherent, stable, and scalable flocking and dispersed or collapsing motion of the group.",

        "abstract": "One of the critical research issues for the future robot is the avoidance of collisions with people while it moves among them. Therefore, people-tracking and motion prediction are important. People are tracked more readily and successfully by using distributed sensor networks than robot's local sensors. Floor sensor networks, in particular, are resistant to changes in lighting conditions and other environmental disturbances. However, the problem with the system is that a person walking is observed as if it were being done in \"rabbit hops\": The signal is nonlinear and even nonholonomic. We tackled the problem by assuming that human walking is regular in terms of walking rhythms. Then the signal was modeled by an oscillation model based on four walking parameters: cycles, phases, directions, and strides. To adapt the parameters to irregular walking, the model was multi-hypothesized based upon a particle filtering algorithm. Experimental results showed that the multi-hypothesized oscillation models showed more than 80% tracking accuracy for four walking patterns: straight walking, stop-and-go, turn, and winding walking. Further, the models were superior to the nearest neighbor filter with regard to the performance of data association for two persons.",

We present the multipartite RRT (MP-RRT), an RRT variant which supports planning in unknown or dynamic environments. By purposefully biasing the sampling distribution and re-using branches from previous planning iterations, MP-RRT combines the strengths of existing adaptations of RRT for dynamic motion planning. Experimental results show MP-RRT to be very effective for planning in dynamic environments with unknown moving obstacles, replanning in high-dimensional configuration spaces, and replanning for systems with space time constraints.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Object tracking is a challenging problem in a number of computer vision applications. A number of approaches have been proposed and implemented to track moving objects in image sequences. The particle filter, which recursively constructs the posterior probability distributions of the state space, is the most popular approach. In the particle filter, many kinds of features are used for tracking a moving object in cluttered environments. The specific feature for tracking is selected according to the type of moving object and condition of the tracking environment. Improved tracking performance is obtained by using multiple features concurrently. This paper proposes the particle filter algorithm, using multiple features, such as IFD (inter-frame difference) and gray level, to track a moving object. The IFD is used to detect an object and the gray level is used to distinguish the target object from other objects. This paper designs the circuit of the proposed algorithm using VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) in an FPGA (field programmable gate array) for tracking without considerable computational cost, since the particle filter requests many computing powers to track objects in real-time. All functions of the proposed tracking system are implemented in an FPGA. A tracking system with this FPGA is implemented and the corresponding performance is measured",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a series of in situ nanofabrication techniques of nanostructures, including cutting, bending and welding of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), inside a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) is reported. In the CNT cutting technique, a CNT was exposed to a low energy beam assisted with 1 seem oxygen gas flow. The proposed technique is effective being capable of cutting a CNT in less than 1 minute. It was found that, although the total pressure of specimen chamber reached 10-2 Pa, high speed cutting occurs only in the area close to the nozzle. The presence of oxygen gas in the vicinity of the CNT can be applied also for the bending of CNT, if some conditions of the cutting technique are changed. These include the increase of the acceleration voltage and/or setting the oxygen gas nozzle farther from the sample, and/or reducing the irradiation time. Using the proposed bending method the angles larger than 90deg can be formed and the location of the kink can be set accurately. It is also shown, that tungsten can be deposited on a substrate by the electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID), if the oxygen of the proposed cutting technique is replaced by W(CO)6. In this paper, these three nanofabrication methods were exploited in creation of a two dimensional (2D) nanostructure, the letters N and U, and a three dimensional (3D) nanostructure, the letter N. The 2D letters were constructed from 6 CNTs assembled on a substrate while the 3D letter N was bended from a single CNT and fixed to stand on a substrate. Based on the high performance of the proposed techniques, it is suggested that the cutting, bending, and welding techniques inside SEM will become widely utilized in the fabrication and assembly of nanodevices and in the characterization of nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Nanorobotic spot welding using single-crystalline-copper-filled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is investigated experimentally inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Controlled melting and flowing of copper inside nanotube shells are realized by applying bias voltages between 1.5 V and 2.5 V. The average mass flow rate of the copper was found to be 120 ag/s according to TEM video imaging (measured visually at approximately 11.6 nm/s through the CNT). Successful soldering of a copper-filled CNT onto another CNT using a nanorobotic manipulator shows promise for nano spot welding, which can play a role similar to its macro counterpart for the interconnection of nano building blocks for the assembly of nanoelectronic circuits and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).",

        "abstract": "An emotional robot is regarded as being able to express its diverse emotions in response to internal or external events. This paper presents a robot affective system that is able to express life-like emotions. In order to do that, the overall architecture of our affective system is based on neuroscience from which we obtained the natural emotional processing routines. Based on that architecture, we apply the reinforcer effects expecting that those would lead the affective system to be more similar to real-life's emotion expression. The robot affective system has responsibility for gathering environmental information and evaluating which environmental stimuli are rewarding or punishing. The emotion processing involves with appraisal of the external and internal stimuli, such as homeostasis, and generates the affective states of the robot. Therefore, emotions are associated with the presentation, omission, and termination of the expected rewards or punishers (reinforcers). The experimental results show that our affective system can express several emotions simultaneously as well as the emotions decrease, increase, or changes to another emotion seamlessly as time passes.",

Visual information is also used for building appearance based topological maps, which can be used for localization. In this paper we describe a system capable of using this appearance based topological map for navigation. The system is made robust by using the epipolar geometry and a planar floor constraint in computing the necessary heading information. Using this method the robot is able to drive robustly in a large environment.

Two steps are required: (1) solution of a least squares matrix problem, followed by projection of the solution onto the nearest scaled subunitary matrix, and (2) solution of a least squares vector problem, followed by projection onto the three dimensional special orthogonal group, SO(3). Although the method can be iterated when necessary, it achieves accuracy to standard stopping criteria with on average only one iteration; thus it can be considered nearly analytical. The method is compared to numerical methods and is shown to be much faster than earlier iterative methods. Both perspective and affine cameras models are treated.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method of optimizing the needle insertion point, heading and depth for needle insertion into deformable tissue. The goal is to minimize the distance between a number of specified targets and the needle. Assuming a rigid needle and a deformable tissue described by a finite element model, an iterative optimization method is proposed that uses the needle insertion simulation. At each iteration, the best fitted 3D line to the targets in the simulated deformed configuration is used as a candidate for the new insertion line in the next iteration. This method has been implemented in a prostate brachytherapy simulator to minimize seed misplacement errors. The targets are designed to lie on a straight line in the undeformed configuration inside the prostate. To increase the accuracy while simulating the prostate rotation, a non-linear model is used. The neo-Hookean material model is exploited to determine the effects of geometric and mechanical nonlinearities and compressibility effects. It is shown that the optimization algorithm converges in few iterations and decreases the targeting error effectively.",

Since the EKF is based on the white noise assumption, if there are colored noise or systematic bias error in the system, EKF inevitably diverges. The neural network in this algorithm is used to approximate the uncertainty of the system model due to mismodeling and extreme nonlinearities. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm NNEKF is very effective compared with the standard EKF algorithm under the practical condition where the mobile robot has bias error in its modeling and environment has strong uncertainties.

        "abstract": "We describe a binocular vision system that emulates disparity computation in the neuronal circuit of the primary visual cortex (V1). The system consists of two sets of silicon retinas and simple cell chips that correspond to the binocular vision and field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit. This arrangement mimics the hierarchical architecture of the visual system of the brain. The silicon retina is an analog very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit and possesses a Laplacian-Gaussian-like spatial filter similar to the receptive field of the vertebrate retina. The simple cell chip generates a Gabor-like spatial filter similar to the orientation-selective receptive field of the simple cell in V1 by aggregating several pixels of the silicon retina. The FPGA receives the outputs from the two simple cell chips corresponding to binocular inputs from the left and right eyes and calculates the binocular disparity in real-time based on the disparity energy model. The system provides output images tuned to five different disparities in parallel. The disparity map is obtained by comparing these disparity energy outputs. Due to the combination of the parallel and analog computation of the aVLSIs and the pixel-wise computation with hard-wired digital circuits, the present system can efficiently compute the binocular disparity using compact hardware and low power dissipation in real-time.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a new three-dimensional talking robot Waseda Talker No. 6 (WT-6), which generates speech sounds by mechanically simulating articulatory motions as well as aero-acoustic phenomena in the vocal tract. WT-6 has 17-DOF vocal mechanism. It has three-dimensional lips, tongue, jaw and velum which form the 3D vocal tract structure. It also has an independent jaw opening/closing mechanism, which controls the relative tongue position in the vocal tract as well as the oral opening. The previous robot in the series had a 2D tongue and was not able to realize precise closure to produce human-like consonants such as /s/ or /r/. The new tongue, which can be controlled to form 3D shapes, is able to produce more realistic vocal tract shapes. The vocal cord model was also improved by adding a new pitch control mechanism that pushes from the side of the vocal cords. The pitch range is broader than that of the previous robot; it is sufficiently broad so as to be able to reproduce normal human speech. Preliminary experimental results showed improved synthesized speech quality for the vowels /a/, /u/ and /o/.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents results related to our latest semi-automated blastocyst microinjection system. Here, the improvements made to the microinjection system are described and evaluated. First, after replacing the original piezo-electric kinematic stage by a DC motor-based robot manipulator, experimentation showed that the speed and the precise motion control of pipettes were improved. Second, by introducing an X-Y stage into the system, to manipulate the Petri dish around the microscope's field of view, multiple microinjection speed was improved. Third, by using SSD template matching to track the injection pipette, rather than the cross-correlation template matching algorithm used in the original system, improvements were made to pipette localization. Under human control, this new semi-automated system gives improved microinjection performance metrics compared to previously obtained results. The system is also providing implicit human knowledge of the microinjection process via the human-control interface. It is the encoding of this knowledge that will lead to the first fully automated system. The semi-automated microinjection system is being tested and evaluated in the AMC at UNC-Chapel Hill.",

        "abstract": "Many control methods have been studied on the assumption that the feet of biped robots contact the ground with four points. However, it is difficult for almost all of such biped robots to maintain four-point contact on uneven terrains because they have rigid and flat soles. In order to solve the problem, foot mechanisms should be studied. In 2003, we developed WS-1R (Waseda Shoes - No.1 Refined) which is able to maintain four-point contact. However, it is difficult to deal with the concave or convex ground because of the problems of the contact detection and sideways slip. So, WS-5 (Waseda Shoes - No.5) has been developed. To avoid the slip of the foot, a cam-slider locking system consisting of a solenoid and a cam is constructed and installed at the foot. Also, linear encoders are employed to measure the position of the foot sliders. Through walking experiments on uneven terrains, the effectiveness of WS-5 is confirmed.",

This will involve a new role for the final user who will change from passive consumer to active participant. To get the most advantage from this opportunity it is necessary to provide a platform which will be interoperable with home and building automation systems and that will supply several functionalities as communicate with distributor/retailer, interact with consumer, manage loads, energy storages and domestic micro-generation. In this way households will become active \"nodes\" of the electric network that could also provide services for the network (power modulation) and the market (reduce energy price volatility).",

        "abstract": "A novel adaptive unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based on dual estimation structure is proposed. The filter is composed of two parallel master-slave UKFs, while the master one estimates the states and the slave one estimates the diagonal elements of the noise covariance matrix for the master UKF. By estimating the noise covariance online, the proposed method is able to compensate the errors resulting from the change of the noise statistics. Such a mechanism improves the adaptive ability of the UKF and enlarges its application scope. Simulations conducted on the dynamics of an omni-directional mobile robot indicate that the performance of the adaptive UKF is superior to the standard one in terms of fast convergence and estimation accuracy.",

The aim of the control is to move the platform of the parallel robot such that the image feature points reach the desired locations. An adaptive supervisory fuzzy logic controller (ASFLC) is first designed to compensate for the uncertainties of the parallel robot and uncertainty of the image Jacobian, then a hybrid controller (HC) including the image-based nonlinear controller (IBNC) and the ASFLC is derived by using the Lyapunov direct method to realize the precision position regulation (PPR). The stability of the closed-loop system in the Lyapunov sense is proven theoretically. The simulation results demonstrate that the PRBPPS realizes PPR with very good robustness to parameter uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "The foundry business model was first developed by TSMC in 1985. A foundry should provide customers with IC manufacturing services. Those customers include IC design houses, integrated device manufacturers (IDM), and system suppliers. However, most electronic products are consumer products, and their life cycle has been reducing with time. An IC design house needs to continuously develop ICs with new functions to meet the current market demand for consumable products. Meanwhile, to support customers for high speed and low cost end product development, foundry service providers must also continue developing new process technologies, from 0.25mum down to 32nm. Unfortunately, advances in new manufacturing process technologies also create difficulties in new IC design. These advances increase the IC design failure rate. Currently, no effective working model and system exists to solve this problem. To formulate this high IC design failure problem, this work proposes a novel engineering-chain (EC) business model. This work also proposes an engineering chain management system (ECMS) to help achieve the goals of EC, such as improving IC design success rate, reducing IC design cycle time, lowering IC design costs, and increasing revenue.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This work treats the problem of modeling and identification of the structural damping of the flexible link of a rigid-flexible manipulator. Besides dissipating energy due to the joint friction, like in rigid robots, flexible robots also dissipate energy due to structural damping that results in the time amplitude decay of the flexible arms oscillations. This behavior is traditionally tackled recurring to viscous, fractional Voigt-Kelvin or hysteretic models. In this paper, for the latter two approaches, numerical approximations are used for their numerical implementation. Furthermore, a heuristic method based on the joint and flexible arm time responses is applied and compared with other methods, like recursive least-squares, to identify the large set of parameters of a flexible manipulator, including the inertial and joint friction parameters.",

        "abstract": "The success of sampling-based motion planners has resulted in a plethora of methods for improving planning components, such as sampling and connection strategies, local planners and collision checking primitives. Although this rapid progress indicates the importance of the motion planning problem and the maturity of the field, it also makes the evaluation of new methods time consuming. We propose that a systems approach is needed for the development and the experimental validation of new motion planners and/or components in existing motion planners. In this paper, we present the online, open-source, programming system for motion planning (OOPSMP), a programming infrastructure that provides implementations of various existing algorithms in a modular, object-oriented fashion that is easily extendible. The system is open-source, since a community-based effort better facilitates the development of a common infrastructure and is less prone to errors. We hope that researchers will contribute their optimized implementations of their methods and thus improve the quality of the code available for use. A dynamic Web interface and a dynamic linking architecture at the programming level allows users to easily add new planning components, algorithms, benchmarks, and experiment with different parameters. The system allows the direct comparison of new contributions with existing approaches on the same hardware and programming infrastructure",

        "abstract": "In this paper, methods for detecting obstacles on a plane using a relative disparity map (RDMap) are proposed and discussed. The RDMap, which was formerly introduced by the author Umeda, is relative to a plane that is observed at first as the reference. It has an interesting feature that a plane in real 3D space also becomes a plane in the map, and has homogeneous characteristics compared to an ordinary range image. The proposed methods work even when the pose of the sensor changes significantly, which is the case in humanoid walking. First, a method to detect planar regions and obstacles by fitting a plane to the RDMap and a method to obtain the pose parameters from the RDMap are introduced. Fundamental experiments are then conducted to verify that a plane in real 3D space becomes a plane in the RDMap and that obstacles can be detected using the residual sum of squares for the fitted plane, and measurement errors in pose parameters are then evaluated. Finally, an experimental system with a humanoid and a small range image sensor is constructed, and it is demonstrated that the humanoid can detect obstacles on a plane by the proposed methods while walking.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Human can pinch or grasp and manipulate an object stably and dexterously. Accomplishment of such tasks is contributed from human hand's configuration, called \"Fingers-thumb opposability\". This opposability of the thumb against other digits is specific and granted to only human among primates. When we use a cell phone, or change a TV's channel using a remote controller, we grasp it by a palm and digits other than the thumb, and push buttons using the thumb quickly, without looking the buttons. These kinds of thumb's movement seem to be one of the most intelligent movements in a human. Therefore, execution of such touching tasks without visual or tactile sensing is called in this paper \"Blind Touching\". The goal of this research is to realize human-like \"Blind Touching\" by means of a 5 D.O.F. thumb robot model with soft and hemispherical finger-tip. To do this, we formulate a simultaneous contact position and touching force control by using 3-Dimensional rolling contact with the task plane. First, dynamics of the 5 D.O.F. thumb robot model with hemispherical soft finger-tip under rolling constraints is derived. Then, a sensory-motor control law without vision, force or tactile sensing is proposed. Some numerical simulations show that the desired contact position and touching force can be attained by the proposed control scheme. A theoretical proof of convergence to the desired state is also presented.",

By defining appropriate values for the initial angular momentum, a method is developed that can lead a mechanism to a desired final configuration from an initial given one, in prescribed time. This method is optimization-based and fully exploits the initial mechanism angular momentum. Obstacle avoidance during flight is achieved by setting additional constraints.

This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders, Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty. This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the ICP (iterative closest/corresponding point) algorithm. Finally, it is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.",

Nevertheless, performance tests, which are used to evaluate the emotion expressing robots, are based on categorical (discrete) models of emotions. In this paper the use of dimensional-based tests is suggested, e.g. semantic differential approaches like the pleasure-arousal-dominance-model. By deriving the test from the theory on which the design of an object is based, the validity of the test raises significantly. Major benefits are explicit guidelines for design improvement and the possible integration of arbitrary actuated expressive features for which no common framework as, for example, the facial action coding system (FACS) exists. For illustration purposes, a comparative evaluation study of the robot EDDIE is conducted: one test is based on a categorical model and one test is based on a dimensional model of emotion. A third study based on a dimensional model demonstrates the evaluation of the influence of animal like features on the perceived emotion state.",

The type of forces generated by the actuation mechanism as well as due to the impulsive interaction with the working environment are studied. Then design steps are proposed for (i) the reduction or elimination of undesired impulsive forces, (ii) the attenuation of the force ripple transmitted to the manipulated object. The outcome is a smooth, controllable force transmitted to the manipulated object. A cantilever is mounted on the platform and preliminary experiments are conducted.",

The aim is to get a better understanding of the well known intuitive behavior of these systems, such as the need for triangulation to features from different positions in order to get accurate relative pose estimates. The characterisation of the unobservable directions is made using the nullspace basis of the stripped observability matrix. This allows us to identify which vehicle motions are required to maximise the number of observable states in the system, which in turn affects accuracy in the estimation process. The analysis is performed by modelling the system in the continuous time domain as piecewise constant. Simulation results using an extended information filter are shown to verify the results of the observability analysis.",

The obtained bounds provide a description of the asymptotic positioning performance of the robots and the targets as a function of the sensor characteristics and the structure of the graph of relative position measurements. By employing an extended Kalman filter (EKF) formulation for data fusion, two key asymptotic results are derived. The first provides the guaranteed worst-case positioning accuracy, whereas the second determines an upper bound on the expected covariance of the estimates. We investigate the effects of jointly estimating the targets' and the robots' position, and demonstrate that it results in better accuracy for the robots' position estimates. The theoretical results are confirmed both in simulation and experimentally.",

It relies both on a flexible continuous slip and force control algorithm as well as on the use of a new slip sensor which is able to measure relative motion between the robot end-effector and the machined object surface. The smart slip and force control concept is applied to a robotic arm finishing the surface of an unfixed randomly moved object.

As with most image-based visual servoing methods, commands are expressed in the space of image features. However, instead of relating instantaneous image-based variations to instantaneous variations in Euclidian space, the visuomotor function relates arbitrary image-based variations to Euclidian transformations. The visuomotor function is approximated in real-time by using online estimation techniques. The system improves its performance with experience and is able to adapt to different configurations of the cameras or environment. Given the disparities between two sets of corresponding image points, the visuomotor function provides the Euclidian transformation the robot must execute in order to align the image coordinates.",

However, the current value of the depth Z for each considered feature must be known. We propose a method to estimate on-line the value of Z for point features while the camera is moving through the scene, by using tools from nonlinear observer theory. By interpreting Z as a continuous unknown state with known dynamics, we build an estimator which asymptotically recovers the actual depth value for the selected feature.",

An initialization step is proposed for a hybrid eye-in-hand/eye-to-hand grasping system to fulfil this requirement. In this paper, the object of interest is assumed to be within the eye-to-hand field of view, whereas it may not be within the eye-in-hand one. The object model is unknown and no database is used. The object lies in a complex scene with a cluttered background. A method to automatically focus on the object of interest is presented, tested and validated on a multi view robotic system.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a control architecture for controlling the locomotion of an amphibious snake/lamprey robot capable of swimming and serpentine locomotion. The control architecture is based on a central pattern generator (CPG) model inspired from the neural circuits controlling locomotion in the lamprey's spinal cord. The CPG model is implemented as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators on board of the robot. The CPG generates coordinated travelling waves in real time while being interactively modulated by a human-operator. Interesting aspects of the CPG model include (1) that it exhibits limit cycle behavior (i.e. it produces stable rhythmic patterns that are robust against perturbations), (2) that the limit cycle behavior has a closed-form solution which provides explicit control over relevant characteristics such as frequency, amplitude and wavelength of the travelling waves, and (3) that the control parameters of the CPG can be continuously and interactively modulated by a human operator to offer high maneuverability. We demonstrate how the CPG allows one to easily adjust the speed and direction of locomotion both in water and on ground while ensuring that continuous and smooth setpoints are sent to the robot's actuated joints.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, robust and light-weight parts used in the automobile and aeronautics industry are made of carbon fibres. To increase the mechanical toughness of the parts the carbon fibres are stitched in the preforming process using a sewing robot. However, current systems miss high flexibility and rely on manual programming of each part. The main target of this work is to develop an automatic system that autonomously sets the structure strengthening seams. Therefore, a rapid and flexible following of the carbon textile edges is required. Due to the black and reflective carbon fibres a laser-stripe sensor is necessary and the processing of the range data is a challenging task. The paper proposes a real time approach where different edge detection methodologies are combined in a voting scheme to increase the edge tracking robustness. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated, sensor-guided robotic sewing process. The seam can be located to within 0.65mm at a detection rate of 99.3% for individual scans.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problems of automatically planning Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) paths which best exploit complex current data, from computational estuarine model forecasts, while also avoiding obstacles. In particular we examine the possibilities for a novel type of AUV mission deployment in fast flowing tidal river regions which experience bi-directional current flow. These environments are interesting in that, by choosing an appropriate path in space and time, an AUV may both bypass adverse currents which are too fast to be overcome by the vehicle's motors and also exploit favorable currents to achieve far greater speeds than the motors could otherwise provide, while substantially saving energy. The AUV can \"ride\" currents both up and down the river, enabling extended monitoring of otherwise energy-exhausting, fast flow environments. The paper discusses suitable path parameterizations, cost functions and optimization techniques which enable optimal AUV paths to be efficiently generated. These paths take maximum advantage of the river currents in order to minimize energy expenditure, journey time and other cost parameters. The resulting path planner can automatically suggest useful alternative mission start and end times and locations to those specified by the user. Examples are presented for navigation in a simple simulation of the fast flowing Hudson River waters around Manhattan.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper studies optimal inventory rationing policies for a retailer of perishable products who sells through its own stores and third party Websites by an affiliate program. By posting on partners' Webpages, an affiliate program allows the retailer to attract more customers who otherwise would be missed. However, the retailer needs to pay out a commission for each sale originated from the Website operator that participates in the affiliate program. Thus, the net revenue of selling one unit of product to an online \"referral\" (online customer) is less profitable than that to a customer from a physical store. When the inventory at stores is running low, the retailer may further refer the online request to somebody else for fulfilling, which is equivalently to say that the retailer can reject online customer requests. Therefore, upon the arrival of any demand through the affiliate program, the retailer needs to decide whether or not to accept it; and if so, assign which of multiple outlets for the fulfillment. Based on a discrete-time dynamic programming model, the optimal admission policy of the retailer is analyzed in this paper, which is shown to be a two-dimensional threshold policy. The structural properties of the revenue function are analyzed, and numerical examples are given to show the revenue impact of optimal admission control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to large view visual servoing in the context of object manipulation. In many scenarios the features extracted in the reference pose are only perceivable across a limited region of the work space. The limited visibility of features necessitates the introduction of additional intermediate reference views of the object and requires path planning in view space. In our scheme the visual control is based on decoupled moments of SIFT-features, which are generic in the sense that the control operates with a dynamic set of feature correspondences rather than a static set of individual features. The additional freedom of dynamic feature sets enables flexible path planning in the image space and online selection of optimal reference views during servoing to the goal view. The time to convergence to the goal view is estimated by a neural network based on the residual feature error and the quality of the SIFT feature distribution. The transition among reference views occurs on the basis of this estimated cost which is evaluated online based on the current set of visible features. The dynamic switching scheme achieves robust and nearly time-optimal convergence of the visual control across the entire task space. The effectiveness and robustness of the scheme is confirmed in an evaluation in a virtual reality simulation and on a real robot arm with a eye-in-hand configuration.",

The new technique has advantages over existing techniques when designing robotic systems for specific, unconventional tasks, and for constrained motion. In this paper, the technique is used to assist in the selection of a remote center-of-motion (RCM) location for a research testbed that is being developed at CSTAR to study robotics-assisted minimally-invasive surgery. The optimization technique allows isotropy to be considered with respect to the surgical tool tip while operating under the RCM constraint. Global isotropy over a minimally-invasive surgical workspace is evaluated for a set of candidate RCM locations, and an optimal RCM location with respect to isotropy is selected. The isotropy results are compared with experimental data for a number of candidate RCM locations. The experimental results confirm the usefulness of the optimization technique.",

Appropriate bounds on velocities and accelerations have to be considered in order to avoid wheels skidding and actuators saturation.

        "abstract": "The task of visual surveillance involves pervasively observing multiple targets as they move through a field of sensor nodes. Mutational analysis and shape based control have been proposed to overcome the limitations of current feature (point) based visual servoing and tracking techniques generally employed to provide an optimal solution for the surveillance task. Hausdorff tracking paradigm for visual tracking of multiple targets using a single sensor has been proposed for accomplishing the surveillance task. However, Hausdorff tracking incorporates some redundancy in the actuation mechanism. This paper exploits this redundancy in the camera motion in order to accomplish various sub-tasks which can be assigned to the system, such as minimization of consumed energy maintaining manipulability etc. The complete task can then be expressed in a multi-objective constrained optimization framework and can be solved, i.e., the input to the camera can be derived, using various methods such as physical programming, nonlinear programming, weighted sum method, etc. In this paper, we use the physical programming method based on the various advantages such as ease of expressing multiple objectives in a physically significant manner. Experimental results are provided which show the advantages of using the physical programming approach over the weighted sum method for constructing the task criterion for multi-objective optimization problems.",

The production node is modelled by a discrete-event model, being the system state, consisting of the continuous level of input and output inventories, affected by the asynchronous processes relevant to part arrivals and product departures. Moreover, also the resource capacity of the node is represented by a continuous variable (to be shared among the two classes). In the paper, two optimization problems are proposed: the former is only stated due to its intrinsic complexity, whereas the latter (a simplified version of the former) is stated and solved. In the latter problem, an optimization is performed each time an event occurs, in order to determine which the next event is, when the next event will occur, how many raw parts/products will arrive/depart, and which portions of production capacity are assigned to the two classes.",

The oracle may be a human or a highly accurate sensor. At each timestep the agent must choose whether to take a domain-level action or consult the oracle. This formulation comprises a factorization between information-gathering actions and domain-level actions, allowing us to characterize the value of information and to examine the problem of planning under uncertainty from a novel perspective. We propose an algorithm to capitalize on this factorization and the special structure of the OPOMDP, and we test the algorithm's performance on a new sample domain. On this new domain, we are able to solve a problem with hundreds of thousands of action-states and vastly outperform a previous state-of-the-art approximate technique",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the extraction of visual landmarks from outdoor images for mobile robot applications. The concept of group of landmarks, called landmark-view, is introduced, aggregating the most relevant landmarks present in each scene. The relevance of the landmarks is determined by their relative visual saliency. Thus, landmark co-occurrence and spatial and saliency relationships between them are added to the single landmark descriptors, which are based on saliency and color distribution in chromaticity space. A suitable framework to compare landmark-views is developed, and it is shown how this remarkably enhances the recognition performance, compared against the single landmark recognition. A view-matching model is constructed using logistic regression. Experimentation using 45 views, acquired outdoors, containing 273 landmarks, yielded good recognition results. Of the 42 corresponding view pairs, 30 were recognized correctly, resulting in 71.4% of correct classification of similar views. Of the 948 non-corresponding view pairs, 768 were recognized correctly, resulting in 81.0% of correct classification in non-similar views. The overall percentage of correct view classification obtained was 80.6%, indicating the convenience of the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a reliable navigation of a mobile robot in outdoor environment. We fuse differential GPS and odometry data using the framework of extended Kalman filter to localize a mobile robot. And also, we propose an algorithm to detect curbs through the laser range finder. An important feature of road environment is the existence of curbs. The mobile robot builds the map of the curbs of roads and the map is used for tracking and localization. The navigation system for the mobile robot consists of a mobile robot and a control station. The mobile robot sends the image data from a camera to the control station. The control station receives and displays the image data and the teleoperator commands the mobile robot based on the image data. Since the image data does not contain enough data for reliable navigation, a hybrid strategy for reliable mobile robot in outdoor environment is suggested. When the mobile robot is faced with unexpected obstacles or the situation that, if it follows the command, it can happen to collide, it sends a warning message to the teleoperator and changes the mode from teleoperated to autonomous to avoid the obstacles by itself. After avoiding the obstacles or the collision situation, the mode of the mobile robot is returned to teleoperated mode. We have been able to confirm that the appropriate change of navigation mode can help the teleoperator perform reliable navigation in outdoor environment through experiments in the road.",

The Treadport active wind tunnel (TPAWT) is thus created in order to produce air flow patterns that allow a variety of wind angles and speeds to be felt by the user. In order to control this system in real-time, the small gain theorem is used in conjunction with a dynamic extension to formulate an output feedback control law. Examples of controller formulations are derived and discrete time simulations in FLUENT demonstrate their effectiveness. The controller is then validated experimentally using a scale model of the TPAWT.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of controlling a micro robot which moves either on a line or on circle of predetermined radius. Locomotion constraints of this type are usual in micro robots, and therefore, it is important to have efficient and easy to implement ways of coping with these constraints. To solve the problem we present a multilevel motion controller that can be easily implemented on a robot with scarce computational resources as it does not rely on complex logical operations. It reduces the kinematics of the micro robot to the kinematics of a unicycle, screening in effect the micro behavior from the high level planner. Simulated results are provided to verify the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the capsule endoscope can be widely used for the diagnosis of digestive organs. It is passively moved by the peristaltic waves of gastro-intestinal tract and thus has some limitations for doctor to get the image of the organ and to diagnose more thoroughly. As a solution of these problems, therefore, a locomotive mechanism of capsule endoscopes has being developed. Our proposed capsule-type microrobot has synchronized multiple legs that are actuated by a linear actuator and two mobile cylinders inside of the capsule. By the novel kinematic relation between the legs and the mobile cylinders, the microrobot can easily move forward in the gastro-intestine. For the feasibility test of the proposed locomotive mechanism, a series of experiments were carried out including in-vitro and in-vivo tests. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the proposed locomotive mechanism is not only easy to be used for micro capsule endoscopes but also effective to move inside of intestinal tract.",

The aim of the session is to compare different existing designs and prototypes of parallel mechanisms using a common set of benchmarking criteria. First, the kinematic architectures of parallel mechanisms of the multipteron family are presented. In addition to the tripteron and the quadrupteron, the pentapteron, a five-degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel mechanism is introduced. Then, the benchmarking criteria are applied to the prototypes of the tripteron (3-dof) and the quadrupteron (4-dof) prototypes. Although the tripteron and quadrupteron parallel mechanisms have been presented elsewhere, their properties, highlighted by the benchmarking analysis presented here are revealed for the first time.",

The particle RRT algorithm explicitly considers uncertainty in its domain, similar to the operation of a particle filter. Each extension to the search tree is treated as a stochastic process and is simulated multiple times. The behavior of the robot can be characterized based on the specified uncertainty in the environment, and guarantees can be made as to the performance under this uncertainty. Extensions to the search tree, and therefore entire paths, may be chosen based on the expected probability of successful execution. The benefit of this algorithm is demonstrated in the simulation of a rover operating in rough terrain with unknown coefficients of friction",

        "abstract": "Self localization and mapping with vision is still an open research field. Since redundancy in the sensing suite is too expensive for consumer-level robots, we base on vision as the main sensing system for SLAM. We approach the problem with 3D data from a trinocular vision system. Past experience shows that problems arise as a consequence of inaccurate modeling of uncertainties; interestingly enough, we found that accuracy in modeling the robot pose uncertainty is much less relevant than for the uncertainty on the sensed data. To overcome the severe limitation of linear and Gaussian approximations, we applied a particle-based description of the inherently non-normal probability density distribution of the sensed data; the aim is to increase the success rate of data association, which we see as the most important problem. The increase in correct data associations reduces the uncertainty in the model and, consequently, in the robot pose, respectively estimated with a hierarchical map decomposition and a six degree of freedom extended Kalman filter. In this paper, we present approaches for particle-based sensor modeling and data association, with a comparative experimental evaluation on real 3D vision data.",

The resulting passive communication scheme is used in an extended teleoperation framework, in which the human operator can define geometrical motion restrictions in order to increase his awareness and his feeling of immersion, hence improving his ability to perform complex tasks. The framework also provides the operator with video feedback and 3D rendering of the remote scene.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for producing virtual fixture based on simulated plasticity, which can be used for assisting precise manual manipulations performed by human users through haptic interfaces. The fixture acts as a guide to help path-tracing tasks and as a wall for preventing a tool from entering a specified region, but the user can move against the fixture by intentionally producing a force larger than a predetermined yield force. The advantage of the proposed virtual fixture is that it is always passive and it acts as a hard fixture when the user's force is smaller than the yield force. The algorithm was demonstrated through experiments using an impedance-type haptic interface.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a path planning and its evaluation method is described with taking into account wheel slip dynamics of lunar/planetary exploration rovers. The surface of the planetary body is largely covered with powdery soil. On such loose soil, the wheel slippage which will make the rover get stuck must be concerned. Since the slippage dynamically depends on the posture/velocity of vehicle, soil characteristics, and wheel-soil interactions, it becomes difficult issues to incorporate the wheel slip dynamics as a criterion into path-planning algorithms. To tackle the slippage problem, the authors develop the path-planning algorithm and the path-evaluation method based on the following approach. First, a path on a rough terrain is generated with the terrain-based criteria function. Subsequently, the dynamics simulation of a rover is carried out in which the rover is controlled to follow the candidate path. Finally, the path is properly evaluated based on the slip motion profiles calculated by the simulation. Demonstrations for the proposed technique are addressed along with a discussion on characteristics of the candidate path and the slip motion profile of the rover",

In this method, a membranous PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) structure of desired 3-dimensional blood vessel shape was fabricated based on CT data. And the PVA structure was dip coated with polymer solution made by dissolving the Caprolactone (3wt%) and NaCl particle (27wt%) into chloroform (organic solvent), Finally, the NaCl particle and the membranous PVA structure were both eluted from the structure by dissolving these materials under water, and finally a patient-specific blood vessel scaffold with desired 3D vascular shape was constructed. Presented scaffold has the mechanical compliance similar to human blood vessel and provides porous polymer structure appropriate for cell cultivation.",

The proposed controller allows interaction between both users, the trainee and the trainer, as well as between the users and the virtual slave robot and environment. It also allows for the adjustment of the dominance of the trainer over the trainee in interaction with the virtual slave and environment through a dominance factor parameter. The issue of transparency in such collaborative haptic simulation system has been discussed. A performance index has also been defined to quantify the users' skill for a specific task under study. This metric is used to identify the maximum allowable dominance of the trainee over the trainer. Haptic simulation experiments have been carried out with two planar twin pantograph haptic devices and a simulated pantograph as the slave robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a force feedback control scheme for the compensation of periodic motions of organs induced by respiration or heartbeat in minimally invasive robotized surgery. It applies surgical tasks involving a contact between an instrument and a moving organ. It is well known that conventional force control allows for compensating the motion of the environment thanks to its natural disturbance rejection capabilities. However, as experimentally evidenced in the first part of this paper, bandwidth limitations do not allow for exact disturbance rejection. Therefore, in addition to a conventional inner force feedback control loop, an outer control loop based on iterative learning control (ILC) is implemented. It is aimed at compensating the physiological motions, based on the hypothesis that the disturbance is periodic. The transient performances of this ILC controller are improved thanks to a wavelet transform-based approach and conclusive experiments are finally presented, evidencing that the tracking performance under cyclic disturbances is significantly improved.",

Stable electrostatic levitation can be realized by controlling an electrostatic force on the basis of measured suspension air gaps. Two control approaches, namely centralized and de-centralized control and the influence of an integrator in the controller, are discussed with regard to the specific tasks of Pick Up and Place. The final goal is to realize a handling tool that allows human operators to perform these object handling tasks. In this paper a linear motor is used to perform the Pick Up and Place task to allow a controllable and reproducible motion. The experimental results show a stable Pick Up and Place motion, where placing is realized without any external control commands.",

In this paper, a walking pattern generator for humanoid robots based on piecewise linear functions and inspired by passive walking is considered. To deal with lateral and frontal disturbances, sensory feedback is realized based on the inverse pendulum model. The reflex system that highly adapts and controls the movement of the humanoid robot, when a large disturbance occurs, is combined with the motion pattern generator and proposed in a unified form with regards to three types of sudden events. Experiments using Fujitsu's humanoid robot HOAP-3 demonstrate that a reflex movement is successfully integrated with the rhythmic motion when there are sudden changes in floor level, when obstacles suddenly appear, and in the presence of a large disturbance. The proposed reflex system therefore contributes toward the safe interaction of humanoid robots with the environment.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to arbitrarily modify the load force of any selected muscle by using an exoskeleton, thus enabling \"pinpointed\" motion support, rehabilitation, and training. An advanced dynamic model, called a musculoskeletal-exoskeletal integrated human model, is developed. The driving-forces of the pneumatic actuators are designated by a muscle force control algorithm using the integrated model. A prototype power-assisting system is developed using pneumatic rubber actuators. The feasibility of the muscle force control is analyzed from a view point of nonlinear programming. The validity of the method is confirmed by measuring surface electromyographic signals of related muscles.",

        "abstract": "We consider an ecology of robots in which robots can help each other by offering information-producing functionalities. A functional configuration of this ecology is a way to allocate and connect functionalities among the participating robots. In general, different configurations can be used to solve the same task, depending on the current situation, and some tasks require sequences of different configurations to be solved. In this paper, we propose a plan-based approach to automatically generate a preferred configuration for a given task, environment, and set of resources. We also describe how our configuration planner can be integrated with an action planner to deal with tasks that require sequences of configurations. We illustrate these ideas on a specific instance of an ecology of robots, called a PEIS Ecology. We also show an experiment run on our PEIS Ecology testbed, in which a sequence of configurations for an olfactory task is automatically generated and executed.",

Statistical techniques, like particle filters, provide a framework for expressing the uncertainty and partial observability of the real world and taking actions to reduce them. We explore a classic manipulation problem of planar batting, but with a new twist of shape, pose and impact uncertainty. We demonstrate a technique for characterizing and reducing this uncertainty using a particle filter coupled with a lookahead planner that maximizes information gain. We show that a two-step planner that first acts for information gain and then acts to maximize the expectation of achieving a desired goal is effective at managing shape, pose and impact uncertainty",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Motion planning for closed-chain systems is particularly difficult due to additional closure constraints placed on the system. In fact, the probability of randomly selecting a set of joint angles that satisfy the closure constraints is zero. We propose planning with reachable distance (PRD) to overcome this challenge by first precomputing the subspace satisfying the closure constraints, then directly sampling in it. To do so, we represent the chain as a hierarchy of sub-chains. Then we calculate the \"closure\" sub-space as appropriate reachable distance ranges of sub-chains satisfying the closure constraints. This provides two distinct advantages over traditional approaches: (1) configurations are quickly sampled and converted to joint angles using basic trigonometry functions instead of more expensive inverse kinematics solvers, and (2) configurations are guaranteed to be closed. In this paper, we describe this hierarchical chain representation and give a sampling algorithm with complexity linear in the number of links. We provide the necessary motion planning primitives for most sampling-based motion planners. Our experimental results show our method is fast, making sampling closed configurations comparable to sampling open chain configurations that ignore closure constraints. Our method is general, easy to implement, and also extends to other distance-related constraints besides the ones demonstrated here",

The approach uses a path planner that calculates optimal paths while considering uncertainty in position and that uses landmarks to localize the vehicle as part of the planning process. The landmarks are simple, possibly aliased, features that have been previously identified in a high-resolution map. These landmarks are combined with an estimate of the position of the vehicle to create unique and robust features. This approach reduces or eliminates the need for GPS and enables the use of prior maps with imperfect map registration.",

Robotic analogues of this type of locomotion are being studied, both in simulation, and via experiments with biomimetic robotic prototypes, which combine undulatory movements of their multi-link body with appropriately coordinated parapodial link oscillations. Extensive experimental studies of locomotion on sand demonstrate the potential of the pedundulatory robotic prototypes, especially their rich gait repertoire and their enhanced performance compared to robotic prototypes relying only on body undulations",

The actuation principle for the microgripper is an SMA wire. The advantages of the fabrication process are low cost and manufacture cycle time. This paper details the technique for fabrication of the microgripper to produce prototypes. These prototypes were then tested and characterised in terms of force output, hysteresis and repeatability. A further miniaturised unsensorised microgripper based on the same actuation principle and fabrication process (but less than half the size) was fabricated to demonstrate the possibility of further downscaling.",

This type of artificial muscle has a greater contraction ratio and power and a longer lifetime than conventional McKibben types. However, these muscles are highly non-linear; hence, it is difficult to use them in a mechanical system. Furthermore, this actuator has a high compliance characteristic. Though this characteristic is useful for human interactions, the position and force of this actuator cannot be easily controlled. In this paper, a mathematical model of this type of artificial muscle is proposed, and the relationship between design parameters and control specifications is realized. In addition, the position and force based on the mathematical model are determined and applied to artificial muscle linearization.",

Our methods consider directly the quadratic force cone without pyramidal linearization of a cone. The conditions can be computed in a constant time and they are used as a heuristic for 3D force closure test. We also show that our proposed heuristic greatly improve the performance of existing grasp testing algorithms.",

The human arm naturally takes a posture with no wandering although it has some redundant DOF. The authors consider that the posture will be determined task-oriented, which means that human unconsciously takes posture of his/her upper extremities, which is suitable for the task that the endpoint about to do. This study also assumes that all or some joints are capable to adjust the joint stiffness so that the stiffness of the endpoint in the task space is also adjustable. Hence our study aims to establish the way to make the manipulator take a posture that provides a stiffness of the endpoint suitable for the task. The new control formula for shaping the manipulator's posture to provide a desired stiffness of the endpoint is presented followed by the simulation study to verify it.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In many robotic domains, efficiency is an important component of task execution. One way to improve task efficiency is to lessen the overhead of beginning a task by making sure the necessary agents are near the task site when execution begins, minimizing travel time delays - in other words, pre-positioning agents for their future tasks. In static, certain domains, this can easily be done in advance and incorporated into the initial plan. In dynamic domains such as search and rescue, however, there is not enough certainty about task execution to plan for this ahead of time. To address this, we present here a planner that adds pre-positioning to a plan during execution. The planner strategically positions groups of idle robots whose future task assignments are uncertain in order to minimize travel time by the group as a whole once its members are allocated tasks. Because this planner must run in real time, we present five versions of the planning algorithm, addressing the trade-off of computation time and solution quality that results. We then show that by adding in this type of planning, the overhead of beginning a task can be reduced by up to 90%.",

The developed adaptive joint torque controller uses additional sensing including the joint and motor positions and the joint torque, and adaptively compensates the large friction associated with harmonic drives, while incorporating the dynamics of flexspline. With guaranteed L2/Linfin stability and asymptotic stability, the adaptive joint torque controller allows any motion controller to be employed. Experimental results using the developed adaptive joint torque controller incorporating a motion controller based on the virtual decomposition control demonstrate precision trajectory tracking control of a 7-DOF robot at both moderate and ultra-low speeds. The precision control with encoder-resolution accuracy at an ultra-low joint speed of 0.001 (rad/s) characterizes the effectiveness of the friction compensation.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of dynamic features is an important task for determining the manipulation strategies of an object. This paper presents a technique for predicting dynamics of objects relative to the robot's motion from visual images. During the learning phase, the authors use recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB) to self-organize the dynamics of objects manipulated by the robot into the PB space. The acquired PB values, static images of objects, and robot motor values are input into a hierarchical neural network to link the static images to dynamic features (PB values). The neural network extracts prominent features that induce each object dynamics. For prediction of the motion sequence of an unknown object, the static image of the object and robot motor value are input into the neural network to calculate the PB values. By inputting the PB values into the closed loop RNNPB, the predicted movements of the object relative to the robot motion are calculated sequentially. Experiments were conducted with the humanoid robot Robovie-IIs pushing objects at different heights. Reducted grayscale images and shoulder pitch angles were input into the neural network to predict the dynamics of target objects. The results of the experiment proved that the technique is efficient for predicting the dynamics of the objects.",

By learning a generative model of appearance, we can compute not only the similarity of two observations, but also the probability that they originate from the same location, and hence compute a pdf over observer location. We do not limit ourselves to the kidnapped robot problem (localizing in a known map), but admit the possibility that observations may come from previously unvisited places. The principled probabilistic approach we develop allows us to explicitly account for the perceptual aliasing in the environment - identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. Our algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.",

However there are many benefits to utilizing contact along the entire length of robot body and links especially for human-like robots. Existing control strategies for link contact require knowledge of the contact point. In an uncertain environment, locating link contact point is difficult for most robots as they do not possess skin capable of sensing. We propose a probabilistic approach to link contact estimation based on geometric considerations and compliant motions. Since for many robots, link geometry is also uncertain, we broaden our approach to simultaneously estimate link shape and environment contact. Our experimental results demonstrate that efficiency of control is significantly improved by link contact estimation",

We examine the problem of multiple robotic pursuers attempting to locate a non-adversarial mobile evader in an indoor environment. Unlike many other approaches to this problem, our method seeks to minimize expected time of capture rather than guaranteeing capture. This allows us to examine the performance of our algorithm in complex and cluttered environments where guaranteed capture is difficult or impossible with limited pursuers. We present a probabilistic formulation of the problem, discretize the environment, and define cost heuristics for use in planning. We then propose a scalable algorithm using an entropy cost heuristic that searches possible movement paths to determine coordination strategies for the robotic pursuers. We present simulated results describing the performance of our algorithm against state of the art alternatives in a complex office environment. Our algorithm successfully reduces capture time with limited pursuers in an environment beyond the scope of many other approaches.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The current research analyses and demonstrates how spoken language can be used by human users to communicate with the HRP-2 humanoid to program the robot's behavior in a cooperative task. The task involves the humans and the HRP-2 working together to assemble a piece of furniture. The objectives of the system are to 1. Allow the human to impart knowledge of how to accomplish a cooperative task to the robot, i.e. to program the robot, in the form of a sensory-motor action plan. 2. To do this in a semi-natural and real-time manner using spoken language. In this framework, a system for Spoken Language Programming (SLP) is presented, and experimental results are presented from this prototype system. In Experiment 1, the human programs the robot to assist in assembling a small table. In Experiment 2, the generalization of the system is demonstrated as the user programs the robot to assist in taking the table apart. The SLP is evaluated in terms of the changes in efficiency as revealed by task completion time and number of command operations required to accomplish the tasks with and without SLP. Lessons learned are discussed, along with plans for improving the system, including developing a richer base of robot action and perception predicates that will allow the use of richer language.",

Like recent approaches our method damps only the joints' variation component heading towards the limits. In addition we propose to dynamically express the corrective joint variation as a highest priority constraint that naturally extends the management of inequality constraints. This process is iterative within linear computing cost of the number of independent joints. We present how our approach is exploited for the major classes of rotation joints from one and up to three degrees of freedom. A comparison with other joint limit avoidance methods is given. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on various experiments targeting on the control of virtual mannequins.",

In this case, differently from common devices, our landmark does not make use of neither light, wave reflection, or radio frequencies, but it makes use of temperature properties of a peltier device which is able to increase or decrease its temperature. By having different characteristics from its surroundings, in this case a temperature landmark can be robustly found and tracked in complex indoor environments using thermo infrared cameras. The proposed system composition and configuration, landmark finding, extraction and tracking methods are also explained and effectiveness of this system is described and evaluated.",

In contrast to other proprioceptive pose estimation techniques, this method allows for global localization (i.e., localization with large initial uncertainty) without the use of exteroceptive sensors. This is made possible by establishing a measurement model based on the feasibility of putative poses on known terrain given observed joint angles and attitude measurements. Results are shown that demonstrate that the method performs better than dead-reckoning, and is also able to perform global localization from large initial uncertainty",

It combines responsive and accurate tracking during normal operation with smooth, slow recovery from large position errors that can sometimes occur after abnormal events. The method can be seen as an extension to both conventional PID control and sliding mode control. In this paper, Proxy-Based Sliding Mode Control is used to control a 2-DOF planar manipulator actuated by Pleated Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PPAMs). The principal advantage of this control method is increased safety for people interacting with the manipulator. Two different forms of Proxy-Based Sliding Mode Control were implemented on the system, and their performance was experimentally evaluated. Both forms performed very well with respect to safety. Good tracking was also obtained, especially with the second form.",

We are trying to clarify the effects of reproducing head movement. In this paper, we evaluated the sense of incongruity induced by the delay time in reproducing head movement. The results indicate that head movement control should have a dead time shorter than 27 ms. In addition, this dead time does not depend on a head shape of an acoustical telepresence robot in terms of guidelines for building an acoustical telepresence robot. The results also suggest that the cue for the discrimination of delay is not the delay time itself. They suggest that subjects might discriminate the difference between the perception of auditory sound localization and somatosensory perception of their head posture.",

This problem can generally be decomposed into task assignment and multi-robot path planning. In this paper, we address both problems jointly. This is possible because we reduce significantly the size of the search space by utilizing RFID tags as coordination points. The exploration approach consists of two parts: a stand-alone distributed local search and a global monitoring process which can be used to restart the local search in more convenient locations. Our results show that the local exploration works for large robot teams, particularly if there are limited computational resources. Experiments with the global approach showed that the number of conflicts can be reduced, and that the global coordination mechanism increases significantly the explored area.",

        "abstract": "A general method for mapping dynamic environments using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is presented. The algorithm rigorously addresses both data association and target tracking in a single unified estimator. The algorithm relies on a Bayesian factorization to separate the posterior into: 1) a data association problem solved via particle filter; and 2) a tracking problem with known data associations solved by Kalman filters developed specifically for the ground robot environment. The algorithm is demonstrated in simulation and validated in the real world with laser range data, showing its practical applicability in simultaneously resolving data association ambiguities and tracking moving objects.",

By utilizing rapid prototyping technology, compliant mechanisms, and commodity-grade actuators and sensors, we significantly reduce the complexity and cost of the previous Orthotweezers system without sacrificing functionality. With a force resolution of 0.7mN and a worst case mean positioning repeatability of 23 mum, the system is capable of dexterously manipulating rectangular parts with dimensions 200 mum times 200 mum times 100 mum. Such blocks can then be temporarily attached to thin, delicate, or oddly shaped parts to enable handling and ultimately assembly of micromechanical structures. Strategies for using compliance to compensate for uncertainty introduced by less expensive fabrication methods, actuators, and sensors are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "A number of conceptually simple but behavior-rich \"inverted pendulum\" humanoid models have greatly enhanced the understanding and analytical insight of humanoid dynamics. However, these models do not incorporate the robot's angular momentum properties, a critical component of its dynamics. We introduce the reaction mass pendulum (RMP) model, a 3D generalization of the better-known reaction wheel pendulum. The RMP model augments the existing models by compactly capturing the robot's centroidal momenta through its composite rigid body (CRB) inertia. This model provides additional analytical insights into legged robot dynamics, especially for motions involving dominant rotation, and leads to a simpler class of control laws. In this paper we show how a humanoid robot of general geometry and dynamics can be mapped into its equivalent RMP model. A movement is subsequently mapped to the time evolution of the RMP. We also show how an \"inertia shaping\" control law can be designed based on the RMP.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive tracking (NMPT) controller for mobile robots is presented. The basic idea is to use a motion model for the vehicle and compute in real-time an optimal M-step-ahead control sequence, which minimizes the total M+l step tracking error of the projected motion. In the presence of obstacles, the controller deviates from the reference trajectory by incorporating into the optimization obstacle-distance information from range sensors (e.g., laser scanner, ultrasound). Numerous simulations were performed and the NMPT consistently converged to the desired trajectories and followed them accurately, despite large initial errors and discontinuities in the desired velocities and orientations. The controller's performance depended strongly on parameters such as the optimization horizon M, and the cost-weights assigned to the various tracking errors. The optimization horizon regulates a trade-off between timely obstacle avoidance and tracking quality (large M) vs. consistently fast convergence (small M). The cost-weights affect tracking quality and also the shape of the path, by regulating trade-offs among position, orientation, and velocity errors. Overall, NMPT seems to offer a promising approach for advanced precision guidance applications, and deserves further investigation.",

We achieve this using an insect-inspired hemispherical fish-eye sensor with 190 degree FOV, and a de-rotated optical flow field. The de-rotation algorithm applied is based on the theoretical work of Nelson and Aloimonos (1988). From this we obtain the translational component of motion, and construct full relative depth maps on the sphere. We examine the robustness of this strategy in both simulation and real-world experiments, for a variety of environmental scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstrated implementation of the Nelson and Aloimonos algorithm working in real-time, over real image sequences. In addition, we apply this algorithm to the real-time recovery of full relative depth maps. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for closed-loop control of a robot.",

        "abstract": "A new paradigm is introduced for solving the forward kinematics of general Stewart platforms in real-time. It consists of an off-line preprocessing phase and an online realtime evaluation phase. In the preprocessing phase, the platform leg (link) space is decomposed into cells, and a large set of data is generated for the platform position/orientation (pose), and their corresponding link lengths are computed using the known inverse kinematics. Due to the existence of multiple solutions (poses) for a particular link vector, a data classification technique is employed to identify various solutions. The classified data are used to find the parameters of a simple model that represents the forward kinematics within a cell. These parameters are stored in a lookup table. During the online phase, given the link lengths, the appropriate cell is identified, the model parameters are retrieved from the lookup table and the poses are computed. The proposed method is tested on a Stewart platform, and the accuracy and online times are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for real-time applications.",

The high update rate permits the use of tracked instrument and target locations for controlling a robot. Validation of the system was done in a water tank, where the robot moved the instrument to the target site with a mean error of 1.2 mm",

It presents a distributed, real-time algorithm to plan motion trajectory for each team member that allows dynamic and spontaneous division of work among team members to meet the common task objective. A mobile manipulator has to perform its share of the task while avoiding other moving mobile manipulators in the team in addition to other obstacles in the environment. To each robot team member, none of the trajectories of the other team members or moving obstacles are known beforehand. The approach is implemented and tested in simulated task environments, which demonstrates its high effectiveness and efficiency.",

Currently, ones try to find as reliable as possible matching techniques with a very little constraint of computational time. In this paper, we are interested in applying image matching technique into robotic problems such as visual servoing in which the computational time is a critical element. We propose in this paper a real time keypoint based matching method. The novelties of this method include a fast corner detector, a compact corner descriptor based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and an efficient matching with help of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) technique. We show that the method gives a very satisfying result on accuracy as well as the computational time. The matching algorithm is applied to control a robot in a visual servoing application. It works at 10-14Hz and is well robust to variations in 3D viewpoint and illumination.",

This makes it difficult to add new simulation functions such as new sensors on a simulator by its users. In the new method, the users of the environment can add new modules easily. The simulation function of this system is evaluated by showing new robot motion simulations like brooming, seesaw and so on.

        "abstract": "To date, several successful structured light vision systems for accurate 3D measurement in machine vision have been set up. However, these are usually limited to scanning stationary objects or static environments since tens of images have to be captured for recovering one 3D scene, which results in the industry largely avoiding this technology. This paper presents a method of grid-pattern design based on the principles of uniquely color-encoded structured light, to improve the reconstruction efficiency for real-time processing. For a live scene, the 3D measurement is desired to only capture a single image. To realize this, an important problem for the color-encoded projection is the unique indexing of the color codes in the image. It is essential that each light grid be uniquely identified by incorporating the local neighborhoods in the pattern so that 3D reconstruction can be performed with only local analysis of a single image. This paper describes such a method in the design of the special grid patterns and its corresponding 3D reconstruction method for fast vision perception.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes realtime and robust tracking of a planar motion target by matched filter implemented on the CMOS+FPGA vision system. It is required to obtain positional and angular signals around 1,000 Hz to control a mechanical system. A vision sensor must obtain visual features of a target object, synchronizing its sampling rate to the sampling rate of the control. The CMOS+FPGA vision system has been proposed to realize 1,000 Hz visual feedback. Matched filter can compute the position of a target robustly against occlusion, change of illumination, and background texture but requires much computation time since it includes 2D Fourier transform of images. Thus, matched filter algorithm is implemented on the system so that the matched filter can be performed in realtime. First we briefly introduce the CMOS+FPGA vision system. Second, we summarize the algorithm of matched filter to describe the design of the circuit performing matched filter on an FPGA. Finally, we show the experimental results of planar motion tracking by matched filter implemented on the system.",

Camera and laser information are fused to recognise and create appearance models for landmarks. The representation is obtained through a non-linear probabilistic regression model encoding a neighbourhood preserving dimensionality reduction. A new data association algorithm is proposed where landmarks are associated based on both position and appearance. The resulting system is more robust and able to recover from possible misassociations.

        "abstract": "Accuracy is essential to surface quality control when a range sensor is applied to measure the 3D shape of an automotive body part. A sensor's viewing pose, including location and orientation, is related to measurement accuracy. It is usually difficult to find an optimal solution by manual control of sensor viewpoints. A CAD-guided robot view planner developed previously can automatically generate viewpoints. Measurement accuracy can be satisfied in a certain range. However, the unpredictable image noises, especially in regions with low intensity contrast, cannot be compensated by the CAD-guided robot view planner. In another aspect, measurement accuracy is evaluated all over the part surface. The local accuracy of a small patch may exceed the measurement tolerance. In this paper, feedback design is applied to the CAD-guided robot sensor planning system. The feedback controller can evaluate the accuracy of obtained point clouds, identify problem regions, and generate new viewpoints. This process is recursively executed until the measurement accuracy reaches to a tolerant value. This feedback-based inspection system had been implemented in previous work to fill holes of a point cloud, which are caused by shadows and light reflections. In this paper, the feedback controller is specifically designed to improve the measurement accuracy. Experimental results show the success of applying this feedback system for dimensional inspection of an automotive body part.",

        "abstract": "Complex robots that interact naturally with humans require the integration, coordination and maintenance of many diverse software components and algorithms. An architecture that incorporates explicit knowledge about the relationships among these components and the overall system state can be used for introspection and consequently to reason about the best configurations of the computing environment under changing conditions; potential uses include maintaining the system's integrity, promoting its health, and providing the ability to dynamically reconfigure system components (e.g., after component failure). In this paper, we describe a rudimentary reasoning system, part of our distributed integrated affect reflection cognition (DIARC) architecture for human-robot interaction, that can autonomously perform failure detection, failure recovery, and system reconfiguration of distributed architectural components to ensure sustained operation and interactions. We demonstrate the functionality and utility of the proposed mechanisms on a robot, where architectural components are forcefully removed by hand and automatically recovered by the system while the robot is continuing its interactions with humans as part of a joint human-robot task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "While operational space control is of essential importance for robotics and well-understood from an analytical point of view, it can be prohibitively hard to achieve accurate control in face of modeling errors, which are inevitable in complex robots, e.g., humanoid robots. In such cases, learning control methods can offer an interesting alternative to analytical control algorithms. However, the resulting supervised learning problem is ill-defined as it requires to learn an inverse mapping of a usually redundant system, which is well known to suffer from the property of non-convexity of the solution space, i.e., the learning system could generate motor commands that try to steer the robot into physically impossible configurations. The important insight that many operational space control algorithms can be reformulated as optimal control problems, however, allows addressing this inverse learning problem in the framework of reinforcement learning. However, few of the known optimization or reinforcement learning algorithms can be used in online learning control for robots, as they are either prohibitively slow, do not scale to interesting domains of complex robots, or require trying out policies generated by random search, which are infeasible for a physical system. Using a generalization of the EM-based reinforcement learning framework suggested by Dayan and Hinton, we reduce the problem of learning with immediate rewards to a reward-weighted regression problem with an adaptive, integrated reward transformation for faster convergence. The resulting algorithm is efficient, learns smoothly without dangerous jumps in solution space, and works well in applications of complex high degree-of-freedom robots.",

We present a teleoperated system that removes the entire motion control structure from the robot, in order to preserve the availability of crucial onboard resources. The operation of state feedback control is performed by a system remote from the robot. We have designed a computerized motion planning and control system for Mobile Emulab, and in this article, discuss the implementation of trajectory tracking control. A component of the Emulab network testbed, Mobile Emulab is used for wireless network experiments requiring mobility; and is publicly available to remote researchers via the Internet. Medium scale wheeled mobile robot couriers are used to move wireless antennas within a semi-controlled environment. Experimenters use a web-based GUI to specify desired paths and configurations for multiple robots. State feedback is provided by an overhead camera based visual localization system. Kinematic control is used to generate velocity commands, which are sent to robots over a computer network. Data availability is restricted to a low sampling frequency. There is significant noise, loss, and phase lag present in the robot localization data, which our research overcomes to provide an autonomous trajectory tracking mobile robot control system.",

In our study, we replaced one of the humans with a robot programmed to perform one of the typical human specialized roles. We expected the remaining human to adopt the complementary specialized role. Subjects did believe that they were interacting with another human but did not adopt a specialized behavior as subjects would when physically working with another human; our negative result suggests a very subtle negotiation takes place in human-human physical interaction.",

Based on a structured representation of the model uncertainty, this paper presents a derivation of the robust control law where these limitations are removed.

        "abstract": "We have developed a new communication robot, Robopal, which is an indoor/outdoor robot for use in human-robot interaction research in the context of daily life. Robopal's intended applications involve leading and/or following a human to a destination. Preliminary experiments have been conducted to study nonverbal cues associated with leading and following behavior, and it has been observed that some behaviors, such as glancing towards the leader or follower, appear to be role-dependent. A system for representing these behaviors with a state transition model is described, based on four kinds of interaction roles: directive, responsive, collaborative, and independent. It is proposed that behavior modeling can be simplified by using this system to represent changes in the roles the robot and human play in an interaction, and by associating appropriate behaviors to each role",

For human - robot communication or robot - robot communication, it is useful to design a communication model based on communication principal that is an entrainment phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we focus on the robot motion synchronization for robot - robot communication. The robots are controlled to be entrained to an orbit attractor that corresponds to a robot motion. By exchanging the state variables of each robot, the robots are controlled to entrain one attractor that is possible for both robots and synchronize each other. The results of this paper represent the communication principal by an entrainment phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics.",

We present a novel ultrasound-based method to generate 3D image data which is well-suited for many interventions, but less costly than equivalent CT data. The method's feasibility is demonstrated for robot-based implant bed milling in the lateral skull base, in a process consisting of infrared navigation registration, manual ultrasound scan path delineation, path smoothing and checking, and robot-based ultrasound scan execution.",

        "abstract": "New technologies and processes enhance the need for direct human-robot-interaction, to fully exploit the potential of robots' accuracy and humans' adaptability. Therefore, the hazardous potential of the involved robot manipulator needs to be minimised. Limits must be set, so that only an acceptable severity of injury for the human will remain in case of an unintended contact between the robot and a human. Current standardisation for industrial robot systems does not sufficiently address the subject of close human-robot-cooperation, thereby restricting the implementation of the newest technology. The aim of the reported research is to demonstrate the possibilities to assess the safety performance of robot systems by robot-dummy impact evaluation. In this paper, methods from the automotive industry are investigated on their transferability to the situation in robotics. Anthropomorphic test devices, so called crash test dummies, that resemble the human's kinematic response in car crashes are analysed during a robot-dummy impact. A simulation setup with the dummy FAT ES-2 representing the operator and an industrial robot is realised within LS-DYNA to conduct impacts of the robot arm against the head and the chest. The resulting Head Injury Index (HIC), the Viscous Criteria (VC) for the chest and the Pubic Symphysis Peak Force (PSPF) for the pelvis are discussed, showing their potential and limitations for the situation in robotics.",

The system is based on a multimodal telemanipulation system using haptic/visual/sound interfaces for observation of microobjects under an optical microscope. Feasible haptically-generated paths based on potentials fields reaction forces and shock absorbers are described for efficient and safe pushing-based or adhesion-based micromanipulation. Then, metaphors with human sensory substitution are proposed in order to improve the perception of data or events. Finally, an experimental investigation carried out by nine trainees proves that the system guides efficiently and safely the operator's gesture. Moreover, user performance on a given task can increase as much as 52% in typical micromanipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Hip joint surgeries are commonplace in our aging society. Robotic hip joint surgery is performed to cut bone precisely and is expected to be performed as minimally invasive treatment. Minimally invasive hip joint surgery needs operating space between muscle tissues and the bone around hip joint. In this paper a prototype of an articulated muscle-retracting robot for minimally invasive RAO (rotational acetabular osteotomy and one of the hip joint surgeries) is described. The muscle-retracting robot's role is to create an operating space between muscles and the surface of the bone for the other robot, whose role is to cut bone. The mechanical structure is very thin to follow a narrow path and tough enough to scrape and retract muscles around a hip joint. The prototype is designed based on the required specification from the previous experiments data. The prototype has 9 DOF, in which 3 DOF arms are capable of controlling the tip position and the force between muscle tissues and the surface of the bone. Evaluation of the prototype was done by using a compliant control as scraping method of muscle tissues from surface of the bone. The capability is revealed as a scraping length on a phantom of 140 mm around human hip joint model and on the living tissues of 27 mm in the crest of the ilium by magnitude of maximum force of 25 N. The scraped living tissues were a narrow part around the hip joint. We shall continue to research it and establish a stable control method to scrape tissues.",

Motivated by the large negative effect of ambient noise sources on robot audition, the long-term goal is to provide awareness of the auditory scene to a robot, so that it may more effectively act to filter out the interference or re-position itself to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we concentrate on the discovery of new sources of sound through the use of mobility and directed investigation. This is performed in a two-step process. In the first step, a mobile robot first explores the surrounding acoustical environment, creating evidence grid representations to localize the most influential sound sources in the auditory scene. Then in the second step, the robot investigates each potential sound source location in the environment so as to improve the localization result, and identify volume and directionality characteristics of the sound source. Once every source has been investigated, a noise map of the entire auditory scene is created for use by the robot in avoiding areas of loud ambient noise when performing an auditory task.",

        "abstract": "We explore the capabilities of a robot designed to locate objects underwater through active movement of an electric field emitter and sensor apparatus. The robot is inspired by the biological phenomenon of active electrolocation, a sensing strategy found in two groups of freshwater fishes known to emit weak electric fields for target localization and communication. We characterize the performance of the robot using several types of automatic electrolocation controllers, objects, and water conditions. We demonstrate successful electrolocation both in the conditions in which it is naturally observed, in low conductivity water, as well as in conditions in which it is not observed, in water of ocean salinity. The belief of the position of the target is maintained via a particle filter and refined with each measurement",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust recognition and segmentation method for daily actions with a novel multi-task sequence labeling algorithm called multi-task conditional random field (MT-CRF). Multi-Task sequence labeling is a task of assigning input sequence to sequence of multi-labels that consist of one or multiple symbols in single frame. Multi-Task sequence labeling is essential for action recognition, since motions can be often classified into multi-labels, e.g. he is folding arms while sitting. The MT-CRFs: extensions of conditional random fields (CRFs), incorporate jointly interaction between action labels as well as Markov property of actions, to improve the performance of the joint accuracy: the accuracy for whole labels at specific time. The MT-CRFs offer several advantages over the generative dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), which are often utilized as multi-task sequence labelers. First, the MT-CRFs allow relaxing the strong assumption of conditional independence of observed motion, which is used in DBNs. Second, the MT-CRFs exploit the power of non-Markovian discriminative classification frameworks instead of generative models in DBNs. With deep insight of the problem Multi-Task sequence labeling, the inference process of the classifier gains more efficiency than the previous Markov random fields that tackle multi-task sequence labeling. The experimental results show that classifiers with MT-CRFs have better performance than cascaded classifiers with a couple of CRFs.",

This methodology is proposed to deal with the control problems of unknown or uncertain system parameters, nonlinearities including the hysteresis effect, and external disturbances in the piezoelectric actuation systems, without any form of feed-forward compensation. In this paper, a special class of positive definite functions is employed to formulate the control methodology such that the closed-loop system stability can be guaranteed. The control formulation as well as the stability analysis is detailed. Furthermore, an experimental investigation is also conducted. Implementation of the control methodology is practical as only a knowledge of the estimated system parameters is required. In the experimental study, a promising tracking ability in following a specified motion trajectory is demonstrated. With the capability of motion tracking under the aforementioned conditions, the robust adaptive control methodology is very attractive in realising high performance control applications in the field of micro/nano manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Based on the methodology of sliding mode, this paper presents a robust controller for a class of under-actuated systems with mismatched uncertainties. Such a system consists of a nominal system and the mismatched uncertainties. The structural characteristic of the nominal system is that it is made up of several subsystems. Based on this characteristic, the hierarchical structure of the sliding mode surfaces is designed for the nominal system as follows. Firstly, the nominal system is divided into several subsystems and the sliding mode surface of every subsystem is defined. Secondly, the sliding mode surface of one subsystem is selected as the first layer sliding mode surface. The first layer sliding mode surface is then to construct the second layer sliding mode surface with the sliding mode surface of another subsystem. This process continues till the sliding mode surfaces of all the subsystems are included. For dealing with the mismatched uncertainties, a lumped sliding mode compensator is designed at the last layer sliding mode surface. The asymptotic stability of every layer sliding mode surface and the sliding mode surface of each subsystem is proven theoretically by Barbalat's lemma. Simulation results show the validity of this robust control method through stabilization control of a double inverted pendulums system with mismatched uncertainties.",

For these flexible manipulators, we propose the robust controller using a recursive design method. The recursive design procedures are constructive and contain two steps. First, a fictitious robust controller for the robot link dynamics is designed as if the link dynamics had an independent control. As the fictitious control, a nonlinear Hinfin control using the energy dissipation is designed in the sense of L2-gain attenuation from the disturbance caused by uncertainties to performance. Second, a real robust control is designed recursively by using a Lyapunov's second method. The designed robust control is applied to a 2 DOF robot manipulator with joint flexibilities.",

For a robust deployment of a RFID network, a systematic solution was proposed in this paper. To simplify the reader deployment problem, instead of the traditional 2D circle-like shape assumption, the ellipse/ellipsoid-like shape was taken to represent the signal range of an RFID antenna in this paper. Further, the performance of RFID was estimated statistically. In addition, a deployment tool was designed for users to obtain a recommended layout. For a given area, solutions of number and placement of RFID readers are computed fast and robustly. To avoid reader collision which may result in low efficiency of a RFID network, two simplified mechanisms were proposed. Finally, the practical implementation and simulations were performed to test the practicability of the deployment tool and further to confirm the robustness and adequacy of the proposed models.",

        "abstract": "For the multi-robot coverage problem deterministic deliberative as well as probabilistic approaches have been proposed. Whereas deterministic approaches usually provide provable completeness and promise good performance under perfect conditions, probabilistic approaches are more robust to sensor and actuator noise, but completion cannot be guaranteed and performance is sub-optimal in terms of time to completion. In reality, however, almost all deterministic algorithms for robot coordination can be considered probabilistic when considering the unpredictability of real world factors. This paper investigates experimentally and analytically how probabilistic and deterministic algorithms can be combined for maintaining the robustness of probabilistic approaches, and explicitly model the reliability of a robotic platform. Using realistic simulation and data from real robot experiments, we study system performance of a swarm-robotic inspection system at different levels of noise (wheel-slip). The prediction error of a purely deterministic model increases when the assumption of perfect sensors and actuators is violated, whereas a combination of probabilistic and deterministic models provides a better match with experimental data.",

        "abstract": "A sequence of images in multiple views rather than a single image from a single view is of great advantage for robust visual recognition and pose estimation of 3D objects in noisy and visually not-so-friendly environments (due to texture, occlusion, illumination, and camera pose). In this paper, we present a particle filter based probabilistic method for recognizing an object and estimating its pose based on a sequence of images, where the probability distribution of object pose in 3D space is represented by particles. The particles are updated by consecutive observations in a sequence of images and are converged to a single pose. The proposed method allows an easy integration of multiple evidences such photometric and geometric features as SIFT, color, 3D line, 2D square, etc. The integration of multiple evidences, including photometric and geometric features, in space and time makes the proposed method robust to various not-so-friendly visual environments. The experimental results with a single stereo camera show the validity of the proposed method in an environment containing both textured and texture-less objects.",

A coordinate transformation architecture which reduces activation signal dimensionality, known as C-segmentation, is presented. A robotic hand with 16 controlled DOF and 32 independent SMA axes was developed to demonstrate the advantages of joule-heated SBC; the total weight of the robotic hand system was less than 800 grams. 16 different grasping postures were successfully recreated by using only 8 C-segments. It was concluded that a very lightweight robotic hand with simple controls can effectively reproduce the necessary configurations for conventional grasping situations.",

In this paper, two algorithms for the distributed solution of the MRTA problem are presented. In our market-based approach, robots consider their local plans when bidding and multiple tasks can be allocated to a single robot during the negotiation process. The second algorithm described in the paper is based on the negotiation of subset of tasks and can be considered as a generalization of the first one, which only negotiates single tasks. Both algorithms have been tested in a multirobot simulator with multiple missions consisting in visiting waypoints with promising results.",

The grouping of visual features improves data association and reduces the number of landmarks against individual visual features. To accomplish this, we propose three techniques: 1) selection of visual features which are invariant to image changes in indoor environment and suitable candidates for the visual plane, 2) extraction of sonar line features with current sensor data, which filters out uncertain outliers efficiently and 3) a scheme on grouping visual features with respect to sonar line features and maintaining database of the extracted visual planes for reliable data association. We integrate above three techniques into one framework and propose a SLAM algorithm for the visual planes. Experimental results in two types of real home environment show that the algorithm can successfully be executed with no human intervention.",

These robots either lacked mobility or was tethered to an external source of power. Using the recent findings on the supporting legs of these robots creating repulsive surface tension based lift forces, a heavier yet highly maneuverable and non-tethered water strider robot, called STRIDE, is proposed in this paper. STRIDE uses two miniature DC motors and a lithium-polymer battery that are connected to the driving circuit on-board. Optimal leg shape is manufactured by bending 0.33 mm diameter stainless steel wires with a Teflon\u00ae coating. This 6.13 gr non-tethered robot with twelve supporting legs demonstrated a linear motion of 8.7 cm/s and a rotational motion of 0.8 rad/s. STRIDE would have potential applications in continuous water quality monitoring on lakes, dams, and other water sources and in entertainment and education in the near future.",

        "abstract": "STriDER (Self-Excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot) is a novel three-legged walking machine that exploits the concept of actuated passive dynamic locomotion to dynamically walk with high energy efficiency and minimal control. Unlike other passive dynamic walking machines, this unique tripedal locomotion robot is inherently stable with its tripod stance, can change directions, and is relatively easy to implement, making it practical to be used for real life applications. STriDER begins its step with a stable stance like a camera tripod. As the center of gravity of the robot shifts forward pass the \"pivot line\" defined by the two feet of the stance legs, the robot begins to fall in the direction perpendicular to the pivot line. The middle leg naturally swings between the two stance legs using the concept of actuated passive dynamic locomotion. The swing leg then catches the fall and the robot resets to its original tripod posture in preparation for its next step. STriDER can easily change its direction of walking, simply by changing the sequence of choice of the swing leg and the stance legs. In this video, we present the concept of this novel walking machine and the mechanical design of the first prototype. The results from the dynamic simulation and a simple experiment for a single step are presented for comparison.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many robotic applications work with visual reference maps, which usually consist of sets of more or less organized images. In these applications, there is a compromise between the density of reference data stored and the capacity to identify later the robot localization, when it is not exactly in the same position as one of the reference views. Here we propose the use of a recently developed feature, SURF, to improve the performance of appearance-based localization methods that perform image retrieval in large data sets. This feature is integrated with a vision-based algorithm that allows both topological and metric localization using omnidirectional images in a hierarchical approach. It uses pyramidal kernels for the topological localization and three-view geometric constraints for the metric one. Experiments with several omnidirectional images sets are shown, including comparisons with other typically used features (radial lines and SIFT). The advantages of this approach are proved, showing the use of SURF as the best compromise between efficiency and accuracy in the results.",

        "abstract": "A safe robot arm can be achieved by either passive or active compliance. The passive compliance systems composed of purely mechanical elements often provide faster and more reliable responses for dynamic collision than the active ones involving sensors and actuators. Since both positioning accuracy and collision safety are important, a robot arm should exhibit very low stiffness when subjected to the collision force greater than the one causing injury to humans, but maintain very high stiffness otherwise. To implement these requirements, a novel safe link mechanism (SLM), which consists of linear springs, a double-slider mechanism and shock absorbing modules, is proposed in this research. The main contribution of SLM lies in its variable stiffness capability implemented only by passive mechanical elements. Various experiments for static and dynamic collision show that the stiffness of SLM is kept very high for the external force less than the critical impact force, but it drops abruptly as the external force exceeds the critical force, thus guaranteeing the collision safety. Furthermore, the critical impact force can be set to any value depending on the applications.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present one approach to achieve safe navigation in indoor dynamic environment. So far, there have been various useful collision avoidance algorithms and path planning schemes. However, those algorithms have a fundamental limitation that the robot can avoid only \"visible\" obstacles. In real environment, it is not possible to detect all the dynamic obstacles around the robot. There exist a lot of \"invisible\" regions due to the limitation of field of view. In order to avoid possible collisions, it is desirable to consider visibility information. Then a robot can reduce the speed or modify a path. This paper proposes a safe navigation scheme to reduce the risk of collision due to unexpected dynamic obstacles. The robot's motion is controlled according to a hybrid control scheme. The possibility of collision is dually reflected to a path planning and a speed control. The proposed scheme clearly indicates the structural procedure how to model and to exploit the risk of navigation. The proposed scheme is experimentally tested in a real office building. The presented result shows that the robot moves along the safe path to obtain sufficient field of view, while appropriate speed control is carried out.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based algorithms have dramatically improved the state of the art in robotic motion planning. However, they make restrictive assumptions that limit their applicability to manipulators operating in uncontrolled and partially unknown environments. This work describes how one of these assumptions - that the world is perfectly known - can be removed. We propose a utility-guided roadmap planner that incorporates uncertainty directly into the planning process. This enables the planner to identify configuration space paths that minimize uncertainty and, when necessary, efficiently pursue further exploration through utility-guided sensing of the workspace. Experimental results indicate that our utility-guided approach results in a robust planner even in the presence of significant error in its perception of the workspace. Furthermore, we show how the planner is able to reduce the amount of required sensing to compute a successful plan",

While shape-forming may require linear amounts of memory, locomotion can be performed with simpler shape specifications, and therefore sublinear algorithms are possible. In this paper, we present a locomotion technique that performs both planning and actuation control in sublinear time and memory. The algorithm is inspired by reinforcement learning and uses dynamic programming to plan module paths in parallel. To ensure the physical integrity of the overall robot during motion, we have developed a novel localized cooperation scheme which may also be used with other self-reconfiguration algorithms. Our overall algorithm is able to direct locomotion over arbitrary obstacles, and the formulation of the goal used in the planning encourages dynamic stability",

We describe a novel method based on spatial relations for accomplishing this task. Our method is based on using the histogram of forces as scene descriptors. We generate a correspondence map between two scene descriptors and evaluate its confidence. From this map, we generate a one-to-one object correspondence map for the two scenes such that the object correspondence confidence value is maximized. Challenges include the fact that the two scenes may differ in terms of the shape and size of the objects, their orientation, and the objects might be shifted due to translation. The approach is evaluated using several hand drawn sketches that were collected as a part of a user study. We believe that the ability to perform scene matching will make our sketch interface more robust and easier to use, thereby providing us with a more intuitive way of communicating with the robots",

In this paper, we extend the decomposition methods in the work of Dwande et al. (2005) for multi-cluster tools with buffer/process modules (BPMs). The computation of the lower-bound cycle time (fundamental period) is presented. Optimality conditions and robot schedules that realize such lower-bound values are then provided using \"pull\" and \"swap\" strategies for single-blade and double-blade robots, respectively. The impact of BPMs on throughput and robot schedules is studied. It is found that such an impact depends on the BPM processing time and the cycle times of the decomposed clusters on both sides of BPMs. A chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tool is used as an example of multi-cluster tools to illustrate the proposed method, analysis, and algorithms. The numerical and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms.",

        "abstract": "One of the most notable and recognizable features of robot motion is the abrupt transitions between actions in action sequences. In contrast, humans and animals perform sequences of actions efficiently, and with seamless transitions between subsequent actions. This smoothness is not a goal in itself, but a side-effect of the evolutionary optimization of other performance measures. In this paper, we argue that such jagged motion is an inevitable consequence of the way human designers and planners reason about abstract actions. We then present subgoal refinement, a procedure that optimizes action sequences. Sub-goal refinement determines action parameters that are not relevant to why the action was selected, and optimizes these parameters with respect to expected execution performance. This performance is computed using action models, which are learned from observed experience. We integrate subgoal refinement in an existing planning system, and demonstrate how requiring optimal performance causes smooth motion in three robotic domains.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A primary motivation for employing quadrupedal robots is that their morphology allows them to traverse difficult terrain. For example, a mountain goat, by carefully choosing its foot placements, is able to scale steep cliff sides. In contrast, wheeled robots have difficulty traveling over non-level terrain, and bipedal robots face stability challenges on rough terrain, even at low velocities. In order for quadrupeds to perform traversals over rough terrain in a stable manner, robust navigation strategies are needed that allow the robots to take full advantage of their physical capabilities. Foot placement and body pose planning is one of the most challenging problems associated with such navigation. We approach this problem as a combinatoric search over candidate foot placements and body poses. The search returns the sequence of kinematically feasible steps with the lowest cost as determined by their deviation from the terrain-independent nominal steps. Due to the large search domain in this problem and the speed required by real time robots, searching for the true optimal solution is computationally intractable. Therefore, we use a limited-horizon best-first search that quickly finds a near-optimal feasible solution. We show, through a series of tests, that this algorithm is sufficient for traversing challenging terrain, with obstacle heights approaching the leg length of the quadruped.",

For such a wearable rehabilitator, identification of joint centre is critical for kinematic modeling, path planning and motion control. However, the shoulder joint centre location is unknown when a user wears this rehabilitator and it differs among users. These complicate the initial patient preparatory. A joint centre self-identification model is formulated based on the differential change in the cable end-point distance. A computationally effective algorithm is employed to identify the shoulder joint centre. It does not require any external measurement devices because of the redundant actuation scheme in the cable-driven shoulder rehabilitator. In order to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm, we conducted computer simulation studies. In the simulation example, although large errors (up to plusmn50mm) had been injected into the initial estimates, the joint centre was always accurately identified within four to five iterations.",

        "abstract": "Numerous applications require a self-contained personal navigation system that works in indoor and outdoor environments, does not require any infrastructure support, and is not susceptible to jamming. Posture tracking with an array of inertial/magnetic sensors attached to individual human limb segments has been successfully demonstrated. The \"sourceless\" nature of this technique makes possible full body posture tracking in an area of unlimited size with no supporting infrastructure. Such sensor modules contain three orthogonally mounted angular rate sensors, three orthogonal linear accelerometers and three orthogonal magnetometers. This paper describes a method for using accelerometer data combined with orientation estimates from the same modules to calculate position during walking and running. The periodic nature of these motions includes short periods of zero foot velocity when the foot is in contact with the ground. This pattern allows for precise drift error correction. Relative position is calculated through double integration of drift corrected accelerometer data. Preliminary experimental results for various types of motion including walking, side stepping, and running document accuracy of distance and position estimates.",

Traditionally, monitoring execution in mobile robotics amounted to looking for discrepancies between the model-based predicted state of executing an action and the real world state as computed from sensing data. We propose to employ semantic knowledge as a source of information to monitor execution. The key idea is to compute implicit expectations, from semantic domain information, that can be observed at run time by the robot to make sure actions are executed correctly. We present the semantic knowledge representation formalism, and how semantic knowledge is used in monitoring. We also describe experiments run in an indoor environment using a real mobile robot.",

In this paper, a service-oriented architectural framework is adopted to provide the infrastructure for the exploitation of service-oriented computing in the development process of factory automation systems. Features required in the development process are implemented as Web-services and published in the public domain, so as to be used on demand by control engineers to construct their projects' specific ESSs. The infrastructure required to build a Web-service based ESS is presented. Specific Web-services are presented and the way that these services affect the development process is discussed. The need of a common field device model in the context of this approach is discussed and an ontology-based framework for such a device model is defined.",

Our approach aims at detecting both physical and logic faults of a robot system with little prior knowledge on the system. We do not need the motion model or a priori knowledge of the possible fault types of the monitored system. Our approach treats the monitored robot system as a black box, with only sensor data available. Thus, we believe the approach is general, and can be used in a wide variety of robot systems performing many different kinds of tasks. Our approach combines data clustering techniques with the generation of a probabilistic state diagram to model the normal operation of the multi-robot system. We have implemented this approach on a physical robot team. This paper presents the results of these experiments, which show that sensor data analyzed from a training phase of normal operation can be used to generate a model of normal robot team operation. This model can then be used to detect many types of abnormal behavior of the system, based purely on monitoring the sensor data of the system.",

The algorithm builds on the probabilistic reasoning using Bayes filters to estimate sensor measurement uncertainty and sensor validity in robot localization. For quantifying measurement uncertainty we score the Bayesian belief probability density using a model selection criterion, and for sensor validity, we evaluate belief on pose estimates from different sensors as a multi-sample clustering problem. The minimization of the combined uncertainty (measurement uncertainly score + sensor validity score) allows us to intelligently choose a subset of sensors that contribute to accurate localization of the mobile robot. We demonstrate the capability of our sensor selection algorithm in automatically switching pose recovery methods and ignoring non-functional sensors for localization on real-world mobile platforms equipped with laser scanners, vision cameras, and other hardware instrumentation for pose estimation.",

        "abstract": "Distributed motion planning of multiple agents raises fundamental and novel problems in control theory and robotics. Recently, one such great challenge has been the development of motion planning algorithms that dynamically assign targets or destinations to multiple homogeneous agents, not relying on any a priori assignment of agents to destinations. In this paper, we address this challenge using two novel ideas. First, we develop distributed multi-destination potential fields able to drive every agent to any available destination for almost all initial conditions. Second, we propose sensor-based coordination protocols that ensure that distinct agents are assigned to distinct destinations. Integration of the overall system results in a distributed, multi-agent, hybrid system for which we show that the mutual exclusion property of the final assignment is guaranteed for almost all initial conditions. Moreover, we show that our dynamic assignment algorithm converges after exploring at most a polynomial number of assignments, dramatically reducing the combinatorial nature of purely discrete assignment problems. Our scalable approach is illustrated with nontrivial computer simulations.",

        "abstract": "Robotic control systems inspired by animals are enticing to the robot designer due to their promises of simplicity, elegance and robustness. While there has been success in applying general and behaviorally-based knowledge of biological systems to control, we are investigating the use of control based on known and hypothesized neural pathways in specific model animals. Neural motor systems in animals are only meaningful in the context of their mechanical body, and the behavior of the system can be highly dependent on nonlinear and dynamic properties of the mechanical part of the system. It is therefore reasonable to believe that to reproduce behavior, the physical characteristics of the biological system must also be modeled or accounted for. In this paper we examine the performance of a robotic system with three types of muscle model: null, piecewise-constant, and linear. Results show that adding very simple models of muscle properties at a single joint cause marked improvement in the performance of a neurally-based step generator for a 3-degree-of-freedom robotic leg.",

        "abstract": "The inherent uncertainty associated with unstructured grasping tasks makes establishing a successful grasp difficult. Traditional approaches to this problem involve hands that are complex, fragile, require elaborate sensor suites, and are difficult to control. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel autonomous grasping system that is both simple and robust. The four-fingered hand is driven by a single actuator, yet can grasp objects spanning a wide range of size, shape, and mass. The hand is constructed using polymer-based Shape Deposition Manufacturing, with joints formed by elastomeric flexures and actuator and sensor components embedded in tough rigid polymers. The hand has superior robustness properties, able to withstand large impacts without damage and capable of grasping objects in the presence of large positioning errors. We present experimental results showing that the hand mounted on a three degree of freedom manipulator arm can reliably grasp 5 cm-scale objects in the presence of positioning error of up to 100% of the object size and 10 cm-scale objects in the presence of positioning error of up to 33% of the object size, while keeping acquisition contact forces low.",

        "abstract": "Several triaxial accelerometers are known. However, to the knowledge of the authors, no true, triaxial accelerometers are commercially available. By true we mean an accelerometer which would pick up the three components of point-accelerations using one single proof-mass. What we propose is novel architecture classes of parallel-kinematics-machine for multi-axial accelerometers, that is, accelerometers that can measure n components of point-accelerations, where n = 1, 2, 3. We call these architectures simplectic, as they use n + 1 legs oriented normally to the n + 1 faces of the regular simplex associated with the n-dimensional subspace of measured acceleration components. We show that the simplectic biaxial accelerometer can be fabricated using micromachining MEMS techniques, while the simplectic triaxial accelerometer lends itself to compliant-mechanism fabrication techniques. CAD models of the prototypes proposed are provided for all of the three novel mechanical architectures proposed. Finally, the direct kinematics problems associated with the simplectic biaxial and triaxial accelerometers are shown to be linear in both cases. This feature simplifies the estimation of the proof-mass displacement from piezoresistive or piezoelectric measurements taken at the flexible joints connecting the legs of the mechanism to the rigid body whose acceleration is under estimation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, two problems related to the simulation of virtual environments for haptic systems are considered. The first problem is how to simulate, in discrete time and with low computational effort, dynamic systems in order to preserve their passivity properties. As a matter of fact, simulation of complex systems in real time may lead to undesired effects, like unstable behaviours of the haptic interface, if proper care is not given to the definition of the simulation algorithm. An algorithm is presented here able to maintain the passivity properties of the physical (simulated) system with a reduced computational complexity. The second problem discussed in this paper is the interconnection of algorithms running at different frequencies, i.e., the control algorithm of the haptic interface (running typically at high frequency) and the algorithm simulating the virtual environment (running at lower frequency). A proper software interface, able to connect these two algorithms in an energetic-consistent manner, is presented and discussed. The general framework of both these techniques is the passivity theory and the so-called port-Hamiltonian formalism.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an algorithm that drives a unicycle type robot to a desired path, including obstacle avoidance capabilities. The path following control design relies on Lyapunov theory, backstepping techniques and deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, it overcomes initial condition constraint present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a \"virtual target\" to be tracked along the path; thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the path target point is simply defined as the closest point on the path. The obstacle avoidance part is using the deformable virtual zone principle, that defines a safety zone around the vehicle, in which the presence of an obstacle induces an \"intrusion of information\" that drives the vehicle reaction. The overall algorithm is combined with a guidance solution that embeds the path following requirements in a desired intrusion information function, that steers the vehicle to the desired path while the DVZ is virtually keeping a minimal contact with the obstacle, implicitly bypassing it. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed.",

These sensors are increasingly used in robotics where accurate calibration is often a prerequisite. Current approaches in the field are either based on theoretical properties and do not take into account important factors such as misalignment or camera-lens distortion or over-parametrised which leads to minimisation problems that are difficult to solve. Recent techniques based on polynomial approximations lead to impractical calibration methods. Our model is based on an exact theoretical projection function to which we add well identified parameters to model real-world errors. This leads to a full methodology from the initialisation of the intrinsic parameters to the general calibration. We also discuss the validity of the approach for fish-eye and spherical models. An implementation of the method is available as OpenSource software on the author's Web page. We validate the approach with the calibration of parabolic, hyperbolic, folded mirror, wide-angle and spherical sensors.",

        "abstract": "Randomly expanding trees are very effective in exploring high-dimensional spaces. Consequently, they are a powerful algorithmic approach to sampling-based single-query motion planning. As the dimensionality of the configuration space increases, however, the performance of tree-based planners that use uniform expansion degrades. To address this challenge, we present a utility-guided algorithm for the online adaptation of the random tree expansion strategy. This algorithm guides expansion towards regions of maximum utility based on local characteristics of state space. To guide exploration, the algorithm adjusts the parameters that control random tree expansion in response to state space information obtained during the planning process. We present experimental results to demonstrate that the resulting single-query planner is computationally more efficient and more robust than previous planners in challenging artificial and real-world environments.",

        "abstract": "A 5-DoF 3R2T (three dimensional rotation and two dimensional translation degrees of freedom) fully-symmetrical parallel manipulator can be adopted in many applications such as simulating the motion of spinal column. However, kinematics of this type parallel manipulator has not been studied enough because of short history. The study of kinematics of the manipulators leads inevitably to the problem of singular configuration. Singularity of a 5-DoF 3R2T fully-symmetrical parallel manipulator, 5-RlowbarRI.ubar;RI.ubar;(RR), is illustrated in this study. According to the singularity classification by Fang and Tsai, both limb singularity and actuation singularity are illustrated by screw theory and Grassmann geometry. The result of this study will be helpful for singularity analysis of 5-DoF 3R2T fully-symmetrical parallel manipulators because of their similar constraint property.",

        "abstract": "Based on its simple structure, base-fixed actuators, high payload capacity, high accuracy, and high mechanical rigidity, the 3-RlowbarRR mechanism is a valuable planar parallel manipulator. However, the 3-RlowbarRR mechanism is known to have singular loci within its workspace affecting its use. In this paper, singularity avoidance of the 3-RlowbarRR mechanism using kinematic redundancy is presented. First, singularity analysis of the proposed 3-RlowbarPlowbarRR mechanism is described and a simple and effective redundancy resolution algorithm based on local optimization suitable for real-time control is developed. Here, the cost function in the optimization is designed to avoid the most problematic singularity configurations, where the end-effector can be locally moved even though all actuated joints are locked. Results from simulation show that the resultant 3-RlowbarPlowbarRR mechanism can be used to avoid singularities associated with the 3-RlowbarRR mechanism, and enlarges the usable workspace.",

What sensing and actuation abilities are needed to complete a given task? Are some robot systems provably \"more powerful\" than others? Can we find meaningful equivalence classes of robot systems? This line of research is inspired by the theory of computation, which has produced similar results for abstract computing machines. The basic idea is a dominance relation over robot systems that formalizes the idea that some robots are stronger than others. We show that this definition is directly related to the robots' ability to complete tasks. Our prior work in this area assumes perfect control and sensing, requires that the robot begin with a single fixed initial condition within a known environment, and models of time as a sequence of variable-length discrete stages, rather than as a continuum. In this paper, we substantially improve upon that earlier work by addressing these problems.",

We construct a global feedback plan (or control policy) by partitioning the environment into convex cells, computing a discrete plan on the resulting cell complex, and generating local control laws on the state space that are safe, consistent with the high level plan, and satisfy smoothness conditions. The trajectories of the resulting global feedback plan are smooth and stabilize the position of the robot in the plane, neglecting the orientation.",

A data-level fusion model, termed three measurements association model (TMAM), has been developed for associating three measurements with a line or a point feature. By use of TMAM, different sets of measurements obtained from a single sonar sensor at consecutive steps are associated with the line and point features. Subsequently, the parameters of the identified features are estimated by use of the iterated least square estimation method. Finally, when a feature is extracted, a simple feature-level fusion strategy is used to update the map. The proposed approach has been tested both in simulation and on real data.",

For each detected motion pattern a local trajectory as well as a con dence level is provided. The method is based on local motion measurements extracted from short video segments. These measurements are mapped in an adequate grouping space where independent trajectories correspond to distinct clusters. The automatic cluster detection is handled in an a contrario framework, which is general and involves no parameter tuning. The method was validated on real video sequences featuring rigid and non-rigid moving objects, static and mobile cameras, and distracting motions. The output of this method could initialize tracking algorithms. Applications of interest are robot navigation, car-driver assistance, surveillance and activity recognition.",

For speeding up point matching methods, the large amount of range data should be reduced. This sampling, in turn, can have a significant impact on accuracy. In particular, genetic algorithms provide a robust optimization method that avoids local minima for scan matching, but their computational cost grows with the number of points. This paper proposes a new point sampling strategy that considers the spherical scanning process of most sensors to equalize the measure-direction density. This fast sampling method reduces the number of points without loss of relevant scene information. It is experimentally compared with other systematic approaches for the case of actual scene genetic registration.",

This condition is independent of the mass of the haptic device. The theoretical results are supported by simulations and experimental data using the DLR light-weight robot.",

We proposed passive dynamic autonomous control (PDAC) previously (2004) as one of point-contact methods. PDAC expresses the robot dynamics as a 1-dimensional autonomous system based on the two concepts: 1) point-contact 2) virtual constraint (proposed by Grizzle et al. (2001) and Westervelt et al. (2004)). We actually realized 3D dynamic walking by means of proposed method, however stability is not proved and the convergence domain is not clear. Thus, this paper finds the convergence domain of the previously proposed controller and proves the stability by the Liapunov theory. Finally, the correctness of stability proof is confirmed by the numerical simulation.",

The proposed feedback controllers rely solely on each robot's range and bearing sensors which allow them to obtain information about positions of neighbors within a given range. This is relevant for applications such as perimeter surveillance or containing hazardous regions where limited bandwidth must be preserved for situational awareness. The computational complexity of the decentralized controller for each agent is linear in the number of neighboring agents, making it scalable to robot swarms.

We separate input and output energy at each port of a bilateral controller, and propose a sufficient condition for satisfying the passivity of the bilateral controller including time-delay. Output energy at the master port should be less than the transmitted input energy from the slave port with time-delay, and output energy at the slave port should be less than the transmitted input energy from the master port with time-delay. For satisfying above two conditions, two passivity controllers are attached at each port of the bilateral controller. Teleoperation experiment with about 120 (msec) of time-delay each way is performed. Stable teleoperation is achieved in free motion and hard contact as well.",

Motivated by applications involving soft tissue manipulation such as robotic surgery, the transparency objective is generalized to include monotonic nonlinear mappings between the master/slave position and force signals. Modified Lyapunov-based adaptive motion/force controllers are presented that can guarantee the convergence of position and force tracking errors in the presence of dynamic uncertainty. Given a priori known bounds on the unknown operator and environment mass-spring-damper parameters, the closed-loop stability is analyzed using an off-axis circle criterion and the Nyquist envelope of interval plant systems. This approach produces far less conservative stability margins than those achievable by the passivity analysis. Experimental results with a two-axis teleoperation setup are provided.",

The paper, in particular, addresses the static and stiffness analyses of this class of manipulators.

Based on the principle of virtual work, the method is applicable to all statically determinate manipulators, i.e., to the manipulators whose joint reactions can be found by resorting to equilibrium equations only. The distinctive feature of the proposed method over the previous ones is the ability to keep the complexity of the kinematic model of the analyzed manipulator to a minimum: no generalized kinematic model is necessary even in case a nominally special-geometry manipulator transforms into a general-geometry manipulator when geometric inaccuracies are taken into account. A numerical example shows application of the proposed method to a case study. Use of the method in kinematic calibration of manipulators is also outlined.",

The input of the system is a sequence of stereo image pairs only, captured by cameras positioned at approximately eye distance. No artificial markers can be used to simplify the estimation problem. Furthermore, the complexity of all algorithms incorporated must be suitable for real-time application, which is maybe the biggest problem when considering the high dimensionality of the search space. Finally, the system must not depend on a static camera setup and has to find the initial configuration automatically. We present a system, which tackles these problems by combining multiple cues within a particle filter framework, allowing the system to recover from wrong estimations in a natural way. We make extensive use of the benefit of having a calibrated stereo setup. To reduce search space implicitly, we use the 3D positions of the hands and the head, computed by a separate hand and head tracker using a linear motion model for each entity to be tracked. With stereo input image sequences at a resolution of 320\u00d7240 pixels, the processing rate of our system is 15 Hz on a 3 GHz CPU. Experimental results documenting the performance of our system are available in form of several videos.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control architecture for artificial muscle materials such as shape memory alloys and polymer actuators. The active material is broken up into many small independent cells that can be regulated in a binary fashion into ON and OFF states, so that the actuator displacement is determined by the number of ON cells. In order to control the number of cells that contract, a novel closed loop feedback control method is employed. Each cell is given a small stochastic finite state machine that governs its transition between ON and OFF states. A central controller globally varies the probabilistic rate with which all of the cells make state transitions. Using this architecture, actuator displacement can be controlled in a stable, robust fashion. Different feedback laws are compared using the fixed policy value iteration algorithm to calculate expected settling time in response to a step reference. A simple law based on calculating expected future behavior is found to be very close to the optimal law computed using the value iteration algorithm. The performance of the control laws is verified on a 50 cell shape memory alloy cellular actuator.",

Despite the extensive research on calculating the volume swept by an object along a trajectory, the efficient algorithms described have imposed constraints on both the trajectories and geometric models. By proposing a general algorithm that handles flat surfaces as well as volumes and disconnected objects, we allow SV calculation without resorting to pre-processing mesh repair. This is of particular interest in the domain of product lifecycle management (PLM), which deals with industrial computer aided design (CAD) models that are malformed more often than not. We incorporate the bounded distance operator used in path planning to efficiently sample the trajectory while controlling the total error. We develop a triangulation scheme that draws on the unique data set created by an advancing front level-set method to tessellate the SV boundary in linear time. We analyze its performance, and demonstrate its effectiveness both theoretically and on real cases taken from PLM.",

The control takes into account the field-of-view constraints of the vision system through the specific design of the paths with optimality criteria. The optimal paths consist of straight lines and curves that saturate the sensor viewing angle. We present the controls that move the robot along these paths based on the convergence of the elements of the homography matrix. Our contribution is the design of the switched homography-based control, following optimal paths guaranteeing the visibility of the target.",

        "abstract": "Network surveillance systems provide extended perception and distributed sensing capability in monitored environments through real time monitoring of the target area and target objects using multiple networked sensors. The development of wireless communication and sensing technology make it possible to deploy networked surveillance systems in various environments. We consider a surveillance network where the sensors are static. The task of tracking targets in a surveillance network is challenging because of the following reasons: (1) the location of the sensors need to be optimally deployed. (2) The view of the sensors need to be optimized so that at a given time the targets are shown with a discernable resolution for feature identification. (3) It is important to devise stable control algorithms for accomplishing the surveillance task. When the target moves, it is important to switch the sensing task between sensors to maintain the visibility of the target with adequate resolution. This paper presents a novel method to deploy static sensors given a target region and a dynamic programming method to optimally switch sensors when the target moves. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for tracking targets over an area.",

Nevertheless, many practical COMRs in use take advantage of the steering link offset different from the wheel radius. This paper presents a systematic isotropy analysis of a fully actuated COMR with variable steering link offset, which can be considered as the generalization of the previous analysis. First, with the characteristic length introduced, the kinematic model of a COMR is obtained based on the orthogonal decomposition of the wheel velocities. Second, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the isotropy of a COMR are examined to categorize three different groups, each of which can be dealt with in a similar way. Third, the isotropy conditions are further explored to identify four different sets of all possible isotropic configurations. Fourth, the expressions of the isotropic characteristic length required for the isotropy of a COMR are obtained.",

        "abstract": "Early detection and removal of small pulmonary nodules significantly improves long term survival rates for patients with lung cancer. To aid in the localization of these tumors during video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), a tactile imaging system (TIS) is presented. The system consists of a capacitive array sensor mounted on a minimally invasive surgical probe that is integrated with the thoracoscopic imaging. A vision-based algorithm localizes the probe in the live video and overlays a registered pseudo-color map of the measured pressure distribution on the streaming images. The surgeon can locate the hard nodules by scanning the tactile sensor head across the surface of the lung and observing the spatial variation in contact pressures caused by the elasticity differences in the underlying tissue. A validation experiment was conducted to compare the system to a current localization technique using a rigid rod. Results indicate that subjects could localize stiff lumps in lung phantoms more quickly and accurately using the TIS.",

        "abstract": "Swedish wheeled mobile robots have remarkable mobility properties allowing them to rotate and translate at the same time. Being holonomic systems, their kinematics model results in the possibility of designing separate and independent position and heading trajectory tracking control laws. Nevertheless, if these control laws should be implemented in the presence of unaccounted actuator peak velocity limits, the resulting saturated linear and angular velocity commands could interfere with each other thus dramatically affecting the overall expected performance. Based on Lyapunov's direct method, a position and heading trajectory tracking control law for Swedish wheeled robots is developed. It explicitly accounts for actuator velocity saturation by using ideas from a prioritized task based control framework.",

It is difficult for the robot to execute tasks automatically in the daily life environment, because it should handle various objects and the working environment is complex. In such an environment, the concept of shared autonomy by which the robot can share a task with a human is important. The task instruction that we propose is as follows: An operator clicks on a target object in a camera image and the system gets the position of the clicked point in the work space from the corresponding range image. Then, the operator selects the task model and attaches the task information to the position and the robot can perform its task safely and reliably using this task information. The features of the task instruction are as follows. An object model is composed of a list of task models which can be applied to the object category. The user recognizes the object type and its situation in the environment, and instructs a robot to execute a task by selecting a task model according to the object type and situation.",

Given a task, the robot selects the most suitable hand preshape and automatically plans a set of actions in order to reach the object and to perform the task, taking continuously into account the task forces. The concept of hand preshape is extended for the inclusion of a task frame, which is a concept from task planning, thus filling the gap between the grasp and the task.",

Yet surprisingly, despite the ease of doing so, many robots store little or no record of their own visual surroundings. This paper explores the utility of keeping the simplest possible persistent record of the environment of a stationary torso robot, in the form of a collection of images captured from various pan-tilt angles around the robot. We demonstrate that this particularly simple process of storing background images can be useful for a variety of tasks, and can relieve the system designer of certain requirements as well. We explore three uses for such a record: auto-calibration, novel object detection with a moving camera, and developing attentional saliency maps.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a method that robots use to explore, navigate, and map an unknown environment. However, this method poses inherent problems with regard to cost and time. To lower computation costs, smoothing and mapping (SAM) approaches have shown some promise, and they also provide more accurate solutions than filtering approaches in realistic scenarios. However, in SAM approaches, updating the linearization is still the most time-consuming step. To mitigate this problem, we propose a submap-based approach, tectonic SAM, in which the original optimization problem is solved by using a divide-and-conquer scheme. Submaps are optimized independently and parameterized relative to a local coordinate frame. During the optimization, the global position of the submap may change dramatically, but the positions of the nodes in the submap relative to the local coordinate frame do not change very much. The key contribution of this paper is to show that the linearization of the submaps can be cached and reused when they are combined into a global map. According to the results of both simulation and real experiments, Tectonic SAM drastically speeds up SAM in very large environments while still maintaining its global accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Needles are commonly used in medical practice as a minimally invasive means to reach subsurface targets for diagnosis or therapy delivery. Recent results indicate that steerable needles may enhance targeting accuracy and allow needles to avoid obstacles along the path to the target. This work considers teleoperation of needles made of a superelastic alloy that steer through tissue using forces generated by the standard asymmetric bevel tip. The needle may be modeled as a nonholonomic system, with inputs of insertion along and spin about the needle axis. A teleoperation system consisting of a commercial master haptic device, a custom needle-steering robot slave, and visual feedback to the operator was assembled. Human subjects experiments were performed to evaluate targeting accuracy in phantom tissue for three needle control methods: teleoperation of both insertion and spin, teleoperation of insertion with open-loop-controlled spin, and open-loop control of both insertion and spin. Targeting accuracy improved with increasing degrees of freedom of human (teleoperation) control, primarily because tissue deformation and modeling limitations result in open-loop control errors. Subjects typically performed multiple spins of the needle during insertion in order to fine tune the needle path. In addition, position, rate, and a nonlinear hybrid control were compared during teleoperation of the insertion degree of freedom. The hybrid method resulted in significantly better targeting accuracy",

A multi-purpose vision platform suited for object recognition, cultural heritage preservation and visual servoing at the same time is missing. In this work, we draw attention to the design principles for such a vision platform. We present its implementation, the 3D-Modeller. In specifying and combining multiple sensors, laser-range scanner, laser-stripe profiler and stereo vision, we derive the required mechanical and electrical hardware design. The concepts for synchronization and communication round off our approach. Precision and frame rate are presented. We illustrate the versatility of the 3D-Modeller by addressing four applications: 3D-modeling, exploration, tracking and object recognition. Due to its low weight and generic mechanical interface, it can be mounted on industrial robots, humanoids, or free-handed as well. The 3D-Modeller is flexibly applicable, not only in research but also in industry, especially in small batch assembly.",

Contemporary applications require a path planner that is fast (to ensure real-time interaction with the environment) and flexible (to avoid local hazards). In addition, paths need to be smooth and short. We propose a new framework, the corridor map method, which meets these requirements.",

        "abstract": "Designing algorithms for multi-robot systems can be a complex and difficult process: the cost of such systems can be very high, collecting experimental data can be time-consuming, and individual robots may malfunction, invalidating experiments. These constraints make it very tempting to work using high-level abstractions of the robots and their environment. While these high-level models can be useful for initial design, it is important to verify techniques in more realistic scenarios that include real-world effects that may have been ignored in the abstractions. In this paper, we take a simple, coordinated, multi-robot search algorithm and illustrate problems that it encounters in environments which incorporate real-world factors, such as probabilistic target detection and positional noise. We compare the performance to that of several simple randomized approaches, which are better able to deal with these constraints.",

It was designed for two purposes; an educational platform and a distributed robotics platform. These two purposes require very different and oftentimes contradictory abilities. As an educational platform, it must be easy to use and program for. It must also be non-intimidating to students who may not have much experience with robotics. As a research platform, it must be powerful enough to run useful behaviors, and expandable with new sensors. These two different purposes have driven the design of the eROSI robot through three generations of development. The first two generations have been tested and evaluated in terms of its two intended purposes. The feedback generated was then used to modify the design of the robot to better accommodate its intended purposes. The eROSI robot is still an ongoing project and aims to create a better platform for both research and education.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of semicircular feet on dynamic bipedal walking. It has been clarified by Asano and Luo (2006) that underactuated virtual passive dynamic walking can be realized by using the rolling effect, which acts as the ankle-joint torque virtually. It has been also shown that, throughout parameter studies, the rolling effect dramatically increases the stable domain of limit cycles. Now that the effect of semicircular feet during stance phase has been discussed, this paper then focuses the effect on mechanical energy dissipation by heel-strike. It is theoretically clarified that, through modeling and analysis of an inelastic collision, increasing walking speed is achieved not by the rolling effect during stance phase but by the effect of reducing mechanical energy dissipation by heel-strike.",

We analyze the general and special cases of the problem, finding it to be at least as hard as the travelling salesman problem. Decomposing the problem into two components: (i) an ordering of robot meetings; and (ii) finding an optimal set of meeting places given an ordering, we present useful solutions to part (ii) only. We propose and compare a discrete algorithm for the restricted meeting location case and two numerical algorithms for the continuous case with weighted Euclidean distance energy cost functions. Anticipating future work, we speculate briefly on suitable ordering heuristics and the need for an integrated method",

Current devices provide stability by locking joints permanently during the unsafe phase of a pathological gait (the stance phase). Though stability is obtained with such orthoses, gait patterns are unnatural and non-cosmetic. Other systems adapt more dynamically during gait, applying different strategies to recover or improve mobility. The system presented consist in a wearable set of sensors, actuators at knee and ankle joints, and a control and monitoring ambulatory unit, all integrated in a custom designed knee-ankle-foot robotic exoskeleton. A base unit allows wireless communication of the ambulatory unit, trough a Bluetooth link, with a PC software platform conceived for on-line and off-line data evaluation. Sensors adapted to the mechanical frame of the orthosis collect kinematics, such as angles at knee and ankle joints, and angular positions and accelerations at lower limb segments; kinetics, such as forces at the orthosis rods and fixation parts, and also foot contact information.",

Future missions will need robotic rovers that can demonstrate a wider range of functionality. This paper proposes an approach to offering this greater functionality by employing science and/or tool packs aboard a highly mobile robotic chassis. The packs are interchangeable and each contains different instruments or tools. The appropriate selection of science and/or tool packs enables the robot to perform a great variety of tasks either alone or in cooperation with other robots. The multi-tasking rover (MTR), thus conceived, provides a novel method for high return on investment.

The method uses a genetic algorithm with respect to the maximization of tranlational/rotational workspaces and isotropy of mechanism to obtain the optimal linkage parameters. It is studied for fifteen cases which are divided by combination of translational and rotational workspaces corresponding to the range of translational motion and tilt angle of the end-effector. To decide the best model in the total optimized cases, compactness of mechanism, translational workspace, rotational workspace on the boundary of translational workspace, and global conditioning index (GCI) as kinematic performances, and then kinematic performances of best model are verified by comparing to those of the preexisting model",

Its location on a spherical shell at the end of the tether is controlled by a pair of ducted fans. The vertical orientation of its body is determined by the point at which the horizontal thrust force acts relative to the centre of gravity (cog). The system acts like a double pendulum with two modes of natural movement. It is modeled with coordinate frames at the ends of the tether and at the cog. Due to the second mode of motion it may oscillate around its centre of gravity while it swings or flies in a circle. From the dynamic model we develop a model for simulating the motion of the tethered robot.",

In this paper, we studied how a mobile robot, equipped with a 3D laser scanner, can learn to perceive the traversability affordance and use it to wander in a room tilled with spheres, cylinders and boxes. The results showed that after learning, the robot can wander around avoiding contact with non-traversable objects (i.e. boxes, upright cylinders, or lying cylinders in certain orientation), but moving over traversable objects (such as spheres, and lying cylinders in a rollable orientation with respect to the robot) rolling them out of its way. We have shown that for each action approximately 1% of the perceptual features were relevant to determine whether it is afforded or not and that these relevant features are positioned in certain regions of the range image. The experiments are conducted both using a physics-based simulator and on a real robot.",

It is shown that, for unforced (passive) reference trajectories, constant time-scaling results in a potential energy-shaping control. Application to walking trajectories of bipedal robots is shown, extending the use of the control beyond purely continuous dynamical systems to a class of hybrid dynamical systems with discontinuities that are linear in velocity. Two biped models are used to demonstrate the control law: for the compass-gait biped, we illustrate time-scaling of a passive reference trajectory; for the biped with a torso, we show time-scaling of a semi-passive reference trajectory.",

On the perception side, various human motion capture systems exist, all of them having in common to calculate a sequence of configuration vectors for the human model in the core of the system. These human models may be 2D or 3D kinematic models, or on a lower level, 2D or 3D positions of markers. However, for appropriate visualization in terms of a 3D animation, and for reproduction on an actual robot, the acquired motion must be mapped to the target 3D kinematic model. On the understanding side, various action and activity recognition systems exist, which assume input of different kinds. However, given human motion capture data in terms of a high-dimensional 3D kinematic model, it is possible to transform the configurations into the appropriate representation which is specific to the recognition module. We will propose a complete architecture, allowing the replacement of any perception, visualization, reproduction module, or target platform. In the core of our architecture, we define a reference 3D kinematic model, which we intend to become a common standard in the robotics community, to allow sharing different software modules and having common benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Coupled operator-multiple vehicle systems are modelled in a unified framework using probabilistic graphs to yield a methodology for analyzing semi-autonomous systems. The framework uses conditional probabilistic dependencies between all elements, leading to a Bayesian network (BN) with probabilistic evaluation capability. Vehicle attitude/navigation states and target/classification states can be evaluated using nonlinear estimators such as the EKF, multiple model filter, information filter, or other approaches. Discrete operator decisions are being modeled as Bayesian network blocks, with conditional dependencies on the vehicle and tracking estimators. Initial decision models use combinations of softmax and discrete probability distributions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present the system design and analysis of a quadruped robot, Rush, that we have constructed to study autonomous and efficient running on flat and rough terrain. The Rush robot is a compact, kneed, four legged machine with only one actuator per compliant leg. We have proposed a novel control strategy for the quadruped robot in consideration of several engineering limitations on sensory feedback. Several simulation studies have already been performed to confirm the validity of the control strategy in our previous reports. Here, the results obtained from experiments with Rush are found to agree with the simulation results. The work reported in this paper may help improve our understanding of energy efficient running locomotion and the simple control required to autonomously stabilize it on flat or rough terrain.",

The system uses nonparametric Bayesian inference to determine an optimal action given a configuration of objects in the world and a desired future configuration.

Besides using standard salient image features to build an on-line map of the camera's environment, this system is capable of identifying and localizing known planar objects in the scene, and incorporating their geometry into the world map. Continued measurement of these mapped objects improves both the accuracy of estimated maps and the robustness of the tracking system. In the context of hand-held or wearable vision, the system's ability to enhance generated maps with known objects increases the map's value to human operators, and also enables meaningful automatic annotation of the user's surroundings. The presented solution lies between the high order enriching of maps such as scene classification, and the efforts to introduce higher geometric primitives such as lines into probabilistic maps.",

The accuracy of the range values produced depends on characteristics of the scene as well as dynamically adjustable operating parameters of the cameras. In order to optimally set these parameters during camera operation we have devised and implemented an optimization algorithm in a modular, extensible architecture for real-time applications including robot control. The approach uses two components: offline nonlinear optimization to minimize the range error for a training set of simple scenes followed by an online, real-time algorithm to reference the training data and set camera parameters. We quantify the effectiveness of our approach and highlight topics of interest for future research.",

First, we construct a visibility graph that supports a minimum turning radius constraint when constructing the graph, so that additional smoothing process is not necessary. Second, we modify the standard A* to consider velocity conditions for rendezvous and collision avoidance with obstacles or other UAVs. Permitting velocity decrease only when it is required that the robot slow down the speed, unnecessary node expansions are avoided. This multi-vehicle problem is solved in a decoupled manner. In order to show the effectiveness of this approach, we present simulation results of rendezvous and independent flight for multiple UAVs.",

        "abstract": "A task-oriented robot-assisted therapy environment to support activities of daily living tasks was developed with the goals of addressing some of the shortcomings of current robotic therapy systems. An important aspect of making these environments work is the implementation of trajectory planning algorithms that support the naturally curving wrist movement seen in real life functional tasks. We explore the challenge of naturally supporting the positioning of the wrist for activities of daily living tasks such as drinking and feeding. In this paper, we examine the minimum jerk model often used to define trajectory planning routines to automatically position the wrist and present the results of fitting these two models to natural wrist movements for a drinking task. Also, we present a case study to examine how an able-bodied experienced the two models as implemented on the ADLER, task-oriented robot-assisted therapy environment.",

        "abstract": "Biological inspiration has a history of advancing the field of robotics. Increasingly, robots are also being used in the modeling of biological systems. In this paper, we use recorded cockroach electromyograms (EMGs) to drive artificial muscle (braided pneumatic actuator) activation and thereby robot joint motion, in an effort to model the transformation from EMG to behavior in the animal. A muscle activation model was developed that transforms EMGs recorded from behaving cockroaches into appropriate commands for the robot. The transform is implemented by multiplying the EMG by an input gain thus generating an input pressure signal, which is used to drive a one-way closed-loop pressure controller. The actuator then can be modeled as a capacitance with input rectification. The actuator exhaust valve is given a leak rate, making the transform a leaky integrator for air pressure, which drives the output force of the actuator. We find parameters of this transform by minimizing the difference between the robot motion produced and that observed in the cockroach. Results from evaluation on reduced-amplitude cockroach angle data strongly suggest that braided pneumatic actuators can be used as part of a physical model of a biological system.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of designing motion-planning and sensor assignment strategies for tracking multiple targets with a mobile sensor network. We focus on triangulation based tracking where two sensors merge their measurements in order to estimate the position of a target. We present an iterative and distributed algorithm for the tracking problem. An iteration starts with an initialization phase where targets are assigned to sensor pairs. Afterwards, assigned sensors relocate to improve their estimates. We refer to the problem of computing new locations for sensors (for given target assignments) as one-step tracking. After observing that one-step tracking is computationally hard, we show how it can be formulated as an energy-minimization problem. This allows us to adapt well-studied distributed algorithms for energy minimization. We present simulations to compare the performance of two such algorithms and conclude the paper with a description of the full tracking strategy. The utility of the presented strategy is demonstrated with simulations and experiments on a sensor network platform",

        "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of generating timed trajectories and temporally coordinated movements for two wheeled vehicles, when relatively low-level, noisy sensorial information is used to steer action. The generated trajectories have controlled and stable timing (limit cycle type solutions). Incoupling of sensory information enables sensor driven termination of movement. We build on a previously proposed solution in which timed trajectories and sequences of movements were generated as attractor solutions of dynamic systems. We present a novel system composed of two coupled dynamical architectures that temporally coordinate the solutions of these dynamical systems. The coupled dynamics enable synchronization of the different components providing an independence relatively to the specification of their individual parameters. We apply this architecture to generate temporally coordinated trajectories for two vision-guided mobile robots in a non-structured simulated environment, whose goal is to reach a target within a certain time independently of the environment configuration or the distance to the target. The results illustrate the robustness of the proposed decision-making mechanism and show that the two vehicles are temporal coordinated: if a robot movement is affected by the environment configuration such that it will take longer to reach the target, the control level coordinates the two robots such that they terminate approximately simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "The problem of object caging is defined as a problem of designing a formation of fingers to restrict an object within a bounded space. Assuming two pointed fingers and a rigid polygonal or polyhedral object, this paper addresses the problem of two-finger squeezing caging, i.e., to characterize all possible formations of the fingers that are capable of caging the object via limiting their separation distance. Our study is done entirely in the object's frame allowing the object to be considered as a static obstacle so that the analysis can be performed in terms of the finger motion. Our solution is based on partitioning the configuration space of the problem into finite subsets called nodes. A graph of these nodes can then be constructed to represent all possible finger motion where a search based method can be applied to solve the caging problem. The partitioning of the configuration is based on convex decomposition of the free space. Let m be the number of convex subsets from the decomposition, our proposed algorithm reports all squeezing cage sets in O(n2 + nm + m2 log m) for a polygonal input with n vertices and O(nN3 + n2 + nm + m2 log m) for a polyhedron with n vertices and having TV edges exhibiting a reflex angle. After reporting all squeezing cages, the proposed algorithm can answer whether a given finger placement can cage the object within a logarithmic time.",

We then propose in this paper an omnidirectional vision system based on straight lines (very frequent in urban environment) that is able to compute the roll and pitch angles. The method consists in finding bundles of horizontal and vertical parallel lines in order to obtain an absolute reference for the attitude computation. We also develop here a new and efficient method for line extraction and bundle of parallel line detection. An original method of horizontal and vertical plane detection is also provided.

This tripartite partition, which independently manifests Intelligence, Perception and Action, enables the abstraction of intelligence through the standardization of sensory data and motor or action commands. The Ubibot system itself is introduced along with its component subsystems of Embots, the Position Embot, Vision Embot and Sound Embot, the Mobots of Mybot and HSR, the Sobot, Rity, a virtual pet modeled as an artificial creature, and finally the Middleware which seamlessly enables interconnection between other components. Three kinds of experiments are devised to demonstrate the fundamental features, of calm sensing, context awareness and seamless service transcending the spatial limitations in the abilities of earlier generation personal robots. The experiments demonstrate the proof of concept of this powerful new paradigm which shows great promise.",

The controller is designed to cope with the case when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera as well as the robot parameters are not calibrated. The controller employs the depth-independent image Jacobian to map the errors on the image plane onto the joint space. By using the depth-independent image Jacobian, it is possible to linearly parameterize the unknown camera parameters in the closed loop dynamics of the system. A new algorithm is developed to estimate unknown parameters on-line. We have proved asymptotic convergence of the image errors by Lyapunov method with a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot manipulator and demonstrated the performance by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter and FastSLAM have become popular tools to solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. However, the above techniques have two important potential limitations, which are the derivation of the Jacobian matrices and the linear approximations to the nonlinear functions. Also, one of the major challenges of both Rao-Blackwellized particle filter and FastSLAM is to reduce the number of particles while maintaining the estimation accuracy. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on unscented transformation called Unscented FastSLAM (UFastSLAM) that overcomes important drawbacks of the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter frameworks by directly using nonlinear relations. Experimental results in large scale environments are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the UFastSLAM algorithm over the previous approaches.",

A methodology is presented for upper-body posture estimation in the sagittal plane from force and torque measurements exerted on handles during human standing, in the hypothesis of quasi-static equilibrium. The method consists in setting up constraints related to the geometric equations and the hand-handle interaction. All measured quantities are subject to an uncertainty assumed unknown but bounded. The set membership estimation problem is solved via interval analysis. Guaranteed uncertainty bounds are computed for the estimated postures. The methodology is validated experimentally with spinal cord injured patients with lesions between T5 and T12. Possible applications of the developed methodology are lower limbs function rehabilitation within clinical centers, walk assistance and independent mobility for spinal cord injured patients.",

In order to suppress the undesirable liquid vibration effects, so called `sloshing', a new simple and effective methodology consisting of adapting the gripper orientation is proposed. The assumption of slosh-free movement will be valid so long as there is no relative motion between the container and the liquid. To accomplish this objective, the maximum acceleration in every time-instant has to be considered in the computation. This represents that our method operates basically in maintaining the normal of the liquid surface opposite to the entire systems acceleration until the completion of the transportation. Experimental results using a manipulator KUKA-KR16 will be demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

In particular, our approach applies AdaBoost to train a strong classifier from simple features of groups of neighboring beams corresponding to legs in range data. Experimental results carried out with laser range data illustrate the robustness of our approach even in cluttered office environments",

        "abstract": "Synthesis of robot behaviors towards nontrivial goals often requires reasoning about both discrete and continuous aspects of the underlying domain. Existing approaches in building automated tools for such synthesis problems attempt to augment methods from either discrete planning or continuous control with hybrid elements, but largely fail to ensure a uniform treatment of both aspects of the domain. In this paper, we present a new formalism, constrained intuitionistic linear logic (CILL), merging continuous constraint solvers with linear logic to yield a single language in which hybrid properties of robotic behaviors can be expressed and reasoned with. Following a gentle introduction to linear logic, we describe the two new connectives of CILL, introduced to interface the constraint domain with the logical fragment of the language. We then illustrate the application of CILL for robotic planning problems within the balanced blocks world, a \"physically realistic\" extension of the blocks world domain. Even though some of the formal proofs for the semantic foundations of the language as well as an efficient implementation of a theorem prover are yet to be completed, CILL promises to be a powerful formalism in reasoning within hybrid domains.",

Two different non-parametric filter approaches are presented to estimate the location of the vehicles. A comparison of the two filters is also presented with experimental results using data collected in two operational mines.",

More precisely, we want to control the orientation of the tangent plane at a certain point on the object corresponding to the center of a region of interest and to move this point to the principal point to fulfill a xation task. To do that, we perform a 3D reconstruction phase during the servoing. It is based on the measurement of the 2D displacement in the region of interest and on the measurement of the camera velocity. Since the 2D displacement depends on the scene, we introduce an unified motion model to deal with planar as well with non-planar objects. Unfortunately, this model is only an approximation. In [1], we propose to use active vision to enlarge its domain of validity and a 3D reconstruction based on a continuous approach. In this paper, we propose to use robust estimation techniques and a 3D reconstruction based on discrete approach. Experimental results compare both approaches.",

        "abstract": "A new method is presented for controlling the lateral foot placement of a simple 3D compass biped model. The method is based on the fact that, in the limit cycle, the gait is time-reversal symmetric and that, after a disturbance, the degree of asymmetry is indicated by a single variable. This variable is used for feedback with a proportional controller. Simulation results show that the controller works very well for a large range of gaits, without any adaptation of the parameter values",

Because of its smoothness, the Gaussian kernel is a popular and useful choice as a basis function. However, it does not allow for discontinuity which typically arises in real-world reinforcement learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new basis function based on geodesic Gaussian kernels, which exploits the non-linear manifold structure induced by the Markov decision processes. The usefulness of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated in a simulated robot arm control and Khepera robot navigation.",

        "abstract": "A key challenge for autonomous navigation in cluttered outdoor environments is the reliable discrimination between obstacles that must be avoided at all costs, and lesser obstacles which the robot can drive over if necessary. Chlorophyll-rich vegetation in particular is often not an obstacle to a capable off-road vehicle, and it has long been recognized in the satellite imaging community that a simple comparison of the red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of a material provides a reliable technique for measuring chlorophyll content in natural scenes. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using this chlorophyll-detection technique to improve autonomous navigation in natural, off-road environments. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that this feature has properties complementary to the color and shape descriptors traditionally used for point cloud analysis, and show significant improvement in classification performance for tasks relevant to outdoor navigation. Results are shown from field testing onboard a robot operating in off-road terrain.",

These fields can be used for sensorless part orientation, uncertainty-reducing transport, and simultaneous manipulation of multiple parts. The principle is demonstrated by a plate rotating about an axis below the plate. Simple oscillatory rotation produces a squeeze field that attracts and aligns parts along a center line. This behavior is confirmed in experiment. Motivated by this experimental confirmation, we use a simulation to find plate motions that yield a number of other useful primitive force fields. By sequencing these force fields, we can create any force field that is a convex combination of the primitives.",

Neptus was created to provide vehicle independence and seamless inter-systems communications. Currently, Neptus has been already tested with Remotely Operated Vehicles, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Autonomous Surface Vehicles and Wireless Sensor Networks.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the problem of view planning with combined view and traveling cost, denoted by traveling VPP. It refers to planning a sequence of sensing actions with minimum total cost by a robot-sensor system to completely inspect the surfaces of objects in a known workspace. The cost to minimize is a combination of the view cost, proportional to the number of viewpoints planned, and the traveling cost for the robot to realize them. First, we formulate traveling VPP as an integer linear program (ILP). The focus of this paper is to design an approximation algorithm that guarantees worst-case performance (w.r.t. the optimal solution cost). We propose a linear program based rounding algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of the order of view frequency, defined to be the maximum number of viewpoints that see a single surface patch of the object. Together with the result we showed (2006), the best approximation ratio for Traveling VPP is either the order of view frequency or a poly-log function of the input size, whichever is smaller. Motivated from the robot motion planning techniques, where the graph built for robot traveling is a tree, we then consider the corresponding special case of traveling VPP, and give a polynomial sized LP formulation. We conclude with a discussion of realistic issues and constraints towards implementing our algorithm on real robot-sensor systems.",

When only a few active cameras are used to cover a wide area, planning their views is an important issue in realizing a competent surveillance system. We develop a multi-start local search (MLS)-based planning method which iteratively selects fixation points of the cameras by which the expected number of tracked persons is maximized. Considering the fact that a person's motion can be estimated with its intermittent observations, we set a criterion which encourages frequent shifts of fixation points and develop a procedure for generating promising initial solutions for MLS. The method is shown to outperform the other approaches. We then modify the method such that it dynamically divides the cameras into mutually independent groups and determines fixation points within each group. The modified method is comparable to the original one with a much lower planning cost.",

        "abstract": "In human-machine collaborative systems, robot joint compliance and human-input dynamics lead to involuntary tool motion into undesired regions. To correct this, a set of methods, called dynamically-defined virtual fixtures, was previously proposed to create a movable virtual fixture that stops the user at a safe distance outside the forbidden region. In this work, a new method, called the force-based method, was added. A vision system was introduced for real-time tool tracking. Additionally, we implemented a closed-loop controller with the virtual fixtures that allows the user to reach, but not enter, the forbidden region. Two user experiments were conducted on a 1-DOF testbed to evaluate the virtual fixture methods. The first experiment showed the effectiveness of the virtual fixtures in preventing the penetration. However, the absence of haptic feedback in the closed-loop implementation resulted in boundary penetration. In the second experiment, visual feedback was used to compensate for the lack of haptic feedback. User cognitive load was added as an inhibiting factor in a human-machine cooperative setting. The experiment showed a significant reduction in penetration with visual feedback, while the addition of cognitive load did not significantly increase the penetration.",

        "abstract": "Categorizing visual elements is fundamentally important for autonomous mobile robots to get intelligence such as new object acquisition and topological place classification. The main problem of visual categorization is how to reduce the large intra-class variations, especially surface markings of man-made objects. In this paper, we present a robust method by introducing intermediate blurring and entropy-guided codebook selection in a bag-of-words framework. Intermediate blurring can filter out the high frequency of surface markings and provide dominant shape information. Entropy of a hypothesized codebook can provide the necessary measure for the semantic parts among training exemplars. From the first step, a generative optimal codebook for each category is learned using the MDL (minimum description length) principle guided by entropy information. From the second step, a final set of codebook is learned using the discriminative method guided by the inter-category entropy of the codebook. We select the necessary parameters through various evaluations and validate the effect of the surface marking reduction method using a Caltech-101 DB, which has large intra-class variations. Finally, we briefly introduce the impact of the method to the object categorization and segmentation problem.",

The objective of this work was to elaborate a method yielding good initial estimates of the pose for SBA based pose refinement. A new approach for determining inter frame correspondences between features is presented. It is based on singular value decomposition of weighted cross correlation matrix of two feature sets. The weighting of potential matches between features is realized on the basis of cross correlation of intensity values and Gabor filter responses. The method is robust to large motions. Corner and SIFT features were used to compare the effectiveness of our method with Kalman filter based tracking of features. Initial estimate of the pose is determined with singular value decomposition and quaternion based representation of camera's pose. The refinement of the pose estimate is achieved using RANSAC and then SBA on several consecutive frames at once. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the system to estimate visual odometry in real-time.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new hybrid visual servoing algorithm for robot arm positioning task. Hybrid methods in visual servoing partially combine the 2D and 3D visual information to improve the performance of the traditional image-based and position-based visual servoing. Our algorithm is superior to the state of the art hybrid methods. The objective function has been designed to include the full 2D and 3D information available either from the CAD model or from the partial reconstruction process by decomposing the homography matrix between two views. Here, each of 2D and 3D error functions is used to control the six degrees of freedom. We call this method 5D visual servoing. The positioning task has been formulated as a minimization problem. Gradient decent as a first order approximation and Gauss-Newton as a second order approximation are considered in this paper. Simulation results show that these two methods provide an efficient solution to the camera retreat and features visibility problems. The camera trajectory in the Cartesian space is also shown to be satisfactory.",

These algorithms fail to provide optimum behavior when the robot has to be controlled with respect to active non-rigid targets. This paper presents a new framework for visual servoing that accomplishes the robot positioning task even in non-rigid environments. We introduce a space-time representation scheme for modeling the deformations of a non-rigid object and propose a model-free hybrid approach that exploits the two-view geometry induced by the space-time features to perform the servoing task. Our formulation can address a variety of non-rigid motions and can tackle large camera displacements without being affected by the degeneracies in the task space. Experimental results validate our approach and demonstrate the robust and stable behavior",

Therefore, a reconstruction phase has to be performed during the camera motion. More precisely, the reconstruction phase is based on the measurement of the 2D motion in a region of interest and on the measurement of the camera velocity. Since the 2D motion depends on the shape of objects being observed, we introduce an uni ed motion model to cope as well with planar as with non-planar objects. This is an improvement of our previous works described in [1], [2] where only planar objects had been considered. However, since this model is only an approximation, we propose to use active vision to enlarge its domain of validity. Experimental results validate the proposed approach.",

A new path-planning scheme is proposed by, first, introducing a robust object reconstruction which allows one to obtain feasible image trajectories. Second, the rotation path is parameterized through a particular extension of the Euler parameters in order to obtain an equivalent expression of the rotation matrix as a quadratic function of unconstrained variables, hence largely simplified with respect to standard parameterizations which involve transcendental functions. Then, polynomials of arbitrary degree are used to complete the parametrization and formulate a general optimization where a number of constraints and costs can be considered. The optimal trajectory is followed by tracking the image trajectories with standard IBVS controllers.",

Even a tiny excessive manipulation force can destroy the membrane or tissue of the biological cell. This makes the control of the injection force an important factor in the cell injection process. In this paper, a vision-based impedance force control algorithm is proposed based on dynamic modeling of a laboratory test-bed injection system. The injection force is calibrated in a cell injection task to derive the relationship between the force and the cell deformation. A cell biomembrane point-load model is utilized in this force calibration. In three-dimensional cell injection task, the total cell membrane deformation is estimated, based on the X - Y coordinate frame deformation of the cell, as measured with a microscope, and the known angle between the injector and the X Y plane. Further, a relationship between the injection force and the injector visual displacement of the cell membrane is derived. Based on this force visual estimation scheme, an impedance force control algorithm is developed. Finally, experimental results are given which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "We describe a system for visual interaction developed for humanoid robots. It enables the robot to interact with its environment using a smooth whole body motion control driven by stabilized visual targets. Targets are defined as visually extracted \"proto-objects\" and behavior-relevant object hypotheses and are stabilized by means of a short-term sensory memory. Selection mechanisms are used to switch between behavior alternatives for searching or tracking objects as well as different whole body motion strategies for reaching. The decision between different motion strategies like reaching with right or left hand or with and without walking is made based on internal predictions that use copies of the whole-body control algorithm. The results show robust object tracking and a smooth interaction behavior that includes a large variety of whole-body postures.",

The key idea is to divide the control into several sensor-based control tasks that are simultaneously executed by a general structure called stack of tasks. This structure enables a very simple access for task sequencing, and can be used for task-level control. This framework was applied for a visual servoing task. The robot walks along a planed path, keeping the specified object in the middle of its field of view and finally, when it is close enough, the robot grasps the object while walking.",

        "abstract": "Detection of line-of-sight (LOS) has a variety of applications, such as communication tools for elderly or disabled people, assisting drivers, and effective location of traffic signs. To realize such promising applications, the LOS detecting system that does not restrict users' activities and is free from mental stress from the equipment is strongly demanded. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable LOS detection system that affects the users as little as possible both physically and mentally using dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. The photovoltaic devices are transparent and generate voltage according to the incident light intensity. Arraying the devices on wearable eyeglasses, this system detects the difference in the reflection light from the pupil and the white of the eye and thus, the position of the pupil. This system is wearable as an eyeglass and hence, it does not disturb the activities and the eyesight of users. More importantly, it involves very little physical and psychological stress to users. We fabricated and characterized the photovoltaic device and demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the location of the pupil. We found it possible to meet the required reaction time of 100 ms by reducing the size of the device and to improve the accuracy of detecting the location of the pupil by arraying the devices.",

The desired task specifications can express complex robot behaviors such as search and rescue, coverage, and collision avoidance. In addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications that depend on the environment with which the robot is interacting, resulting in a novel paradigm for sensor-based temporal logic motion planning. As one robot is part of the environment of another robot, our sensor-based framework very naturally captures multi-robot specifications. Our computational approach is based on first creating discrete controllers satisfying so-called general reactivity formulas. If feasible, the discrete controller is then used in order to guide the sensor-based composition of continuous controllers resulting in a hybrid controller satisfying the high level specification, but only if the environment is admissible.",

Measuring the motion of the heart during this operation is an important part of this scheme. In this paper, a novel whisker sensor design to measure the heart motion in three dimensions (3D) is presented. The proposed whisker sensor is a flexible contact sensor. Low stiffness of the sensor prevents damage on the tissue it contacts.

The robot, called Stickybot, draws its inspiration from geckos and other climbing lizards and employs similar compliance and force control strategies to climb smooth vertical surfaces including glass, tile and plastic panels. Foremost among the design features are multiple levels of compliance, at length scales ranging from centimeters to micrometers, to allow the robot to conform to surfaces and maintain large real areas of contact so that adhesive forces can support it. Structures within the feet ensure even stress distributions over each toe and facilitate engagement and disengagement of the adhesive materials. A force control strategy works in conjunction with the directional adhesive materials to obtain sufficient levels of friction and adhesion for climbing with low attachment and detachment forces.",

This paper demonstrates a simple generalized method of creating and understanding pulse-based profiles, and presents an approach to suppress a wider band of induced vibration than previously attainable. The current approach of Input Shaping ignores the potential contributions the base profile and pulse shape can have on the profile. When examined from a signal processing point of view these pulse-based profiles can be thought of as sampled low pass filters. The sampling of the filter kernel defines the magnitude of the pulses, but as in any digital system it also produces aliasing. An interpolating filter can then be used to both remove the aliasing and to smooth and shape the base profile. This dual purpose of the interpolating filter allows the use of the Swing Free step input in conjunction with a rate-limit as a base profile. A generalized methodology is proposed which can create smooth motion profiles with continuous derivatives, while keeping the computational efficient of traditional Input Shaping. Experimental validation of two multi-DOF systems is shown.",

The WFW is fundamental since it takes into account both the requirement of non-negative cable tension and the requirement of a maximum admissible cable tension. This paper addresses the problem of the determination of the WFW of n-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanisms driven by more than n cables. Interval analysis based methods that allow to determine if a given n-dimensional box is fully included in the WFW are presented. Moreover, these methods are also able to approximate the WFW up to a chosen accuracy. The resulting approximation consists of a set of n-dimensional boxes such that each box of the set is fully included in the WFW.",

        "abstract": "We discuss a ZMP-based running pattern generation for a biped robot equipped with toe springs. Our biped robot HRP-2LT has twelve active DoFs for its legs and two passive DoFs for its toes. The trajectory of the center of mass is designed to realize the specified running motion and the foot trajectories are determined to get proper spring action at lift off phases. They are interpreted into joint angles by using the resolved momentum control. By the simulation and the preliminary experiment, it is shown that the toe springs are effectively used for running and hopping.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the design and current capabilities of a new software tool, dVC, capable of simulating planar systems of bodies experiencing unilateral contacts with friction. Since different problems require different levels of accuracy, dVC provides user-selectable body types (rigid or locally-compliant), motion models (first-order, quasi-static, dynamic), and several state-of-the-art time-stepping methods. One can also choose to include friction between each body and the plane of motion. To support optimal and robust part design, dVC also allows on-the-fly changes to parameters of the geometric and physical models. The results obtained for three representative planar problems are presented: the design of a passive part-orienting device, the planning of a mesoscale assembly operation, and the design of a grasp strategy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We introduce incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM), a novel approach to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that addresses the data association problem and allows real-time application in large-scale environments. We employ smoothing to obtain the complete trajectory and map without the need for any approximations, exploiting the natural sparsity of the smoothing information matrix. A QR-factorization of this information matrix is at the heart of our approach. It provides efficient access to the exact covariances as well as to conservative estimates that are used for online data association. It also allows recovery of the exact trajectory and map at any given time by back-substitution. Instead of refactoring in each step, we update the QR-factorization whenever a new measurement arrives. We analyze the effect of loops, and show how our approach extends to the non-linear case. Finally, we provide experimental validation of the overall non-linear algorithm based on the standard Victoria Park data set with unknown correspondences.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the major issues enduring with microscale mechanics has been to design high fidelity miniature machines capable of performing complex operations. Though achieved in some proportion through conventional in-plane and out-of-plane designs, the efficacy of such micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) structures is highly limited due to complicate fabrication and inadequate robustness. On the other hand, the use of precise robots to assemble MEMS parts of comparatively simpler design to build 3D micromechanical structures has recently emerged as a viable approach. Such modular assemblies of microscale parts typically utilize minimum energy connectors that are multifunctional, e.g., mechanical, electrical etc. The \u03bc3 is a 3-D microassembly station consisting of 19 DOF arranged into 3 micromanipulators, with additional microgrippers and stereo microscope vision. The platform is capable of motion resolutions of 3nm and is small enough to be used inside of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for nano-manipulation. In this paper we discuss how systematic identification and calibration of the station, combined with appropriate part connector designs can lead to multi-degree of freedom active MEMS robots assembled on a wafer.",
