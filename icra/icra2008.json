        "abstract": "The potential of six-axis acceleration sensors in the field of robotic manipulation applications is quite high and most of it has not been used yet - neither in theoretic literature nor in research experiments. When considering six-joint industrial manipulators with six-axis force/torque and six-axis acceleration sensing, many new possibilities arise: all ten inertial parameters of any object can be identified and objects can be recognized based on these parameters, position control behavior can be improved; non-contact forces can be extracted and force control performance can be improved; visual-servoing methods can use acceleration signals to become more robust. The authors made numerous experiments in the mentioned fields and recognized major weaknesses during the realization of prototypic research setups with six-axis acceleration sensors. These problems regard sensor drift, undesired sensor-internal dependencies as the influence of any distal sensor part, noise, and undesired crosstalk behavior. In order to benefit from acceleration signals, it is important to clearly overcome these problems. This paper analyzes typical systematic errors, characterizes them, and suggests important solution methods for a successful usage of acceleration information.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the image-based visual servoing framework, image moments provide an appealing choice as visual features since they can be easily evaluated on any shape on the image plane, and do not require tracking and matching of individual geometric structures between distinct image frames (i.e., the so-called correspondence problem). However, computation of the moment interaction matrix still requires the knowledge of specific unmeasurable 3D quantities relative to the target object, quantities that are usually approximated in practical implementations. Therefore, in this paper we analyze the possibility to estimate on-line the value of such 3D quantities during the camera motion with the only assumption of a target shape with planar limb surface. The proposed estimation scheme builds upon the theory of nonlinear observers, and in particular exploits the basic formulation of the persistency of excitation Lemma. Simulation results are then presented in order to support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Their sampling rate is around the video rate (30Hz or so) and a faster sensor is required. The proposed sensor has achieved 200Hz measurement. It consists of a commercially available laser projector and a high-speed CCD camera. The number of pixels is 361 and the measurement range is 800\u20132000mm. Although the acquired range image is sparse, the proposed sensor is thought to be adequate for several applications such as robot vision because of its high-speed imaging and compactness. Some characteristics such as measurement errors are discussed, and the effectiveness of the proposed sensor is verified by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Local linearizations are ubiquitous in the control of robotic systems. Analytical methods, if available, can be used to obtain the linearization, but in complex robotics systems where the dynamics and kinematics are often not faithfully obtainable, empirical linearization may be preferable. In this case, it is important to only use data for the local linearization that lies within a \"reasonable\" linear regime of the system, which can be defined from the Hessian at the point of the linearization- a quantity that is not available without an analytical model. We introduce a Bayesian approach to solve statistically what constitutes a \"reasonable\" local regime. We approach this problem in the context local linear regression. In contrast to previous locally linear methods, we avoid cross-validation or complex statistical hypothesis testing techniques to find the appropriate local regime. Instead, we treat the parameters of the local regime probabilistically and use approximate Bayesian inference for their estimation. The approach results in an analytical set of iterative update equations that are easily implemented on real robotics systems for real-time applications. As in other locally weighted regressions, our algorithm also lends itself to complete nonlinear function approximation for learning empirical internal models. We sketch the derivation of our Bayesian method and provide evaluations on synthetic data and actual robot data where the analytical linearization was known.",

We seek hypotheses that can justify a separate implementation of control, localization and planning. In the end, we reduce the stochastic control problem to path- planning in the extended space of poses x covariances; the transitions between states are modeled through the use of the Fisher information matrix. In this framework, we consider two problems: minimizing the execution time, and minimizing the final covariance, with an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct and complete algorithms are presented. The first is the direct extension of classical graph-search algorithms in the extended space. The second one is a back-projection algorithm: uncertainty constraints are propagated backward from the goal towards the start state.",

We simultaneously consider bounded speed for both players and a variable distance separating them. Unlike our previous efforts [R. Murrieta-Cid et al., 2007], we give special attention to the combinatorial problem that arises when searching for a solution through visiting several locations. We approach evader tracking by decomposing the environment into convex regions. We define two graphs: one is called the mutual visibility graph (MVG) and the other the accessibility graph (AG). The MVG provides a sufficient condition to maintain visibility of the evader while the AG defines possible regions to which either the pursuer or the evader may go to. The problem is framed as a non cooperative game. We establish the existence of a solution, based on a k- Min approach, for the following givens: the environment, the initial state of the evader and the pursuer, including their maximal speeds. We show that the problem of finding a solution to this game is NP-complete.",

Different from embryos/oocytes that have a spherical shape and regular morphology, adherent cells are flat with a thickness of a few micrometers and are highly irregular in morphology. Based on computer vision microscopy and motion control, the system coordinately controls a three-degrees-of-freedom microrobot and a precision XY stage. The microrobotic system demonstrates an injection speed of 25 endothelial cells per minute with a survival rate of 96% and a success rate of 82% (n=1012). The system has a high degree of performance consistency. It is immune to operator proficiency variations and from human fatigue, requiring a human operator to select injection destinations through computer mouse clicking as the only operator intervention.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a powerful robust stability analysis technique is introduced and developed for teleoperation systems. The methodology is based on wave parameters and discusses absolute stability and potential instability using scattering and is originally used in microwave systems [1]. The proposed method provides suitable mathematical and visual aids to determine bounds or regions of passive environment impedances for which a potentially unstable system connected to any passive operator is stable, and vice-versa. Furthermore, a novel stability parameter is proposed to maximize the derivation of the above bounds or regions. This results in less conservative guaranteed stability conditions compared to the Llewellyn\u2019s criterion; thus, achieving a better compromise between stability and performance. The proposed methodology allows for the design of bilateral control systems when such bounds are known or even when the operator or environment dynamics are active. The new robust stability analysis and Llewellyn\u2019s criterion are numerically evaluated and compared with each other on two common teleoperation control architectures.",

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) (see Fig.1) AUV has been successfully used in several hydrothermal vents prospecting missions. Recently, a three-stage nested approach [1] has been introduced. It consists in surveys at different altitudes to finally photograph the venting structures flying very close to the seafloor. In this paper, we introduce a new strategy for ABE's movement in surveys at higher altitude (phase-1): ABE moves along predesigned tracklines sampling the seawater; when some conditions on collected data are encountered, it starts a spiral movement to fly over areas likely to contain active vent fields. Results of the proposed algorithm tested on data coming from previous ABE's missions are shown and assess the efficiency and reliability of the method.",

Such a system aims at increasing the surgeon's dexterity for tasks requiring that only small forces be applied on the organ (eg. for micro-surgery). In the proposed setup, the surgeon manipulates a handle mounted on the instrument. This is a comanipulation system because the surgeon and the robot simultaneously manipulate the instrument. The proposed control scheme allows an augmented force control: the control law ensures that the instrument applies on the organ the same forces that the surgeon applies on the handle but decreased by a scale factor. As a consequence, the forces sensed by the surgeon are the forces between the instrument and the organ amplified by a scale factor. This control scheme is proved stable thanks to a passivity study. Indeed, passivity analysis is a useful tool for the stability analysis of a robot interacting with the environment. Experimental results are presented on a robot dedicated to minimally invasive surgery.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a square root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF) solution to the problem of performing visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using a single camera. Several authors have proposed the conventional UKF for SLAM to improve the handling of non-linearities compared with the more widely used EKF, but at the expense increasing computational complexity from O(N2) to O(N3) in the map size, making it unattractive for video-rate application. Van der Merwe and Wan's general SRUKF delivers identical results to a general UKF along with computational savings, but remains O(N3) overall. This paper shows how the SRUKF for the SLAM problem can be re-posed with O(N2) complexity, matching that of the EKF. The paper also shows how the method of inverse depth feature initialization developed by Montiel et al. for the EKF can be reformulated to work with the SRUKF. Experimental results confirm that the SRUKF and the UKF produce identical estimates, and that the SRUKF is more consistent than the EKF. Although the complexity is the same, the SRUKF remains more expensive to compute.",

It takes advantage of the models of species reproduction to provide a suitable framework for carrying on the multi-hypothesis, along with proper policies for both autonomous and collaborative contexts. Collaboration among robots is obtained by exchanging sensory data and their relative distance and orientation. This information is integrated into the framework in such a way that the convergence aptitude is enhanced. Several simulations in different environments have been performed, comparing autonomous and collaborative localization, along with proper statistical analysis for performance assessment.",

        "abstract": "Several recently-designed robots are able to scale steep surfaces using animal-inspired strategies for foot attachment and leg kinematics. These designs could be valuable for reaching high vantage points or for overcoming large obstacles. However, most of these robots cannot transition between intersecting surfaces. For example, our previous Climbing Mini-WhegsTM robot cannot make a 90deg transition from a vertical wall up onto a flat horizontal surface. It is known that cockroaches bend their body to accomplish such transitions. This concept has been simplified to a single-axis body joint which allows ground-walking robots to cross uneven terrain. In this work, we examine the effect of a body joint on wall-climbing vehicles using both a kinematic simulation and two prototype Climbing Mini-WhegsTM robots. The simulation accurately predicts that the better design has the body joint axle closer to the center of the robot than to the front wheel- legs for orthogonal exterior transitions for a wide range of initial conditions. In the future, the methods and principles demonstrated here could be used to improve the design of climbing robots for other environments.",

We present an algorithm based on gradient boosting for biosanar-based robots that recognize different objects such as different trees via reflected sonar echoes. Gradient boosting is a machine learning approach, that builds one strong classifier from many base learners. We present two kinds of base learners for the gradient boosting: ordinary least squares (OLS) and kernel-based base learners. Compared with our previous works, in which we presented a time resolved spectrum kernel to extract the similarities between echoes, we get more efficient and accurate results with the newly proposed boosting method. We compare the methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient and also the runtime of training and testing.",

We conclude that the spiral-surge algorithm yields significantly better results than the casting algorithm, and discuss possible rationales behind this performance difference.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we have extended the concept of constrained motion control of robots to surgical tasks that require multiple robots. We present virtual fixtures to guide the motion of multiple robots such that spatial and temporal relationship is maintained between them. At the same time, our algorithm keeps the surgeon in the control loop. Moreover, we show that these virtual fixtures allow bimanual tasks to be completed using input for a single robot. That is, the user requires only one hand to cooperatively control multiple robots. This reduces the cognitive load on the surgeon and makes multiple-robot setup for surgery more relevant.We demonstrate this architecture by using an example of manipulating a surgical knot to position it at a target point. Significant improvement is observed in the accuracy when bimanual virtual fixture assistance is provided. Moreover, the accuracy when using a single input from user is similar to the accuracy obtained from bimanual assistance.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots have the potential to navigate a much larger variety of terrain than their wheeled counterparts. In this paper we present a hierarchical control architecture that enables a quadruped, the \u201cLittleDog\u201d robot, to walk over rough terrain. The controller consists of a high-level planner that plans a set of footsteps across the terrain, a low-level planner that plans trajectories for the robot\u2019s feet and center of gravity (COG), and a low-level controller that tracks these desired trajectories using a set of closed-loop mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that the controller is able to robustly cross a wide variety of challenging terrains, climbing over obstacles nearly as tall as the robot\u2019s legs. In addition, we highlight several elements of the controller that we found to be particularly crucial for robust locomotion, and which are applicable to quadruped robots in general. In such cases we conduct empirical evaluations to test the usefulness of these elements.",

The forearm utilizes pneumatic type actuators which use the reaction products of a monopropellant gas generator as a working fluid. The use of pneumatic type actuators provides a near-human power density, such that the fourteen actuator forearm unit can deliver approximately one half of the force and power capability of a human arm, with a total package size that fits within the volumetric constraints of a 50th percentile female forearm (excluding the cartridge of liquid propellant). This paper describes the design of the forearm. The design has been fabricated, and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the closed-loop force tracking capability. An accompanying video further demonstrates the forearm performance.",

        "abstract": "The control and mechanical systems of an embodied agent should be tightly coupled so as to emerge useful functionalities such as adaptivity. This indicates that the mechanical system as well as the control system should be responsible for a certain amount of computation for generating the behavior. However, there still leaves much to be understood about how such \u201ccomputational offloading\u201d from the control system to the mechanical system can be achieved. In order to intensively investigate this, here we particularly focus on the \u201csoftness\u201d of the body, and show how the computational offloading derived from this property is exploited to simplify the control system and to increase the degree of adaptivity. To this end, we employ a two-dimensional amoeboid robot as a practical example, consisting of incompressive fluid (i.e. protoplasm) covered with an outer skin composed of a network of real-time tunable springs. Preliminary simulation results show that the exploitation of the \u201clong-distant interaction\u201d stemming from \u201cthe law of conservation of protoplasmic mass\u201d allows us to simplify the control mechanism; and that adaptive amoeboid locomotion can be realized without the need of a central controller. The results obtained are expected to shed light on how control and mechanical systems should be coupled, and what the \u201cbrain-body-interaction\u201d carefully designed brings to the resulting behavior.",

        "abstract": "Motion trajectory is a compact clue for motion characterization. However, it is normally used directly in its raw data form in most work and effective trajectory description is lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical motion trajectory signature descriptor, which can not only fully capture motion features for detailed perception, but also can be used for probabilistic fast recognition. The hierarchy enables the signature to exhibit high functional adaptability meeting different application requirements. At the first-level, differential invariants are employed to describe trajectory features and a nonlinear signature warping method is developed to perceive and recognize trajectories. The second-level signature is the condensation of the first-level signature by applying PCA based dimension optimization. It behaves more efficiently in recognition based on the Gaussian Mixture modeling and Bayesian classifier. The conducted experiments verified the signature\u2019s effectiveness.",

This paper presents the concept of hybrid actuation for the development of human-friendly robotic systems. The new design employs inherently safe pneumatic artificial muscles augmented with small electrical actuators, human-bone-inspired robotic links, and newly designed distributed compact pressure regulators. The modularization and integration of the robot components enable low complexity in the design and assembly. The hybrid actuation concept has been validated on a two-degree-of-freedom prototype arm. The experimental results show the significant improvement that can be achieved with hybrid actuation over an actuation system with pneumatic artificial muscles alone. Using the Manipulator Safety Index (MSI), the paper discusses the safety of the new prototype and shows the robot arm safety characteristics to be comparable to those of a human arm.",

The controller is distributed in that it requires only information local to each robot, and adaptive in that it modifies its behavior based on information in the environment. The ladybug controller is developed as a modification to a basic coverage control law, first for the non-adaptive case, then for the adaptive case. Stability is proven for both cases with a Lyapunov-type proof. Results of numerical simulations are presented.",

Nominal operations will likely produce manipulator configurations that occlude the line-of-sight from the camera to a target of interest. In this paper, a technique is developed that treats the camera line-of-sight as a virtual obstacle in order to prevent camera occlusion. The approach is based on using virtual point charges to represent obstacles and using the self-motion of the arm to avoid collisions. The approach is demonstrated on the Ranger Dexterous Manipulator.",

We argue that this design reduces the control complexity of an IPMC manipulator and increases the precision of the device. The design rationale stems from our theoretical work in material modeling. It suggests that when electrically decoupled short IPMC strips are connected to rigid links, the control of the IPMC manipulator, which is currently vaguely understood and highly non-linear, can be reduced to simple inverse kinematics serial chain manipulator control without the loss in efficiency. We validate our design by comparing the prototype device to a simple IPMC manipulator commonly investigated in the literature. The results show increased precision, reaction time and reachable workspace. We suggest that such a manipulator is suitable for soft and micromanipulation.",

In this system, the leader robot knows global trajectory, tries to track the global trajectory, and has the ability to avoid collisions. The follower robots do not know global trajectory. They only use local sensors to acquire relative information between neighbors. In this paper they use a laser scanner to obtain relative distances and relative angles between neighbors. By using local information, the follower robots maintain the distances between their neighbors and avoid collisions with their neighbors. We prove that such a leader-follower flocking system is stable based on LaSalles invariance principle. To evaluate the performance of the flocking system, we simulate the flocking system tracking a desired trajectory. The flocking algorithm is tested with three Pioneer robots and SICK laser scanners. Both of simulation and real robot experiments successfully show the proposed local sensor based algorithm works in the leader-follower flocking system.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a physical model of an inertial/magnetic measurement unit by effectively integrating an accelerometer, a magnetometer, and two gyroscopes for low-g motion tracking applications. The proposed model breaks down the errors contributed by individual components, then determines error elimination methods based on sensor behavior and characteristics, and finally constructs a feedback loop for continuous self-calibration. Measurement errors are reduced by adopting a systematic design methodology: 1) tilt errors are minimized through a careful selection of A/D convertor resolution and by making compensation on sensor bias and scale factor; 2) heading errors are reduced by cancelling out nearby ferrous distortions and making tilt-compensation on the magnetometer; 3) errors from gyroscope measurements are eliminated via the least squares algorithm and continuous corrections using orientation data at the steady-state position. Preliminary tests for low-g motion sensing show that the motion tracker can achieve less than \u00b10.5\u00b0 accuracy in tilt and less than \u00b11\u00b0 accuracy in yaw angle measurement with above-mentioned methods.",

Autonomous electrode positioning can significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of acute electrophysiolgical experiments aimed at basic understanding of the nervous system. Future miniaturized systems of this sort could also overcome some of the inherent difficulties in estabilishing long-lasting neural interfaces that are needed for practical realization of neural prostheses. The paper describes the robot's design and summarizes the overall structure of the control system that governs the electrode positioning process. We present a new sequential clustering algorithm that is key to improving our system's performance, and which may have other applications in robotics. Experimental results in macaque cortex demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

This natural interaction paradigm has few physical requirements, and thus can be deployed in many restrictive and challenging environments. We present an implementation of this scheme in the control of an underwater robot by an on-site human operator. The operator performs discrete gestures using engineered visual targets, which are interpreted by the robot as parametrized actionable commands. By combining the symbolic alphabets resulting from several visual cues, a large vocabulary of statements can be produced. An iterative closest point algorithm is used to detect these observed motions, by comparing them with an established database of gestures. Finally, we present quantitative data collected from human participants indicating accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme.",

Our goal is to utilize microorganisms as micro-robots in various applications by exploiting galvanotaxis (locomotor response to electrical stimulus) to actuate them. This requires automated motion control of swimming cells in 3-D space; in contrast, our previous work has been limited to 1-D or 2-D motion control on the focal plane. The system is capable of 3-D tracking and control of swimming cells by utilizing a high-speed vision system. A combination of \u201clock-on\u201d tracking within the focal plane and automated focusing using a Depth-From-Diffraction method executed at 1-kHz frame rate ensures both detailed measurement and a large working space. Experimental results for closed-loop 3-D motion control of Paramecium cells trapped within a small 3-D region demonstrate the possibility of using microorganisms as micromachines.",

Moreover this procedure can determine exactly the worst-case angular accuracy in translating fully-parallel manipulators under the influence of joint clearances. The relevance of the method is demonstrated by two application examples, that clearly demonstrate how kinematic properties, such as kinematic isotropy, are strictly related to position accuracy in mechanisms with joint clearances.",

With these new similarity measure functions, two similarity-based mean-shift tracking algorithms are derived. To enhance the robustness, the weighted background information is added into the proposed tracking algorithm. In order to solve the object deformation problem, the principal component analysis is used to update the orientation of the tracking object, and corresponding eigenvalues are used to monitor the scale of the object.

Operating in unknown environments current robots are prone to failure when hitting unforeseen rigid obstacles. Moreover, safety constraints are a major aspect for robots interacting with humans. In order to operate safely, existing robotic systems in this field are slow and have a lack of performance. To circumvent these limitations, a new robot joint with a variable stiffness approach (VS-Joint) is presented. It combines a compact and highly integrated design with high performance actuation. The VS-Joint features a highly dynamic stiffness adjustment along with a mechanically programmable system behavior. This allows an easy adaption to a big variety of tasks. A benefit of the joint is its intrinsic robustness against impacts and hard contacts, which permits faster trajectories and handling. Thus, it provides excellent attributes for the use in shoulder and elbow joints of an anthropomorphic robot arm.",

Multi-regression-based (MR-based) SS method is widely applied in dealing with key-variable selecting problems despite that it may not guarantee finding the best model based on its selected variables. However, the variables selected by MR-based SS may be adopted as the initial set of variables for the proposed NN-based SS to reduce the SS process time. The backward elimination and forward selection procedures of the proposed NN-based SS are both performed by the designated NN algorithm used for VM conjecturing. Therefore, the key variables selected by NN-based SS will be more suitable for the said NN-based VM algorithm as far as conjecture accuracy is concerned. The etching process of semiconductor manufacturing is used as the illustrative example to test and verify the VM conjecture accuracy. One-hidden-layered back-propagation neural networks (BPNN-I) are adopted for establishing the NN models used in the NN-based SS method and the VMconjecture models. Test results show that the NN model created by the selected variables of NN-based SS can achieve better conjecture accuracy than that of MR-based SS. Simple recurrent neural networks (SRNN) are also tested and proved to be able to achieve similar results as those of BPNN-I.",

Mechatronic systems for automatic and quantitative behavioural analysis are now of current use for neuroscientists to improve the results of their research. Most of these devices are portable and need to be used out of engineering labs by personnel with no technical expertise and without specific equipment. The calibration of the devices, that should be performed before each experimental session, is a typical issue to be faced. This paper deals with a new calibration method that is fast, simple and doesn't need other external measurement systems. It is based on the parallel use of an accelerometer and an optical sensor. The two signals are processed and compared to obtain the final calibration curve of the device.",

        "abstract": "In a virtual environment, a virtual maintenance process can be used to simulate real-world maintenance, and the efficiency of the simulation depends mainly on the assembly/disassembly task sequence. During the simulation, the path planning of mechanical parts becomes an important factor since it affects the overall efficiency of the maintenance system in terms of saving energy and time. Therefore, planners must consider the path-planning factors under constraints such as obstacles and the initial/final positions of the parts, as well as the assembly sequence, for example, the number of gripper exchanges and direction changes. We propose a novel optimal assembly algorithm that considers the assembly sequence of mechanical parts and the path-planning factors for a virtual maintenance simulation system. The genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal parts sequence to minimize the numbers of gripper exchanges and direction changes, as well as find a repulsive force radius using the potential field method to generate the shortest optimal distance for each part during the assembly operation. By applying the proposed algorithm to a virtual maintenance system, users can be haptically guided to the optimized assembly solution during mechanical parts assembly operations.",

        "abstract": "Target tracking has two variants that are often studied independently with different approaches: target searching requires a robot to find a target initially not visible, and target following requires a robot to maintain visibility on a target initially visible. In this work, we use a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to build a single model that unifies target searching and target following. The POMDP solution exhibits interesting tracking behaviors, such as anticipatory moves that exploit target dynamics, informationgathering moves that reduce target position uncertainty, and energy-conserving actions that allow the target to get out of sight, but do not compromise long-term tracking performance. To overcome the high computational complexity of solving POMDPs, we have developed SARSOP, a new point-based POMDP algorithm based on successively approximating the space reachable under optimal policies. Experimental results show that SARSOP is competitive with the fastest existing pointbased algorithm on many standard test problems and faster by many times on some.",

Most previous approaches to this problem employ non-probabilistic batch optimizations or delay the initialization of new beacons within a probabilistic filter until a good estimate is available. The contribution of this work is the formulation of RO-SLAM as an online Bayesian estimation process based on a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter. The conditional distribution for each beacon is initialized using an additional particle filter which, eventually, is transformed into an extended Kalman filter when the uncertainty becomes sufficiently small. This approach allows the introduction of new beacons without either delay or any special non-probabilistic processing. We validate our proposal with experiments for both simulated and real datasets.",

Due to safety and precision requirements, a combined position and force control is needed where the force calculation delivers the desired tendon force distributions. The high dynamic potential of the robot demands for realtime capable algorithms. To avoid steps in the motor torques the calculated tension force distributions also have to be continuous along the trajectory.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a SLAM algorithm based on FastSLAM 2.0 that maps features representing regions with a semantic type, topological properties, and an approximative geometric extent. The resulting maps enable spatial reasoning on a semantic level and provide abstract information allowing efficient semantic planning and a convenient interface for human-machine interaction. We present novel region features and an algorithm for estimating the feature parameters from uncertain measurements. In particular, we provide a means of estimating parameters even if the region feature is considerably larger than the robot's sensor range. Finally, we adapt the FastSLAM 2.0 algorithm to map the proposed features and show simulation-based results illustrating the capabilities of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a robot referee for \u201crockpaper-scissors (RPS)\u201d sound games; the robot decides the winner from a combination of rock, paper and scissors uttered by two or three people simultaneously without using any visual information. In this referee task, the robot has to cope with speech with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to a mixture of speeches, robot motor noises, and ambient noises. Our robot referee system, thus, consists of two subsystems - a real-time robot audition subsystem and a dialog subsystem focusing on RPS sound games. The robot audition subsystem can recognize simultaneous speeches by exploiting two key ideas; preprocessing consisting of sound source localization and separation with a microphone array, and system integration based on missing feature theory (MFT). Preprocessing improves the SNR of a target sound signal using geometric source separation with a multi-channel post-filter. MFT uses only reliable acoustic features in speech recognition and masks out unreliable parts caused by interfering sounds and preprocessing. MFT thus provides smooth integration between preprocessing and automatic speech recognition. The dialog subsystem is implemented as a system-initiative dialog system for multiple players based on deterministic finite automata. It first waits for a trigger command to start an RPS sound game, controls the dialog with players in the game, and finally decides the winner of the game. The referee system is constructed for Honda ASIMO with an 8-ch microphone array. In the case with two players, we attained a 70% task completion rate for the games on average.",

Normal and shearing forces applied to the sensing element were detected separately; when we examined the repeatability of the present tactile sensor with 1,000 loading-unloading cycles, the respective error of the normal forces was 2%. In the present paper, the three-axis tactile sensor is mounted on a robotic finger of three degrees of freedom to evaluate it for dexterous hands. A series of three kinds of experiments were performed. First, the robotic hand touches and scans flat specimens to evaluate the sensing ability of the friction coefficient. Second, it detects the contour of parallelepiped and cylindrical objects. Finally, it manipulates a parallelepiped case put on a table by sliding it on the table. Since the present robotic hand was able to perform the above three tasks with appropriate precision, we expected that it would be applicable to dexterous hands in subsequent studies.",

        "abstract": "Low dose rate prostate brachytherapy involves the permanent implant of radioactive sources into the prostate region using needles. We present a four-degree-of-freedom robot for prostate brachytherapy. The robot can translate a needle guide in the X-Y plane allowing for precise needle insertion along the Z direction. It can also rotate the guide about the X and Y axes, providing thus fine control over the needle insertion point and angle. The robot is light and mountable on a standard brachytherapy stepper. It is nonback-drivable providing a stable needle insertion direction when the power is off. It allows for manual control of each of the motor axes for fine positioning and has a quick-release mechanism for gross translation of the needle guide. We present the robot design and the performance characteristics of the prototype we built. The robot has an interface that allows the guide to be stepped through a complete treatment plan. A radiation oncologist implanted a phantom according to a treatment plan. Only 32 minutes were required for the complete implant that had 26 needles with 136 seeds. This demonstrates that, in spite of its increased flexibility of use, the robotic guide does not add to the procedure time.",

However, the space/time costs of building/retrieving the map database tend to be significant due to the high dimensionality. In addition, most of existing databases are working well only on batch problems, difficult to be built incrementally by a mapper robot. In this paper, a scalable localization algorithm is proposed for incremental databases of high dimensional features. The Monte Carlo localization (MCL) algorithm is extended by employing the exact Euclidean locality sensitive hashing (LSH). The robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated using the radish dataset.",

For the successful deployment of mobile sensors in the arctic, a reliable, fault tolerant, low-cost method of navigating must be developed. One aspect of an autonomous navigation system must be an assessment of the local terrain, including the slope of nearby regions. Presented here is a method of estimating the slope of the terrain in the robot\u2019s coordinate frame using only a single camera, which has been applied to both simulated arctic terrain and real images. The slope estimates are then converted into the global coordinate frame using information from a roll sensor, used as an input to a fuzzy logic navigation scheme, and tested in a simulated arctic environment.",

        "abstract": "A state estimation algorithm for rejecting noise and tracking bias in both real-time and post-processing applications of inertial measurement for intermittent motion is presented with experimental results for one-dimensional motion. The algorithm uses characteristics of the sensor noise to automatically recognize motionless periods and update the sensor's bias level without any dependency on application-specific parameters, frequency separation between the signal of interest and the sensor noise, or a high-level system model. Accumulated error in the velocity estimate is eliminated during periods of rest allowing useful velocity estimates to be obtained for arbitrarily long periods given reasonably frequent pauses in the motion. This significantly extends the length of time over which useful position estimates are obtained, especially for postprocessing applications. While derived and demonstrated in the context of inertial measurement, the algorithm can be used to reject noise and/or track bias drift for any signal where zero-level inputs occur intermittently and limits can be set on the noise amplitude, frequency, and bias drift rate.",

The proposed exoskeleton assists not only the motion of the user but also the perception of the user using sensors and a stereo camera. In the proposed power-assist method, the assisted user\u2019s motion can be modified based on the environmental information obtained by the sensors and the camera if problems are found in the user\u2019s motion. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent exoskeleton was evaluated by experiments.",

        "abstract": "In our earlier work, we showed that high stability of passive walking can be achieved by the global stabilization principle of fixed point. The principle has been established, providing that the state just after heel-strike exists at the next step. However, this condition may not always hold. The passive walker with knees can execute the leg-swing motion with no control, only by gravity effect. Unfortunately, while the walker takes a step forward, the swing leg may strike its toe on the slope at unsuitable point. Therefore, understanding of the mechanism of leg-swing motion is very important for assuring the next step. In this paper, we focus on the leg-swing motion of passive walking, and demonstrate the mechanism of the flexion and extension of knee joint of swing leg.",

Performance was tested with sinusoidal, triangular, trapezoidal and square waveforms, with average position error below 5% for all cases up to and including 25 Hz. Wing control and data capture were found to be of high accuracy, and measurements showed significant differences in wing performance with different flapping motions, indicating a need for continuation of this research.",

Stiffness of passive joint (joint without actuator) is temporally assumed as nonzero variable in the procedure and infinite stiffness can be treated. A simple parallel manipulator is used as an example to illustrate the process and its correctness. Then validity of the proposed approach is confirmed by comparing to FEA and conventional joint stiffness method. The total link compliance (inverses of total stiffness) calculated by the developed approach and its counterpart obtained by FEA model are very close. The total joint stiffness computed by the developed approach and its correspondence derived from conventional joint stiffness method are totally the same. Stiffness performance of parallel force redundancy mechanisms is evaluated. These results indicate that this scheme is feasible and effective.",

        "abstract": "Control of robotic systems subject to friction phenomena is an important issue since growing demands on accuracy require elimination of friction disturbances. If several models-e.g., friction model, rigid-body dynamics-are required to describe the behavior with high precision, each model requires the knowledge of numerous parameters (perhaps time-varying) as well as an increased number of signals and sensors. In order to tackle this double limitation, an observer is proposed, addressing both the problem of velocity reconstruction and friction estimation in the joint of an inverted pendulum. Firstly, an adaptive two-level velocity observer is defined to reconstruct relevant unmeasured velocities, using estimation of the friction model error. Secondly, the observer is exploited for model-based friction compensation. Capabilities of the algorithm proposed are demonstrated by means of experiments on the Furuta pendulum.",

Then, this approach uses a classical Cartesian space computed torque control with a fast exteroceptive measure, reducing the control schemes complexity.

Our sensor unit consists of an accelerometer, a 3-axis magnetic sensor, 2 gyroscopes and a miniature linear encoder. The fusion of data from the sensors is accomplished by extracting the gravity related term from the accelerometer and consistently calibrating the gyroscopes and linear encoder when the sensor unit is under static conditions. Using the fused sensors, we developed a complete motion processing system that consists of a gateway where the human kinematics modeling is embedded. A time divided multiple access wireless architecture is adopted to synchronize the sensor network at 100Hz. Experimental results show that the combination of the IMU and linear encoder produces a low RMS error of 3.5\u00b0 and correlation coefficient of 99.01%. A video showing the capture a performer\u2019s upper body motion is also realized.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many different robotic in-parallel structures have been conceived as six-component force sensors. In general, they perform well for most applications but, when accuracy is a must, two main limitations arise. First, in most designs, the legs are connected to the base and the platform through ball- and-socket joints. Although the dry friction in each of these joints can be individually neglected, the integrated effect of twelve such elements becomes noticeable. Second, dynamical measurements might not be very accurate because the natural resonance frequency of the used structures is quite low even for relatively small dimensions. This dynamical response can be obviously modified with a proper mechanical design, but this increases the complexity of the sensor. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a touch pad based on a 6-axis force sensor and shows how the above limitations degrade its behavior. Moreover, it is shown how using a tensegrity structure both problems could be alleviated because ball-and- socket joints can be substituted by point contacts and the resonance frequency of the structure can be controlled by adjusting the static tensions of the tendons.",

Our system, ADAPT (ADaptive and Automatic Presentation of Tasks), which was designed in accordance to current training guidelines for stroke rehabilitation, engages the patient intensively, actively, and adaptively in a variety of realistic functional tasks that require reaching and manipulation. A general-purpose robot simulates the dynamics of the functional tasks. Based on the subject\u2019s performance, a task scheduler adaptively selects a task and sets the task difficulty. The tool changer selects the tool corresponding to the selected task, a doorknob for instance.

The bail-out condition yields speed increases between 25x-50x on real data, with only slight degradation in accuracy.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This study describes a method of estimating the intrinsic parameters of a perspective camera. In previous calibration methods for perspective cameras, the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are estimated simultaneously during calibration. Thus, the intrinsic parameters depend on the estimation of the extrinsic parameters, which is inconsistent with the fact that intrinsic parameters are independent of extrinsic ones. Moreover, in a situation where the extrinsic parameters are not used, only the intrinsic parameters need to be estimated. In this case, an intrinsic parameter, such as focal length, is not sufficiently robust to combat the image processing noise, that is absorbed by both parameter types, during calibration. We therefore propose a new method that allows the estimation of intrinsic parameters without estimating the extrinsic parameters. In order to calibrate the intrinsic parameters, the proposed method observes parallel light pairs that are projected on different points. This is accomplished by applying the constraint that the relative angle of two parallel rays is constant irrespective of where the rays are projected. This method focuses only on intrinsic parameters and the calibrations are sufficiently robust as demonstrated in this study. Moreover, our method can visualize the error of the calibrated result and the degeneracy of the input data.",

This information can be used to employ adaptation techniques to compensate the deviation thus enabling robots to react flexibly to changes such as workspace variations or object drifts.

We describe methods to automatically determine a function describing this relation and how adaptive techniques can be integrated easily into robot programs without detailed knowledge provided by the programmer.",

The objective of trajectory planning is to minimise the uncertainty of the estimates and to maximise coverage. Trajectory planning is performed using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with an attractor incorporating long term goals. This planning is demonstrated both in simulation and in a real-time experiment with a Pioneer2DX robot.",

        "abstract": "Object recognition is a challenging problem for artificial systems. This is especially true for objects that are placed in cluttered and uncontrolled environments. To challenge this problem, we discuss an active approach to object recognition. Instead of passively observing objects, we use a robot to actively explore the objects. This enables the system to learn objects from different viewpoints and to actively select viewpoints for optimal recognition. Active vision furthermore simplifies the segmentation of the object from its background. As the basis for object recognition we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). SIFT has been a successful method for image representation. However, a known drawback of SIFT is that the computational complexity of the algorithm increases with the number of keypoints. We discuss a growing-when-required (GWR) network for efficient clustering of the key- points. The results show successful learning of 3D objects in real-world environments. The active approach is successful in separating the object from its cluttered background, and the active selection of viewpoint further increases the performance. Moreover, the GWR-network strongly reduces the number of keypoints.",

Features, detected by a biologically motivated attention system, are tracked over several frames to determine stable landmarks. Matching of features to database entries enables global loop closing. The focus of this paper is the active camera control module, which supports the system with three behaviours: i) A tracking behaviour tracks promising landmarks and prevents them from leaving the field of view. ii) A redetection behaviour directs the camera actively to regions where landmarks are expected and thus supports loop closing. iii) Finally, an exploration behaviour investigates regions without landmarks and enables a more uniform distribution of landmarks. Several real-world experiments show that the active camera control outperforms the passive system considerably.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative manipulation with multiple, independent agents can be complicated by changing dynamics as the agents come in and out of contact with the object they are manipulating. This effect, combined with uncertainty in the environment, leads to nontrivial issues in terms of guaranteeing convergence and task completion. Here we illustrate how these effects can be mitigated using a decentralized adaptive control technique based on hybrid control. Results are verified in an experiment using three agents.",

The proposed control method is capable of selecting the force control or position control, and smooth and quick switching according to the amount of the external force. The proposed method was applied to adaptive grasping by three-fingered hand which has 12 DOF, and the experimental results revealed that the smooth collision process and the stable grasping is realized even if the precise surface position, the mass and the stiffness are unknown. In addition a new algorithm determines the grasp force according to the \u201cslip\u201d measured with the tactile sensor and the viscoelastic media on the fingertip. This algorithm works at starting and stationary state, so the friction and mass unknown object grasping is realized by the effectual force.",

Continuous on-line estimation of the remote environment's impedance is performed, and is then used as a local model for haptic display control. Lyapunov stability of the proposed impedance adaptation law is demonstrated. A series of experiments is performed to evaluate the performance of this teleoperation control scheme. Two performance measures are defined to assess transparency and stability of the teleoperator. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed adaptive scheme, with respect to direct teleoperation, particularly in terms of increasing the stability margin and of significantly ameliorating transparency in the presence of large time delays. Experimental results, using a phantom omni as the haptic master device, support this conclusion.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive neural network controller is proposed to deal with the task-space tracking problem of manipulators with kinematic and dynamic uncertainties. The orientation of manipulator is represented by the unit quaternion, which avoids singularities associated with three-parameter representation. By employing the adaptive Jacobian scheme, neural networks, and backstepping technique, the torque controller is obtained which is demonstrated to be stable by the Lyapunov approach. The adaptive updating laws for controller parameters are derived by the projection method, and the tracking error can be reduced as small as desired. The favorable features of the proposed controller lie in that: (1) the uncertainty in manipulator kinematics is taken into account; (2) the unit quaternion is used to represent the end-effector orientation; (3) the \u201clinearity-in-parameters\u201d assumption for the uncertain terms in dynamics of manipulators is no longer necessary; (4) effects of external disturbances are also considered in the controller design. Finally, the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulation results on a PUMA 560 robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of actuators involving smart materials like piezoelectric, control of such materials becomes important. The existence of the inherent hysteretic behavior hinders the tracking accuracy of the actuators. To make matters worse, the hysteretic behavior changes with rate. One of the suggested ways is to have a feedforward controller to linearize the relationship between the input and output. Thus, the hysteretic behavior of the actuator must be first modeled by sensing the relationship between the input voltage and output displacement. Unfortunately, the hysteretic behavior is dependent on individual actuator and also environmental conditions like temperature. In this fast moving world, time is money and it is very costly to model the hysteresis regularly. In addition, the hysteretic behavior of the actuators also changes with age. Base on the studies done on the phenomena hysteretic behavior with rate, this paper proposes an adaptive rate-dependent feedforward controller with Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis operators for piezoelectric actuators. This adaptive controller is achieved by adapting the coefficients to manipulate the weights of the play operators. Actual experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive controller.",

In previous work, we have studied a modular reconfigurable robot (Slimebot) characterized by a spontaneous inter-module connection control mechanism. The modules of Slimebot connect to each other via a functional material which satisfies physical coupling between the ones. Here, we investigate the effect of heterogeneous inter-module coupling strengths on the adaptivity of Slimebot (here measured in terms of structural stability and locomotive speed). Simulation results show that a certain amount of heterogeneity improves the adaptivity of the system compared to the case of homogeneous modules. The only assumption that needs to be satisfied by the system with heterogeneous couplings is compliance to Steinberg\u2019s energy minimization theory.",

Past research has found that non-uniform sampling in the configuration space can significantly outperform uniform sampling; one important strategy is to bias the sampling distribution based on features present in the underlying workspace. In this paper, we unite several previous approaches to workspace biasing into a general framework for automatically discovering useful sampling distributions. We present a novel algorithm, based on the REINFORCE family of stochastic policy gradient algorithms, which automatically discovers a locally-optimal weighting of workspace features to produce a distribution which performs well for a given class of sampling-based motion planning queries. We present as well a novel set of workspace features that our adaptive algorithm can leverage for improved configuration space sampling. Experimental results show our algorithm to be effective across a variety of robotic platforms and high- dimensional configuration spaces.",

A modified structure of EMD is used to detect local optical flow. Six templates of receptive fields, according to the fly\u2019s vision system, are designed for simple ego-motion estimation. The results of several typical experiments demonstrate local detection of optical flow and simple motion estimation under specific backgrounds. The performance of the real-time implementation is sufficient to deal with a video frame rate of 350 fps at 256 x 256 pixels resolution. The execution of the motion detection algorithm and the resulting time delay is only 0.25 \u03bcs. This hardware is suited for obstacle detection, motion estimation and UAV/MAV attitude control.",

The resulting algorithm has some interesting properties: it converges quadratically, and in a finite number of steps. The method is validated against vanilla ICP, IDC (Iterative Dual Correspondences), and MBICP (Metric-Based ICP) by reproducing the experiments performed in Minguez et al. (2006). The experiments suggest that PLICP is more precise, and requires less iterations. However, it is less robust to very large initial displacement errors. The last part of the paper is devoted to purely algorithmic optimization of the correspondence search; this allows for a significant speed-up of the computation.

Owing to the simple structure, the proposed control is designed without requiring entire dynamics computation or complex algorithms. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed control are verified using a two degrees of freedom robot with stiff wall simulation. The proposed control realizes desired impedance accurately compared with other competent controllers throughout the task, i.e., free motion, constrained motion, and transition between these motions. Further, proposed control realizes four sets of desired impedance accurately. Thus, accuracy and robustness of proposed control is confirmed.",

Based on Gestalt rules the model segments the visual field into primitive groupings by evaluating both edge continuity and color similarity. An object representation is also built in long-term memory by using contour and color features. Dependent on the task and object representation, top-down modulation performs on pre-attentive features, followed by bottom-up competition. The object-based salience is evaluated by combination of pixel-wise salience within each pre-attentive grouping. The attended object is finally refined to reach an accurate representation in working memory. This model has been applied into two tasks of mobile robots: task-specific still and moving object detection. Experimental results in cluttered scenes are shown to validate this model.",

The special requirements include a lightweight and simple construction providing an active, strong, hermaphrodite, completely retractable connection mechanism with a 90 degree symmetry1 and a no-energy consumption in the locked state. The mechanism volume is kept small to fit multiple copies into a single modular robot unit and to be used on as many faces of the robot unit as possible. This way several different lattice like modular robot structures are possible. The large selection for dock-able connection positions will likely simplify self-reconfiguration strategies. Tests with the implemented mechanism demonstrate its applicative potential for self-reconfiguring modular robots.",

First, the analytical formula of the optimal joint velocity with minimum jump is derived, and its specific expressions for both all joint failure and certain single joint failure are presented. Then, the jump difference between the minimum jump solution and the least-norm velocity solution is mathematically analyzed, and the influence factors on this difference are also discussed. Based on this formula, a new fault tolerant algorithm with the minimum jump is proposed. Finally simulation examples are implemented with a planar 3R robot and a 4R spatial robot, and an experimental study is also done. Study results indicate that the new algorithm proposed in this paper is well suited for real time implementation, and can further reduce the joint velocity jump thereby improving the motion stability of redundant robots in fault tolerant operations. Also, the fewer the possible failed joints are, the more obvious the effect of this new algorithm is.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new approximate algorithm, LA- JIV (lookahead J-MDP information value), to solve oracular partially observable Markov decision problems (OPOMDPs), a special type of POMDP that rather than standard observations includes an \"oracle\" that can be consulted for full state information at a fixed cost. We previously introduced JIV (J-MDP information value) to solve OPOMDPs, an heuristic algorithm that utilizes the solution of the underlying MDP and weighs the value of consulting the oracle against the value of taking a state-modifying action. While efficient, JIV will rarely find the optimal solution. In this paper, we extend JIV to include lookahead, thereby permitting arbitrarily small deviation from the optimal policy's long-term expected reward at the cost of added computation time. The depth of the lookahead is a parameter that governs this tradeoff; by iteratively increasing this depth, we provide an anytime algorithm that yields an ever- improving solution. LA-JIV leverages the OPOMDP framework's unique characteristics to outperform general-purpose approximate POMDP solvers; in fact, we prove that LA-JIV is a poly-time approximation scheme (PTAS) with respect to the size of the state and observation spaces, thereby showing rigorously that OPOMDPs are \"easier\" than POMDPs. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical results via an empirical analysis of a benchmark OPOMDP instance.",

        "abstract": "We report our algorithmic development of the pframe problem that addresses the need of coordinating a set of p networked robotic pan-tilt-zoom cameras for n, (n \u226b p), competing polygonal requests. We assume that the p frames have almost no overlap on the coverage between frames and a request is satisfied only if it is fully covered. We then propose a Resolution Ratio with Non-Partial Coverage (RRNPC) metric to quantify the satisfaction level for a given request with respect to a set of p candidate frames. We propose a latticebased approximation algorithm to search for the solution that maximizes the overall satisfaction. The algorithm builds on an induction-like approach that finds the relationship between the solution to the (p \u2014 1)-frame problem and the solution to the p-frame problem. For a given approximation bound \u03b5, the algorithm runs in O(n/\u03b53+p2/\u03b56) time. We have implemented the algorithm and experimental results are consistent with our complexity analysis.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric robotic catapult based on the closed elastica. The conventional robotic catapults based on the closed elastica which the authors developed are the robotic elements for generating impulsive motions by utilizing a snap-through buckling. In a typical closed elastica, the two ends of an elastic strip are fixed to a passive rotational joint and an active rotational joint, respectively. Here we found that by adding only a range limitation to the passive rotational joint, compared to the conventional type, the deforming shape of the elastic strip becomes more complicated and 40% more elastic energy can be stored. Using this modification, we can develop a compact jumping robot which is able to leap over 700[mm] away and 200[mm] high.",

        "abstract": "Oblique-viewing endoscopes (oblique scopes) are widely used in minimally invasive surgery. The viewing direction of an oblique endoscope can be changed by rotating the scope cylinder, which enables a larger field of view, but makes the scope calibration process more difficult. The calibration is a critical step for incorporating oblique scope into computer assisted surgical procedures (robotics, navigation, augmented reality), though few calibration methods of oblique endoscopes has been developed. Yamaguchi et al. [1] first modelled and calibrated the oblique scope. They directly tracked the camera head and formulated the scope cylinder\u2019s rotation to the camera model as an extrinsic parameter. Their method requires five additional parameters to be estimated. In this work, we track the scope cylinder instead. Since the rotation of the camera head with respect to the cylinder only causes the rotation of the image plane, less parameter needs to be estimated. Experiments demonstrate the ease, simplicity and accuracy of our method.",

To this end, we have employed a decentralized control of a two-dimensional serpentine robot consisting of several identical body segments as a practical example. The preliminary simulation results derived indicate that the convergence of decentralized learning of locomotion control can be significantly improved even with an extremely simple learning algorithm, i.e., a gradient method, by introducing biarticular muscles compared to the one only with monoarticular muscles. This strongly suggests the fact that a certain amount of computation should be off loaded from the brain into its body, which allows robots to emerge various interesting functionalities.",

Our algorithm computes samples near the boundary of C-obstacle using local contact analysis and uses those samples to improve the performance of RRT planners in narrow passages. We analyze the performance of our planner using Voronoi diagrams and show that the tree can grow closely towards any randomly generated sample. Our algorithm is general and applicable to all polygonal models. In practice, we observe significant speedups over prior RRT planners on challenging scenarios with narrow passages.",

The pHRI model is based on geometric parameters that describe the combined human-robot system. It is applied in this paper to measured constraint forces from a pHRI experiment. The model is validated with the experimental data. The geometrical model parameters are identified from force and position measurements by non-linear parameter optimization. The attachment stiffness and the actual offsets between the exoskeleton and the human joints are estimated. For the tested subject, the stiffness reaches 222 N/m and constraint forces are shown to be in the order of plusmn 10 N. It is shown in this paper how an ergonomically designed wearable robot with passive compensation joints can reduce such interaction forces.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe a study of the human pilot control behavior in a planar goal directed flight task. The experimental data was collected using a miniature helicopter in an indoor flight test facility. To provide insight into the human's control behavior we developed a technique to extract extremal fields from the family of collected trajectories. These fields describe the spatial distribution of the vehicle states and cost- to-go, including their statistical distribution, which provides information about the variability of the pilot's control behavior over the task domain. Once extracted we can compare these fields to the value functions obtained from the task's equivalent optimal control problem. The comparison of the human-extracted and the computed value function maps suggests that on average, the human acts similarity to an optimal control policy. The results also suggests that a simple mass-point model used for our analysis, and motivated by the hypothesis that the pilot acts as a dynamic inverse controller, is sufficient to explain the pilot's performance at the planning level. We use these results to develop hypotheses about human planning and control processes and discuss their biological plausibility based on control-theoretic interpretations. We plan to use the new insights from this framework to help design more capable and versatile algorithms for autonomous vehicle control, as well as help design man-machine interfaces that enable a more natural link with the operator's internal control and planning processes.",

Sensor difference can be caused by: natural sensory data variations, minor variations in the task conditions, significant changes in the task scenario, or because the task requires a new set of actions to be executed. This paper presents a design for a programming by demonstration system that focuses on the important goal of capturing the intentions of the user during the demonstration. A gesture interface for a large touch screen is used during demonstration, to capture more clearly the user's intentions for robot movements, and also during a pre- playback session to capture the user's intentions regarding sensor data.",

        "abstract": "The lack of a parameterized observation model in robot localization using occupancy grids requires the application of sampling-based methods, or particle filters. This work addresses the problem of optimal Bayesian filtering for dynamic systems with observation models that cannot be approximated properly as any parameterized distribution, which includes localization and SLAM with occupancy grids. By integrating ideas from previous works on adaptive sample size, auxiliary particle filters, and rejection sampling, we derive a new particle filter algorithm that enables the usage of the optimal proposal distribution to estimate the true posterior density of a non-parametric dynamic system. Our solution avoids approximations adopted in previous approaches at the cost of a higher computational burden. We present simulations and experimental results for a real robot showing the suitability of the method for localization.",

We focus on pick-and-place operations, where a given object must be moved from its start configuration to its goal configuration by the robot. Given only the start and goal configurations of the object and a model of the robot and scene, our algorithm finds a grasp and a trajectory for the robot that will bring the object to its goal configuration. The algorithm consists of two phases: optimization and planning. In the optimization phase, the optimal robot configurations and grasp are found for the object in its start and goal configurations using a co-evolutionary algorithm. In the planning phase, a path is found connecting the two robot configurations found by the optimization phase using Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs). We benchmark our algorithm and demonstrate it on a 10 DOF mobile manipulator performing complex pick-and-place tasks in simulation.",

By using electromagnets to control the robot, the surface on which the robot operates need not be specialized, smooth, patterned, nor conductive. Two control methods, both based on periodic excitation of the robot, are attempted and compared. Controllable motion at speeds in excess of 2.8 mm/s, approximately 11 body lengths per second, is demonstrated. Teleoperated motion in two dimensions is shown, and the assembly of micro-particles is demonstrated underwater. Potential future applications include micro-scale manipulation, fabrication, and assembly of micro-systems.",

In the past, many algorithms were proposed based on a weighted pseudoinverse of the grasp map. In a different approach Stramigioli introduces a virtual object - called \"intrinsically passive controller (IPC)\". This controller distributes the generalized object forces using coupling springs whose weighting have an intuitive physical meaning. Even though this controller has been known for several years we will present the first experimental results for a four-fingered hand. Furthermore, the term virtual grasp map is introduced and a method to parameterize the stiffness parameters in order to obtain an effective object level stiffness and a damping design is proposed. An implementation of the IPC is tested on the DLR Hand II and its performance is analyzed by manipulating soft and stiff objects.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we study the inconsistency of EKF-based SLAM from the perspective of observability. We analytically prove that when the Jacobians of the state and measurement models are evaluated at the latest state estimates during every time step, the linearized error-state system model of the EKF-based SLAM has observable subspace of dimension higher than that of the actual, nonlinear, SLAM system. As a result, the covariance estimates of the EKF undergo reduction in directions of the state space where no information is available, which is a primary cause of inconsistency. To address this issue, a new \u201cFirst Estimates Jacobian\u201d (FEJ) EKF is proposed, which is shown to perform better in terms of consistency. In the FEJ-EKF, the filter Jacobians are calculated using the first-ever available estimates for each state variable, which insures that the observable subspace of the error-state system model is of the same dimension as that of the underlying nonlinear SLAM system. The theoretical analysis is validated through extensive simulations.",

The second control law is designed to try to obtain the global stability of the system. An analytical study of all control schemes when translational motion along and rotational motion around the optical axis is also presented. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the new control law with a behavior controller has a wider range of success than the other control schemes and can be used to avoid local minima and singularities.",

The purpose of our approach is to decompose the complexity of assembling and commanding a functional robot made of numerous simple modules (thousands to millions) by introducing a hierarchy of structure and control. The robots we describe incorporate anatomically-inspired parts such as muscles, bones and joints, and these parts in turn are assembled from modules. Each of those parts encapsulates one or more functions, e.g. a muscle can contract. Control of the robot can then be cast as a problem of controlling its anatomical parts rather than each discrete module. We show simulation results from experiments using gradient-based primitives to control parts of increasingly complex robots, including snake, crawler, cilia-surface, arm-joint-muscle and grasping robots. We conclude that this approach is promising for future many-modules systems, but is currently impractical on most existing platforms.",

Inspired by biological findings on the mammalian hippocampus, here, episodic memories retain a sequence of experienced observation, behavior, and reward. Incorporating multiple machine learning methods, this approach attempts to help reducing the computational burden of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem. In particular, proposed computational reduction techniques include: (1) abstraction of the state space via temporal difference learning; (2) abstraction of the action space by utilizing motor schemata; (3) narrowing down the state space in terms of goals through instance-based learning; (4) elimination of the value-iteration by assuming a unidirectional-linear-chaining formation of the state space; (5) reduction of the state-estimate computation by exploiting the property of the Poisson distribution; and (6) trimming the history length by imposing a cap on the number of episodes that are computed. Claims (5) and (6) were empirically verified, and it was confirmed that the state estimation can be in fact computed in an 0(n) time (where n is the number of the states), more efficient than a conventional Kalman-filter based approach of 0(n2).",

An n-bit Gray code is a kind of binary code whose adjacent code-strings differ only in one bit position. We introduce a specified Gray code, called an 'antipodal Gray code.' Since the n-bit antipodal Gray code has the additional property that the complement of any code-string appears exactly n steps away in the list, the spatial frequency (the width between the white and black stripes) of the antipodal Gray code-pattern is similar along frames. In this paper, we describe the limitations of structured light and the criteria for robust codes. We evaluate the original and antipodal Gray codes, and the experimental results show that the antipodal Gray code provides more robust and accurate results than original Gray codes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the capabilities of actuated models of the compass gait walker on rough terrain. We solve for the optimal high-level feedback policy to negotiate a perfectly known but qualitatively complex terrain, using a fixed low-level controller which selects a high-level action once- per-step. We also demonstrate that a one-step time horizon control strategy using the same low-level controller can provide performance which is surprisingly comparable to that of the infinite time horizon optimal policy. The model presented here uses a torque at the hip and an axially-directed impulsive toe-off applied just before each ground collision. Our results provide compelling evidence that actuated robots based on passive dynamic principles (e.g. no ankle torque) should inherently be capable of walking on significantly rough terrain.",

        "abstract": "Flagged manipulators are of interest because they are the only Stewart-Gough platforms for which a cell decomposition of their singularity loci is available. Here we show that the known family of such manipulators can be enlarged if one allows robot designs that, for some particular parameter values, become architecturally singular. Along this line, the most general 6-6 flagged manipulator is derived by applying a singularity-preserving transformation that leaves the relative position between two lines invariant. This transformation opens up the possibility of an \"equal cross ratios\" architectural singularity, which is shown to appear clearly in the factorization of the Jacobian determinant. From the 6-6 flagged manipulator, all the extended family of (possibly architecturally-singular) flagged manipulators is derived.",

The resulting potential field is constructed as a superposition of disparate functions for lane-keeping, road-staying, speed preference, and vehicle avoidance and passing. The construction of the vehicle avoidance potential is of primary importance, incorporating the structure and protocol of laned highway driving. Particularly, the shape and dimensions of the potential field behind each obstacle vehicle can appropriately encourage control vehicle slowing and/or passing, depending on the cars\u2019 velocities and surrounding traffic. Hard barriers on roadway edges and soft boundaries between navigable lanes keep the vehicle on the highway, with a preference to travel in a lane center.",

By applying this concept, this paper proposes an assemblable pursestring suture instrument (PSI). In gastrectomy, a purse string suture on the esophagus is made preparatory to the anastomosis of the esophagus and the small intestine with a circular stapler. A traditional PSI cannot pass through a trocar because of its T-shaped jaws and a PSI that can be used in laparoscopic surgery is highly desired, which motivates us to develop the assemblable PSI. We have developed two prototypes of the assemblable PSI. The experiment with the first prototype verifies that it can be assembled in the abdominal cavity. However it cannot generate a grip force enough to hold the esophagus. We propose a two-DOF unfolding linkage mechanism for the gripper of the second prototype. The in vivo experiment with the second prototype verifies that it can make a satisfactory purse string suture.",

        "abstract": "In laparoscopic surgery, surgeons perform surgery in the abdominal cavity by using only slender instruments that can be inserted through small diameter trocars. When it is difficult to perform surgery by using only instruments for laparoscopic surgery, they often make a 7\u20138 cm incision through which their hand can be inserted. Clearly this is invasive compared with complete laparoscopic surgery. This paper proposes an assemblable mechanical hand like a human hand that can be inserted through trocars. We already developed a three-fingered three-degree of freedom assemblable hand. The purpose of this paper is to develop an assemblable hand with more degrees of freedom that can grasp/push aside large internal organs and open membranes. The developed hand has three fingers with a total of five degrees of freedom. Its power transmission mechanisms and assembling method are completely different from those of the previous hand. The hand is assembled from body and finger units with an installation tool. The finger unit is fixed to the body unit with only one screw by using the installation tool. To drive the fingers, power is transmitted with cables, gears and shafts. Experimental results verify that the hand can be assembled in a closed space and that it can grasp and push aside various objects.",

First, we generate a gait by using tracking control to achieve the desired trajectory of the hip-joint angle, and show that there is a trade-off between efficiency and robustness through a numerical simulation. Second, we investigate the asymptotic stability of the gait from the mechanical energy balance viewpoint, and discuss the importance of the control input properties. Furthermore, we point out that there is a feedback in mechanical energy in the discrete walking system, and it is difficult to detect a stable 2-period gait.",

        "abstract": "Social robots face the fundamental challenge of detecting and adapting their behavior to the current social mood. For example, robots that assist teachers in early education must choose different behaviors depending on whether the children are crying, laughing, sleeping, or singing songs. Interactive robotic applications require perceptual algorithms that both run in real time and are adaptable to the challenging conditions of daily life. This paper explores a novel approach to auditory mood detection which was born out of our experience immersing social robots in classroom environments. We propose a new set of low-level spectral contrast features that extends a class of features which have proven very successful for object recognition in the modern computer vision literature. Features are selected and combined using machine learning approaches so as to make decisions about the ongoing auditory mood. We demonstrate excellent performance on two standard emotional speech databases (the Berlin Emotional Speech [W. Burkhardt et al., 2005], and the ORATOR dataset [H. Quast, 2001]). In addition we establish strong baseline performance for mood detection on a database collected from a social robot immersed in a classroom of 18-24 months old children [J. Movellan er al., 2007]. This approach operates in real time at little computational cost. It has the potential to greatly enhance the effectiveness of social robots in daily life environments.",

        "abstract": "For 3D dimensional inspection systems, point clouds measured on each viewpoint need to be processed for quality evaluation. Three steps are usually included in this process: filtering, registration, and error map generation. For quality control, small defects like dints and dents have to be kept in the point cloud. Therefore, a filtering algorithm is required to automatically remove outliers and keep dints/dents. Many filtering algorithm smooth the point cloud for better display, however, since the measured point cloud is used to represent the shape of the part, modification of any point's coordinates is not allowed because that will modify the error map. A point cloud filtering algorithm is developed using a link clustering algorithm to identify and remove outliers. Point cloud filtering is especially important in an iterative closest point (ICP)-based robot hand- eye calibration method because outliers will bring calibration errors into the calculated transformation matrix. With this technique, the cleaned point clouds can be directly transformed to a world frame for registration. This registration method has two advantages compared to feature-based registration methods: 1) the entire inspection process can be automatically executed, 2) avoid holes in point clouds caused by artificial markers. For error map generation, a point-to-plane distance is used in this paper which calculates the distance of a point to its closest triangle. The introduced automated inspection system had been implemented on a PUMA robot system. Experimental results are described in this paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a novel vision-based modeling and grasping system for three-dimensional (3D) objects whose shape and location are unknown a priori. Our approach integrates online computer vision-based 3D object modeling with online 3D grasp planning and execution. A single wrist-mounted video camera is moved around the stationary object to obtain images from multiple viewpoints. Object silhouettes are extracted from these images and used to form a 3D solid model of the object. To refine the model, the object's top surface is modeled by scanning with a wrist-mounted line laser while recording images. The laser line in each image is used to form a 3D surface model that is combined with the silhouette result. The grasp planning algorithm is designed for the parallel-jaw grippers that are commonly used in industry. The algorithm analyses the solid model, generates a robust force closure grasp, and outputs the required gripper position and orientation for grasping the object. The robot then automatically picks up the object. Experiments are performed with two real-world 3D objects, a metal bracket and a hex nut. The shape, position and orientation of the objects are not known by the system a priori. The time required to compute an object model and plan a grasp was less than 4 s for each object. The experimental results demonstrate that the automated grasping system can obtain suitable models and generate successful grasps, even when the objects are not lying parallel to the supporting table.",

        "abstract": "Robots based on parallel kinematic structures are known to have a small workspace compared to their installation space. To tackle this drawback a workspace enlargement approach using several workspaces going along with different working and assembly modes has been introduced in earlier publications. Robot structures designed for this approach are able to change their assembly modes. Using the drives' position feedback systems these assembly modes cannot be distinguished, which is necessary at least after startup of the robot control to correctly solve the structure's kinematic models. In this paper different approaches for a detection of the actual assembly mode of a kinematic structure are presented. Using the example of a Triglide-robot one of the approaches is demonstrated in more detail. It is based on a comparison of measured drive forces, necessary to hold the structure against gravity, with theoretical holding forces, calculated for all possible assembly modes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach.",

A computer tool developed executes the first step of a kinematic calibration, the choice of appropriate measurement points, using a priori knowledge about kinematic parameters, e.g. obtained with a measuring tape. This step is performed by intersecting the robot's kinematic workspace and the area surveyable by the measurement device and overlaying it with a grid of a desired number of measurement points. A simulation determines automatically whether the choice leads to an accurate calibration and outputs a trajectory readable by a robot controller. In a calibration experiment it is shown that the method gives results with an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration. The method allows non-experts to execute kinematic calibration of modular robots after reconfiguration thus making possible the use of modular robots in small size enterprises where such robots can answer the need for flexibility required with regularly changing tasks.",

        "abstract": "Image-based navigation paradigms have recently emerged as an interesting alternative to conventional modelbased methods in mobile robotics. In this paper, we augment the existing image-based navigation approaches by presenting a novel image-based exploration algorithm. The algorithm facilitates a mobile robot equipped only with a monocular pan-tilt camera to autonomously explore a typical indoor environment. The algorithm infers frontier information directly from the images and displaces the robot towards regions that are informative for navigation. The frontiers are detected using a geometric context-based segmentation scheme that exploits the natural scene structure in indoor environments. In the due process, a topological graph of the workspace is built in terms of images which can be subsequently utilised for the tasks of localisation, path planning and navigation. Experimental results on a mobile robot in an unmodified laboratory and corridor environments demonstrate the validity of the approach.",

        "abstract": "For almost two decades, Holk Cruse's leg coordination method has been used as a control basis for generating gaits in legged robots. His stick insect inspired method has been successfully implemented for a number of robots such as Robot I and Robot II, the TUM Walking Machine, Tarry II, and BILL-Ant-p. However, some engineers have had difficulties implementing the controller when trying to select robust mechanism influence weights that are immune to variations in starting pose and leg speed. Additionally, the coordination method can be overwhelming for low- computation capable microcontrollers preferred for small, untethered mobile robots. The Biologically-Inspired Legged Locomotion-Low computation Emergent Gait System (BILL-LEGS) was developed as a solution to some of these issues. This method borrows heavily from Cruse's original design with some modifications that allow it to be implemented on small, autonomous legged robots using simple microcontrollers. This paper describes the BILL-LEGS method and its performance during simulation. Additionally, data are presented that show its robustness to mechanism weight selection and its generation of stable gaits, independent of leg starting positions and leg movement speeds.",

In building and maintaining the roadmap, it takes path safety and network longevity into account, and therefore the roadmap adapts to dynamic dangers and evolves over time to increase network longevity. To find a safe path, a navigation field is propagated over the roadmap and the shortest path is computed. Simulation results show that as compared to existing methods our method finds a safe path with less communication cost, and in dense networks it generates smaller roadmaps.

The camera motion is restricted with regard to panning, tilting, and zooming. For small panning and tilting angles and small values of zooming difference, we assume that the apparent background motion occurring between two consecutive images can be approximated. We perform this using a scaling transformation followed by a translation. The vertical and horizontal histograms of two successive images are created and then matched using Hough transformations. The transformation parameters are determined when the vertical and horizontal histograms are matched. A multi-resolution Hough transformation is employed to reduce processing time.",

        "abstract": "Computationally efficient motion planning must avoid exhaustive exploration of configuration space. We argue that this can be accomplished most effectively by carefully balancing exploration and exploitation. Exploration seeks to understand configuration space, irrespective of the planning problem, while exploitation acts to solve the problem given the available information obtained by exploration. We present an exploring/exploiting tree (EET) planner that balances its exploration and exploitation behavior. The planner acquires workspace information and subsequently uses this information for exploitation in configuration space. If exploitation fails in difficult regions, the planner gradually shifts its behavior towards exploration. We present experimental results demonstrating that adaptive balancing of exploration and exploitation leads to significant performance improvements compared to other state-of-the-art sampling-based planners.",

Unlike most of the conventional mobile robots to move through opened spaces, the proposed robot has the ability of cultivating spaces by its own so as to be able to pass through. The key of the robot is the step structure on its head which enables it to open 10 mm gap up to 250 mm gradually under 600kg load by oil hydraulic power, synchronizing with the mobile behavior to go forward. Such kind of mobile method with jack-up function can be realized by switching two modes alternately discussed in this paper. The validity of the proposed design and behavior is experimentally verified by the developed model named Bari-bari-II.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the basic behavior acquisition of the robot head based on the multisensor integration. A robot head generally has several degrees of freedom (D.O.F.) of motions as well as different kinds of sensors. The head motion is planned based on all sensors\u2019 feedback. We take advantage of the Jacobian matrix to describe the differential relations between the sensor feedback and the motor motions. Hence, the relation between two sensors could be formulated by the two respective Jacobian matrices of both sensors to motors. Consequently, multisensor integration can be employed for better performance of the robot head. Experiments of basic behavior acquisition like gazing and head posture control are conducted. Performances of both basic behaviors of the robot head before and after multisensor integration are compared, which demonstrate that the proposed multisensor integration way improves the performance of control, robustness against some sensor\u2019s failure, and reduces the overall computation.",

This study presents one of the main preliminary results of the project which is balancing a basketball on a plate using a six degrees of freedom serial industrial robot based on pure haptic information. The Ball-On-Plate system has been one of the classical applications of control theory and many studies have been conducted on this issue. However, most of these studies employed vision systems to update the current state of the ball on the plate. In this paper, the concept of balancing a ball on a plate purely based on haptic information is discussed. The velocity of the basketball which rolls on a plate is estimated based on the force data measured by a force-torque (F/T) sensor mounted on the end-effector and the proposed control scheme brings the basketball back to a still standing on the plate. Experimental results are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of optimal control in continuous and partially observable environments when the parameters of the model are not known exactly. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a rich mathematical model to handle such environments but require a known model to be solved by most approaches. This is a limitation in practice as the exact model parameters are often difficult to specify exactly. We adopt a Bayesian approach where a posterior distribution over the model parameters is maintained and updated through experience with the environment. We propose a particle filter algorithm to maintain the posterior distribution and an online planning algorithm, based on trajectory sampling, to plan the best action to perform under the current posterior. The resulting approach selects control actions which optimally trade-off between 1) exploring the environment to learn the model, 2) identifying the system's state, and 3) exploiting its knowledge in order to maximize long-term rewards. Our preliminary results on a simulated robot navigation problem show that our approach is able to learn good models of the sensors and actuators, and performs as well as if it had the true model.",

Our approach named BOM-STMDS (Bearing-Only Mapping by Sequential Triangulation and Multi-Dimensional Scaling) first tries to estimate relative distances among the features, then finds two-dimensional coordinates of all features by using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and its enhancements. BOMSTMDS is different from the conventional BOSLAM methods based on Bayesian filtering in that robot self-localization is not mandatory. Another remarkable property is that BOM-STMDS is able to utilize prior information about relative distances among features efficiently. In the experiment, the performance of BOM-STMDS is shown to be competitive with a conventional EKF-based BOSLAM method.",

The novelty of our formulation is in the sensor model. In the original formulation, the lion can sense the precise location of the man at all times. In our version, which is inspired by mobile robots equipped with monocular vision systems, the lion can only obtain bearing information about the man's location.

        "abstract": "The time domain passivity framework is attracting interest as a method for granting stability in both telerobotics and haptic contexts; this paper employs this approach in order to introduce a novel concept, the Bilateral Energy Transfer for haptic telepresence. Loosely speaking, the Bilateral Energy Transfer is the straightforward transfer of energy between the two opposite sides of a teleoperation network, the master and slave robots. In an ideal telepresence scenario master and slave robots behave as rigid connected masses [1], and their power exchange is lossless; conversely, realistic scenarios include sources of energy leaks, i.e. elements that modify the power flows in the network. Moreover, if energy leaks have an active nature, they become source of instability for the system. This work isolates two sources of instability normally present in a teleoperation system, i.e. the delayed communication channel and robot velocity estimation based on digital position acquisition. These energy leaks are counterbalanced by two independent controllers, whose design is based on energetic consideration, and whose employment allows to achieve the Bilateral Energy Transfer. The presented arguments are sustained by simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes some novel research results on bilateral teleoperation of a flexible catheter in a constrained environment. The dynamics of the catheter in a constrained environment is highly nonlinear and is affected by a large number of factors such as friction, flexibility of the catheter, force of insertion, shape and size of the catheter, etc. As a result, the distal end of the catheter almost never follows the actuated end of the catheter which could cause fatigue to the clinician/user attempting to insert the catheter in a blood vessel. In addition, there is a time delay of up to 0.8 second before the distal end of the catheter advances after the near end is actuated. This delay is sufficient to cause instability in the control loop. We have developed a teleoperation framework using wave variables to perform robot- assisted catheter insertion in a constrained environment while reflecting the forces at the tip of the catheter to the clinician. Experimental results showing the effect of different factors such as the velocity and stroke length of insertion on the delays introduced in control loop and errors between the master and slave position are included. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to attempt to provide an understanding of the effects of various factors on the flexing of the catheter. In addition, master-slave insertion of a catheter instrumented with shape memory alloys (SMA) has also been performed and the results are included in this paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces biohybrid microsystems actuated by cardiomyocytes, such as microcantilever, microrobot, and micropump. The microfabicated biohybrid microcantilever can measure the contractile force of self-organized cardiomyocytes. The microcantilever is made of a biocompatible PDMS substrate, using a simple microfabrication technique and a specially designed 3D micromolding aligner. The contractile force of the cardiomyocytes makes a bending displacement of the microcantilever. Conversely, from the displacement, we can estimate the contractile of the cardiomyocytes on the microcantilever. The bending motion of the microcantilever can be applied as a biohybrid actuator of microrobot. We have developed a novel method to fabricate a crab-like microrobot that can actuate for a long period under a physiological condition. The microrobot consists of three separate front and rear legs which have a shape of the microcantilever. The performance of our crab-like microrobot was measured at an average velocity of 100 mum/s, and the estimated total distance it traveled was 50 m for a one-week period. Finally, a micropump actuated by the self-beating cardiomyocytes is fabricated and the pumping performance is demonstrated.",

Using a experiment protocol where subjects were asked to transit between control states with equal end-effector force but different stiffness requirements, we observed that (1) some subjects used the same muscle synergy for both conditions by maintaining the same synergy throughout the transition, and (2) other subjects used two different muscle synergies to execute two conditions by transiting from one synergy to another rapidly. We hypothesize that humans typically try to use the same muscle synergy to execute two tasks when it is possible to optimize on the simplicity and speed over energy. This is a different control strategy from the way robots have been controlled in the past, and it provides a new direction in controlling an anthropomorphic robotic hand.",

The key feature of this device is that the power generation adds only a minimal extra effort to the user. The knee-mounted devices accomplish this by selectively engaging power generation at the end of the swing phase when knee flexor muscles act to brake knee motion. Analogous to regenerative braking in hybrid cars, the device assists deceleration of each leg within each stride while generating electrical power. We developed a control system to engage/disengage power generation based on the measured knee kinematics during a gait cycle. Experimental results show that generative braking generated 4.8 plusmn 0.8 W of electrical power with a minimal increase in metabolic cost.",

The sensing algorithms allow each robot to estimate the shape and the orientation of the entire formation from readings of range sensors and a speedometer. The usage of GPS is avoided because each robot is able to estimate the relative position of the entire formation with respect to the boundary curve. Based on these estimates, we present a control law that allows the robot formation to achieve desired non-singular shape while following the boundary curve. We control the distance between the center of mass of the formation and the boundary curve so that it converges to desired value. Our control law also guarantees that there will be no collision between any pair of robots and no collision between any robot and the boundary curve.",

The averaging theory shows that for high frequency systems, only the mean aerodynamic forces and torques over a period affect the movement of the body. Therefore, a bounded nonlinear state feedback control, calculated using the averaged model, is applied to the time varying system in order to stabilize it at a desired position in hovering mode. The robustness of the control is tested with respect to the aerodynamic coefficient and to external disturbances.",

Here, we aim to understand the brain to the extent that we can make humanoid robots solve tasks typically solved by the human brain by using essentially the same principles. I postulate that this \u2018Understanding the Brain by Creating the Brain\u2019 approach is the only way to fully understand neural mechanisms in a rigorous sense. Even if we could create an artificial brain, we could not investigate its functions, such as vision or motor control, if we just let it float in incubation fluid in a jar. The brain must be connected to sensors and a motor apparatus so that it can interact with its environment. A humanoid robot controlled by an artificial brain, which is implemented as software based on computational models of brain functions, seems to be the most plausible candidate for this purpose, given currently available technology. With the slogan of \u2018Understanding the Brain by Creating the Brain\u2019, in the mid-80s we started to use robots for brain research (Miyamoto & Kawato 1988), and about 10 different kinds of robots have been used by our group at Osaka University\u2019s Department of Biophysical Engineering, ATR Laboratories, ERATO Kawato Dynamic Brain Project (ERATO 1996\u20132001), and ICORP Kawato Computational Brain Project (ICOPR 2004\u20132009).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents collaborative smoothing and mapping (C-SAM) as a viable approach to the multi-robot map- alignment problem. This method enables a team of robots to build joint maps with or without initial knowledge of their relative poses. To accomplish the simultaneous localization and mapping this method uses square root information smoothing (SRIS). In contrast to traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) methods the smoothing does not exclude any information and is therefore also better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models. The method proposed does not require the collaborative robots to have initial correspondence. The key contribution of this work is an optimal smoothing algorithm for merging maps that are created by different robots independently or in groups. The method not only joins maps from different robots, it also recovers the complete robot trajectory for each robot involved in the map joining. It is also shown how data association between duplicate features is done and how this reduces uncertainty in the complete map. Two simulated scenarios are presented where the C-SAM algorithm is applied on two individually created maps. One basically joins two maps resulting in a large map while the other shows a scenario where sensor extension is carried out.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the navigation of a three degrees-of-freedom mobile robot equipped with position and tactile sensors in an unknown planar environment. The paper focuses on the contact preserving segments of the robot's path. Any contact preserving path can trace a single or two simultaneous contacts. The paper establishes that motions involving two contacts induce two types of configuration-space curves: contractible loops representing passable gaps, and non- contractible loops representing impassable gaps. The paper identifies a generic class of contact preserving paths which requires only single-contact tracings with efficient transitions at double-contact configurations involving impassable gaps, and at triple-contact configurations involving both passable and impassable gaps. A preliminary tactile-sensor navigation algorithm based on these paths is illustrated with an example.",

Our small-size team consists of five executing wheeled robots with centralized, off-board perception and decision making. The decision making framework consists of a set of layered components, consisting of perception, evaluation and strategy, robot tactics and skills, and real-time navigation. In this paper, we present the strategy, action selection, and execution aspects of our architecture, with a focus on passing as an example of effective coordinated teamwork. The design enabled our robot team to score using multiple methods, from direct shooting up to 3D passes deflected in midair, resulting in a rich set of actions that were difficult for adversaries to counter. We provide several performance quantified claims supported by testing in our laboratory and in competition settings.",

This paper addresses the problem of designing such formation for object represented by a polytope in any finite dimensional workspace and for any specified number of pointed finger. Our goal is to characterize all the caging sets, each of which corresponds to a largest connected set of initial formations of fingers guaranteed to cage the object, up to maintaining a certain class of real-valued measurement induced by the whole fingers' formation below a critical value. In our previous works, such measurement is simply the distance between two fingers (the formation). We found that it is possible to apply the framework based on graph search from the previous works to broader classes of measurements. In this paper, we introduce two of measurements, called dispersion and concentration and propose a generalized approach to query and to report all caging sets with respect to a given dispersion or concentration.",

The vision network system is conceived to support a robot working in our daily human life environment: the system provides with visual observation of the dynamically changing situation surrounding the robot. Vision cameras are rather sparsely distributed to cover a wide area such as a block of a town. Position, view direction and range of view are the camera parameters of principal importance to be estimated by the proposed method. A set of calibration data for each distributed camera is provided by a group of mobile robots having a cooperative positioning function and visually distinguishable markers mounted on the body of the robot.",

However, there are a number of conundrums that must be addressed in designing such a robot. This work addresses two main limitations in the development of intelligent task-driven socially assistive robots: (i) recognition and identification of human gesticulation as a source of determining the affective state of a person, and (ii) robotic control architecture design and implementation with explicit social and assistive task functionalities. In this paper, the development of a unique task-driven robotic system capable of quantitatively interpreting human body language and in turn, effectively responding via task-driven behavior during assistive social interaction is presented. In particular, a novel gesture identification and classification technique is proposed capable of interpreting human gestures as semantically meaningful commands for inputs into a multi-layer decision making control architecture. The learning-based control architecture is then utilized to determine the effective and appropriate assistive behavior of the robot.",

Assuming n hard-finger contact with Coulomb friction model and based on central axes of the grasp wrench (i.e., force and torque), we develop a new necessary and sufficient condition for n-finger grasps to achieve force-closure. We demonstrate that a grasp is force-closure if and only if, its wrench can generate any arbitrary central axis. According to this condition, we reformulate the force-closure test as a linear programming problem without computing the convex hull of the primitive contact wrenches. Therefore, we present an efficient algorithm for computing n-finger force-closure grasps. Finally, we have implemented the proposed algorithm and verified its efficiency through some examples.",

Due to the stringent requirements associated with the applications of flexure-based precision mechanisms, it is necessary to be able to evaluate and certify the performance at the design stage, taking into account the possible sources of errors: such as fabrication tolerance and modeling inaccuracies in flexure joints. An interval-based method is proposed to certify whether various constraints are satisfied for all points within a required workspace. This paper presents the interval-based methodology and its implementation on a planar 3RRR parallel flexure-based manipulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the integration of several techniques for cooperative control of both tele-operated and autonomous redundant manipulators with overlapping workspaces. Motivating this research is a tele-operated surgical manipulator(s) supported by autonomous robot(s) that insert/remove items from the surgical workspace. The dynamic and unpredictable location of obstacles in a small workspace requires a complete strategy to avoid collisions when completing critical tasks and minimizes the need for user (i.e. the surgeon) intervention to make path planning decisions or resolve impasse situations. Three techniques are integrated into the decision-making for the manipulators: an intelligent and intuitive EEF velocity scaling, coordinated null-space optimization across affected manipulators, and collision detection. Central to all three techniques is an estimated time- to-collision formulation that combines distances between objects with their higher order properties, thus only objects currently moving towards each other are included in the collision avoidance techniques. The use of multiple techniques derived from the terms of a single metric results in a computationally efficient strategy for tele-operated and autonomous manipulators sharing the same workspace.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach for incremental learning of human motion pattern primitives through on-line observation of human motion. The observed motion time series data stream is first stochastically segmented into potential motion primitive segments, based on the assumption that data belonging to the same motion primitive will have the same underlying distribution. The motion segments are then abstracted into a stochastic model representation, and automatically clustered and organized. As new motion patterns are observed, they are incrementally grouped together based on their relative distance in the model space. The resulting representation of the knowledge domain is a tree structure, with specialized motions at the tree leaves, and generalized motions closer to the root. The tree leaves, which represent the most specialized learned motion primitives, are then passed back to the segmentation algorithm, so that as the number of known motion primitives increases, the accuracy of the segmentation can also be improved. The combined algorithm is tested on a sequence of continuous human motion data obtained through motion capture, and demonstrates the performance of the proposed approach.",

One promising approach is the use of relay nodes in wireless ad-hoc networks which require special routing protocols to provide a transparent communication network to the user. This work tests and compares four different existing ad-hoc routing protocol implementations with respect to aspects of mobile robot teleoperation. The reactive routing protocols ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR), the proactive optimized link state routing (OLSR) and B.A.T.M.A.N. are used in test scenarios to command a mobile robot via an ad-hoc network of several communication relay nodes. For all four ad-hoc routing protocols, the route reestablishing behavior is observed. In particular the packet loss and the duration of route reestablishing during test runs with real hardware in an outdoor environment are analyzed.",

We propose communication-aware motion-planning strategies, where each node incorporates statistical learning of communication link qualities, such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and correlation characteristics, into its motion-planning function. We show that while uncorrelated fading channels can ruin the overall performance, the introduced natural randomization can potentially help the nodes leave deep fade spots. We furthermore show that highly correlated deep fades, on the other hand, can degrade the performance drastically for a long period of time. We then propose a randomizing motion-planning strategy that can help the nodes leave highly correlated deep fades.",

Under the assumption that the signal is subject to multipath fading, we formulate this as a hybrid optimal control problem with penalties on tracking error, communication buffer length and control power. The problem is then solved using relaxed dynamic programming, resulting in control laws for the discrete switching sequence and the continuous control. We finally illustrate the results through simulations under non-ideal conditions, confirming that the system maintains a bounded buffer size and zero-mean tracking error.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, preliminary results in motor function improvement for four sub-acute stroke patients that underwent a hybrid robotic and traditional rehabilitation program are presented. The therapy program was scheduled for three days a week, four hours per day (approximately 60% traditional constraint induced therapy activities and 40% robotic therapy). A haptic joystick was used to implement four different operating modes for robotic therapy: unassisted (U), constrained (C), assisted (A), and resisted (R) modes. A target hitting task involving the positioning of a pointer on twelve targets was completed by the patients. Two different robotic measures were utilized to quantify the motor function improvement through the sessions: trajectory error (TE) and smoothness of movement (SM). Fugl-Meyer (FM) and motor activity log (MAL) scales were used as clinical measures. Analysis of results showed that the group demonstrates a significant motor function improvement with respect to both clinical and robotic measures. Regression analyses were carried out on corresponding clinical and robotic measure result pairs. A significant relation between FM scale and robotic measures was found for both of the analyzed modes. Regression of robotic measures on MAL scores resulted in no significance. A regression analysis that compared the two clinical measures revealed a very low agreement. Our findings suggest that it might be possible to obtain objective robotic measures that are significantly correlated to widely-used and reliable clinical measures in considerably different operating modes and control schemes.",

Based on the notice that humans outperforms robots with the contact motion, we follow two aspects of human manipulation: passive compliance and learning. As imitation of human\u2019s arm and learning, we use a robot arm with passive compliant joints and it learns a policy for peg in hole by the proposed gradient descending method. We present that the passive compliance provides with quick and stable learning as well as a slow control sampling time.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel liquid rate gyroscope using an electro-conjugate fluid in this study. The electro-conjugate fluid (ECF) is a dielectric fluid that works here as a functional/smart fluid generating a powerful jet flow (ECF jet) when subjected to high DC voltage. Using the ECF jet, we developed a liquid rate gyroscope based on the principle of a conventional gas rate sensor operated by Coriolis force. Because the ECF jet is generated only with a tiny electrode pair, the pumping part of proposed ECF gyroscope needs no mechanically moving parts, resulting in making the ECF gyroscope suitable for micro sensor compared to the gas rate sensor having a pumping mechanism inside. We fabricated a prototype of liquid rate gyroscope (40mm \u00d7 60mm \u00d7 t7mm) and confirmed its characteristics by experiment. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed liquid rate gyroscope. The scale factor of \u221229 mV/(\u00b0/s) is obtained with applied voltage of 4.5 kV.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents algorithms for concurrent deployment of multiple links of a gravity-assisted underactuated robot arm. The joints of the hyper-articulated arm have no dedicated actuators, but are activated with gravity. By tilting the base link appropriately, multiple unactuated links may be steered simultaneously to desired angular positions. This underactuated arm design was motivated by the need for a compact snake-like robot that can go into aircraft wings and perform assembly operations using heavy end-effecters. The dynamics of the unactuated links are essentially 2nd order nonholonomic constraints, for which there are no general control algorithms. We perform a controllability analysis to establish the feasibility of multi-link positioning using the available inputs, viz., the biaxial tilts of the base link. We propose a feed-forward control algorithm for simultaneous positioning of multiple links.We also propose an intermittent feedback control scheme to compensate for disturbances acting on the system.We built a 4 link prototype where the base is tilted using a Stewart Platform. The proposed control schemes are implemented on our prototype system. The experimental results indicate the efficacy of the control schemes.",

We make use of two metrics for characterizing the communication: the Fiedler value of the weighted Laplacian describing the communication interactions of all the robots in the system, and the k-connectivity matrix that expresses which robots can interact through k or less intermediary robots. At each step, we move in such a way as to improve the Fiedler value as much as possible while keeping the number of intermediary robots between the two robots of interest below a desired value. We demonstrate the use of this framework in a scenario where the hop-count constraint cannot be satisfied, but show that communication quality is maintained anyways.",

A distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed here, that detects possible non-cooperative agents. Previous work by the authors showed how single monitors embedded on-board the agents can detect non- cooperative behavior, using only locally available information. In this paper, we allow such monitors to share the collected information in order to overcome their sensing limitation. In this perspective, we show how an agreement on the type of behavior of a target-robot may be reached by the monitors, through execution of a suitable consensus algorithm. After formulating a consensus problem over non-scalar quantities, and with a generic update function, we provide conditions for the consensus convergence and an upper bound to its transient duration. Effectiveness of the proposed solution is finally shown through simulation of a case study.",

However it is difficult to consider directly unilateral constraints in such a framework. Unilateral constraints presents some strong irregularities (in particular at the level of their derivative) that prevents the insertion of unilateral-based tasks at the high-priority level of a hierarchy. In this paper, we present an original method to generalize the hierarchy-based control schemes to take unilateral constraint into account at the top-priority level. We develop our method first at the kinematic level then directly at the dynamic level using the operational space. The method is then validated on a various set of robots by realizing a visual servoing under the constraint of joint limits.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a vocal control method, based on forward and inverse models, to allow the anthropomorphic talking robot Waseda Talker No. 7 (WT-7) to produce various kinds of voices. The control parameters of the vocal cords on WT-7 are pressure, vocal cord tension and glottal opening, and the acoustic parameters are sound pressure, sound pitch and spectrum slope. The relationships among these parameters are complicated and difficult to model using conventional methods. Here we present a neural network (NN) control method. The learning process consists of creation of the NN forward model by back propagation methods and optimization of the inverse model using the forward model. In addition, a real-time auditory feed-back mechanism is used to reduce the error between the target and the generated acoustic parameters. Using this method, the control parameters can be adjusted to follow the target voice well.",

We discuss the motion control which accomplishes the trajectory tracking and other tasks, for example singular configuration avoidance, obstacle avoidance, etc., for the 3D snake robot. Features of the internal motion caused by the kinematic redundancy are considered and the dynamic model of the 3D snake robot is derived by introducing shape controllable points. By utilizing redundancy, we propose the controller which accomplishes the trajectory tracking as the main-task and several sub-tasks. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control scheme of a class of under-actuated systems with saturation using hierarchical sliding mode. This class with a single input and multiple outputs is made up of several subsystems. Based on this physical structure, the hierarchical structure of the sliding mode surfaces is developed as follows. The sliding surface of every subsystem is defined. Then the sliding surface of one subsystem is selected as the first layer sliding surface. The first layer sliding surface is used to construct the second layer sliding surface with the sliding surface of another subsystem. This process continues till all the subsystem sliding surfaces are included. The hierarchical sliding mode control law is deduced by using Lyapunov theorem. On account of saturation nonlinearity of the single input, asymptotic stability of the control system is proven by nonlinear small gain theorem. Parameter ranges of the subsystem sliding surfaces are also given. In practice, simulation and experimental results show the validity of this control method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Over the past four years, researchers at McGill University have developed a novel concept for studying dynamics and control of robotic grasping of objects in space. This problem arises in several applications - those currently under investigation include on-orbit servicing of satellites and removal of space debris. The main difficulty in experimental testing of such tasks is how to emulate the gravity-free environment of space here on the ground. A number of experimental facilities have been developed around the world to emulate the gravity-free conditions for space robotics research. For example, one popular approach involves floating the system under investigation - a robotic arm or a mock-up satellite - on air-bearings on a glass- covered or granite table. A few research establishments have invested in neutral buoyancy water tanks for three- dimensional, high-fidelity, albeit very costly, emulation of weightlessness. We have proposed a novel idea which involves using a small helium blimp to emulate a free-floating object. Although not perfect, this concept is simpler, less expensive to implement and is more suitable for 3D emulation of the gravity-free conditions of space. An experimental facility has been developed in the Aerospace Mechatronics Laboratory to implement this concept in an indoor laboratory setting. The main components of our facility are: a six-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator placed on a 3 m linear track, a spherical helium airship 6 ft in diameter, made neutrally buoyant and balanced, a Vicon six-camera system and associated control hardware and software interfaces. This video submission focuses on the control of the airship for satellite emulation.",

A simple algorithm, based on end-effector positions only, and a more sophisticated approach, incorporating also the body position of the operator, are presented and compared. Experimental results show that the latter algorithm performs better in most use cases.",

Setting the remote center of compliance at the shoulder will allow the exoskeleton to enact resistance training protocols that strengthen the rotator cuff and other joint musculature supporting the shoulder complex. The rotational kinematics for the shoulder are first derived, and then the torques applied at the shoulder are estimated using force sensors placed at the hand and elbow interfaces. Impedance and admittance control schemes are both developed for realizing isolateral strengthening exercises, and some preliminary experimental results are presented for implementation on an arm exoskeleton currently under development.",

In such distributed systems, there are many different sources and types of information, which need to be coordinated and combined effectively. The problem of cooperative anchoring is (roughly) the problem of, in a distributed system, determining which items of information refer to the same objects, and combining these items accordingly. In this paper, we define a general computational framework for cooperative anchoring inspired by work on conceptual spaces and (single-robot) perceptual anchoring. We also discuss an implementation of this framework which uses tools from fuzzy logic, and we present an illustrative experiment.",

The two main challenges are: (1) the actuators are unidirectional and experience saturation; (2) the hydrodynamics of the system are difficult to characterize. The primary theoretical contribution of the paper addresses the first challenge. We present a tracking controller and force allocation strategy that, despite actuator limitations, result in asymptotically convergent tracking for a certain class of reference trajectories. The primary practical contribution is the introduction of a set of adaptive control laws that address the second challenge by compensating for unknown, and difficult to measure, hydrodynamic parameters. Experimental verification of the controllers is presented using a 1:36 scale model of a U.S. Navy ship, inside the Naval Academy's unique 380 ft testing tank.",

        "abstract": "The minimum-time motion coordination is an important subject in robotics. In this study, the arrangement of several goals, which is treated as a traveling salesman problem (TSP), is incorporated to this subject. Although TSP has been studied in most previous works; but, solving a TSP that takes into account collision occurrences has not received much attention. This instance arises when a robot arm has to plan a sequence of reaching goals with other moving objects and/or other robot arms. If goals are also moving, then the problem becomes more complex since the end configuration of robot arm is undefined when reaching a goal. In this study, in particular, a 6-DOF robot arm has to reach several goals found in an object while a 1-axis positioning table simultaneously positions the object; thereby changing the goal locations and collision occurrences are inevitable. For the purpose of this study, the TSP is solved effectively with motion coordination and collision avoidance. The collision-free configurations of a robot arm when reaching goals are solved through motion coordination. Collision is avoided by exploiting the redundancy of the system. The above-mentioned solution is verified through a simulation utilizing an object with various numbers of goals and their positions, and is proven effective.",

        "abstract": "Biological inspired control approaches based on central pattern generator (CPG) have been used to generate human-like rhythmic locomotion for bipedal robots. CPG consists of several oscillators with coupled mutual inhibition. In the application of CPG to bipedal walking, one of the important problem is how to coordinate oscillators so as to achieve stable walking, since without proper coordination the rhythmic trajectory generated by CPG may fail to control the walking. To solve this problem, this paper presents a method of coordination between two oscillators using phase information. In the method, approximated phase values of the oscillators are derived and used as the feedback to coordinate two oscillators. Furthermore, coordination between multiple oscillators with different frequencies and phases has also been explored. This method is verified with a 2D robust walking controlled by four oscillators. Several walking scenarios are tested: adding external force, change walking frequency and step length during walking. Robust walking is achieved in our simulation.",

        "abstract": "The identification of the dynamic parameters of robot is based on the use of the inverse dynamic model which is linear with respect to the parameters. This model is sampled while the robot is tracking trajectories which excite the system dynamics in order to get an over determined linear system. The linear least squares solution of this system calculates the estimated parameters. The efficiency of this method has been proved through the experimental identification of many prototype and industrial robots. However, this method needs joint torque and position measurements and the estimation of the joint velocities and accelerations through the pass band filtering of the joint position at high sample rate. The new method bypasses the need to measure or estimate joint position, velocity and acceleration by using both Direct and Inverse Dynamic Identification Models (DIDIM). It needs only torque data at a low sample rate. It is based on a closed loop simulation which integrates the direct dynamic model. The optimal parameters minimize the 2 norm of the error between the actual torque and the simulated torque assuming the same control law and the same tracking trajectory. This non linear least squares problem is dramatically simplified using the inverse model to calculate the derivatives of the cost function.",

However, while laser scanners play an important role nowadays in the field of robotics, there are very few literatures that address the related issues such as mirror reflection and glass transparency. We introduce a sensor fusion technique to detect the potential obstacles not seen by laser scanners. A laser-based mirror tracker is also proposed to figure out the mirror locations in the environment. The mirror tracking method is seamlessly integrated with the occupancy grid map representation and the mobile robot localization framework. The proposed approaches have been demonstrated using data from sonar sensors and a laser scanner equipped on the NTU-PAL5 robot. Mirrors and windows, as potential obstacles, are successfully detected and tracked.",

The proposed fault tolerant control scheme is independent of fault detection, avoiding the chances of delay being introduced by the detection scheme on the fault tolerant control algorithm. Based on a unique joint by joint control approach, the proposed fault tolerant controller for each module neither requires motion states of any other modules, nor the link dynamics. The addition or removal of modules does not affect the control of other joint modules. Uncalibrated torque sensor signals are utilized and actuator performance degradation is considered. Faults are detected and corrective measures are taken at the module level. An observer-based fault detection algorithm is proposed by using a residual generated from the joint velocity estimation and measured joint velocity. Simulation and experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed fault tolerant control and fault detection schemes.",

The control law respects the limited sensing capabilities of the agents by allowing each agent to take into account only agents within its sensing radius in the controller implementation. In contrast to previous approaches to the problem, the proposed control law does not attain infinite values whenever an edge tends to be lost, and is therefore a bounded distributed control law. This is achieved via the use of decentralized navigation functions which are potential fields with guaranteed boundedness and are redefined in this paper in order to take into account the connectivity maintenance objective. We first treat the case of connectivity maintenance in a static initial position based communication graph and extend the results to the case of dynamic edge addition. The results are then applied to a formation control problem.",

We would also like the network to provide localization for mobile entities, allowing them to navigate and explore the environment. In this paper, we present a robust decentralized algorithm for mapping the nodes in a sparsely connected sensor network using range-only measurements and odometry from a mobile robot. Our approach utilizes an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in polar space allowing us to model the nonlinearities within the range-only measurements using Gaussian distributions. We also extend this unimodal centralized EKF to a multi-modal decentralized framework enabling us to accurately model the ambiguities in range-based position estimation. Each node within the network estimates its position along with its neighbor\u2019s position and uses a message-passing algorithm to propagate its belief to its neighbors. Thus, the global network localization problem is solved in pieces, by each node independently estimating its local network, greatly reducing the computation done by each node.

        "abstract": "Controlled mobility in wireless sensor networks provides many benefits towards enhancing the network performance and prolonging its lifetime. Mobile elements, acting as mechanical data carriers, traverse the network collecting data using single-hop communication, instead of the more energy demanding multi-hop routing to the sink. Scaling up from single to multiple mobiles is based more on the mobility models and the coordination methodology rather than increasing the number of mobile elements in the network. This work addresses the problem of designing and coordinating decentralized mobile elements for scheduling data collection in wireless sensor networks, while preserving some performance measures, such as latency and amount of data collected. We propose two mobility models governing the behaviour of the mobile element, where the incoming data collection requests are scheduled to service according to bidding strategies to determine the winner element. Simulations are run to measure the performance of the proposed mobility models subject to the network size and the number of mobile elements.",

We show that our variant of the series elastic actuator topology, the velocity sourced series elastic actuator, has well defined performance characteristics that make for improvements in safety and performance over conventional high impedance actuators. The improvement in performance was principally achieved by having tight velocity control of the DC motor that acts as the mechanical power source for the actuator. Results for performance are given for point to point transition times, while results for safety are based on empirical assessment of the head injury criterion during collisions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents coverage algorithms for mobile sensor networks in which agents have limited power to move. Rather than making use of a constrained optimization technique, our approach accounts for power constraints by assigning non-homogeneously time-varying regions to each robot. This leads to a novel partition of the environment into limited-range, generalized Voronoi regions. The motion control algorithms are then designed to ascend the gradient of several types of locational optimization functions. In particular, the objective functions reflect the global energy available to the group and different coverage criteria. As we discuss in the paper, this has an effect on limiting each agent's velocity to save energy and balance its expenditure across the network.",

As the fundamentals of bio/non-bio interaction processes are still poorly understood in the design of these devices, design tools and multiscale dynamics modeling approaches are necessary at the fabrication pre-project stage. This paper proposes a new concept of optimized carbon nanotube based servomotor design for drug delivery and biomolecular transport applications. The design of an encapsulated DNA-multi walled carbon nanotube (DNA@MWNT) actuator is prototyped using a molecular dynamics simulator. Then, a multiscale dynamics model from the mechanics point of view is proposed through an atomistic-continuum approach. Based on the analysis of the simulation results, a servo nanoactuator using ionic current feedback is simulated and analyzed for application as a drug delivery carrier.",

The finger design allows an adaptive grasp, including adaptation between fingers and phalanges with respect to the shape of an object. In addition, a self-lock is embedded in the metacarpophalangeal joint to prevent back driving when external forces act on the fingers. The thumb design also provides adaptation between phalanges and adds an intermittent rotary motion to the carpometacarpal joint. As a result, the hand can perform versatile grasping motions using only two motors, and is capable of natural and stable grasping without complex sensor and servo systems. Moreover, the adaptive grasping capabilities reduce the requirements of electromyogram pattern recognition, as analogous motions, such as cylindrical and tip grasps, can be classified as one motion.",

Based on this mechanism, a robot is designed and fabricated. The advantage of this robot is that it has mobile ability in the pipe and detecting function for inspection, while only one DC motor is installed. This results in low energy consumption and low cost to make. The robot propels itself in the pipe under a driving mode, and it is used for finding the defect of the pipe under a detecting mode. By switching these two working modes, the robot performs the inspection task without other extra DC motors. Moreover, a velocity change mechanism is introduced to adapt the change of the payload through adjusting the incline angle of the roller. The characteristics of this mechanism are analyzed by comparison with a classical screw drive robot and a direct drive robot. Finally, basic experiments are conducted to testify the mobility and efficiency of this robot.",

The machine is conceived to optimize the dynamic behavior in the interaction with the patient, basically in terms of low impedance when back-driven and low and isotropic inertial properties. Robot kinematics and dynamics are mathematically modeled and its dynamic properties are measured in the workspace in terms of inertia and acceleration capabilities. A method is used that is borrowed from the literature and is based on inertia and acceleration graphical representation through ellipsoids.",

        "abstract": "A robot joint with a variable stiffness unit is presented. The variable stiffness unit (VSU) is composed of a motor, two rings that consist of arc-shaped magnets separated by spacers, and a linear guide to change the cross-sectional area of the two rings. Angular displacement between two rings causes the magnets to generate torque, which acts as a nonlinear spring. The stiffness of the joint is varied via changing the overlapping area of the magnets. The VS J exhibits nearly zero stiffness, which enables robot manipulator to be harmless to humans at a wide range of operating speed. Connected to a joint motor in series, the stiffness by the VSU and the position of the joint are controlled independently by two motors. The torque generated by the magnets is analyzed. Using dynamics of the joint, feedback linearization method is adopted to control the VSJ. In addition to feedback linearization, an integral controller is augmented in order to reduce the effect of model uncertainty and disturbances.",

To date, nearly all designs and analyses of omnidirectional robots have considered the case of motion on flat, smooth terrain. This paper presents design constraints and guidelines for designing an omnidirectional mobile robot propelled by active split offset casters to be driven in rough terrain. Geometric constraints on wheel and linkage sizes are presented. The effects of terrain roughness and loss of wheel contact are analyzed. The vehicle design is optimized for kinematic isotropy, ability to maintain ground contact, traversable obstacle height, and maximum traversable distance over four diverse terrain types. The results are contrasted with a baseline design.",

The key to the design is selection of an appropriate actuator and a body frame that is simple and compact. SMA spring actuators are customized to provide the necessary work output for the microrobotic fish. The flexure joints, electrical wiring and attachment pads for SMA actuators are all embedded in a single layer of copper laminated polymer film, sandwiched between two layers of glass fiber. Instead of using individual actuators to rotate each joint, each actuator rotates all the joints to a certain mode shape and undulatory motion is created by a timed sequence of these mode shapes. Subcarangiform swimming mode of minnows has been emulated using five links and four actuators. The size of the four-joint propulsion system is 6mm wide, 40 mm long with the body frame thickness of 0.25mm.",

The novel mechanical design is described in detail. To analyse the design, a virtual prototype tool was developed with ADAMS software for multi-body dynamic motion simulations of the complete robotic system. The simulation results were used to study the robot's mobility characteristics through animations of different possible tasks that require various locomotion and manipulation capabilities. The ability to visualize and validate various robot mobility cases and to study its functionality in the early design stages aided in optimizing the design and hence dramatically reduce physical prototype development time and cost. The design optimization process also involved proper components selection. Moreover, the simulations enabled us to define motor torque requirements and maximize end-effector payload capacity for different robot configurations.",

This paper has two main contributions. First, we propose an automatic 3D face pose initialization scheme for our real-time tracker by adopting a 2D face detector and an eigenface system. Second, we use the proposed methods - the initialization and tracking - for controlling the orientation of an AIBO camera. We show how the changes in user\u2019s face movement can be imitated by the robot\u2019s camera and how it can be applied to map an indoor scene.",

Thus, they have to be able to report their current state and whereabouts in a way that is comprehensible for the user. Pure metric maps do not usually correspond to the understanding of the environment a user would provide. Thus, the robotic map needs to be integrated with the human representation. With our framework for Human Augmented Mapping we aim to deal with this issue and assume a guided tour as basis for an initial mapping process. During such a tour the robotic system needs to be able to detect significant changes in its environment representation - structural ambiguities - to be able to invoke a clarification discourse with the user. In this paper we present our approach to the detection of such ambiguities, that is independent from prior specification and training of particular spatial categories. We evaluate our method on data sets obtained during several runs in indoor environments in the context of a guided tour scenario.",

        "abstract": "One of the main roadblocks to Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) based nanomanipulation is lack of real time visual feedback. Although the model based visual feedback can partly solve this problem, its unguaranteed reliability due to the inaccurate models in nano-environment still limits the efficiency of AFM based nanomanipulation. This paper introduce a Real-time Fault Detection and Correction (RFDC) method to improve the reliability of the visual feedback. By utilizing Kalman filter and local scan technologies, the RFDC method not only can real-time detect the fault display caused by the modeling error, but also can on-line correct it without interrupting manipulation. In this way, the visual feedback keeps consistent with the true environment changes during manipulation, which makes several operations being finished without a image scanning in between. The theoretical study and the implementation of the RFDC method are elaborated in this paper. Experiments of manipulating nano-particles have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Welding is very difficult and dangerous for manual welders. The double hull structures found in ships are very hazardous environments, and as such the shipbuilding industry demands a safer, autonomous system to perform the welding rather than deploy manual welders. This paper describes the design of a new mechanism, called the 'Rail Runner', which is able to autonomously travel within the double hull structure. The design of a 3P3R serial manipulator for welding is also described in this paper. As an application of the 'Rail Runner' mechanism, we combine the 'Rail Runner' platform and the 3P3R serial manipulator for autonomous welding. The mechanical system of this robot is composed of a six-axes (3P3R) manipulator for achieving the welding function and a six-axes mobile platform for traveling within the double hull structure. This robot is able to autonomously travel between longitudinal structures, with transverse direction, and is capable of welding in double hull structures. The 'Rail Runner' can raise the efficiency of the welding process, as compared to manual welders. This in turn raises the international competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry.",

        "abstract": "Up to now, different kinds of musical performance robots (MPRs) and robotic musicians (RMs) have been developed. MPRs are designed to closely reproduce the motor skills displayed by humans in order to play musical instruments. From this approach, MPRs are used as benchmarks to study the human motor control from an engineering point of view and to understand better the human-robot interaction from a musical point of view. In contrast, RMs are conceived as automated mechanisms designed to create new ways of musical expression from a musical engineering point of view. Our research, at Waseda University, has been focused on developing an anthropomorphic flutist robot. Our research aims in studying the human motor control from an engineering point of view, understanding the ways to facilitate the human-robot interaction and proposing new applications for humanoid robot in musical terms. As a result of our research, the Waseda Flutist Robot No.4 Refined IV (WF-4RIV) has been developed. In a previous research, we focused on improving the mechanical system in order to enhance the clarity of the sound. However, we require performing further improvements to the control system in order to enable the robot to autonomously improve the quality of the sound during the flute performance. For this purpose, we proposed to implement an auditory feedback control system on the flutist robot. The proposed system is composed by a music expressive generator, feed-forward air pressure control system and a pitch evaluation module. From the experimental results with the WF-4RIV, we could confirm the improvements on the flute performance.",

In general, the processing quality of production equipment is not only related to its own manufacturing process but also affected by the process result of the previous equipment. Current proposed virtual metrology (VM) architectures are all applied to conjecture processing quality of a single stage. These single-stage VM architectures lack the ability of detecting the processing drift occur between different stages. This paper proposes a novel dual-stage VM architecture for quality conjecturing that involves two pieces of equipment. The architecture consists of two stages. In Stage I, the fore-equipment VM model is established as usual and then the rear-equipment VM model that depends on stage-I VM output is built in Stage II. An example of the proposed dual-stage VM architecture applied to two sets of TFT-LCD chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that this dual-stage VM architecture is promising for TFT-LCD manufacturing.",

The skin lesion can be prevented by daily skin care such as applying an ointment containing moisturizing factors several times a day. Aged persons, however, have difficulties in accessing the back and rely therefore on nursing care for such treatment. Unfortunately, in underpopulated areas such nursing care may not always be available. To tackle this problem, the concept of a skincare robot is proposed. The feasibility of the concept is then confirmed by designing a real skincare robot and by performing experiments for applying ointment on human\u2019s back. The robot developed is able to recognize the shape of the body, to plan the appropriate motion paths for the hand, and to execute the task without applying any excessive forces.",

        "abstract": "A modular and reconfigurable robot (MRR) with multiple working modes is developed for performing sophisticated tasks in uncontrolled environments. In the proposed MRR design, each joint module can independently work in active modes with position or torque control, or passive modes with friction compensation. Under a federated control system architecture, not only the MRR configuration can be reconfigured to adapt to various tasks, but also the working mode of each module, which can be switched on-line to satisfy the needs to carry out sophisticated tasks. Three joint modules have been developed, and the proposed method of passive working mode implementation with friction compensation has been tested experimentally. Door opening using a mobile manipulator consisting of the developed joint modules is studied as an application case study of the proposed multiple working mode MRR.",

The authors think that the emotion expression of a robot is effective in joint activities of human and robot. In addition, we also think that bipedal walking is necessary to robots which are active in human living environment. But, there was no robot which has those functions. And, it is not clear what kinds of functions are effective actually. Therefore we developed a new bipedal walking robot which is capable to express emotions. In this paper, we present the design and the preliminary evaluation of the new head of the robot with only a small number of degrees of freedom for facial expression.",

We first discuss the necessary combinations of active degrees of freedom of the plate for manipulating an object to arbitrary position and orientation on the plate, under the gravity. While there are nine patterns for choosing two active degrees of freedom of the plate, we show one of them can satisfy a sufficient condition for manipulating the object with the weakest coupling among object\u2019s motions and eventually leads to a simple manipulation scheme. A couple of experiments are shown to confirm the basic idea.",

To cope with these issues, a new compact design for high performance actuators specifically adapted for integration in robotic mechanisms is presented. This design makes use of a mechanical differential as its central element. Results shown that differential coupling between an intrinsically high impedance transducer and an intrinsically low impedance mechanical spring provides the same benefits as serial coupling, but in a more compact and simple design. This new actuator, named Differential Elastic Actuator (DEA), provides interesting design implementations, especially for rotational actuators used for mobile robot locomotion.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Control of nonlinear under-actuated systems is an area of ongoing research. In certain applications, under- actuated systems are unavoidable. For instance, a biped can not have an actuator between the foot and the ground. In industrial robots, under-actuation can minimize cost and dead weight. Differential flatness, if applicable, provides a systematic approach to plan and control feasible trajectories for such systems. Recently, the authors have formulated a philosophy to design under-actuated planar manipulators that are differentially flat [1]. The design philosophy has two sufficient conditions: (i) an inertia distribution scheme, and (ii) an actuator and torque spring placement scheme. The philosophy covers a broad range of n-DOF manipulator designs with the degree of under- actuation varying from 1 to n - 1 as opposed to under-actuation by one or two in most of the literature on under-actuated manipulators. This paper presents a 3-DOF planar manipulator designed on the basis of this philosophy and an experimental study of controllers based on its differential flatness property. It is demonstrated experimentally that the differential flatness based controllers are able to track the desired trajectories with small tracking errors even in the presence disturbances like friction, parameter uncertainty etc. It is shown via simulation that the errors observed in the trajectories can be attributed to the friction present at the unactuated joint.",

These mechanisms are composed of three identical legs ending with a spherical joint that is constrained to move in one of three equally spaced planes intersecting at one line. The closed-form solutions are based on the use of a not-well-known intuitive orientation representation. The latter, previously introduced under the name of Tilt-and-Torsion angles, is briefly described. Then, the interdependence between the Cartesian coordinates of the general class of parallel mechanisms is derived. Finally, the direct kinematics of the mechanisms are derived and numerical examples are presented.",

Using this representation, we derive a simple algorithm to numerically calculate forward kinematic maps, body velocities, and their derivatives. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales to large systems very well by using recursion to take advantage of the tree structure. Moreover, this method is less prone to modeling errors because each element of the graph is simple. The tree representation provides a natural framework to simulate mechanical dynamics with numeric computations rather than large symbolically-derived equations. In particular, the representation allows one to simulate systems in generalized coordinates using Lagrangian dynamics without symbolically finding the equations of motion. This method also applies to the relatively new variational integrators which numerically integrate dynamics in a way that preserve momentum and other symmetries. We show how to implement both integration schemes for an arbitrary system of interconnected rigid bodies in a computationally efficient way while avoiding symbolic equations of motion. We end with an example simulating a marionette; a mechanically complex, high degree-of-freedom system.",

In our study, the dismantling task would be achieved by proper collaboration between human workers and robots utilizing mobile arms, interface devices and software. This paper describes an overview of the proposed dismantling system as well as its requirements. The real experiments presented are focused on the disassembling task of a ceiling lamp panel (LP). In the disassembling task, a robot arm collaborates with the human worker holding the LP, accomplishing an assisting function. At first, in order to approach the robot to the holding position, the worker controls the robot using interface devices which are also evaluated in their usability aspect. Then, a laser pointer fixed at the robot\u2019s tip is used both as a guidance in the teleoperation process and as a first indicator of the holding position. As a second step toward the target, the control program applies model-based 3D object recognition techniques to calculate the final position. At this stage the information of an stereo camera, configured as an eye-in-hand system, is necessary. On the last part of the task, the robot reaches the estimated position automatically by using the results of its kinematic analysis. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a method for displaying feeling of cutting by a micro-scissors type haptic device is described. Micro-scissors are a type of surgical instrument, which is frequently used in brain surgery under a microscope. A prototype of a micro-scissors type haptic device consists of three components: an interface, a drive member, and force sensors. The interface is designed to equip features of a pair of micro-scissors and has a blade spring on its end. The drive member is composed of two DC-motors and two crank-lever mechanisms as decelerators. The force sensors are composed of strain gauges with H-slits, and implemented into each handle of the interface. For the aid of applying the force sensors to feedback control of cutting resistance forces, compensation for influence of a blade spring on the force sensors is added. Evaluation experiment for basic performance of the device is carried out, and the device is proved to be able to generate the computed cutting resistance forces. Virtual cutting experiment by six subjects is carried out, and it is proved that the device is able to display feeling of cutting.",

        "abstract": "Assume a swarm of mobile robots is in the act of transporting a large object in the plane, by applying unilateral forces to the perimeter of that object. We address the question of where a new robot, joining the group, should establish contact with the object to maximally improve the manipulation capabilities of the swarm. Inspired by the literature on multi-fingered hands, we synthesize a grasp by incrementally optimizing a grasp quality function. We adapt the quality function in several important ways to accommodate the distributed nature of the swarm problem. We show that the objective function is quasi- concave, which has important implications for uniqueness and scalability of the solution; and present a solution methodology. We apply the resulting framework to the example of a large swarm of autonomous tug boats towing a barge, taken from our larger research program.",

        "abstract": "We present a computational framework for automatic synthesis of decentralized communication and control strategies for a robotic team from global specifications given as temporal and logic statements about visiting regions of interest in a partitioned environment. We consider a purely discrete scenario where the robots move among the vertices of a graph. However, by employing recent results on invariance and facet reachability for dynamical system in environments with polyhedral partitions, the framework from this paper can be directly implemented for robots with nontrivial dynamics. While providing a rich specification language and guaranteeing the correctness of the solution, our approach is conservative, in the sense that we might not find a solution even if one exists. The overall amount of required computation is large. However, most of it is performed off-line before the deployment.",

A new challenge is the development of distributed algorithms that dynamically assign tasks to multiple agents, not relying on a priori assignment information. We address this challenge using market-based coordination protocols where the agents are able to bid for task assignment with the assumption that every agent has knowledge of the maximum number of agents that any given task can accommodate. We show that our approach always achieves the desired assignment of agents to tasks after exploring at most a polynomial number of assignments, dramatically reducing the combinatorial nature of discrete assignment problems. We verify our algorithm through both simulation and experimentation on a team of non-holonomic robots performing distributed formation stabilization and group splitting and merging.",

By continuously predicting a task's remaining duration, a proactive replanner is able to accommodate upcoming problems or opportunities before they manifest themselves. We have developed a kernel density estimation-based method for predicting a task's duration distribution as it executes, and have integrated our prediction algorithm with an existing planner based on heuristic repair. Our predictor allows the planner to anticipate problems, or opportunities, early enough to avoid, or take advantage of, them, resulting in executed schedules that score significantly higher on a number of metrics. We have evaluated a limited form of our approach in simulation, and present the results of our experiments. The addition of duration prediction resulted in a 11.1% improvement in average reward. Compared with an omniscient planner, this is 45.0% of the maximum possible improvement.",

The proposed actuator design overcomes these limitations and can serve as a high-bandwidth multifunctional artificial muscle. The dynamic characteristics of the actuator design are derived analytically and validated experimentally. A test system mimicking flapping flight is then used to illustrate the actuator dynamics.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to determine the stability of off-road vehicles moving on rough terrain. The measures of stability are defined as the maximum speed and acceleration under which the vehicle does not slide or tip over. To compute these stability measures, we propose a quasi 3D analysis by decomposing the vehicle dynamics into three separate planes: the yaw, pitch, and roll planes. In each plane, we compute the set of admissible speeds and acceleration for the planar vehicle model, contact model, and ground force constraints. The intersection of the admissible sets provides the total range of feasible speeds and accelerations along the vehicle's path, from which we obtain the stability margins. Numerical results for a vehicle traversing a simulated terrain demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "abstract": "An important problem in position-based visual servoing (PBVS) is to guarantee that a target will remain within the field of view for the duration of the task. In this paper, we propose a dynamic visibility checking algorithm that, given a parametrized trajectory of the camera, determines if an arbitrary 3D target will remain within the field of view. We reformulate this problem as the problem of determining if the 3D coordinates of the target collide with the frustum formed by the camera field of view during the camera trajectory. To solve this problem, our algorithm computes and compares the shortest distance between the target and the frustum with the length of the trajectory described by the target in the camera's coordinate frame. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be combined with path planning algorithms and, in particular, probabilistic roadmaps (PRM). Results suggest that our algorithm is computationally efficient even when the target moves in the vicinity of image borders. In simulations, we use our dynamic visibility checking algorithm in conjunction with a PRM to plan collision free paths while providing the guarantee that a specific target will not leave the field of view.",

        "abstract": "A unified formulation for deriving the equations of motion of constrained or unconstrained multi-body systems (MBS) in terms of (reduced) quasi-velocities is presented. In this formulation, the square-root of the mass matrix is used to transform disparate units into homogeneous units for all the quasi-velocities resulting the gauge invariance. We show that the square-root factorization of mass matrix and hence the quasi-velocities are not unique, rather they are related by unitary transformations. Subsequently, we show that a particular transformation leads to significant simplification of the dynamic modeling. The number of differentiations required to derive the equations of motion is reduced. This fact combined with the fact that the expression of the inverse of the mass matrix factorization can be given in a closed-form make the formulation suitable for symbolic manipulation or numerical computation. Moreover, in this formulation the equations of motion are decoupled from those of constrained force and each system has its own independent input (that is not attainable by other formulations). This allows the possibility to develop a simpler force control action that is totally independent from the motion control action. The structure of the formulation is also suitable for control purposes. Tracking control and regulation control of constrained multi-body systems based on a combination of feedbacks on the vectors of the quasi-velocity and the configuration variables (which may contain redundant variables) are presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Tumors in thorax region incur significant amount of motion and deformation due to respiratory and cardiac cycles. To accommodate this undesired movement, physicians incorporate a large standard margin around the tumor to delineate a Planning Target Volume (PTV), so that the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) receives the prescribed dose under any scenario. Consequently, a large volume of healthy tissue might be irradiated and sometimes it is difficult to spare critical organs adjacent to the tumor. For compensating this tumor motion, techniques such as breath-hold, gating, and Active Tracking and Dynamic Delivery (ATDD) are used. Although, ATDD is the most effective technique, it is the most challenging one. The ATDD can be accomplished in three different ways: adjusting the Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC), adjusting the couch, and adjusting the MLC and couch simultaneously. The first two techniques have been explored and/or implemented in practice. However, the third approach has not been investigated extensively. In this study, we have proposed a novel approach for ATDD that exploits the advantages of both the MLC (or MLC-bank) and the HexaPOD\u2122 robotic couch. In our proposed new approach, we have decomposed and allocated the tumor motion trajectory to the subsystems (MLC or MLC-bank and HexaPOD\u2122 robotic couch) based on their natural frequency domains using wavelet technique. The efficacy of the proposed method has been investigated by extensive computer simulation and the results are presented in this paper.",

It enables novice human operators to teach \u201cgood\u201d robot motions in a short period of time. First in this method, a human operator makes a robot manipulator sweep a volume by its bodies. The manipulator is equipped with a force sensor on its wrist and damping-controlled; the operator can move it freely by grasping its end-effector. The swept volume stands for a part of the manipulator\u2019s free space, because the manipulator has passed through the volume without collisions. Next, the obtained swept volume is used by a motion planner to generate a well-optimized path of the manipulator automatically. Finally, the planned motion is executed by the manipulator. Even non-skilled operators can generate robot motions with short cycle time by doing the above procedure. The effectiveness of our method is successfully demonstrated in teaching experiments for a comparison with other conventional methods.",

The paper proposes a rational criteria to select the action that minimizes the expected number of remaining position hypotheses, for the single robot case and for the cooperative case, where the lost robot takes advantage of observations coming from a sensor network deployed on the environment or from other localized robots. Efficiency in time complexity is achieved thanks to reasoning in terms of the number of hypotheses instead of in terms of the belief function. Simulation results in a real outdoor environment of 10.000m2 are presented validating the presented approach and showing different behaviours for the single robot case and for the cooperative one.",

        "abstract": "An efficient snow cleaning system is essential for optimal airport traffic during the winter term. In this paper an autonomous approach based on formation driving of cooperative mobile vehicles is described. The method is composed of two independent elements. The route scheduling part designs a time optimal plan for all robots and the formation driving method on the other hand guides the ploughs in an appropriate way during the shoveling. The bridge connecting both modules is a path generator, which creates a feasible trajectory for the reference points of the formations. Optimality for the covering task is achieved by splitting and reuniting the robot groups depending on the varying size of the runways. The robustness of the algorithm is increased by the ability to adjust the formations shape reactively on obstacle detection. The proposed method was verified by simulations in the environment of the International Frankfurt Airport as well as by hardware experiments in a test field.",

This method is valid for indoor and outdoor environments and not restricted to mobile robots. The proposed strategy is purely vision-based and uses as reference a set of prerecorded images (visual memory). The localization consists on finding in the visual memory the image which best fits the current image. We propose a hierarchical process combining global descriptors computed onto cubic interpolation of triangular mesh and patches correlation around Harris corners. To evaluate this method, three large images data sets have been used. Results of the proposed method are compared with those obtained from state-of-the-art techniques by means of 1) accuracy, 2) amount of memorized data required per image and 3) computational cost. The proposed method shows the best compromise in term of those criteria.",

        "abstract": "The ability to reliably navigate through the environment is an important prerequisite for truly autonomous robots. In this paper, we consider the problem of path planning in environments with non-rigid obstacles such as curtains or plants. We present an approach that combines probabilistic roadmaps with a physical simulation of object deformations to determine a path that optimizes the trade-off between the deformation cost and the distance to be traveled. We describe how our approach utilizes Finite Element theory for calculating the deformation cost. Since the high computational requirements of the corresponding simulation prevent this method from being applicable online, we present an approximation that uses a preprocessing step to determine a deformation cost function for each object. This cost function allows us to estimate the deformation costs of arbitrary paths through the objects and is used to evaluate the trajectories generated by the roadmap planner online. We present experiments which demonstrate that the resulting algorithm plans nearly identical trajectories compared to the method that relies on computationally intense simulations. At the same time, our approach allows the robot to quickly calculate paths in environments with deformable objects.",

People are defined as high-level tracks consisting of two legs that are found with little model knowledge. We extend the data association so that it explicitly handles track occlusions in addition to detections and deletions. Additionally, we adapt the corresponding probabilities in a situation-dependent fashion so as to reflect the fact that legs frequently occlude each other. Experimental results carried out with a mobile robot illustrate that our approach can robustly and efficiently track multiple people even in situations of high levels of occlusion.",

        "abstract": "Visual tracking algorithms have important robotic applications such as mobile robot guidance and servoed wide area surveillance systems. These applications ideally require vision algorithms which are robust to camera motion and scene change but are cheap and fast enough to run on small, low power embedded systems. Unfortunately most robust visual tracking algorithms are either computationally expensive or are restricted to a stationary camera. This paper describes a new color based tracking algorithm, the Adaptive Background CAMSHIFT (ABCshift) tracker and an associated technique, mean shift servoing, for efficient pan-tilt servoing of a motorized camera platform. ABCshift achieves robustness against camera motion and other scene changes by continuously relearning its background model at every frame. This also enables robustness in difficult scenes where the tracked object moves past backgrounds with which it shares significant colors. Despite this continuous machine learning, ABCshift needs minimal training and is remarkably computationally cheap. We first demonstrate how ABCshift tracks robustly in situations where related algorithms fail, and then show how it can be used for real time tracking with pan-tilt servo control using only a small embedded microcontroller.",

As the name implies, electroadhesion is an electrically controllable adhesion technology. It involves inducing electrostatic charges on a wall substrate using a power supply connected to compliant pads situated on the moving robot. High clamping forces (0.2\u20131.4 Newton supported by 1 square centimeter of clamp area, depending on substrate) have been demonstrated on a wide variety of common building substrates, both rough and smooth as well as both electrically conductive and insulating. Unlike conventional adhesives or dry adhesives, the electroadhesion can be modulated or turned off for mobility or cleaning. The technology uses a very small amount of power (on the order of 20 microwatts/Newton weight held) and shows the ability to repeatably clamp to wall substrates that are heavily covered in dust or other debris. Using this technology, SRI International has demonstrated a variety of wall climbing robots including tracked and legged robots.",

        "abstract": "Auditory capabilities would allow small robots interacting with people to act according to vocal cues. In our recent work, we have demonstrated AUDIBLE, an auditory system capable of sound source localization, tracking and separation in real-time, using an array of eight microphones and running on a laptop computer. The system is able to localize and track up to four sources, while separating up to three sources in real-time in noisy environments. Signal processing techniques can be quite computer intensive, and the question of making it possible for this system to run on platforms that cannot carry a laptop computer onboard can be raised. This paper reports our investigation of the appropriate compromises to be made to AUDIBLE's implementation in order to port the system on an embedded DSP (Digital Signal Processor) platform. The DSP implementation is fully functional and performs well with minor limitations compared to the original system i.e., limitations on sound source duration and on the number of sources that can be processed simultaneously. Results demonstrate that it is feasible to port AUDIBLE on embedded platforms, opening up its use in field applications such as human-robot interaction in real life settings.",

        "abstract": "By controlling complex robotic systems one often has to cope with the situation that different sub-systems are interfaced and controlled by different computers. In this paper the problem of coordinated control of such a system with distributed control structure is addressed. In particular one must handle the transmission delays in the communication between the different computers, which can be considered small but not negligible, since also small delays in the transmission of power variables violate the passivity and therefore may lead to instability. In this paper the wave variables concept is applied to handle the delays and is used in combination with a virtual inertia for designing a Cartesian compliance controller. Therefore, in particular the steady state properties of the wave variable based communication is of interest and leads for the case of small delays to the analogy with a flexible joint robot. In a second step the virtual inertia is eliminated in order to approximate the desired closed loop behavior better. Finally, some simple planar simulations are presented which validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In human and animal running spring-like leg behavior is found, and similar concepts have been demonstrated by various robotic systems in the past. In general, a spring-mass model provides self-stabilizing characteristics against external perturbations originated in leg-ground interactions and motor control. Although most of these systems made use of linear spring-like legs. The question addressed in this paper is the influence of leg segmentation (i.e. the use of rotational joint and two limb-segments) to the self-stability of running, as it appears to be a common design principle in nature. This paper shows that, with the leg segmentation, the system is able to perform self-stable running behavior in significantly broader ranges of running speed and control parameters (e.g. control of angle of attack at touchdown, and adjustment of spring stiffness) by exploiting a nonlinear relationship between leg force and leg compression. The concept is investigated by using a two- segment leg model and a robotic platform, which demonstrate the plausibility in the real world.",

Each individual is modeled as a Newtonian particle which interacts with obstacles, such as walls and other individuals. The UPEM technique estimates not only the general trend of the crowd as a whole, but also the specific states of each of the evacuees in the crowd. Furthermore, an approach to cooperative autonomous searching in crowded urban emergencies is developed using UPEM. A number of simulated searches in emergency evacuations highlight the efficacy of the technique in reducing the time required to detect targets and in increasing the level of safety for human evacuees.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable ability of humans and animals to perform dynamic maneuvers, such as a jump, is largely attributed to series-elastic elements in skeletal muscle. Both the degree of elasticity and the coordination of muscular contractions have been shown to impact jump performance. The objective of this paper is to use a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the control and actuator parameters of a series-elastic actuator (SEA), which is functionally analogous to skeletal muscle, in an articulated leg to produce the highest jump. Similar to skeletal muscle, the control and stiffness of the SEA is found by the GA to affect jump performance, yielding solutions with biological properties. In particular, the jumps evolved by the GA made use of the stretch and shortening cycle of the series-elasticity, which is commonly seen in nature to increase the force of an explosive movement. The model studied in this paper is of a prototype leg with series-elastic actuation. A detailed leg and actuator model was developed to include the important electrical and mechanical properties of the DC motors as well as the characteristics of the motor amplifiers.",

This paper introduces a new method for multiple task performance based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, where each task is considered as a separate objective function. In order to verify the effectiveness, the proposed method is applied to evolve neural controllers for the Cyber Rodent robot that has to switch properly between two distinctly different tasks: (1) protecting another moving robot by following it closely and (2) collecting objects scattered in the environment. Furthermore, the tasks and neural complexity are analyzed by including the neural structure as a separate objective function. The simulation and experimental results using the Cyber Rodent robot show that the multiobjective-based evolutionary method can be applied effectively for generating neural networks which enable the robot to perform multiple tasks, simultaneously.",

The recovery algorithm is very efficient because of an incremental Cholesky factorization approach and a natural reordering of the global state vector. Simulation results show that the computation cost of the SLSJF is much lower as compared with the sequential map joining algorithm using extended Kalman filter (EKF).

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The twin-pulse motion profile is still perhaps the simplest profile in existence for reducing residual vibration. Its primary drawback is that of narrow bandwidth, i.e., it is effective for attenuating only a very narrow range of frequencies about its design frequency. This has led to the inclusion of more pulses to improve robustness to frequency variation. However, one cost of adding pulses is extending the duration of the resulting motion. This paper presents several techniques whereby the basic twin-pulse motion profile can be expanded to reduce its frequency sensitivity while still preserving its advantages. These techniques include intentionally mis-aligning the null points of ideal twin pulses and a convolved boxcar function, then adding a trapezoidal profile component, finally culminating in what we term a misaligned boxcar / trapezoidal / twin pulse (MBC: TZ:TP) motion profile. This expanded profile and a basic twin-pulse profile were both evaluated on a ten-pendula system with natural frequencies varying over a range of nearly 10%. Simulation results showed an overall reduction of 97% with the expanded twin-pulse profile, and notably all ten frequencies were attenuated; only one frequency was attenuated with the standard twin-pulse profile. Experiments using a linear rail transport system and the ten pendula device validated the simulation. These expanded profiles retain the simplicity and short duration of the twin-pulse with increased robustness to frequency variations.",

We have developed four prototype robots based on four proposed methods for preliminarily announcing and indicating to people the speed and direction of upcoming movement of mobile robot moving on two-dimensional plane. We observed significant difference between when there was a preliminary-announcement and indication (PAI) function and when there was not even in each experiment. Therefore the effect of preliminary-announcement and indication of upcoming operation was declared. In addition the feature and effective usage of each type of preliminary-announcement and indication method were clarified. That is, the method of announcing state of operation just after the present is effective when a person has to judge to which direction he should get on immediately due to the feature that simple information can be quickly transmitted. The method of indicating operations from the present to some future time continuously is effective when a person wants to avoid contact or collision surely and correctly owing to the feature that complicated information can be accurately transmitted. We would like to verify the result in various conditions such as the case that traffic lines are obliquely crossed.",

We set up a packet reflector network at our collaborators' servers in order to able to perform the experiment with subjects located in the same laboratory. Subjects were blinded to which controller was used and received them in a randomized sequence. UDP data packets were used for haptic data communication and the packet transmission rate was maintained at 1000 Hz. Our experimental results show that the tuned PD controller gave the best performance in terms of position error and wave variables in terms of force.",

Constraints on size, weight, and onboard computing power, together with noisy underwater environment, have made underwater localization a particularly challenging problem. In this paper a comprehensive experimental study is presented on underwater acoustic ranging methods based on time difference of arrival (TDOA). Performances of four methods are characterized and analyzed, including threshold-crossing, tone-detection, correlation integral, and sliding-window fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. The study facilitates the understanding of capabilities and limitations of different underwater ranging methods and provides important insight into choice of hardware and algorithms for localization of networks of small aquatic robots.",

To attain the vibration suppression a vibration variable should play role in the control signal which drives the flexible manipulator. The proposed controller is based on the conventional PID control but the integral term is replaced with another one which mainly depends on the vibration of the end effector. Camera becomes an inherent part of space manipulator, using the MPID controller with the visual information recorded by the camera makes the strain measuring circuits and amplifiers unnecessary. This means reducing the hardware used in the control of flexible manipulator. The novelty of the results lies in the fact that the measurement of the rate of change in deflection, which is used as a vibration variable, has been done without the need of numerical differentiation. Experiments successfully demonstrate that using the visual data with an observer based on Kalman filer can achieve a noticeable damping of the end effector vibration of the flexible manipulator.",

The robot was designed with mobility in mind, so that cable spacers, suspension clamps and other obstacles, which so far have prevented the use of robots for inspection of high-voltage lines, would not hamper the operation of the machine. After careful considerations on mobility, the robot was designed, and a prototype was built.

        "abstract": "Simulation is frequently used in the study of multi-agent systems. Unfortunately, in many cases, it is not necessarily clear how faithfully the details of the simulated model represent the behavior of the physical system. Often, the effects of the environment in which the system is to be placed are even neglected entirely. Taking into account the entire system (including interactions with the target environment), establishing a clear hierarchy among multiple levels of modeling not only enhances the fidelity of the individual models, but also emphasizes the tradeoffs inherent in each. Understanding and leveraging the full spectrum of models allows the use of fast, high-level models for exploration in the parameter space, the results of which can be verified on more precise low-level models. Here, we demonstrate the generation of a family of models for a robotic wireless sensor network engaged in an acoustic detection task. Quantitative correspondence is shown between modeling levels and with the physical system.",

        "abstract": "Technologies to develop scaffolds with controlled pore layout and porosity have great significance in tissue engineering. As one method of scaffold fabrication, porogen leaching has been commonly used to control pore size, pore structure and porosity in the scaffold. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to fabricate 2D and 3D porous biodegradable scaffolds made of poly(L-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) by using magnetic sugar particles as porogens. First, ferrite micro/nano particles were encapsulated in sugar microspheres to make them magnetized. After sieving magnetic sugar particles, those diameter-controlled particles were attracted by a magnetic force to form an assembled template for polymer casting. A magnetic field with polka-dot pattern was also utilized to align particles on desired positions. After polymer casting and removal of the sugar template, spherical pores were generated inside scaffold. For future application in vascular tissue engineering, we extended the scaffold fabrication to straight tubular scaffolds by winding 2D porous sheets on sacrificial molds. The biocompatibility of the developed scaffold was confirmed by viable cells after 4-day culture.",

Environment measurement gel-microtool was fabricated by connecting the gel-microbeads impregnated with indicators in a microchip. In this paper, Bromothymol blue (BTB) and Bromocresol green (BCG) were employed as pH indicators. BTB and BCG have the different indicator range. Rhodamine B is temperature sensitive fluorescent dye and is used for temperature measurement. Gel-microbead is made by salting-out of hydrophilic photo-crosslinkable resin and is manipulated by optical tweezers. Moreover, gel-microbead is polymerized by UV illumination and connected to other gel-microbead under an electrolyte solution. The connection of gel-microbeads is performed by contact of gel-microbeads under UV illumination. Environment measurement gel-microtool with an arbitrary shape is fabricated by connection of the gel-microtool impregnated with arbitrary indicator. Multiple environments measurement gel-microtool included with several indicators is realized by assembly of the gel-microbeads impregnated with different indicators. Environment measurement is performed by detecting the color and the fluorescence intensity of each gel-microbead. We succeeded in the on-chip fabrication of the environment measurement gel-microtools such as circular pH measurement gel-microtool and wide range pH measurement gel-microtool in a microchip.",

Our method requires no explicit knowledge of individual motions applied during calibration procedure. Instead a set of motion constraints in the form of an inner-product is used to factorize sensor measurements into a calibration matrix (that represents intrinsic sensor parameters) and a motion matrix (that represents acceleration or angular velocity). These motion constraints can be collected quickly from a low-cost calibration apparatus. Our method is not limited to just triad configurations but also applicable to any coordination of more than three sensor elements. A redundant configuration has the benefit that all the calibration parameters including biases are estimated at once. Simulation and experiments are provided to verify the proposed method.",

The Fast Level Set Method is an efficient implementation algorithm of the Level Set Method and has been applied to several applications such as object tracking in video images and 3D shape reconstruction using multiple stereo cameras. In this paper, we implement the Fast Level Set Method on a PC cluster and develop a real-time motion capture system for arbitrary viewpoint image synthesis. To obtain high performance on a PC cluster, efficient load-balancing and resource allocation algorithms are crucial problems. We develop a novel optimization technique of load distribution based on the estimation of moving direction of object boundaries. In this technique, the boundary motion is estimated in the framework of the Fast Level Set Method, and the optimum load distribution is predicted and performed according to the estimated boundary motion and the current load balance. Experiments of human shape reconstruction and arbitrary viewpoint image synthesis using the proposed system are successfully carried out.",

By using the convex models and the new approximation method of the friction cone, our proposed algorithm can calculate the grasping motion within the reasonable time. For each grasping style used in this research, we define the grasping rectangular convex (GRC). We also define the object convex polygon (OCP) for the grasped object. By considering the geometrical relashionship among these convex models, we determine several parameters needed to define the final grasping configuration. To determine the contact point position satisfying the force closure, we use two approximation models of the friction cone. To save the calculation time, the rough approximation by using the ellipsoid is mainly used to check the force closure. Additionally, approximation by using the convex polyhedral cone is used at the final stage of the planning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by some numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "A recent trend in society is for young parents to ask for support in performing their childcare duties. Against this background and to promote the intermixing of parents and children and support information exchange between parents and nursery teachers, we developed the network-based interactive child-watch system called \u201cMeru-robo Digital Log system\u201d. It is composed of the \u201cAction Switch Platform (AcSP)\u201d (developed by NTT Laboratories) for exchanging dialog with a \u201cpersonal robot\u201d (called \u201cPaPeRo\u201d) (developed by NEC Corporation) by using cellular phone text messaging. A field trial showed that parents could send their intentions and receive information in a schedule-flexible manner via cellular phone text messaging. Since the robot in the nursery linked the parents to the teacher, their information exchanges did not interfere with the activities of the children. We report results of information exchanges using this system in two situations: parents are the same building (but not the same room as the children) and parents are in other locations going about their daily life. In the limited situation of children playing in a nursery, we found that parents in remote locations could get detailed information about their children\u2019s activities and expressions when desired via asynchronous communication.",

        "abstract": "Planning a precision grasp for a robot hand is usually decomposed into two main steps. First, a set of contact points over the object surface must be determined, ensuring they allow a stable grasp. Second, the inverse kinematics of the robot hand must be solved to verify whether the contact points can actually be reached. Whereas the first problem has been largely solved in a general posing, the second one has only been tackled with local convergence methods. These methods only provide one solution to the problem, even if many are possible, and depending on the initial estimation they use, they may fail to converge, which results in grasp re-planning in situations where it could be avoided. This paper overcomes both issues by providing a complete method to solve the kinematics of human-like hands. The method is able to find all possible configurations that reach the specified contact points, even when positive-dimensional sets of such configurations are possible.",

The finger is inspired by the designs of arthropod limbs, with integral strain sensilla concentrated near the joints. The use of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) allows for embedded sensors with high strain sensitivity and immunity to electromagnetic interference. The embedded sensors are useful for contact detection and for control of forces during fine manipulation. The application to force control requires precise and high-bandwidth measurement of contact forces. We present a nonlinear force control approach that combines signals from an optical interrogator and conventional joint angle sensors to achieve accurate tracking of desired contact forces.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an exoskeleton assistive hand that supports human hand and wrist activities by using user\u2019s bioelectric potential to control the exoskeleton movement. The exoskeleton has three active joints for an index finger, three active joints for combination of a middle finger, a ring finger and a little finger and two active joints for a thumb. It also has two passive joints between the index finger part and the combined part of the three fingers. Our proposed poly-articular tendon drive mechanism simulates a mechanical compliance of a human finger so that the exoskeleton could realize comfortable and stable grasping. This paper proposes a new mechanism \u201cdual sensing system\u201d and a new control algorithm \u201cbioelectric potential-based switching control\u201d so that the exoskeleton could synchronize wearer\u2019s hand activities without any force sensor. A tendon-driven mechanism and a dual sensing system enable wearer\u2019s fingers to move freely when they does need power assist but precise position control or force control. A bioelectric potential-based switching control enables the exoskeleton to augment their grasping force only when wearer\u2019s fingers generate a relatively large grasping force. A five-parallel-link mechanism is used to assist wrist activities of a wearer. Through experiments it is confirmed that the exoskeleton does not disturb a wear\u2019s pinch of a small object and that it augments grasping force for a heavy work.",

        "abstract": "From bird flocks to fish schools, animals move together and respond to their environment in remarkable ways; their natural collective motion patterns appear well choreographed and their collective survival strategies seem ingenious. Animal group behaviors inspire design for mobile multi-agent robotic systems, where demanding cooperative sensing tasks, such as exploration and sampling in an uncertain and dynamic environment, find their analogue in natural aggregation behaviors, such as foraging and feeding. However, bio-inspiration of this kind is not transparent because the natural \u201cdesign\u201d mechanisms are not well understood. The joint challenge is to explain the enabling mechanisms in animal groups and to define provable mechanisms for robotic groups. And this suggests an integrated approach: formal bio-inspired models and analysis tools derived to synthesize collective robotic motion and exploration can be used to evaluate design hypotheses for animal groups; subsequent revelations from the biology will in turn inspire new approaches for robotic systems. I will discuss mobile robot and animal networks using a common mathematical framework that builds on coupled oscillator dynamics and communication graphs. I will describe application to an adaptive ocean sampling network, a successful, recent field experiment in Monterey Bay, CA and an investigation of dynamics and decision-making in fish schools.",

A 1985 graduate of Princeton University, she worked for four years as an engineer in the electric power industry before getting her PhD in electrical engineering in 1994 at the University of Maryland. Her formal training is in control theory, a field in which mathematical foundations and tools are developed and applied to modeling, analyzing and synthesizing systems with behavior that can be governed, typically by feedback. In 2004 she was awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship as a marine roboticist. Feedback is ubiquitous in nature as well as in the engineered world. It refers to responsive behavior; the system repeatedly 1) measures how it is behaving and compares this to some reference or desired behavior, 2) computes a corrective action and 3) effects the desired change. Most recently Leonard's work focuses on the feedback and dynamics of collective motion. Working with ecologists and evolutionary biologists, she studies feedback mechanisms and dynamics in animal groups. In parallel she designs the means to enable groups of autonomous mobile robots to move in organized, coordinated patterns. Leonard co-leads an ambitious, collaborative project called Adaptive (Ocean) Sensing and Prediction (ASAP) which features a fleet of underwater robotic gliders equipped with sensors to measure the temperature and currents in the ocean and controlled to move as a group into patterns that yield the richest data set.",

The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we use the covariance feature to construct the likelihood function under the framework of particle filter. This likelihood captures the spatial and statistical properties as well as their correlation within representation of covariance. Secondly, different from the existing fusion approaches, our approach automatically realizes the fusion by sequential belief propagation, which uses message passing scheme to exchange information between color and infrared image. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using real visual tracking examples.",

        "abstract": "Extremum seeking has been successfully applied to source seeking for autonomous vehicles operating in two dimensions. In this paper we extend these results to vehicles operating in three dimensions. The extension is interesting for several reasons. First, there is the choice of vehicle models to consider, and second there is the question of what type of vehicle movement can be actuated. We present two control schemes which address these questions. The first scheme focuses on vehicles with a constant forward velocity and the ability to actuate pitch and yaw velocities. The second scheme explores vehicles which operate with a constant forward velocity and a constant pitch velocity and which are capable of actuating only the roll velocity. We present the vehicle models, details of the control schemes, and simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Wabot-House Research Laboratory is working on a project that will enable integrating robots into our everyday life. We believe that a \u201cstructured environment\u201d (SE) will be one of most important concepts for this project. An SE generally means that objects near people that have some database or intelligence provide certain information to those people. An SE will also assist robot recognition or movement planning. Now, we focus on a global positioning system (GPS), which is a global SE that gives users or robots their positions whenever and wherever they are outdoors all over the world. GPS will strongly support robot self-positioning. However, GPS has the problem that it cannot be used when the robots are indoors. To solve this problem, we experimentally mounted four pseudolites (\u2018pseudo\u2019 means imitated and \u2018lite\u2019 means satellite) in our laboratory and developed indoor GPS. The system worked well unless the robot was near the wall, where cycle slip often occurred. To examine the characteristics and reason for cycle slip, we measured the radio-wave environment in the laboratory. The first half of this paper introduces this system. The last reports results and findings about this experiment.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a new method for stereo visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) that works in unstructured, outdoor environments. Unlike other grid-based SLAM algorithms, which use occupancy grid maps, our algorithm uses a new mapping technique that maintains a posterior distribution over the height variance in each cell. This idea was motivated by our experience with outdoor navigation tasks, which has shown height variance to be a useful measure of traversability. To obtain a joint posterior over poses and maps, we use a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter: the pose distribution is estimated using a particle filter, and each particle has its own map that is obtained through exact filtering conditioned on the particle\u2019s pose. Visual odometry provides good proposal distributions for the particle pose. In the analytical (exact) filter for the map, we update the sufficient statistics of a gamma distribution over the precision (inverse variance) of heights in each grid cell. We verify the algorithm\u2019s accuracy on two outdoor courses by comparing with ground truth data obtained using electronic surveying equipment. In addition, we solve for the optimal transformation from the SLAM map to georeferenced coordinates, based on a noisy GPS signal. We derive an online version of this alignment process, which can be used to maintain a running estimate of the robot\u2019s global position that is much more accurate than the GPS readings.",

        "abstract": "One of the key tasks during the realization of probabilistic approaches to localization is the design of a proper sensor model, that calculates the likelihood of a measurement given the current pose of the vehicle and the map of the environment. In the past, range sensors have become popular for mobile robot localization since they directly measure distance. However, in situations in which the robot operates close to edges of obstacles or in highly cluttered environments, small changes in the pose of the robot can lead to large variations in the acquired range scans. If the sensor model used does not appropriately characterize the resulting fluctuations, the performance of probabilistic approaches may substantially degrade. A common solution is to artificially smooth the likelihood function or to only integrate a small fraction of the measurements. In this paper we present a more fundamental and robust approach which uses mixtures of Gaussians to model the likelihood function for single range measurements. In practical experiments we compare our approach to previous methods and demonstrate that it yields a substantially increase in robustness.",

Adaptation to uneven surfaces was observed with fiber elongations over 6 times the original height of the fiber. The unstructured sample exhibited 1.6 times as much adhesion as the fiber array sample for the flat punch indenter. However, fibrillar samples demonstrated up to 5.3 times as much adhesion as the unstructured sample for the hemispherical indenter.

We present the empirically derived limit surface for directional adhesive pads and illustrate its application to controlling the forces at the feet of a robot climbing on arbitrary slopes, including overhanging surfaces. For the directional adhesive patches that we have developed, the limit surface is convex, which permits efficient computation of the desired internal and external forces among the feet to maximize a safety margin with respect to disturbance forces on the robot. The limit surface also intersects the origin in force space, which enables efficient climbing without wasting energy in attaching and detaching the feet. These insights are applied to an experimental climbing platform demonstrating the proper use of directional adhesion and mimicking the climbing behavior seen in geckos.",

The answer to this fundamental question is only known analytically for a few planar mobile robots: the Dubins and Reeds-Shepp steered cars, the differential drive, and a particular omnidirectional robot. This paper explores the optimal trajectories for a general parameterized model of a mobile robot that includes each previously-studied vehicle as a special case. The model also allows characterization of the optimal trajectories for several other mobile robot designs for which the optimal trajectories have not been previously explored. The paper applies Pontryagin's Maximum Principle to the generalized robot to find necessary conditions that optimal trajectories must satisfy, and gives geometric interpretations of the conditions. We also present an algorithm that generates and classifies all optimal trajectories for a given design.",

Instead of representing the problem in the space of the many degrees of freedom of the robots and components involved in the assembly, we approach the problem in the space of valid configurations of the structure to be assembled. We use a graph-based framework to describe valid assembly configurations and feasible assembly steps. In addition to reasoning about kinematic feasibility of assembly steps, we consider the quality of potential configurations with respect to actions for the mobile robots. This method automatically repositions the structure in the workspace so that components to be assembled are most approachable. That is, the sequence of assembly and the position of the structure as it is assembled is chosen so as to maximize the area in which mobile robots can operate to perform their tasks. We present simulation results from a simple five-component assembly with and without the constraints of a narrow confined environment. Results show that our method allows over twice as much space available for robots during assembly. In addition, the plans preserve most of their free-space flexibility in tight workspaces where other planning approaches are left with only a few candidate solutions.",

Experimental results on a physical system for a three cable deployment show substantial reductions in energy consumption as compared to linear trajectories.",

However, as in many other hostile environments, substantial benefits in terms of workers safety and quality of inspection results could arise. This paper describes one of the latest initiatives toward that goal by presenting the design of a teleoperated robot called the \"LineScout\". This moving platform has the capacity to cross obstacles found on the line. Special care was taken early in the design phase to account for the context of power utility operation and to customize the geometric parameters to the specific features of the electric power network. The final prototype incorporates several key mechanical design features, which are briefly described. The LineScout is now validated, fully tested and ready to undertake pilot projects.",

The problem is an adaptation of the so-called hand-eye calibration, well known in robotics; however we name it the endoscope-tracking system calibration. By this way, we can relate the preoperative data (3D model and planing of the surgery), with the data acquired in real time during the surgery by means of the optical tracking system and the endoscope. Results obtained with our approach are compared with other approach which computes separately (in a two-step algorithm) the rotation and translation, and they are promising.",

In this study, we propose a method for detecting the slip of a grasped object using the force output of Center of Pressure (CoP) tactile sensors. CoP sensors can measure the center position of a distributed load and the total load applied on the surface of the sensor, within 1 ms. These sensors are arranged on the fingers of the robot hand, and their effectiveness as slip detecting sensors is confirmed in tests of slip detection during grasping. Finally, we propose a method for controlling grasping force to resist tangential force applied to the grasped object using a feedback control system with the CoP sensor force output.",

The basic idea is to use the hierarchical identification principle to decompose the identification model of the multivariable system into several submodels with smaller dimensions and fewer variables, and then to identify the parameter vector of each submodel. The analysis indicates that the parameter estimation error given by the proposed algorithm converges to zero under the persistent excitation. Also, the algorithm has much less computational efforts than the recursive least squares algorithm and is easy to implement on computer. Finally, we test the proposed algorithm by an example.",

To overcome these problems, in this article, we introduce a caster-like dynamics for controlling the multiple mobile robots in coordination. By using the caster-like dynamics, multiple mobile robots could handle a single object without using the geometric relations among them and the shape of the object. The effectiveness of the caster-like dynamics is illustrated through the video in which several types mobile robots handle a single object in coordination.",

        "abstract": "Haptic interactions with computer generated simulations has become almost routine in Virtual Reality (VR) applications. While general interaction requires six degrees of freedom, some haptic devices are designed with fewer degrees of freedom, and so have problems representing general haptic contact. In this work, we present a new approach to the control of a general haptic device, and extend this approach to compensate for missing forces in under-actuated haptic devices. We present an experimental implementation using one of the most popular devices, the PHANTOMreg, and show experimental results for a simple case of haptic interaction.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical control architecture that enables cooperative surveillance by a heterogeneous aerial robot network comprised of mothership unmanned aircraft and daughtership micro air vehicles. Combining the endurance, range, and processing capabilities of the motherships with the stealth, flexibility, and maneuverability of swarms of daughterships enables robust control of aerial robot networks conducting collaborative operations. The hierarchical control structure decomposes the system into components that take advantage of the abilities of the different types of vehicles. The motherships act as distributed databases, fusion centers, negotiation agents, and task supervisors while daughtership control is achieved using cooperative vector field tracking. This paper describes the overall architecture and then focuses on the assignment and tracking algorithms used once sub- teams of daughtership vehicles have been deployed. A summary of the communication, command, and control structure of a heterogeneous unmanned aircraft system is also given in this paper along with hardware-in-the-loop and software simulation results verifying several components of the distributed control architecture.",

Where a passivity-based task-space controller acts not only as a full-body force control module, but also as an important module to generate phasic joint patterns. The generated joint patterns are encoded into the paramaters of phase oscillators and form the synergy of the task. Then, similar and/or faster motions are synthesized by superposing the task space controller output and the oscillator output with the modified oscillator amplitudes and/or frequencies. We present some examples of whole-body motion synthesis on a human-sized biped humanoid robot including squatting, dancing and stepping while bipedal balancing.

        "abstract": "To be acceptable to human drivers, the motion of an intelligent robotic wheelchair must be more than just collision-free: it must be graceful. We define graceful motion as being safe, comfortable, fast and intuitive. In this paper, we quantify these properties of graceful motion, providing formal evaluation criteria. We propose a method for graceful motion and present implementation results for the task of driving through a narrow doorway, evaluated on a simulated model of the wheelchair. We use B-splines to specify an intuitive path to a goal, and then describe path-following control law for a differential- drive wheeled vehicle to follow that path within velocity and acceleration bounds. Existing methods typically respond to tight clearances with very slow motion which is not graceful. Our results show that, starting from a set of representative poses, the wheelchair passes through the door at near maximum speed, staying close to the mid-line of the doorway. The velocity of the wheelchair reflects the curvature of the path rather than the closeness of the door edges, so it can move smoothly, safely, and quickly through the doorway. Thus, this paper makes two contributions - first it introduces the concept of graceful motion and provides quantitative measures for the same, and second, it proposes a method for graceful motion and demonstrates it on a specific task.",

The main problem in high speed vision is the bottleneck phenomenon which limits the video rate transmission. The proposed approach circles the problem out by increasing the information density instead of the data rate transmission. This strategy is based on a rotary sequential acquisition of selected regions of interest (ROI) which provides space-time data. This acquisition mode induces an image projection deformation of dynamic objects. This paper shows how to use this artifact for the simultaneous measure of both pose and velocity, at the same frequency as the ROI's acquisition one.",

This strategy based on the homogeneous transformation matrices integrates, in a unified representation, the structural aspects of the robot, the reference trajectories based on motion capture, the measures given by the robot sensors, the locomotion constraints and the high-level control using desired trajectories modified at each sample time. This approach is applied on a biped with flexible feet walking with an average speed equal to 1.2 m/s.",

        "abstract": "A major issue in the field of human-robot interaction for assistance to manipulation is transparency. This basic feature qualifies the capacity for a robot to follow human movements without any human-perceptible resistive forces. In this paper we address the issue of human motion prediction in order to increase the transparency of a robotic manipulator. Our aim is not to predict the motion itself, but to study how this prediction can be used to improve the robot transparency. For this purpose, we have designed a setup for performing basic planar manipulation tasks involving movements that are demanded to the subject and thus easily predictable. Moreover, we have developed a general controller which takes a predicted trajectory (recorded from offline free motion experiments) as an input and feeds the robot motors with a weighted sum of three controllers: torque feedforward, variable stiffness control and force feedback control. Subjects were then asked to perform the same task but with or without the robot assistance (which was not visible to the subject), and with several sets of gains for the controller tuning. First results seems to indicate that when a predictive controller with open loop torque feedforward is used, in conjunction with force- feedback control, the interaction forces are minimized. Therefore, the transparency is increased.",

        "abstract": "Self-assembly is a process through which an organized structure can spontaneously form from simple parts. Taking inspiration from biological examples of self-assembly, we designed and built a water-based modular robotic system consisting of autonomous plastic tiles capable of aggregation on the surface of water. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the morphology (here: shape) of the tiles on the yield of the self-assembly process, that is, on the final amount of the desired aggregate. We describe experiments done with the real system as well as with a computer simulation thereof. We also present results of a mathematical analysis of the modular system based on chemical rate equations which point to a power-law relationship between yield rate and shape. Using the real system, we further demonstrate how through a single parameter (here: the externally applied electric potential) it is possible to control the self-assembly of propeller-like aggregates. Our results seem to provide a starting point (a) for quantifying the effect of morphology on the yield rates of self-assembly processes and (b) for assessing the level of modular autonomy and computational resources required for emergent functionality to arise.",

However, they have several drawbacks compared to wheeled vehicles such as stability problems, limited payload capabilities, violation of the flat world assumption, and they typically provide only very rough odometry information, if at all. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning accurate grid maps with humanoid robots. We present techniques to deal with some of the above-mentioned difficulties. We describe how an existing approach to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem can be adapted to robustly learn accurate maps with a humanoid equipped with a laser range finder. We present an experiment in which our mapping system builds a highly accurate map with a size of around 20 m by 20 m using data acquired with a humanoid in our office environment containing two loops. The resulting maps have a similar accuracy as maps built with a wheeled robot.",

The edge map is filtered using a feature selection algorithm. The filtered edge map is then projected onto an eigen space of human shapes to determine if the image contains a human.

Laser range data analysis groups data points with a novel graph cutting method. Therefore, it computes a belief to each cluster based on the evaluation of multidimensional features that describe geometrical properties. A person detection algorithm based on dense overlapping grid of Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is processed on the image area determined by each laser cluster. The selection of HOG features and laser features is obtained through a learning process based on a cascade of linear Support Vector Machines (SVM). A technique to obtain conditional probabilities from a cascade of SVMs is here proposed in order to combine the two information together. The resulting human detection consists in a rich information that takes into account the distance of the cluster and the confidence level of both detection methods. We demonstrate the performance of this work on real-world data and different environments.",

Most existing gait recognition algorithms assume that people have been tracked and silhouettes have been segmented successfully. Tacking and segmentation are, however, very difficult especially for articulated objects such as human beings. Therefore, we present an integrated algorithm for tracking and segmentation supported by gait recognition. After the tracking module produces initial results consisting of bounding boxes and foreground likelihood images, the gait recognition module searches for the optimal silhouette-based gait models corresponding to the results. Then, the segmentation module tries to segment people out using the provided gait silhouette sequence as shape priors. Experiments on real video sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The interaction between a human and a wheeled inverted pendulum involves a pulling or pushing force. This type of action is a severe disturbance for a wheeled inverted pendulum, as the wheeled inverted pendulum tends to maintain its initial position if there is no desired input. Thus, there are many possibilities for the wheeled inverted pendulum to be unstable as a result of interactions with humans. To solve this problem, the control algorithm of a wheeled inverted pendulum was designed to move in coordination with the external force of a human. This control algorithm is termed human-friendly motion control. It contains an optimal controller using a full-state feedback and a reduce-order disturbance observer. The disturbance torque from a human was estimated, and the estimated disturbance torque was used to generate a position reference for the human-friendly motion. This control algorithm keeps the wheeled inverted pendulum stable even when a severe disturbance is applied.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "There are two main limitations in the conventional robot-assisted spinal fusion surgery. Since the end effector in the state of art has a role of guiding the insertion pose of a screw only, i) convenience that can be obtained when the robot intervenes in the surgery more actively could be limited, ii) The insertion pose of a screw provided by the robots could be deteriorated by surgeon's resisting force since he should insert a screw with his own hand withstanding the large reaction force transmitted through the drilling handle. To overcome those limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach for spinal fusion, wherein the robot performs the spinal fusion using the equipped end effector following surgeon's guide. We developed a dexterous small-sized the end effector that can perform previous gimleting and screwing tasks into the vertebrae. A five-DOF robot body that has kinematically-closed structure guides the insertion pose of a screw and resists strong reaction force firmly during the screwing process. Based on admittance control framework, the surgeon controls the pose of the end effector precisely to compensate induced static/dynamic errors during the operation. A torque feedback method without torque sensor that suggests the haptic information about the status of drilling is also included. The performance of the CoRASS was verified by experiments.",

        "abstract": "The ability of a service or personal robot to learn new tasks from human teaching is important if it is to be multi-functioning and serve users a lifetime. Considering the vast variation of tasks, work environments, and nature of potential teachers or users who may not have knowledge in robotics, the problem of task teaching and learning can be difficult to achieve. Current methods of robot teaching and learning do not yet enable the robot to learn different types of tasks from the teaching by a general user. This paper presents a human-inspired method of robot task learning from human instructive hand-to-hand teaching. The method is novel in including an introduction of the complete task to the robot before task demonstration, a voting algorithm for segmenting the demonstrated task trajectory, and a Bayesian approach to assign partitioned trajectory segments to subtasks. Also, the proposed trajectory blending scheme can generate actual task paths in real-time to adapt learned tasks to new task setups.",

        "abstract": "The term scaffolding, with respect to human education, was first coined in the 1970ies, although the basic concept originates back to the 1930ies. The main idea is to formalize the superior knowledge of a teacher in a certain way to generate support for a trainee. In practice, this concept can be implemented as concrete as a cloze, which assists pupils in learning a foreign language, or it might be as abstract as a social environment, which facilitates learning of specific tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach towards robotic learning by means of such a scaffolding framework. In this case, the scaffolding is constituted by abstract patterns, which facilitate the structuring and segmentation of information during \u201cLearning by Demonstration\u201d. The methodology was applied to a real-world scenario of robot-assisted surgery.",

One key feature of all these elements in human coordination is their dynamic nature. We have developed a framework to provide a dynamic regulatory system for supporting coordination in human-robot teamwork. This framework supports the definition and functions of roles within teams, as well as the creation of subteams and the roles within them. It also serves to regulate communications in support of coordination. We have demonstrated our system with a team of two humans and five robots performing advanced coordination while trying to apprehend an intruder hiding on a cluttered pier. This work lays the foundation for human-robot coordination based on dynamic regulation.",

However, in some situations (varying from person to person), they may require assistance; hence, research is being carried out into the development of 'smart' wheelchairs. Predominantly, this research has been derived from the field of mobile robotics, focussing on creating autonomous systems, which unfortunately tend to treat the human as little more than a precious piece of cargo. Instead, the design should be based around each individual user's abilities and desires, maximising the amount of control they are given. In this paper, we look at how collaborative control techniques can be used to achieve this, offering the user help, as and when it is required. We then evaluate the effects of this collaboration, which is built by predicting user intentions and responding to these predictions with adaptable levels of assistance.",

Using a single joystick the operator controls walking and whole body manipulation along arbitrary paths for up to ten minutes of continuous execution. The robot grasps, walks, pushes, pulls, turns and re-grasps a 55kg range of loads on casters. Our telemanipulation framework changes reference frames online to let the operator steer the robot in free walking, its hands in grasping and the object during mobile manipulation. In the case of manipulation, our system computes a robot motion that satisfies the commanded object path as well as the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the robot. Furthermore, we achieve increased robot stability by learning dynamic friction models of manipulated objects.",

        "abstract": "Planetary exploration systems, operating under severe environmental and operating conditions, have thus far successfully employed carefully calibrated stereo cameras and manipulators to achieve desired precision in instrument placement activities. However, the environmental and functional restrictions imposed by the remote operation of semi-autonomous robots in a harsh planetary atmosphere for long periods of time limit the ultimate operational accuracy of this approach. This paper builds on an algorithm, referred to as Hybrid Image-Plane/Stereo (HIPS), developed to optimize the positioning accuracy of a manipulator. The HIPS method generates camera models through direct visual sensing of the manipulator end-effector. It estimates and subsequently uses these models to position the manipulator at a target location specified in the image-planes of a stereo camera pair using stereo correlation and triangulation. While positioning control of manipulation systems is important, orientation control of these systems is also crucial. Many planetary manipulation tasks being considered for the Mars Science Laboratory rover, due to launch in 2009, and subsequent missions, will require precise orientation control of manipulators. This paper studies the effect of using HIPS models to control the position and orientation of manipulator end-effector. As seen in previous position control experiments, the static version of the HIPS technique reduces position error by almost an order of magnitude. This paper additionally shows that orientation error is reduced by almost a factor of two.",

Assuming a 2D map of the robot's surroundings and a set of navigation nodes between which it is free to move, we show how to compute an efficient sensing plan that allows the robot's camera to cover the environment, while obeying restrictions on the different objects' maximum and minimum viewing distances.

The hybrid simulator includes a 14-degrees-of-freedom (14-DOF) dual-arm robot and 9-DOF motion table. A hybrid simulator has a great advantage in simulating complicated collision with multiple contacts, because it is difficult for a numerical simulation to get reliable and accurate results of such complicated phenomena. In this paper, the system architecture and the motion planning for three motion tables are presented. Two experiments are performed to confirm the basic motion and simulate a free-flying dualarm space robot colliding with a floating object. The feasibility of robot operation is discussed from showing the position and force data obtained in the motion simulation.",

Rather than evaluating individual sample paths or relying on point estimates of state, hyper-particle filtering maintains at each stage an approximation of the full probability density function over the belief space (i.e., the space of possible posterior densities for the state estimate). By applying hyper-particle filtering, control policies can be more more accurately assessed and can be evaluated from one stage to the next. These aspects of hyper-particle filtering may prove to be useful when determining policies, not just when evaluating them.",

        "abstract": "Tactile display is a technology that gives an artificial sense of touch to operators of information terminals or master-slave systems. The generation of tactile stimuli in response to the hand movements of the operators is associated with active touch and is considered to be one of the effective display methods, however which inevitably causes delayed tactile feedbacks from tactile displays. The knowledge of the detection threshold of system latency between the hand movements and the stimuli is helpful in designing the tactile displays. In this study, the identification of the thresholds through psychophysical experiments of 13 participants revealed two types of thresholds. One was the time-delay at which the participants observed the existence of latency. The other was the minimal time-delay that could affect the subjective feelings of the operators while they were not conscious of the latency. The means of the thresholds were 41 ms and 59 ms, respectively. The participants reported that the time-delay stimuli caused various changes in their subjective feelings. The empirical results suggest that the two types of thresholds depend on different sensory processes. This paper also proposes a design policy for tactile display systems in terms of system latency.",

The analytical form of the interaction matrix, relating the time variation of these visual features to the probe velocity, is derived and used in the control law.

In this paper, we propose a new approach: planning a path for the robot in the image-space of an on-board camera. We apply a learned color-to-cost mapping to transform a raw image into a cost-image, which then undergoes a pseudo-configuration-space transform. We search in the resulting cost-image for a path to the projected goal point in the image. One benefit of our approach is the ability to react to obstacles at ranges well beyond our 3D sensor range \u2014 independent testing has confirmed our system has effectively reacted to obstacles at a range of 93 m while our stereo sensor provides reliable data only up to 5 m away. We describe the details of our technique and the results from testing under the DARPA LAGR and UPI programs.",

        "abstract": "We have recently proposed DSLX, a motion planner that significantly reduces the computational time for solving challenging kinodynamic problems by interleaving continuous state-space exploration with discrete search on a workspace decomposition. An important but inadequately understood aspect of DSLX is the role of the workspace decomposition on the computational efficiency of the planner. Understanding this role is important for successful applications of DSLX to increasingly complex robotic systems. This work shows that the granularity of the workspace decomposition directly impacts computational efficiency: DSLX is faster when the decomposition is neither too fine-nor too coarse-grained. Finding the right level of granularity can require extensive fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that significant computational efficiency can instead be obtained with no fine-tuning by using conforming Delaunay triangulations, which in the context of DSLX provide a natural workspace decomposition that allows an efficient interplay between continuous state-space exploration and discrete search. The results of this work are based on extensive experiments on DSLX using grid, trapezoidal, and triangular decompositions of various granularities to solve challenging first and second-order kinodynamic motion-planning problems.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Regarding manipulators with wrist-mounted force/torque sensors a major issue is the high execution time of force-guided and force-guarded motions compared to purely position-controlled tasks. An important factor that aggravates the reduction of the execution time is the influence of non-contact forces, e.g. inertial forces, centrifugal forces, Coriolis forces, and associated torques, which are exerted onto the sensor by a load attached to it. Considering force-guided or force-guarded motions, these non-contact forces may significantly deteriorate contact detection and force control performance when executing dynamic movements. In addition to these disturbance forces/torques, resets of the force/torque sensor consume execution time. This paper presents an approach to eliminating all non-contact forces and associated torques from force/torque sensor measurements thus enabling pure contact force control. Apart from facilitating pure contact force control, the presented approach renders resets of the force/torque sensor unnecessary. To achieve this aim, the ten inertial parameters (mass, coordinates of the center of mass, and the elements of the inertia matrix) of the load attached to the sensor as well as the force/torque sensor offsets are estimated on-line employing a variant of the recursive instrumental variables method. These parameters are used to calculate the non- contact forces/torques acting upon the sensor. The current non-contact forces/torques and sensor offsets are subtracted from the force/torque measurements thus yielding the contact forces/torques. Experimental results show that both contact detection and force control performance are improved significantly by this approach.",

An additional prismatic actuator is applied to a 3RRR planar parallel manipulator. It allows a selective reconfiguration of the kinematic structure according to several optimization criteria. Based on an index that we denote the gain of the Jacobian matrix the position of the redundant actuator is changed in a discrete manner. The resulting optimized switching patterns lead to a great increase of the traveling platform's pose accuracy. Between two switching operations the prismatic actuator's position is supposed to be locked. Hence, sources of error, e.g. the joint clearance, can be minimized. Several analysis examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concept in combination with the developed optimization procedure.",

        "abstract": "A new type of underwater thruster is studied which is inspired by the natural locomotion of squid and other cephalopod. The thruster is similar to synthetic jet actuators used for flow control studies, but operates on different length and frequency scales. A hybrid simulation experiment has been designed to test the performance of this thruster in a static environment, under dynamic, unsteady driving signals. The hybrid simulation implements actual thrust production on a virtual vehicle model and attempts to control the trajectory of that vehicle. It was determined that this type of thruster being controlled with a basic PD control algorithm demonstrates excellent position tracking in a wide range of maneuvers. The thruster showed that it could produce controlling forces accurately on several scales of thrust. However, the maneuvering system was subject to an appreciable position overshoot at high vehicle oscillation frequencies, due to unmodeled thruster settling time.",

The range information is quantized and enhanced by local structure to partially cope with considerable measurement noise and distortion. The augmented voxel representation allows the adaptation of known track-before-detect algorithms to infer multiple object parts in a range image sequence even when each single observation does not contain enough information to do the detection. The appropriateness of the method is successfully demonstrated by two experiments for chair legs.",

In this paper, an appearance-based topological map, covering a large, mixed indoor and outdoor environment, is built incrementally by using panoramic images. The map is based on image similarity, so that the resulting segmentation of the world corresponds closely to the human concept of a place. Using high-resolution images and the epipolar constraint, the resulting map is shown to be very suitable for localization, even when the environment has undergone seasonal changes.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient algorithm to compute independent contact regions on the surface of complex 3D objects such that a finger contact anywhere inside each of these regions assures a force-closure grasp despite the exact contact position. Independent contact regions provide robustness in front of finger positioning errors during an object grasping, and give relevant information for finger repositioning during the object manipulation. The object is described with a mesh of surface points, so the procedure is applicable to objects of any arbitrary shape. The proposed approach uses information from the wrench space, and generates the independent regions by growing them around the contact points of a given starting grasp. A two-phase approach is also provided to find a locally optimum force-closure grasp that serves as starting grasp, considering as grasp quality measure the largest perturbation wrench that the grasp can resist with independence of the perturbation direction. The approach has been implemented and several examples are provided to illustrate its performance.",

        "abstract": "In the path clearance problem the robot needs to reach its goal as quickly as possible without being detected by enemies. The robot does not know the precise locations of enemies, but has a list of their possible locations. These locations can be sensed, and the robot can go through them if no enemy is present or has to take a detour otherwise. We have previously developed an approach to the path clearance problem when the robot itself had to sense possible enemy locations. In this paper we investigate the problem of path clearance when the robot can use multiple scout robots to sense the possible enemy locations. This becomes a high-dimensional planning under uncertainty problem. We propose an efficient and scalable approach to it. While the approach requires centralized planning, it can scale to very large environments and to a large number of scouts and allows the scouts to be heterogenous. The experimental results show the benefits of using our approach when multiple scout robots are available.",

We treat selective data return as a compression problem in which the explorer agent transmits the subset of measurements that are most informative with respect to the complete dataset. Experiments demonstrate selective downlink of navigation imagery by a rover during autonomous geologic investigations in the Atacama desert of Chile. Here automatic analysis identifies informative images using classifications based on natural image statistics. Image texture analysis, together with a context-sensitive Hidden Markov Model representation, permits adaptive downlink in response to geologic unit boundaries. Selective data return improves the science content of returned data for this geologic mapping task.",

In contrast to current state-of-the-art object recognition solutions which are evaluated on databases of static images, the system described in this paper employs an active strategy based on identifying potential objects using an attention mechanism and planning to obtain images of these objects from numerous viewpoints. We demonstrate the use of a bag-of-features technique for ranking potential objects, and show that this measure outperforms geometric matching for invariance across viewpoints. Our system implements informed visual search by prioritising map locations and re-examining promising locations first. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is a highly competent object recognition system that is capable of locating numerous challenging objects amongst distractors.",

Animal cells that have been chemically softened are aspirated into a narrow teflon tube, which is then inserted into a microfluidic chip. The tube's tip is inserted into a microchannel and releases the aspirated cells in the microchannel. The microfluidic chip contains two orthogonal channels. One is a narrow microchannel that aspirates and fixes a cell; in the other channel, a fluid flows at high velocity for cutting the aspirated cell. The thickness of the aspiration channel can be adjusted to fix the aspirated cell. Half the volume of the cell is aspirated into the narrow microchannel and high-speed flow is then generated to cut the cell into two. In this report, the cutting method and the injection method are described. Then an imaging process is also investigated for an automatic cutting.",

        "abstract": "Currently, large efforts are unertaken to bring robotic applications to domestic environments. Especially physical human-robot cooperation is a major concern and various design and control methodologies were developed on the way to achieve this task. In particular, this necessitates the evaluation of injury risks a human is exposed to in case he is hit by a robot. In this video several blunt impact tests are shown, leading to an assessment of which factors dominate injury severity. We will illustrate the effect robot speed, robot mass, and constraints in the environment have on safety in human-robot impacts. It will be shown that the intuition of high impact loads being transmitted by heavy robots is wrong. Furthermore, the conclusion is induced that free impacts are by far less dangerous than being crushed.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes work we have done in developing an insertable surgical imaging device with multiple degrees-of-freedom for minimally invasive surgery. The device is fully insertable into the abdomen using standard 12 mm trocars. It consists of a modular camera and lens system which has pan and tilt capability provided by 2 small DC servo motors. It also has its own integrated lighting system that is part of the camera assembly. Once the camera is inserted into the abdomen, the insertion port is available for additional tooling, motivating the idea of single port surgery. A third zoom axis has been designed for the camera as well, allowing close-up and far-away imaging of surgical sites with a single camera unit. In animal tests with the device we have performed surgical procedures including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, running (measuring) the bowel, suturing, and nephrectomy. The tests show that the new device is: (1) Easier and more intuitive to use than a standard laparoscope. (2) Joystick operation requires no specialized operator training. (3) Field of view and access to relevant regions of the body were superior to a standard laparoscope using a single port. (4) Time to perform procedures was better or equivalent to a standard laparoscope. We believe these insertable platforms will be an integral part of future surgical systems. The platforms can be used with tooling as well as imaging systems, allowing many surgical procedures to be done using such a platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a landmark position measurement system using an integrated laser-camera sensor. Laser range finder can be used to detect landmarks that are direction invariant in the laser data such as protruding edges in walls, edges of tables, chairs. When such features are unavailable the processes that depend on landmarks such as navigation and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms will fail. However, in many instances, larger number of landmarks can be detected using computer vision. In the proposed method camera is used to detect landmarks while the location of the landmark is measured by the laser range finder using laser-camera calibration information. Thus, the proposed method exploits the beneficial aspects of each sensor to overcome the disadvantages of the other sensor. Experimental results of an application in SLAM is presented to verify the results.",

Targeting small lesions and foci (5 mm in diameter) is particularly prone to errors. We developed an integrated system to perform robot-assisted transperineal needle insertions into the prostate, under Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guidance. The system provides arbitrary needle trajectories and allows for simultaneous surveillance and correction of the needle path, based on intra-operative MRI. System functionality and data transfer and processing tests were conducted. Five lesions embedded in the gel phantom were targeted successfully, while communication delays (due to higher image frame rates) had no adverse affect on robot-software communication. The system was sufficiently resistant to high network loads and performed with an acceptable transfer rate.",

        "abstract": "Automatic cell injection has been the focus of many researches and commercial development for several years. In this paper, a robotic cell injection system for automatic batch injection of suspended cells is developed. To facilitate the process, these suspended cells are held and fixed to a cell array by a specially designed cell holding device, and injected one by one through an \u201cout-of-plane\u201d cell injection process. A micropipette equipped with a PVDF micro force sensor is integrated in the proposed system. The force sensor is utilized to measure real time injection force applied to the cells during injection process. Through calibration of the relationship between the cell injection force and the desired injector pipette trajectory, a position (vision) and force control algorithm is proposed and applied to the motion control of the injection pipette in three-coordinate directions during an injection process. The out-of-plane cell injection task is decoupled into a position control in X-Y horizontal plane and an impedance force control in Z-axis. The depth motion of the injector pipette, a common problem of three-dimensional micromanipulation, is indirectly controlled by the force control. Finally, experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Up to now, there is no widely accepted quantitative evaluation scheme. Nowadays, an objective structured clinical examination has been proposed as a modern type of examination often used in medicine to test skills such as medical procedures, etc. The assessment of skills is realized by practical exams, in which students are evaluated by experienced examiner using a check list. However, the examiner lacks of information which cannot be obtained trough the simple observation of the task. Thanks to the advances in robot technology in embedded systems, etc.; more advanced evaluation tools can be conceived. For this reason, at Waseda University, we have proposed the development of a patient robot as an advanced evaluation tool to provide more detailed information of the task. As a first approach of our long-term research target, we have proposed the development of a suture/ligature training system which provides quantitative information of the movement of a dummy skin as well as information of the quality of task. In this paper; we describe the functionalities of the newest version, the Waseda-KyotoKagaku Skin No.2 Refined (WKS-2R), which has been designed to provide quantitative information of the task. In addition, we are proposing a new evaluation function which includes performance indexes and weighting coefficients. As a first approach, the weighting coefficients were determined by using the discriminant analysis. A set of experiments were proposed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation function. From the preliminary results, the evaluation function was useful in detecting differences among different levels of expertise as well as detecting improvements during the training process by computing the learning curve.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a shoe-integrated system for human abnormal gait detection. This intelligent system focuses on detecting the following patterns: normal gait, toe in, toe out, oversupination, and heel walking gait abnormalities. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of three-dimensional gyroscopes and accelerometers is employed to measure angular velocities and accelerations of the foot. Four force sensing resistors (FSRs) and one bend sensor are installed on the insole of each foot for force and flexion information acquisition. The proposed detection method is mainly based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature generation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for multi-pattern classification. In the present study, four subjects tested the shoe-integrated device in outdoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust and efficient in detecting abnormal gait patterns. Our goal is to provide a cost-effective system for detecting gait abnormalities in order to assist persons with abnormal gaits in the developing of a normal walking pattern in their daily life.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the benefits of adopting a fully probabilistic SLAM approach in sequential motion and structure estimation from an image sequence. Unlike standard Structure from Motion (SFM) methods, this \u2018monocular SLAM\u2019 approach is able to achieve drift-free estimation with high frame-rate real-time operation, particularly benefitting from highly efficient active feature search, map management and mismatch rejection. A consistent thread in this research on real-time monocular SLAM has been to reduce the assumptions required. In this paper we move towards the logical conclusion of this direction by implementing a fully Bayesian Interacting Multiple Models (IMM) framework which can switch automatically between parameter sets in a dimensionless formulation of monocular SLAM. Remarkably, our approach of full sequential probability propagation means that there is no need for penalty terms to achieve the Occam property of favouring simpler models - this arises automatically. We successfully tackle the known stiffness in on-the-fly monocular SLAM start up without known patterns in the scene. The search regions for matches are also reduced in size with respect to single model EKF increasing the rejection of spurious matches.

        "abstract": "Despite parallels between the cooperative use of domestic dogs in human society today, the predicted similar deployment of robots in the future, and the plethora of superficially dog-like robotic entertainment devices, very little effort has been directed at exploiting any understanding of social cognition between dogs and humans when designing interactive robotic systems. This paper describes an experiment in which we gave interactive robots zoomorphic appearances and dog-like behavioural properties. We analysed human reactions to robots exhibiting differing levels of zoomorphism and dog-like behaviour during an interaction task; we were particularly interested to determine whether behaviour and/or appearance that mimicked that of dogs facilitated increased satisfaction in robot performance and a willingness to persevere with a robot that made mistakes. Our findings show that neither the appearance or behaviour of a robot had an impact on the participants' rating of robot performance whilst there was also no significant difference in the self-reported categories of frustration, excitement and desire to persist with an interaction. However, our findings suggest that differences in individual preferences are revealed when people are asked to interact with robots that exhibit dog-like behaviours and other zoomorphic characteristics and that further research is required in order to better understand these differences.",

We also determine properties of the form that serve as sufficient conditions for driving a simple mechanical systems underactuated by one control to an epsiv-neighborhood of rest from an arbitrary initial configuration and velocity. These conditions are computable and coordinate invariant. We focus on the case where the symmetric form is real-valued and indefinite on the entire configuration manifold. Our technical results give rise to a nonlinear control law that drives these systems to an epsiv-neighborhood of rest given an arbitrary initial configuration, velocity and epsiv > 0.",

Whegs vehicles use abstracted biological principles to navigate over irregular and varied terrain with little or no low level control. Torsionally compliant devices in the drive train of each wheel-leg allow its gait to passively adapt when climbing large obstacles or steep inclines. Whegs is similar to the RHex line of robots that preceded Whegs in that the foot motion of all 6 legs is circular, but it differs in many aspects: 3 leg-spokes versus 1, 1 drive motor vs. 6, leg rotation for steering instead of skid steering, passive gait adaptation vs. active gait control, and Whegs has a body joint.",

In this method, the transformation from Cartesian space to joint space is performed in a feedback loop and as a result the new feedback inverse kinematics (FIK) law operates as a filter and does not require matrix manipulations (inversion, singular value decomposition or a computation of a damping factor). While the computational demand is greatly reduced, the performance is comparable to the one delivered by the damped least squares (DLS) law. The new algorithm is capable of escaping and avoiding kinematic singularities and in this respect it outperforms pseudo-inverse based formulations.",

Both the cases of an unbounded and a circular bounded workspace are considered. In the first case, we show that the closed loop system reaches a configuration in which the minimum distance between any pair of agents is larger than a specific lower bound. It is proved that this lower bound coincides with the agents' sensing radius. In the case of a bounded workspace, the control law is modified to force the agents to remain within the workspace boundary throughout the closed loop system evolution. Moreover the proposed control guarantees collision avoidance between the team members. The results are supported through relevant computer simulations.",

        "abstract": "For human-robot cooperation in the context of human-augmentation tasks, the stability of the control model is of great concern due to the risk for the human safety represented by a powerful robot. This paper investigates stability conditions for impedance control in this cooperative context and where touch is used as the sense of interaction. The proposed analysis takes into account human arm and robot physical characteristics, which are first investigated. Then, a global system model including noise filtering and impedance control is defined in a state-space representation. From this representation, a Lyapunov function candidate has been successfully discovered. In addition to providing conclusions on the global asymptotic stability of the system, the relative simplicity of the resulting equation allows the derivation of general expressions for the critical values of impedance parameters. Such knowledge is of great interest in the context of design of new adaptive control laws or simply to serve as design guidelines for conventional impedance control. The accuracy of these results were verified in a user study involving 7 human subjects and a 3-dof parallel robot. In this experiment, the real effective stability frontier was defined for each subject and compared with values predicted using the Lyapunov function.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the importance of iteration when performing the measurement update step for the problem of bearing-only SLAM. We focus on an undelayed approach that initializes a landmark after only one bearing measurement. Traditionally, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been used for SLAM, but the EKF measurement update rule can often lead to a divergent state estimate due to its inconsistency in linearization. We discuss the flaws of the EKF in this paper, and show that even the well established inverse-depth parametrization for bearing-only SLAM can be affected. We then show that representing the bearing-only update as a numerical optimization problem (solved with an iterative approach such as Gauss-Newton minimization) prevents divergence of the Kalman filter state and produces accurate SLAM results for a bearing-only sensor. More specifically, we propose the use of an iterated Kalman filter to resolve the issues normally associated with the EKF measurement update. Two outdoor mobile robot experiments are discussed to compare algorithm performance.",

        "abstract": "Currently there is a lack of objective clinical diagnosis and classification of tremor is difficult when it is subtle. Thus in previous work, a sensing system has been developed to quantify pathological tremor in human upper limb. In this paper, a Kalman filter algorithm to fuse information from accelerometers and surface electromyography is proposed. As the ground truth, an optical motion tracking system will be utilized. Then two sensor fusion algorithms based on Kalman filter are formulated to estimate the joint angle of the limb from the reading of accelerometers and surface EMG. Initial results using tremor data from two Parkinson's disease patients show promising future in this sensor fusion. The sensing system and the algorithms proposed are useful for actively compensating the tremor and helping the clinicians in tremor diagnostics.",

This CDRA consists of three 'self-calibrated' cable-driven parallel mechanism (CDPM) modules. In order to account for any kinematic errors that might arise when assembling the individual CDPMs, a calibration model is formulated based on the local product-of-exponential formula and the measurement residues in the tool-tip frame poses. An iterative least-squares algorithm is employed to identify the errors in the fixed transformation frames of the sequentially assembled 'self- calibrated' CDPM modules. Both computer simulations and experimental studies were carried out to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed calibration algorithm. From the experimental studies, errors in the fixed kinematic transformation frames were precisely recovered after a minimum of 15 pose measurements.",

In order to build the kinematic model, the fluid force acting on the robotic fish is divided into three parts: the pressure on links, the approach stream pressure and the frictional force. By solving Lagrange's equation of the second kind and the fluid force, the movement of robotic fish is obtained. The robotic fish's motion, such as propelling and turning are simulated, and experiments are taken to verify the model.",

A path manifold that considers curvature limitations is used to provide a desired path shape and convergence to the reference posture or trajectory. Lyapunov based techniques are then used to derive a control law that asymptotically converges the robot to the path manifold. Posture regulation, path following, and trajectory tracking capability are provided. Allowable initial conditions are estimated based upon curvature constraints of the robot. Curvature boundaries and asymptotic convergence naturally limit allowable initial conditions and are resolved by driving the robot to intermediate goal points within regions of allowable initial conditions. The proposed controller is evaluated in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Active cannulas are remotely actuated thin continuum robots with the potential to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on \"guiding\" environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for procedures requiring passage through narrow openings to access air-filled cavities (e.g. surgery in the throat and lung). Composed of telescoping concentric pre-curved elastic tubes, an active cannula is actuated at its base by translation and axial rotation of component tubes. Using minimum energy principles and Lie Group theory, we present a framework for the kinematics of multi-link active cannulas. This framework permits testing of the hypothesis that overall cannula shape locally minimizes stored elastic energy. We evaluate in particular whether the torsional energy in the long, straight transmission between actuators and the curved sections is important. Including torsion in the kinematic model enables us to analytically predict experimentally observed bifurcation in the energy landscape. Independent calibration procedures based on bifurcation and tip and feature positions enable model parameter identification, producing results near ranges expected from tube material properties and geometry. Experimental results validate the kinematic framework and demonstrate the importance of modeling torsional effects in order to describe bifurcation and accurately predict active cannula shape.",

We present here a robot using linear actuator and a pulley system allowing a higher modularity of the actuation system. The kinematics of this redundant system (the system has 7 wires), taking into account the elasticity of the wires, is presented. Inverse kinematics may be solved either by first choosing the wire tensions, the control vector being then a linear function of the tensions or by solving directly a system of non linear equations whose unknowns are the components of the control vector. Forward kinematics is a much more complex issue, involving the solving of a large system. We present a solving approach but this problem remains an open issue.",

We can tie knots in different types of wire and fishing line using these fixtures.

Depending on the posture of the robot, when it lifts up its body, the robot automatically selects the legs supporting the robot\u2019s weight and distributes the weight to these legs based on their force margins. The legs which cannot support forces are controlled to always contact with the rungs so that the robot holds the ladder firmly. The advantages of proposed gait and control method are verified by the analysis of the supporting range and the torque, and by experiment on force distribution.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a system that uses only vision to land a UAV on a runway. We describe a method for estimating the relative location of the runway as an image by performing image registration against a stack of images in which the location of the runway is known. An approximation of the camera projection model for a forward-facing view of a runway is derived, allowing the course deviation of the UAV to be estimated from a registered image. The course deviation is used as input to a linear feedback control loop to maintain the correct flight path. Our method is implemented as a real-time multithreaded application, which is used to control an aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator. We also show results of applying the vision component of the system to video recorded from an actual UAV.",

Unlike most LA scanners which are designed to provide a 2D image of a static object, the lateral optical sensor presented here offers an additional and practical means to detect object slippage on the conveyor in real time. We illustrate numerically the effectiveness of this sensing method with two illustrative examples. The first simulates the 2D boundary of a geometrically well-defined object on an accelerating conveyor, which offers intuitive insights on the effects of conveyor dynamics and object slippage on the accuracy of the 2D boundary measurement. The second demonstrates the application of the lateral optical sensor as a real time feedback sensor for active singulation of natural objects.",

        "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for solving the global localization problem called Frozen-Time Smoother (FTS). Time is 'frozen', in the sense that the belief always refers to the same time instant, instead of following a moving target, like Monte Carlo Localization does. This algorithm works in the case in which global localization is formulated as a smoothing problem, and a precise estimate of the incremental motion of the robot is usually available. These assumptions correspond to the case when global localization is used to solve the loop closing problem in SLAM. We compare FTS to two Monte Carlo methods designed with the same assumptions. The experiments suggest that a naive implementation of the FTS is more efficient than an extremely optimized equivalent Monte Carlo solution. Moreover, the FTS has an intrinsic laziness: it does not need frequent updates (scans can be integrated once every many meters) and it can process data in arbitrary order. The source code and datasets are available for download.",

        "abstract": "Researchers at IHMC and Honda Research Institute are developing techniques for learning capture points for bipedal push recovery. A capture point is a point on the ground where a biped can step to in order to stop. Humans are very adept at stepping to capture points, while most bipedal robots cannot recover from significant pushes. To calculate approximate capture point locations, we use the linear inverted pendulum model introduced by Kajita and Tani. For a point mass biped walking at a constant height, this model exactly predicts the capture point. However, for a distributed mass biped, it is only an approximation. In order to better predict capture points, we learn a correction function to the linear inverted pendulum model. We used two learning methods, one online and one offline, to improve capture point prediction. In the offline learning method, the robot is pushed multiple times with a given force magnitude and direction. In the online learning technique, we use a radial basis function to represent the learned offsets from the capture point predicted by the linear inverted pendulum model.",

In this framework, support vector machines are applied to obtain a classifier that can differentiate between moving shadows and other foreground objects. The co-training algorithm of Blum and Mitchell is then used in an online setting to improve accuracy with the help of unlabeled data. We evaluate the concept of co-training and show its viability even when explicit assumptions made by the algorithm are not satisfied. Thus, given a small random set of labeled examples (in our application domain, shadow and foreground), the system gives encouraging generalization performance using a semi-supervised approach. In dynamic environments such as those induced by robot motion, the view changes significantly and traditional algorithms do not work well. Our method can handle such changing conditions by adapting online using a semi-supervised approach.",

In this study Recursive Least-Square (RLS) filter based episodic Natural Actor-Critic is employed to determine the optimal impedance parameters. Through dynamic simulations of contact tasks, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

        "abstract": "Learning parameters of a motion model is an important challenge for autonomous robots. We address the particular instance of parameter learning when tracking motions with a switching state-space model. We present a general algorithm for dealing simultaneously with both unknown fixed model parameters and state variables. Using an Expectation-Maximization approach, we apply a tactic-based multi-model particle filter to estimate the state variables in the E-step, and use particle smoothing to update the parameters in the M-step. We test our algorithm both in simulation and in a team robot soccer environment, as a substrate for applying the learned models to object tracking in a team. One of the soccer robots learns the actuation model of its teammate. The experimental results show that the particle smoothing efficiency is substantially increased and the tracking performance is significantly improved using the learned teammate actuation model.",

However, if successful, the controller has the advantage of being tailored exactly to the system it eventually has to control. Here we describe, how a neural network based RL controller learns the challenging task of ball dribbling directly on our Middle-Size robot. The learned behaviour was actively used throughout the RoboCup world championship tournament 2007 in Atlanta, where we won the first place. This contistutes another important step within our Brainstormers project. The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent control architecture for a soccer playing robot, that is able to learn more and more complex behaviours from scratch.",

The second objective is to study the achievable localization performance with the aforementioned resources. Image processing techniques are employed to create a feature map from an aerial image, and also to extract features from camera images to provide observations that are used by a particle filter for localization.",

This locomotion mechanism can move while keeping a large area in contact with the ground. Further, the amount of space required by this locomotion mechanism is less than that by other locomotion mechanisms. Therefore, it is desirable to apply this mechanism not only to robots for rescue and limited environment exploration operations but also to locomotive endoscopic robots for medical engineering. In this study, we developed a peristaltic crawling robot that can move not only in a tube but also on a plane surface Furthermore; we propose a peristaltic crawling robot and its locomotion strategy. As a result, the simulation and experimental results showed good performance.",

Our aim is to develop an intelligent control system that can distinguish the hardness of unknown objects so that robotic fingers can effectively explore the object\u2019s surface without altering its physical properties or causing damage. Initially we developed a novel optical three-axis tactile sensor system based on an optical waveguide transduction method capable of acquiring normal and shearing forces. The sensors are mounted on the fingertips of the multi-fingered humanoid robot arm. We proposed a new control scheme applying low force interaction to distinguish the hardness of unknown objects in robot manipulation tasks based on tactile sensing. The scheme utilized new control parameters obtained by calibration experiments using hard and soft objects that enable robot fingers to precisely control grasp pressure and define the slippage sensation of the given object. Finally, verification experiments of the proposed control scheme using a humanoid robot arm were conducted whose results revealed that the finger\u2019s system managed to recognize the hardness of unknown objects and complied with sudden changes of the object\u2019s weight during object manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "We propose using the kernel dimension reduction (KDR) to extract a low-dimensional feature space for humanoid locomotion tasks. Although humanoids have many degrees of freedom, task relevant feature spaces can be much smaller than the number of dimension of the original state space. We consider an application of the proposed approach to improve the locomotive performance of humanoid robots using an extracted low-dimensional state space. To improve the locomotive performance, we use a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. While RL is a useful non-linear optimizer, it is usually difficult to apply RL to real robotic systems \u2014 due to the large number of iterations required to acquire suitable policies. In this study, we use the extracted low-dimensional feature space for RL so that the learning system can improve task performance quickly. The kernel dimension reduction method allows us to extract the feature space even if the task relevant mapping is non-linear. This is an essential property to improve humanoid locomotive performance since stepping or walking dynamics involves highly nonlinear dynamics. We show that we can improve stepping and walking policies by using a RL method on an extracted feature space by using KDR.",

The macromodel has four spatular hairs operating by magnetic forces instead of van der Waals forces. The purpose of the models is to simulate the mechanics of the actual gecko seta. For additional hair compliance, a two degree of freedom double bent spatular hair geometry is chosen. A mathematical model for the displacement and forces (slide, peel, and pull-off) for the macro scale gecko hairs is presented. Experiments showed good agreement with the model and a directional adhesion effect which could be useful for locomotion.",

This microrobotic agent with dimensions less than 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 70 \u03bcm is capable of maneuvering with 3 degrees of freedom. A specially prepared substrate allows for adjustable speeds exceeding 12.5 mm/s or 42 times the robot\u2019s body length per second (see accompanying video).

In contrast to existing designs, this design achieves fish like locomotion through the use of a single actuator and a compliant body and tail. Experiments were performed using both biased swimming motions and coasted turns. During these experiments the Compliant Robotic Tuna (CRT) achieved steady swimming speeds of up to 0.37 body lengths/second, average turning rates of up to 12.6 degrees per second, and turning radii as low as 1 body length. In addition, this paper compares the measured maneuvering performance with the predictions of a simplified rigid body model that was derived using both theoretical and empirical techniques. The swimming motions studied in this paper were achieved using open loop mechanisms. Therefore the potential for performance improvements exists.",

To address this challenge, we propose to couple manipulation and perception. The robot observes its own deliberate interactions with the world. These interactions reveal sensory information that would otherwise remain hidden and facilitate the interpretation of perceptual data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of interactive perception we present a skill for the manipulation of articulated objects. We show how UMan, our mobile manipulation platform, obtains a kinematic model of an unknown object. The model then enables the robot to perform purposeful manipulation. Our algorithm is extremely robust, and does not require prior knowledge of the object; it is insensitive to lighting, texture, color, specularities, background, and is computationally highly efficient.",

These models are typically tuned manually, a brittle and laborious process. Autonomous model learning is a promising alternative to manual calibration, but previous work has assumed the presence of an accurate action or sensor model in order to train the other model. This paper presents an adaptation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to enable a mobile robot to learn both its action and sensor model functions, starting without an accurate version of either. The resulting algorithm is validated experimentally both on a Sony Aibo ERS-7 robot and in simulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a methodology to measure the effectiveness of a human-robot team as part of an adjustable autonomy system. The effectiveness measure is aimed at determining an appropriate autonomy level prior to the system's deployment. Two competing goals need to be traded off: maximising robot performance while minimising the amount of human input. The relative importance of the two goals depend on the mission priorities and constraints which are taken into account. The proposed methodology is applied to a human-robot communication system developed for task- oriented information exchange. The robot uses a decision- theoretic framework to act autonomously and to decide when to request input from human operators. The latter is achieved by computing the value-of-information an operator is able to provide which is compared to the cost of obtaining the information. For our system, the cost parameter represents the autonomy level to be determined. We demonstrate how an appropriate autonomy level can be found experimentally using a navigation task. In our experiment, the robot navigates through a set of simulated worlds with human input being generated by a software component. The results are used to find appropriate autonomy levels for three example missions and a subsequent user study.",

        "abstract": "We present and examine a technique for estimating the ego-motion of a mobile robot using memory-based learning and a monocular camera. Unlike other approaches that rely heavily on camera calibration and geometry to compute trajectory, our method learns a mapping from sparse optical flow to platform velocity and turn rate. We also demonstrate an efficient method of computing high-quality sparse optical flow, and techniques for using this sparse optical flow as input to a supervised learning method. We employ a voting scheme of many learners that use subsets of the sparse optical flow to cope with variable dimensionality and reduce the dimensionality of each learner. Finally, we perform experiments in which we examine the learned mapping for visual odometry, investigate the effects of varying the reduced dimensionality of the sparse optical flow state, and quantify the accuracy of two variations of our learner scheme. Our results indicate that our learning scheme estimates monocular visual odometry mainly from points on the ground plane, and reflect to a degree the minimum dimensionality imposed by the problem. In addition, we show that while this memory-based learning method cannot yet estimate ego-motion as accurately as recent geometric methods, it is possible to learn, with no explicit model of camera calibration or scene structure, complicated mappings that take advantage of properties of the camera and the environment.",

        "abstract": "Manipulation and assembly tasks are typically characterized by many nominally rigid bodies coming into frictional contacts, possibly involving impacts. Manipulation tasks are difficult to model because uncertainties associated with friction and assembly tasks are particularly hard to analyze because of the interplay between process tolerance and geometric uncertainties due to manufacturing errors. Manipulation at the meso (hundred microns to millimeters) and micro (several microns to tens of microns) scale is even harder for several reasons. It is difficult to measure forces at the micro-netwon level reliably using off-the-shelf force sensors and good force-feedback control schemes have not proved successful. It is hard to manufacture general-purpose end effectors at this scale and it is even more difficult to grasp and manipulate parts at the micro and meso level than it is at the macro level. Finally, the lack of good models of the mechanics of contact interactions at this scale means that model-based approaches to planning and control are difficult.",

        "abstract": "Robot assisted interventions often require coupling and decoupling of the robot to/from a specific tool. By using manual gripper changing systems these operations are facilitated, but the robot has to approach to and move away from the coupling position. Industrial applications are mostly based on movements which are teached-in, since the working environment is perfectly described (i.e. working cell). Especially in robot assisted surgery we are facing non fixed tools to which the robot has to be coupled (e.g. a holding device attached to a mobilised bone) and restricted working areas with special safety requirements. In this paper we present an automatic end-effector registration method and a semiautomatic coupling procedure exemplarily for robot assisted orthognathic surgery. By using means of an optical localisation system and force- /torque sensing, the coupling procedure is controlled by a multi- sensor data fusion approach. The developed methods can be adapted to any robot assisted intervention.",

The rotary-linear motor is miniaturized to the size needed to function in a blood vessel. The stator prototype is a cube of side 3.5mm, and the main body is fabricated as a single metallic cube with a through-hole. Four piezoelectric elements are bonded to the sides of the stator. When AC voltage at each resonant frequency is applied to the piezoelectric elements, the circumference of the stator generates elliptical motions at each natural frequency. We can obtain the output from a shaft inserted through the hole. We developed the first prototype of the stator using the finite element method (FEM), and experimentally determined the output of the rotary-linear motor. In the rotary sense, approximately 260 rpm and 0.1 mNm were attained at a resonant frequency of 270 kHz, and in the linear sense about 50 mm/s and 0.01 mN was attained at 306 kHz by driving the system at applied voltages of 42 Vrms.",

The microgripper integrates an electrothermal V-beam microactuator and two capacitive force sensors, one for contact detection (force resolution: 38.5 nN) and the other for gripping force measurements (force resolution: 19.9 nN). The MEMS-based microgripper and the force control system experimentally demonstrate the capability of rapid contact detection and reliable force-controlled micrograsping to accommodate variations in sizes and mechanical properties of objects with a high reproducibility. Cell viability testing validated that the temperature at gripping arm tips does not exceed 50degC.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the assignment of discrete points to two robots, in the presence of geometric and kinematic constraints between the robots. The individual points have differing processing times, and the goal is to identify an assignment of points to the robots so that the total processing time is minimized. The assignment of points to the robots is the first step in the path generation process for the robots. This work is motivated by an industrial microelectronics manufacturing system with two robots, with square footprints, that are constrained to translate along a common line while satisfying proximity and collision avoidance constraints. The N points lie on a planar base plate that can translate along the plane normal to the direction of motion of the robots. The geometric constraints on the motions of the two robots lead to constraints on points that can be processed simultaneously. We show that the point assignment for processing problem can be converted to a maximum weighted matching problem on a graph and solved optimally in O(N3) time. Since this is too slow for large datasets, we present a O(N2) time greedy algorithm and prove that the greedy solution is within a factor of 3/2 of the optimal solution. Finally, we provide computational results for the greedy algorithm on typical industrial datasets.",

While sensor perception and model interpretation focus on the robot\u2019s internal representation of the world rather passively, robot grasping capabilities are needed to actively execute tasks, modify scenarios and thereby reach versatile goals. These capabilities should also include the generation of stable grasps to safely handle even objects unknown to the robot. We believe that the key to this ability is not to select a good grasp depending on the identification of an object (e.g. as a cup), but on its shape (e.g. as a composition of shape primitives). In this paper, we envelop given 3D data points into primitive box shapes by a fit-and-split algorithm that is based on an efficient Minimum Volume Bounding Box implementation. Though box shapes are not able to approximate arbitrary data in a precise manner, they give efficient clues for planning grasps on arbitrary objects. We present the algorithm and experiments using the 3D grasping simulator GraspIt! [1].",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to recover missing data during observation by factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The fundamental idea of the proposed method originates from the mimesis model, inspired by the mirror neuron system. By combining the motion recognition from partial observation algorithm and the proto-symbol based duplication of observed motion algorithm, whole body motion imitation from partial observation can be achieved. The algorithm for missing data recovery uses the same basic strategy as the whole body motion imitation from partial observation, but requires more accurate spatial representability. FHMMs allow for more efficient representation of a continuous data sequence by distributed state representation compared to hidden Markov models (HMMs). The proposed algorithm is tested with human motion data and the experimental results show improved representability compared to the conventional HMMs.",

        "abstract": "This video demonstrates a mixed reality (MR) environment which is constructed for development of autonomous behaviors of robots. Many kinds of functions are required to be integrated for realizing an autonomous behavior. For example, autonomous navigation of humanoid robots needs functions, such as, recognition of environment, localization and mapping, path planning, gait planning, dynamically stable biped walking pattern generation, and sensor feedback stabilization of walking. Technologies to realize each function are well investigated by many research works. However, another effort is required for constructing an autonomous behavior by integrating those functions. We demonstrate a MR environment in which internal status of a robot, such as, sensor status, recognition results, planning results, and motion control parameters, can be projected to the environment and its body. We can understand intuitively how each function works as a part of total system in the real environment by using the proposed system, and it helps solving the integration problems. The overview of the system, projection of each internal status, and the application to an autonomous locomotion experiment are presented in the video clip.",

        "abstract": "In this work inspired by flocking of birds or fish communities traveling together in the nature, we have developed a novel dynamically reformable mobile formation algorithm for the navigation of wheeled mobile robot (WMR) groups operating in complex and/or obstacle dense environments. The proposed method is formed via the combination of simple and computationally efficient tools such as (i) a mobile network of a small number of WMR sensors for detecting obstacles; (ii) Cardinal Cubic splines or Least Squares fits for modeling the formation boundaries based on this small network; and (iii) reference frames to ensure uniform spacing and velocity profiles along the ensemble. By these components a simple geometrical formation is developed for real time flock path planning of relatively large groups of small agents. To our best knowledge the proposed approach is novel and its effectiveness is verified by simulations in complex environments.",

Because microscopes which have a small observable area and are vulnerable to vibrations, images from hand-held microscopes are usually blurred. We propose a method of stabilizing images from a microscope which are affected by shaking, and we use the method to realize a mobile microscope. The method is based on high-speed visual feedback with an inclined image sensor for measuring the 3D movements of the microscope. We developed a prototype microscope system, without a built-in actuator, by employing this method. Experimental results showed that images from the hand-held microscope could be stabilized by our method.",

        "abstract": "In this work we tackle the road sign problem with reservoir computing (RC) networks. The T-maze task (a particular form of the road sign problem) consists of a robot in a T-shaped environment that must reach the correct goal (left or right arm of the T-maze) depending on a previously received input sign. It is a control task in which the delay period between the sign received and the required response (e.g., turn right or left) is a crucial factor. Delayed response tasks like this one form a temporal problem that can be handled very well by RC networks. Reservoir computing is a biologically plausible technique which overcomes the problems of previous algorithms such as backpropagation through time - which exhibits slow (or non-) convergence on training. RC is a new concept that includes a fast and efficient training algorithm. We show that this simple approach can solve the T-maze task efficiently.",

The new approach uses a constellation of different types of affine covariant regions to characterize a place. This type of representation permits a reliable and distinctive environment modeling. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a database of panoramic images from different rooms. Additionally, we compare different combinations of complementary feature region detectors to find the one that achieves the best results. Our experimental results show promising results for this new localization method. Additionally, similarly to what happens with single detectors, different combinations exhibit different strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation, suggesting that a context-aware method to combine the different detectors would improve the localization results.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the development and experimental evaluation of a complete model-aided inertial navigation system (INS) for underwater vehicles. The navigation system is novel in that accurate knowledge of the vehicle dynamics is utilized for aiding the INS, and the performance is evaluated using real data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Together with real-time sea current estimation, the output from a kinetic vehicle model describing the dynamics is integrated in the navigation system. The presented experimental results verify that with merely an addition of software and no added instrumentation, it is possible to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of an INS by utilizing the physical insight provided by a kinetic vehicle model. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first report on the implementation and experimental evaluation of a complete model-aided INS for underwater vehicle navigation. The proposed approach shows promise to improve underwater navigation capabilities both for systems lacking disparate velocity measurements, typically from a Doppler velocity log (DVL), and for systems where the need for redundancy and integrity is important, e.g. during sensor dropouts or failures, or in case of emergency navigation. The reported methodology is applicable to a large group of submersibles, as well as land and aerial crafts and robots.",

        "abstract": "We investigate modeling and recognition of object manipulation actions for the purpose of imitation based learning in robotics. To model the process, we are using a combination of discriminative (support vector machines, conditional random fields) and generative approaches (hidden Markov models). We examine the hypothesis that complex actions can be represented as a sequence of motion or action primitives. The experimental evaluation, performed with five object manipulation actions and 10 people, investigates the modeling approach of the primitive action structure and compares the performance of the considered generative and discriminative models.",

        "abstract": "Capitalizing on advances in CMOS and MEMS technologies, microrobots have the potential to dramatically change many aspects of medicine by navigating bodily fluids to perform targeted diagnosis and therapy. Onboard energy storage and actuation is very difficult at the microscale, but externally applied magnetic fields provide an unparalleled means of wireless power and control. Recent results have provided a model for accurate real-time control of soft-magnetic bodies with axially symmetric geometries. In this paper, we extend the model to consider the real-time control of assembled-MEMS devices that may have significantly more complex geometries. We validate the model through FEM and experiments. The model captures the characteristics of complex 3-D structures and allows us, for the first time, to consider full 6-DOF control of untethered devices, which can act as in vivo microrobots or as end-effectors of micromanipulation systems.",

We describe alternative methods for building interaction grids, first by recording instances of actual robot-robot interaction, and then by a much faster approximation method. The resulting maps of interaction likelihood can subsequently be used to modify the robot's behaviour to avoid interference. For example, we show how to automatically generate an aggression map for input to the aggressive display behaviour we have previously shown to be effective in interference reduction.",

Friction between the cable and the conduit makes the system nonlinear and accounts for major losses in tension transmission across the cable. This paper proposes an analytical model for a similar cable-conduit system and formulates the load transmission characteristics. The dynamic model uses discrete elements with friction losses and cable stretch calculated for each of the segments. The simulations predict backlash, cable slacking, and other nonlinear behavior. These results are verified with an experiment using two DC motors coupled with a cable-conduit pair. The drive motor is run in position control mode, while the load motor simulates a passive environment torsional spring. Experimental results are compared with the simulation and various implications are discussed.",

Inspired by biological fins, a passive plastic foil is attached to the IPMC beam. The model incorporates both IPMC actuation dynamics and the hydrodynamics, and captures the interactions between the IPMC actuator and the plastic foil. Experimental results have shown that the proposed model is able to predict the steady-state cruising speed of the robotic fish under a periodic actuation input. Since the majority of the model parameters are expressed in terms of fundamental physical properties and geometric dimensions, the model is expected to be instrumental in optimal design of the robotic fish.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots rely on the ability to sense the geometry of their local environment in order to avoid obstacles or to explore the surroundings. For this task, dedicated proximity sensors such as laser range finders or sonars are typically employed. Cameras are a cheap and lightweight alternative to such sensors, but do not directly offer proximity information. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning the relationship between range measurements and visual features extracted from a single monocular camera image. As the learning engine, we apply Gaussian processes, a non-parametric learning technique that not only yields the most likely range prediction corresponding to a certain visual input but also the predictive uncertainty. This information, in turn, can be utilized in an extended grid-based mapping scheme to more accurately update the map. In practical experiments carried out in different environments with a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera system, we demonstrate that our system is able to produce proximity estimates with an accuracy comparable to that of dedicated sensors such as sonars or infrared range finders.",

This paper formulates this search problem as a sequential probabilistic decision, which enables analysis and design of efficient and robust search control strategies. Imperfect detections of the target's possible locations are made by each search agent and shared with teammates. This information is used to update the evolving decision variable which represents the belief that the target is present in the region. The sequential decision-theoretic formulation presented in this paper provides an analytic framework to evaluate team search systems, as it includes a performance metric (time until decision), a measure of uncertainty (decision confidence thresholds) and imperfect information gathering (detection error). Strategies for cooperative search are evaluated in this context, and comparisons between homogeneous and hybrid search strategies are investigated in numerical studies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe development of the multi-axial micromanipulation organized by versatile micro robots using micro tweezers. To conduct microscopic operations, a unique locomotion mechanism composed of four piezoelectric actuators and two electromagnets is proposed. Here two legs arranged to cross each other are connected by four piezoelectric actuators so that the robot can move in any direction, i.e. in X and Y directions as well as rotate at the specified point precisely in the manner of an inchworm. To manipulate micro objects by these versatile micro robots, we have developed micro tweezers driven by 3 piezoelectric actuators. We have also developed an electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator to position the micro tweezers. The electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator rotates in yaw, roll and pitch directions independently. The electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator is a 1-inch cube size, so we can easily attach them on top of the versatile micro robots. We have developed the multi-axial micromanipulation organized by 3 versatile micro robots with the electromagnetic spherical micromanipulator and micro tweezers. The whole manipulation device is very small, 200 mm in diameter and 70 mm in height, so we can easily attach the device to micro processing instruments even if the working area is very small. This device has 21 DOF with less than 100 nm resolution. In experiments, we have demonstrated flexible handling of miniscule glass spheres with a diameter of 20 mum. We have also succeeded in fixing miniscule glass spheres on a sample table by an ultraviolet cure adhesive. The design procedure, basic performance and micro-assembling applications of this tiny robot are also discussed as part of the new field of micro robotics requiring especially high precision in certain regions.",

In case the adversary knows the patrol scheme of the robots and the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm, then in many cases it is possible to penetrate with probability 1. Therefore this paper considers a non-deterministic patrol scheme for the robots, such that their movement is characterized by a probability p. This patrol scheme allows reducing the probability of penetration, even under an assumption of a strong opponent that knows the patrol scheme. We offer an optimal polynomial-time algorithm for finding the probability p such that the minimal probability of penetration detection throughout the perimeter is maximized. We describe three robotic motion models, defined by the movement characteristics of the robots. The algorithm described herein is suitable for all three models.",

        "abstract": "Teams of mobile robots have been recently proposed as effective means of completing complex missions involving multiple tasks spatially distributed over a large area. A central problem in such domains is multi-robot routing, namely the problem of coordinating a team of robots in terms of the locations they should visit and the routes they should follow in order to accomplish their common mission. A typical assumption made in prior work on multi-robot routing is that robots are able to communicate uninterruptedly at all times independently of their locations. In this paper, we investigate the multi-robot routing problem under communication constraints, reflecting on the fact that real mobile robots have a limited range of communication and the requirement that connectivity must remain intact (even through relaying) during the entire mission. We propose four algorithms for this problem, all based on the same reactive framework, ranging from greedy to deliberative approaches. All algorithms are tested in various scenarios implemented using the Player-Stage robot simulation environment. Our results demonstrate that effective multi-robot routing can be achieved even under limited communication range with moderate loss compared to the case of infinite communication range.",

Key features of our approach are the ability to measure the real-world state of tracked vehicles, to hand off targets between cameras, and to track simultaneously from multiple views for improved handling of occlusions and scene clutter. Further, the proposed measurement model supports both full and partial measurements from any number of views, which are seamlessly fused by the estimation procedure. State constraints are incorporated in the tracking method, and issues caused by stop-and-go traffic and turning vehicles are addressed. The use of constrained estimation, the support of partial measurements, and the multi- view capability represents a significant improvement of our past efforts in automating the tracking of vehicles in challenging situations.",

        "abstract": "As concern for water resource availability increases, so does the need for intelligent aquatic sensing applications. The requirements, and complexity of such applications has also increased due to demands for: 1) broad spatial coverage and high spatial resolution monitoring, 2) capability for resolving fine scale spatiotemporal dynamics and 3) the need for rapid system deployment with semi-autonomous operation. With these criteria in mind, we present the Aquatic Networked InfoMechanical System (NIMS-AQ). NIMS-AQ was developed based on experience gained from engineering research and collaboration with aquatic scientists and environmental engineers during several in-field measurement campaigns [1], [2], [3]. In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of NIMSAQ through two experimental sensing campaigns encompassing both river and lake environments. Each campaign is centered around critical water resource monitoring objectives such as temperature, flow and contaminant levels. Experimental results for autonomous depth profiling using a submersible sonar system as well as adaptive sampling algorithms guided by phenomena models are presented herein. The found results conform with our objectives for rapid and systematic operation. Preliminary studies also indicate the systems viability for use with an Autonomous Iterative experiment Design for Environmental Applications (A-IDEA) methodology that is currently under development. The IDEA methodology [1] provides effective characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics in aquatic environments. A-IDEA, as it is to be implemented on the NIMS-AQ platform, is also described.",

However only a few research concerns on the two issues simultaneously. The difficulty for natural gesture-based human-robot interaction lies in that appearances of the same hand posture vary with different users from different viewing directions. In this paper, we propose a systematic feature selection approach based on Zernike moments and Isomap dimensionality reduction. A hierarchical classifier based on multivariate decision tree and piecewise linearization is developed to deal with the irregular distribution of the same hand postures. The proposed method is compared with other commonly used ones in hand posture recognition. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively identify different hand postures, irrespective of viewing directions and users.",

Initially, the posture of the omni-directional mobile robot is calculated by using the odometry information. Next, the position accuracy of the mobile robot is measured through comparison of the odometry information and the external sensor measurement. Finally, for successful navigation of the mobile robot, a motion planning algorithm that employs kinematic redundancy resolution method is proposed. Through experiments for multiple obstacles and multiple moving obstacles, the feasibility of the proposed navigation algorithm was verified.",

In order to localize well in environments with few landmarks, a robot must make full use of all the information provided to it. This paper moves towards this goal by studying the effects of incorporating line observations and negative information into the localization algorithm. We extend the general Monte Carlo localization algorithm to utilize observations of lines such as carpet edges. We also make use of the information available when the robot expects to see a landmark but does not, by incorporating negative information into the algorithm. We compare our implementations of these ideas to previous similar approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements through localization experiments performed both on a Sony AIBO ERS-7 robot and in simulation.",

Based on the control authority of these two CCD cameras, a suitable reference command including desired steering angle and translation velocity for the fuzzy decentralized variable structure control (FDVSC) in the client computer is on-line planned. Due to the delay of signal transmission through an internet network and wireless local area network (WLAN), suitable sampling time of the FDVSC is determined by the Quality of Service (QoS). The proposed control can track an on-line planning reference command without the requirement of a mathematical model of the CLMR. Only the information of the upper bound of system knowledge (including the dynamics of the CLMR, the delay feature of internet network and WLAN) is required to select the suitable scaling factors and the coefficients of switching surface so that an acceptable performance is achieved.",

In this paper, input shaping control is investigated to damp such unwanted flexible modes. We present a new design technique that creates long impulse sequences to adapt input shaping to systems with long sampling period and to compensate the resulting time delay. This makes the method feasible for industrial robots. In addition to the conventional input shaping which causes oscillations to stop only after applying the last impulse, we also minimize the quadratic control error until this time step is reached.",

        "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper arises from the development of a new framework, which has its inspiration in the mechanics of human navigation, for solving the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The proposed framework has specific relevance to vision based SLAM, in particular, small baseline stereo vision based SLAM and addresses several key issues relevant to the particular sensor domain. Firstly, as observed in the authors' earlier work, the particular sensing device has a highly nonlinear observation model resulting in inconsistent state estimations when standard recursive estimators such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or the Unscented variants are used. Secondly, vision based approaches tend to have issues related to large feature density, narrow field of view and the potential requirement of maintaining large databases for vision based data association techniques. The proposed Multi Map SLAM solution addresses the filter inconsistency issue by formulating the SLAM problem as a nonlinear batch optimization. Feature management is addressed through a two tier map representation. The two maps have unique attributes assigned to them. The Global Map (GM) is a compact global representation of the robots environment and the Local Map (LM) is exclusively used for low-level navigation between local points in the robot's navigation horizon.",

The goal is to coordinate a group of agents, considered as points in plane, to achieve a particular formation. The control law is designed using local attractive forces only where every agent knows the position of another two agents reducing the requirements of the control law implementation. The control law guarantees the convergence to the desired formation but does not avoid inter-agent collisions. A set of necessary and sufficient non-collision conditions based on the explicit solution of the closed-loop system is derived. The conditions allow to conclude from the initial conditions whether or not the agents will collide. The formal proof is presented for the case of three agents. The result is extended to the case of formations of three unicycles.",

The use of autonomous vehicles equipped with LADAR systems to conduct fully automatic surveys of terrain, infrastructures, or just to navigate safely in unknown environments, motivates the research on increasingly precise LADAR data acquisition and processing algorithms, for which the determination of the correct installation matrix is critical. The proposed methods rely on the minimization of the errors between the measured data set and a representation of the real calibration surface. To minimize this error, two nonlinear optimization techniques are proposed, one that estimates the ZYX Euler angles and a second that uses optimization tools for Riemannian manifolds enabling direct estimation of the installation matrix on the group of special orthogonal matrices SO(3). The proposed techniques are extensively tested and their effectiveness compared resorting to simulated LADAR data sets under realistic noise conditions.",

        "abstract": "A model-based FES would be very helpful for the adaptive movement synthesis of spinal-cord-injured patients. For the fulfillment, we need a precise skeletal muscle model to predict the force of each muscle. Thus, we have to estimate many unknown parameters in the nonlinear muscle system. The identification process is essential for the realistic force prediction. We previously proposed a mathematical muscle model of skeletal muscle which describes the complex physiological system of skeletal muscle based on the macroscopic Hill-Maxwell and microscopic Huxley concepts. It has an original skeletal muscle model to enable consideration for the muscular masses and the viscous frictions caused by the muscle-tendon complex. In this paper, we present an experimental identification method of biomechanical parameters using Sigma-Point Kalman Filter applied to the nonlinear skeletal muscle model. Result of the identification shows its effective performance. The evaluation is provided by comparing the estimated isometric force with experimental data with the stimulation of the rabbit medial gastrocnemius muscle. This approach has the advantage of fast and robust computation, that can be implemented for online application of FES control.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, nonlinear modeling of low cost force sensors is considered for force control applications in robotic or biomechanical applications. Commercial force sensors are often expensive, with a limited use in severe conditions such as the presence of a strong magnetic field. On the contrary, thin film piezoresistive sensors such as the Tekscan Flexiforce and the Interlink FSR sensors are of low cost and can be considered in such an environment. Only a few information is however available on their dynamic properties. We therefore provide an experimental study of their dynamic behavior, showing nonlinear properties. Identification is then achieved, and a compensation model is proposed. A force control experiment is finally presented to evaluate the compensation scheme.",

Because the ball easily slides away from the robot when the ball moves along a curve, dribbling control is more challenging than the normal mobile robot motion control problem. Based on an introduced reference point with respect to the robot body and a sophisticated planning method of robot pose, the nonlinear predictive control is used to steer the robot to follow the planned poses so as to prevent the ball from leaving the robot. Real-world experiments showed that nonlinear predictive control is capable of solving the pose following problem in a real-time application.",

This paper proposes a technique to generate autonomous motions based on consistency of object dynamics. The technique resolves two issues: construction of an object dynamics prediction model and evaluation of consistency. The authors utilize Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias to self-organize the dynamics, and link static images to the self-organized dynamics using a hierarchical neural network to deal with the first issue. For evaluation of consistency, the authors have set an evaluation function based on object dynamics relative to robot motor dynamics. Experiments have shown that the method is capable of predicting 90% of unknown object dynamics. Motion generation experiments have proved that the technique is capable of generating autonomous pushing motions that generate consistent rolling motions.",

        "abstract": "Daily life objects reveal natural similarities, which cannot be resolved with the perception of a single view. In this paper, we present an approach for object separation using active methods and multi-view object representations. By actively rotating an object, the coherence between controlled path, inner models, and percept is observed and used to reject implausible object hypotheses. Using the resulting object hypotheses, pose and object correspondence are determined. The proposed approach allows for the separation of different object candidates, which have similar views to the current percept. With the benefit of active methods the perceptual task can be solved using even coarse features, which facilitates a compact multi-view object representation. Furthermore, the approach is independent from a specific visual feature descriptor and thus suitable for multi-modal object recognition.",

Instead of directly using large numbers of SIFT features as visual landmarks, we first use a jigsaw puzzle image segmentation algorithm to segment the input scene image into regions that may correspond to objects or parts of objects. Based on these image regions, we further detect a set of salient objects to represent a place and only those SIFT descriptors that were contained in these salient objects were kept in the database. We also designed a range-tree data structure to organize these salient objects to increase the matching efficiency. Experiments show that place recognition can be achieved accurately and efficiently with these salient objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the detection and the geo-localization of obstacle in outdoor environment. The proposed approach exploits a geographical 3D model managed by a 3D Geographical Information System (3D-GIS) and a video camera. An image processing module is developed to match synchronized real image and virtual image. The real image is provided by an on-board camera and gives the real view of the scene seen by the vehicle whereas the virtual image is provided by the 3D-GIS. A centimetric LRK GPS provides an estimation of the geo-position of the vehicle, which is used to localized the vehicle in the geographical 3D model. Obstacle(s) are then detected and tracked by comparison between the real image that contain the obstacle(s) and the virtual image where obstacle(s) are absent. The developed method permits also to compute the distance between the camera and obstacle(s), as well as the geo-position of these detected obstacles. In order to validate the computed distance, a 2D ladar (laser range scanner) is used. A necessary condition to complete the comparison is to calibrate the camera and the ladar together. Experimental results with real data are presented in the final section.",

        "abstract": "We are developing a mobile robot capable of emulating general 6-degree-of-freedom spacecraft relative motion. The omni-directional base uses a trio of active split offset castor drive modules to provide smooth, holonomic, precise control of its motion. Encoders measure the rotations of the six wheels and the three castor pivots. We present a generic odometric algorithm using a least squares framework which is applicable to vehicles with two or more castors and apply it to our unique vehicle configuration. As the accuracy of odometry algorithms depends on the accuracy to which the model parameters are known, a method to perform calibration on the physical robot is needed. We present a geometric calibration method based solely on internal sensor measurements. We present a range of simulation results comparing our odometry results to other algorithms under various systematic and non-systematic errors. We evaluate the ability of our calibration method to accurately determine the true values of our system parameters. The odometry algorithm was also implemented and tested in hardware on our robotic platform. The results presented in the paper validate the calibration and odometry algorithms in both simulation and hardware.",

Odometry error can be categorized as systematic and non-systematic error. In this paper, we suggest a novel method to calibrate systematic error using inherent home positioning capability of home cleaning robot. The method is designed for a differential drive type and take advantage of Augmented extended Kalman Fil- ter(AKF) Algorithm to estimates systematic error parameters. Our approach has both characteristics of on-line and off-line. By simulation and experiment, we evaluate the method and the result shows that the proposed method gives odometry error reduction by several times.",

The main objective is to reproduce an imitated motion which should be as close as possible to the original human captured motion. To achieve this goal, the imitation problem is formulated as an optimization problem and the physical limits of the humanoid robot are considered as constraints. The optimization problem is then solved recursively by using an efficient dynamics algorithm, which allows the calculation of the gradient function with respect to the control parameters analytically. The simulation results using OpenHRP platform, which is a dynamical simulator for humanoid robot motions, have pointed out that the imitated motions preserve the salient characteristics of the original human captured motion. Moreover the optimization procedure converges well thanks to the analytical calculation of the gradient function.",

        "abstract": "Physical human-robot interaction requires the development of safe and dependable robots. This involves the mechanical design of lightweight and compliant manipulators and the definition of motion control laws that allow to combine compliant behavior in reaction to possible collisions, while preserving accuracy and performance of rigid robots in free space. In this framework, great attention has been given to robots manipulators with relevant elasticity at the joints/transmissions. While the modeling and control of robots with elastic joints of finite but constant stiffness is a well- established topic, few results are available for the case of robot structures with variable joint stiffness -mostly limited to the 1-dof case. We present here a basic control study for a general class of multi-dof manipulators with variable joint stiffness, taking into account different possible modalities for changing the joint stiffness on the fly by an additional set of commands. It is shown that nonlinear control laws, based either on static or dynamic state feedback, are able to exactly linearize the closed- loop equations and allow to simultaneously impose a desired behavior to the robot motion and to the joint stiffness in an decoupled way. Illustrative simulations results are presented.",

        "abstract": "It is known that a parallel manipulator with a singular configuration can gain one or more degrees of freedom and become uncontrollable. That is it might not reproduce a stable motion under a prescribed trajectory. However, it is proved experimentally that there is possible passing through the singular zones. This was simulated and shown on numerical examples and illustrated on several parallel structures. In this paper, we determine the optimal dynamic conditions generating a stable motion inside the singular zones. The obtained results show that the general condition for passing through a singularity can be defined as follows: the end-effector of the parallel manipulator can pass through the singular positions without perturbation of motion if the wrench applied on the end-effector by the legs, and external efforts of the manipulator are orthogonal to the twist along the direction of the uncontrollable motion. This condition is obtained from the inverse dynamics and analytically demonstrated by the study of the Lagrangian of a general parallel manipulator. Numerical simulations are carried out using the software ADAMS and validated by experimental tests.",

Subsequently, a mathematical explanation has been given by Malis (2004). In this paper, the proofs given by Malis are considered to deal with their validity. It will be shown that there is a limitation to the the validity of this method and some precautions should be taken, for adequate application of it. In other words, we will show that the use of ESM does not necessary ensures a better system behavior, especially in the cases where large rotational motions are considered.",

        "abstract": "The control and mechanical systems of an embodied agent should be tightly coupled so as to emerge useful functionalities such as adaptivity. This indicates that the mechanical system as well as the control system should be responsible for a certain amount of \u201ccomputation\u201d for generating the behavior. However, there still leaves much to be understood about to what extent \u201ccomputational offloading\u201d from the control system to the mechanical system should be achieved. In order to effectively consider this, here we particularly focus on a passive dynamic running biped whose behavior is generated purely from its mechanical system, and investigate how the body\u2019s properties influence the resulting behavior. Through the numerical simulations, we have found that two elastic parameters of its body, leg spring constant and hip coil spring constant, play a crucial role, and depending on which various kinds of stable gait patterns are generated. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been explicitly addressed so far. The results obtained are expected to shed a new light on to what extent the mechanical system should be responsible for generating the behavior.",

Stability of equilibrium postures is investigated under initial perturbations which may involve sliding or separation at the contacts. The frictional dynamics is formulated using the notion of contact modes, and the related problems of solution ambiguity and inconsistency are reviewed. The paper then uses the condition of strong equilibrium to eliminate ambiguities, and defines a new condition of kinematic-strong equilibrium which additionally eliminates frictional inconsistencies. It is then proven that strong equilibrium is necessary for stability of frictional equilibrium postures, and that kinematic-strong equilibrium guarantees finite-time recovery of an initially perturbed contact. The results are demonstrated on a reduced model of a rigid body having a variable center-of-mass and supported by two frictional contacts. A companion paper completes the analysis of this reduced problem by investigating the overall hybrid dynamics and deriving sufficient conditions for its stability.",

We approximate the multibody dynamic model with a linear discrete time system, and at each step solve a quadratic program in order to keep the output within a predefined set of constraints. The focus is on creating an efficient framework for forming and solving the underlying optimization problem. For that purpose we develop: a) a reliable guess for the active constraints at optimality; b) a fast way of generating an initial feasible point with respect to the set of constraints for each preview interval; c) a variable discretization sampling time. A simple implementation of a standard primal active set algorithm which exploits a \"hot start\" is used to demonstrate the advantages of the first point, while the latter one is verified using an existing dual solver.",

First, the existence of intrinsic kinematics constraints (or Donders' law, similarly to oculomotor system) for the human wrist during pointing tasks is verified. To this end, a novel approach based on a hand-held device is presented which allow assessing wrist movements without any mechanical loading. Second, similar pointing tasks are assessed by means of a state-of-the-art wrist robot, typically used in robot-mediated therapy as well as assessment tool. By comparing experimental results relative to the pointing task performed by healthy subjects with the hand-held device and with the robot, a loading effect on the performance due to the mechanisms of the robot is remarked. A functional requirement for the next generation of rehabilitation robots is thus provided.",

This is an important issue in collective and cooperative robotics where global positioning systems are not available, and the basic premise is the localization ability of the group. We prove that, giving a set of relative observations made by the robots, the unique non ambiguous pose estimation of the robot network in a deterministic way, is a NP-hard problem. This means that no polynomial-time algorithm can deterministically solve the unique pose estimation problem based on relative observations. The consequence is that no guaranty can be provided, in a polynomial time, that the possibly estimated poses of the robots, will correspond to the effective (actual) ones. The proof is based on complexity theory. We build appropriate polynomial-time reductions acting on the localization problem and leading to well known NP-hard problems. The paper gives some tracks to overcome this issue.",

        "abstract": "Robots are increasingly used to perform complex tasks, which often involve interaction and contact with unstructured environments. By identifying geometric uncertainties and the dynamic behavior of the environment on-line, the autonomy of intelligent robot systems can be considerably improved. This paper considers the 2D case of an industrial robot equipped with a probe to explore an unknown environment. The goal is to estimate from the measured end-effector position, velocity and forces not only the environmental contact dynamics parameters, but also geometric parameters such as the environment position and orientation, and the position of the probe end-point with respect to the robot end-effector. To this end, a Kalman filter based algorithm is proposed, which enforces physical constraints and which is executed in an event-triggered way to improve convergence and robustness. Experimental results illustrate the viability of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of incrementally optimizing constraint networks for maximum likelihood map learning. Our approach allows a robot to efficiently compute configurations of the network with small errors while the robot moves through the environment. We apply a variant of stochastic gradient descent and use a tree-based parameterization of the nodes in the network. By integrating adaptive learning rates in the parameterization of the network, our algorithm can use previously computed solutions to determine the result of the next optimization run. Additionally, our approach updates only the parts of the network which are affected by the newly incorporated measurements and starts the optimization approach only if the new data reveals inconsistencies with the network constructed so far. These improvements yield an efficient solution for this class of online optimization problems. Our approach has been implemented and tested on simulated and on real data. We present comparisons to recently proposed online and offline methods that address the problem of optimizing constraint network. Experiments illustrate that our approach converges faster to a network configuration with small errors than the previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "The authors present a novel approach to the task of autonomous terrain classification based on structured prediction. We consider the problem of learning a classifier that will accurately segment an image into \u201cobstacle\u201d and \u201cground\u201d patches based on supervised input. Previous approaches to this problem have focused mostly on local appearance; typically, a classifier is trained and evaluated on a pixel-bypixel basis, making an implicit assumption of independence in local pixel neighborhoods. We relax this assumption by modeling correlations between pixels in the submodular MRF framework. We show how both the learning and inference tasks can be simply and efficiently implemented-exact inference via an efficient max flow computation; and learning, via an averaged-subgradient method. Unlike most comparable MRFbased approaches, our method is suitable for implementation on a robot in real-time. Experimental results are shown that demonstrate a marked increase in classification accuracy over standard methods in addition to real-time performance.",

Our experimental results show that the combination of both sensors achieves the most successful way to open the door.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a multi-robot science exploration software architecture and system called the telesupervised adaptive ocean sensor fleet (TAOSF). TAOSF supervises and coordinates a group of robotic boats, the OASIS platforms, to enable in situ study of phenomena in the ocean/atmosphere interface, as well as on the ocean surface and sub-surface. The OASIS platforms are extended-deployment autonomous ocean surface vessels, whose development is funded separately by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). TAOSF allows a human operator to effectively supervise and coordinate multiple robotic assets using a multi-level autonomy control architecture, where the operating mode of the vehicles ranges from autonomous control to teleoperated human control. TAOSF increases data-gathering effectiveness and science return while reducing demands on scientists for robotic asset tasking, control, and monitoring. The first field application chosen for TAOSF is the characterization of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). We discuss the overall TAOSF architecture, describe field tests conducted under controlled conditions using rhodamine dye as a HAB simulant, present initial results from these tests, and outline the next steps in the development of TAOSF.",

This sensor applies a novel reflective light intensity modulation scheme using bent-tip optical fibers and a reflector to measure mechanical response of the soft tissue when it interacts with the sensor. By adopting such optical fibers to detect minute deflection of a flexible cylindrical structure at the reflective edge of the reflector, good sensitivity for the force detection can be obtained. The prototype described in this document has demonstrated that it can detect the tissue interaction forces in the axial direction and identify variations in tissue stiffness. The maximum force range that can be detected by the sensor is 3 N. The measurement resolution is 0.02 N.",

However, each application requires a specific placement of the cameras for best performance. Therefore, determining this placement has been a problem of much work in the field of computer vision. However, most of the current approaches deal with a scene that does not change once the cameras have been placed. In this paper a system is developed and successfully tested that can not only distribute cameras around a scene such that the observability is improved, but can reorganize the cameras if the pattern of activity within a scene changes with time. The cameras can be distributed in either two or three dimensional space, and this was tested with the use of mobile robotic cameras and stationary cameras.",

        "abstract": "Optimal control of robotic systems with logical constraints is an instance of a hybrid optimal control problem. It has been traditionally treated as a mixed-integer programming problem (MIP) which is of combinatorial complexity. This paper proposes a new approach for transforming logical constraints into inequality and equality constraints involving only continuous variables. In this way the hybrid optimal control problem is converted to a smooth optimal control problem that can in turn be solved using traditional nonlinear programming methods, thereby dramatically reducing the computational complexity of finding the solution. We illustrate the techniques by solving an optimal path planning problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with collision avoidance. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a semi-active biped which combines the merits of both powered and passive bipeds is proposed. The semi-activeness of the biped is due to the fact that, during most of a walking cycle, only half of the joints are actuated, and the other half remain unactuated, but have passive joint springs to induce their motions. To devise a systematic design methodology for the biped, its dynamics as well as the walking constraints are carefully studied. Furthermore, an optimization procedure is proposed to compute the optimal trajectories for the actuated joints and spring constants which can lead to minimum energy consumption. The feasibility of the proposed biped is verified by hardware implementation. Experiments indicate that the semi-active biped consumes 80% less the electrical power of the powered biped that performs the same gait and is more energy-efficient than several state-of-the-art bipeds.",

        "abstract": "The problem of showing that Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) are useful in determining near optimal trajectories for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) known as gliders is investigated. This paper extends our preliminary results in couple ways. First, the ocean current flows are modeled by 3D B-spline functions in which the input variables are latitude, longitude and time, and the output variable is the ocean current velocity in 2D. The 3D (2D and time-varying) B-spline model of the ocean current is utilized in the Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) algorithm to find the optimal trajectory of the glider. The trajectories found using the 2D and time-varying B-spline ocean flows model are compared with the trajectories from 2D B-spline model in which the time is assumed to be constant in the ocean current model. In the second part of the paper, the dynamical glider model is established and controlled by gyroscopic forces rather than the simplified kinematic glider model as in the previous work. Finally, numerical solutions of several scenarios and animations of glider trajectories are presented. The results show that the 2D and time-varying B-spline ocean model not only can make the whole trajectory generating process much easier, but also the glider can reach the same destination in a comparable time and with much less energy than it does with the previous 2D ocean current model for both the kinematic and dynamic glider models. Both of the kinematic and dynamic glider optimal trajectories, successfully generated with 2D and time varying ocean current B-spline models, are shown to correspond to LCS.",

Based on the lumped model, the efficient models for kinematics, statics and dynamics of the XY stage have been obtained, which are verified by resorting to the finite element analysis via ANSYS software package. Moreover, the stage dimensions are optimized through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach, and a manipulator with performances satisfying the requirements is generated. Furthermore, a prototype of the manipulator has been fabricated via the wire-EDM process. The developed micromanipulator is expected to be adopted in practical applications.",

Without an absolute reference, it is however difficult to prevent drift when estimating motion. To prevent orientation drift, our approach exploits typical features of indoor environments: Straight walls that are parallel or orthogonal to each other. Our idea is to detect walls in monocular depth measurements and to correct odometry obtained from matching successive images and from inertial measurements, such that the observed walls are aligned with the main orientation estimated from the map that is being built. The experimental results indicate that orientation drift can be prevented and orientation uncertainty can be reduced greatly when applying the proposed orthogonal wall correction. This can make the difference between reliable mapping and failure.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an intelligent decision-making agent to assist wheelchair users in their daily navigation activities. Several navigational techniques have been successfully developed in the past to assist with specific behaviours such as \"door passing\" or \"corridor following\". These shared control strategies normally require the user to manually select the level of assistance required during use. Recent research has seen a move towards more intelligent systems that focus on forecasting users' intentions based on current and past actions. However, these predictions have been typically limited to locations immediately surrounding the wheelchair. The key contribution of the work presented here is the ability to predict the users' intended destination at a larger scale, that of a typical office arena. The systems relies on minimal user input - obtained from a standard wheelchair joystick - in conjunction with a learned Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), to estimate and subsequently drive the user to his destination. The projection is constantly being updated, allowing for true user- platform integration. This shifts users' focus from fine motor- skilled control to coarse control broadly intended to convey intention. Successful simulation and experimental results on a real wheelchair robot demonstrate the validity of the approach.",

With distributed task allocation as a case study, we show how optimal control parameters leading to a desired steady-state task distribution for two fully-distributed algorithms can be found even if the parameters of the system are unknown. First, a reactive algorithm in which robots change states independently from each other and which leads to a linear macroscopic model describing the dynamics of the system is considered. Second, a threshold-based algorithm where robots change states based on the number of other robots in this state and which leads to a non-linear model is investigated. Whereas analytical results can be obtained for the linear system, the optimization of the non-linear controller is performed numerically. Finally, we show using stochastic simulations that whereas the presented methodology and models work best if the swarm size is large, useful results can already be obtained for team-sizes below a hundred robots. The methodology presented can be applied to scenarios involving the control of large numbers of entities with limited computational and communication abilities as well as a tight energy budget, such as swarms of robots from the centimeter to nanometer range or sensor networks.",

To program optimal collision-free motions requires a choice of the appropriate notion of optimality. We work in the case where each robot wishes to travel to a goal while optimizing elapsed time and consider vector-valued (Pareto) optima. Earlier work demonstrated a finite number of Pareto-optimal classes of motion plans when the robots are subjected to velocity bounds but no acceleration bounds. This paper demonstrates that when velocity and acceleration are bounded, the finiteness result still holds for certain systems, e.g., two robots; however, in the general case, the acceleration bounds can lead to continua of Pareto optima. We give examples and explain the result in terms of the geometry of phase space.",

We use ideas from noncooperative game theory together with previous results from complete barrier coverage - the problem of completely preventing undetected intrusion - to develop new methods that solve this problem for the specific case of bounded-range line-of-sight sensors in a two-dimensional polygonally-bounded region. Our solution constructs equilibrium strategies for the intruder and guards, and calculates the level of partial coverage.",

These relative measurements are shown to improve the quality of the navigation solution when GPS is available, and they are shown to keep the navigation solution converged in extended GPS blackouts. Measurements are incorporated with careful hypothesis testing and error modeling to account for non-Gaussian errors committed by vision-based detection algorithms. The PosteriorPose algorithm is implemented and validated in real-time on Cornell University\u2019s 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge entry; experimental data is presented showing the algorithm outperforming a tightly-coupled GPS / Inertial Navigation solution both in full GPS coverage and in an extended GPS blackout.",

        "abstract": "We present heuristic algorithms for pruning large sets of candidate paths or trajectories down to smaller subsets that maintain desirable characteristics in terms of overall reachability and path length. Consider the example of a set of candidate paths in an environment that is the result of a forward search tree built over a set of actions or behaviors. The tree is precomputed and stored in memory to be used online to compute collision-free paths from the root of the tree to a particular goal node. In general, such a set of paths may be quite large, growing exponentially in the depth of the search tree. In practice, however, many of these paths may be close together and could be pruned without a loss to the overall problem of path-finding. The best such pruning for a given resulting tree size is the one that maximizes path diversity, which is quantified as the probability of the survival of paths, averaged over all possible obstacle environments. We formalize this notion and provide formulas for computing it exactly. We also present experimental results for two approximate algorithms for path set reduction that are efficient and yield desirable properties in terms of overall path diversity. The exact formulas and approximate algorithms generalize to the computation and maximization of spatio-temporal diversity for trajectories.",

To that end we designed and constructed the brake actuated manipulator (BAM) with 2m3 workspace. Dissipative devices are capable of simulating virtual objects through resistance analogous to active devices. However, the challenge remains for path guidance paradigms because neither impedance nor admittance control can be used to actively steer limb movements. Here we first define a new way to create and track a path during path guidance with a twinned vector field to allow bilateral motion. Using this new path definition three controllers, velocity ratio, force cancelling, and force mapping are compared with and without visual feedback. The results indicate that both force controllers provide better guidance over velocity control; the force mapping technique resulted in the smoothest limb trajectory. The presence of visual feedback was found to be a critical factor for path guidance using dissipative devices.",

        "abstract": "Haptic interfaces are used increasingly in medical systems and related applications, but relatively little is known on the effectiveness of these interfaces. This paper reports a study on the perception of haptic force magnitude during hand movements. Discrimination thresholds were determined for a reference force of 1.5N in five different directions (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0) with respect to the movement direction. We found that force discrimination thresholds detected were significantly higher during hand movement than those reported previously without hand movement, indicating that the perception of force magnitude is impaired by hand movement. The results also show there is no significant difference between the discrimination thresholds found for fast (28mm/s) and slow (14mm/s) hand movements. Finally, we found that the perception of force magnitude is impaired at a force direction of 45\u00b0 with respect to the hand movement, indicating the existence of an oblique effect.",

        "abstract": "The water runner robot is designed to run on the surface of water in a manner similar to the basilisk lizard. To do so, it must generate a lift force greater than its weight by slapping and stroking its foot through the water, creating an air cavity in the process. In addition, it must remove its foot before this cavity collapses. Basilisk lizards deal with this problem by folding their feet during retraction from the air cavity to avoid prematurely collapsing the cavity and generating excess drag. Several different passive foot designs for the water runner were analyzed to determine which had the largest lift and created the least amount of drag. Feet with folding sections which collapse during retraction and spring back into place once the foot has exited the water were found to work best. Those feet which allowed air to pass through during retraction provided the least net lift. Elliptic feet with their major axis in line with the direction of running performed better than simple circular feet. Consequences of these results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "For a mobile robot that interacts with humans such as a home assistant or a tour guide robot, tracking a particular person among multiple persons is a fundamental, yet challenging task. Uniquely identifying characteristics such as a person's face, may not be visible consistently enough to be used as the sole form of identification. Rather, it may be useful to also track more frequently visible, but perhaps less uniquely identifying characteristics such as a person's clothes. After learning various characteristics of a person, the tracking system is required to autonomously update itself with additional training data, since the learned features may change over space and time due to the mobile nature of the robot. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for merging multiple, heterogeneous sub-classifiers designed to track and associate different characteristics of a person being tracked. These heterogeneous classifiers give feedback to each other by identifying additional online training data for one another, thus improving the performance of each classifier and the accuracy of the overall system. Our algorithm has been fully implemented and tested on a Segway base.",

        "abstract": "Flexible endoscopes are used in many surgical procedures and diagnostic exams, like in gastroscopy or coloscopy. They have also been used recently for new surgical procedures using natural orifices called NOTES. While these procedures are very promising for the patients, they are quite awkward for the surgeons. The flexible endoscope allows the access to operating areas which are not easily reachable, with small or no incisions; but the manipulation of the system is complex. In order to help the practicians during NOTES or classical interventions with flexible endoscopes, we propose to motorize the system so as to partially robotize the movements. This paper presents the problems in the use of the flexible endoscope and explains how the system can be used to stabilize the endoscope on an area of interest despite physiological motions and therefore to improve the manipulation of the system.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a piercing based grasping by using the self-tightening effect of objects with elasticity. We suppose a piercing hand with palm where the piercing motion by needles can be independently achieved irrespective of the palm motion. The palm first approaches and touches with the object, with a slight pushing motion. This motion produces an increase of potential energy of object. After the motion, the needles pierce the object. When the object is lifted up, the accumulated potential energy is released and the object tries to recover the original shape under the piercing condition. We found a particular mechanical configuration between the object and the needle, under which the constraint of object is tightened due to the object deformation during the release of the potential energy. In order to confirm the robustness of the proposed method, we have done a couple of experiments. The results show that the proposed method keeps an extremely high robustness compared with the other piercing methods.",

        "abstract": "Pose estimation of outdoor robots presents some distinct challenges due to the various uncertainties in the robot sensing and action. In particular, global positioning sensors of outdoor robots do not always work perfectly, causing large drift in the location estimate of the robot. To overcome this common problem, we propose a new approach for global localization using place recognition. First, we learn the location of some arbitrary key places using odometry measurements and GPS measurements only at the start and the end of the robot trajectory. In subsequent runs, when the robot perceives a key place, our fixed-lag smoother fuses odometry measurements with the relative location to the key place to improve its pose estimate. Outdoor mobile robot experiments show that place recognition measurements significantly improve the estimate of the smoother in the absence of GPS measurements.",

Without accurate global positioning, the vehicle\u2019s ability to localize itself varies across the environment, since different environmental features provide different degrees of localization. If the vehicle plans a path without regard to how well it can localize itself along that path, it runs the risk of becoming lost. We use the Belief Roadmap (BRM) algorithm [1], an information-space extension of the Probabilistic Roadmap algorithm, to plan vehicle trajectories that incorporate sensing. We show that the original BRM can be extended to use the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and describe a sampling algorithm that minimizes the number of samples required to find a good path. Finally, we demonstrate the BRM path-planning algorithm on the helicopter, navigating in an indoor environment with a laser range-finder.",

The system under consideration is represented by a hemispherical object that can roll without slipping or spinning on the plane. Under the constraints imposed on the size of the contact area, the construction of motion can be regarded as a problem of parallel parking in a finite number of movement steps. A motion planning algorithm, realizing the movement steps by tracing smooth figure eights on the hemisphere, is introduced. To generate asymmetric figure eights, a generalization of the Viviani curve is proposed. An exceptional case of the algorithm, corresponding to a spinning maneuver, is constructed with the use of the Cassini curve. The convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and its computational feasibility is verified under simulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the maximal independent contact region for two-fingered force- closure grasp of a rigid object in 2D. Existing methods for optimizing this criterion considered only independent graspable regions on a given pair of edges. We propose an algorithm that takes nearby edges into consideration so that larger independent contact regions can be obtained. Our method takes the input polygons, computes graspable regions for each pair of edges, merge all adjacent regions together, and then find the best independent contact region inscribed in those regions. Two different criteria to define the best independent contact region are studied. The first criterion maximizes area of the axis-parallel rectangle in the configuration space, while the other criterion maximizes the smaller side's length of the rectangle. For a given object with n vertices, the first criterion can be optimized using the algorithm from Karen Daniels et al. in O(n2 log2 n) time, while the other criterion can be optimized using the algorithm from Evanthia Papadopoulou and D. T. Lee in O(n2 log n) time.",

        "abstract": "The pose detection of three-dimensional (3-D) objects from two-dimensional (2-D) images is an important issue in computer vision and robotics applications. Specific examples include automated assembly, automated part inspection, robotic welding, and human robot interaction, as well as a host of others. Eigendecomposition is a common technique for dealing with this issue and has been applied to sets of correlated images for this purpose. Unfortunately, for the pose detection of 3-D objects, a very large number of correlated images must be captured from many different orientations. As a result, the eigendecomposition of this large set of images is very computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method for capturing images of objects from many locations by sampling S2 appropriately. Using this spherical sampling pattern, the computational burden of computing the eigendecomposition can be reduced by using the spherical harmonic transform to \"condense\" information due to the correlation in S2. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm for approximating the eigendecomposition based on the spherical harmonic transform analysis. Experimental results are presented to compare and contrast the algorithm against the true eigendecomposition, as well as quantify the computational savings.",

Long-term kyphosis will not only affect the persons' appearance, but also result in thoracic deformity accompanied by pain. In this paper, we introduce a cost-effective shoe-integrated system which mainly consists of 8 force sensing resistors (FSRs) for gathering the pressure information under the 8 bony prominences. Based on the gathered plantar pressure information, the methodology of cascade neural networks with node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering (CNN-NDEKF) is applied for training the model of detecting the gait pattern associated with postural kyphosis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient. This device is of particular significance to provide feedback in the application of postural kyphosis rectification.",

In distributed consensus algorithm methods [1\u20133], and leader-follower structures [4] the robots are explicitly assigned positions within the desired formation. By contrast, artificial potential function (APF) control [5\u20139] generally does not specify a formation explicitly but rather drives the robots down the negative gradient of a potential field such that a formation emerges at a global or local minimum. The ad hoc emergence of the formation has several benefits, especially for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles: It allows for spontaneous adaptation of the formation to addition and removal of vehicles, and it allows for truly homogeneous control for each agent since no hierarchy or unique assignment in a constraint graph is needed.",

        "abstract": "In order to perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery, a stationary heart is necessary. A human cannot achieve manual tracking of the complex heartbeat motion. Robotics technology can overcome such limitations. In the robotic-assisted beating heart surgery, the robot actively cancels heart motion by closely following a point of interest on the heart surface-a process called active relative motion canceling. As a result, surgeon can operate on the beating heart as if it is stationary. In this paper, a generalized estimation algorithm, that uses an adaptive filter to generate future position estimates is studied. The predictor is parameterized on-line and adaptively to minimize the prediction error in the mean-square sense. The predictor is evaluated using a 3-degree- of-freedom test-bed system and prerecorded heart motion data.",

        "abstract": "There is a real need in the robotics and wireless sensor network (WSN) communities for the estimation of the geolocation of wireless agents. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI), a common metric in most networking hardware, has been reputed as a very unreliable method for doing the job, due to its vulnerability to environmental factors. Nevertheless, it still remains as the most prevalent estimator of distance between agents on many research projects. Multipath fading, shadowing and other effects that the environment exerts over a signal while propagating are regarded as the main cause of such vulnerability. Although some success has been obtained using RSSI outdoors where the effects are less noticeable, indoor settings remain an unconquered territory. The main motivation of this paper is to establish whether, in real time applications, the use of preprocessing techniques over partial raw collected data helps the RSSI to be a suitable estimator of distance. We propose one such technique and the results suggest that its use may indeed assist the obtainment of more accurate distance estimations while using RSSI.",

        "abstract": "Modern probabilistic modeling has revolutionized the design and implementation of machine vision systems. There are now numerous instances of systems that can see stereoscopically in depth, or separate foreground from background, or accurately excise objects of a particular class, all in real time. Each of those three vision functionalities will be demonstrated in the lecture. The underlying advances in system design and performance owe much to probabilistic frameworks for inference in images. In particular, the Markov Random Field (MRF), which first appeared in image processing in the 70s, has staged a resounding comeback in the last decade. The MRF is a mechanism, borrowed from statistical physics, for expressing prior properties of images, such as smoothness and spatial coherence. Despite its considerable generality, the MRF has proved nonetheless to be remarkably tractable when used in inference systems, as the lecture will explain.",

        "abstract": "Researchers have addressed the localization problem for mobile robots using many different kinds of sensors, including rangefinders, cameras, and odometers. In this paper, we consider localization using a robot that is virtually \"blind\", having only a clock and contact sensor at its disposal. This represents a drastic reduction in sensing requirements, even in light of existing work that considers localization with limited sensing. We present probabilistic techniques that represent and update the robot's position uncertainty and algorithms to reduce this uncertainty. We demonstrate the experimental effectiveness of these methods using a Roomba autonomous vacuum cleaner robot in laboratory environments.",

An LDP program is a collection of LDPs with associated actions which are triggered on any subensemble that matches the predicate. The result is a reactive programming language which efficiently and concisely supports ensemble-level programming. We demonstrate the utility of LDP by implementing three common, but diverse, modular robotic tasks.",

In this paper, we describe one approach to modeling support friction within a two-dimensional environment consisting of a single robot finger pushing objects on a table. Instead of explicitly modeling the friction distribution between the object and the table, we learn the mapping between pushes and the motion of the object using an online, memory-based model using local regression. The resulting manipulation map implicitly describes the support friction without a complex model. We also describe methods of acquiring object shape and localizing the object using a proximity sensor. Results are presented for objects with different friction distributions.",

ROCR is a pendular two-link, serial chain robot that utilizes alternating hand-holds and an actuated tail to propel itself upward in a climbing style based on observation of human climbers and brachiating gibbons. ROCR's bio-inspired oscillating climbing strategy is simple and efficient. This robot is intended for autonomous surveillance and inspection on sheer vertical surfaces. Potential locomotion gait strategies were investigated in simulation using Working Model 2D. Strategy comparisons were drawn on a basis of climbing rate and energy efficiency. Simulation results show the feasibility and relative merits of these climbing gait strategies and compare them to the potential energy gained while climbing. A first generation ROCR design, having physical parameters based on simulation analysis, that utilizes actuated permanent magnet grippers and a geared-motor actuated tail was fabricated. Magnetic grippers are used for this initial prototype to facilitate investigating the robots climbing efficiency. Several climbing gaits which showed promise in simulation were implemented in the prototype. ROCR is a lightweight, flexible, self-contained robot with onboard microcontroller, tilt and acceleration sensing, power supply and wireless communication. We conclude with plans to evolve the simulation and design of the robot and plans for testing the prototype.",

Basically, a moving fovea in combination with a multi-resolution representation is created from a pair of input images given by a stereo head, that reduces hundreds of times the amount of information from the original images. With this new theoretical approach we are able to compute several feature maps, including several filters, stereo matching, and motion, in real time, that is at more than 30 frames per second. As the main contribution, the moving fovea allows, most of the time, a robot to avoid performing physical motion with the cameras in order to get a desirable region in the images center. We present mathematical formalization of the moving fovea approach, the algorithms, and details of the implementation of such schema. We validate it with experimental results. This approach has demonstrated to be very useful to robotics vision.",

On the basis of a new proximity distance computation method which ensures having continuous gradient, a new controller in the velocity domain is proposed. The gradient continuity encompasses no jump in the generated command. Included in a stack of tasks architecture, this controller has been implemented on the humanoid platform HRP-2 and experienced in a grasping task while walking and avoiding collisions with the environment and auto-collisions.",

Most of the input devices are ON/OFF (digital) type for the control of equipments. Considering the application of electrically powered wheelchair, the ON/OFF type interface is not desirable. Because the control of powered wheelchair needs preciseness and quickness for safe operation. A new input device using breath pressure is proposed for such purposes. The paper examines basic performances of human breath pressure control as an analog input device. Then possibility of two-dimensional input device by the breath pressure is discussed for the control of powered wheelchair. Basic experiments to study performance of the two-dimensional analog input device by breath pressure for an operation of the powered wheelchair are shown.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel technique for implementing Clothoidal real-time paths for mobile robots. As first step, rational Bezier curves are obtained as approximation of the Fresnel integrals. By rescaling, rotating and translating the previously computed RBC, an on-line Clothoidal path is obtained. In this process, coefficients, weights and control points are kept invariant. This on-line approach guarantees that an RBC has the same behavior as the original Clothoid using a low curve order. The resulting Clothoidal path allows any two arbitrary poses to be joined in a plane. RBCs working as Clothoids are also used to search for the shortest bounded-curvature path with a significant computational cost reduction. In addition to this, the proposed technique is tested on a real mobile robot for trajectory generation and kinematic control. To the authors' knowledge, the present approach is the first technique which allows real-time Clothoidal path computation.",

        "abstract": "Learning inverse kinematics has long been fascinating the robot learning community. While humans acquire this transformation to complicated tool spaces with ease, it is not a straightforward application for supervised learning algorithms due to non-convex learning problem. However, the key insight that the problem can be considered convex in small local regions allows the application of locally linear learning methods. Nevertheless, the local solution of the problem depends on the data distribution which can result into inconsistent global solutions with large model discontinuities. While this problem can be treated in various ways in offline learning, it poses a serious problem for online learning. Previous approaches to the real-time learning of inverse kinematics avoid this problem using smart data generation, such as the learner biasses its own solution. Such biassed solutions can result into premature convergence, and from the resulting solution it is often hard to understand what has been learned in that local region. This paper improves and solves this problem by presenting a learning algorithm which can deal with this inconsistency through re-weighting the data online. Furthermore, we show that our algorithms work not only in simulation, but we present real-time learning results on a physical Mitsubishi PA-10 robot arm.",

We consider the case in which each agent navigates independently without explicit communication with other agents. Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation-free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.",

In this control method, the robots move as a group inside a desired region while maintaining a minimum distance among themselves. Various shapes of desired region can be formed by choosing the appropriate objective functions. The robots do not need to have specific identities since the proposed controller does not need specific orders of robots within the group. Therefore, the system is scalable since any robot can come in or go out of the group without affecting the system. Lyapunov-like function is presented for convergence analysis of the multi-robot systems. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "Hopping sensors are a class of mobile sensors whose mobility design are inspired by creatures such as grasshoppers. Such sensors are able to maintain mobility in harsh terrains but may lack movement accuracy of those sensors that are powered by wheels. We examine the opportunities and challenges for utilizing the mobility of low cost hopping sensors to ensure coverage and maintain energy efficiency within a sensing field. We focus on the problem of transporting a number of hopping sensors from multiple sources to a destination. Probabilistic methods are used to contain the movement inaccuracies along the hopping course. We also consider the impact of wind under an aerodynamic setting. Two transport schemes are designed to minimize the number of hops needed while considering other constraints, such as sustaining the capability of relocating sensors within the whole network. In one scheme we use upper and lower hopping limits to apply the network mobility constraints. The other scheme uses a balancing coefficient to construct a new optimization target to meet the requirement of path optimality and network mobility dynamically. Simulation results show that both schemes work well regardless of the wind factors, while the dynamic scheme is also shown to be resilient to topological changes of the network.",

In outdoor environments, it is often the case that scenes taken by a camera are deteriorated because of adherent noises such as waterdrops on the surface of the lens-protecting glass of the camera. To solve this problem, our method takes advantage of image sequences captured with a moving camera. The method makes a spatio-temporal image to extract the regions of adherent noises by examining differences of track slopes in cross section images between adherent noises and other objects. Finally, regions of noises are eliminated by replacing with image data corresponding to object regions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",

Results show that with an IMU the true scale of the map becomes observable over time and the use of a square root information filter allows the effect of initial scale biases to be removed completely from the solution resulting in an unbiased solution no matter what the initial scale assumptions are.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents two new approaches to planning with uncertainty in position that achieve better performance than existing techniques and that are able to incorporate changes in the environment in near real-time. Both approaches reuse previous searches and replan when changes in the environment are detected. The first approach, called replanning with prior map updates, assumes that changes in the prior map originate from the same source as the original prior map. Therefore, the updates are registered with the existing map, but not with the position of the robot. The resulting path after applying the updates is the same as if the updates had been present in the original prior map. The second approach, called replanning with sensor updates, assumes that changes in the prior map originate from on-board sensors. Therefore, the updates are registered with the robot, but not with the existing map. The resulting path after applying the updates is not the same path that would be found if the updates had taken place in the original prior map. Replanning with prior map updates achieves a speed-up to one order of magnitude with respect to forward planning from scratch, while replanning with sensor updates achieves a speedup of almost two orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a compliance control law for kinematically redundant manipulators is proposed. The controller contains a Cartesian compliance part and a nullspace compliance part which are complemented by a power-conserving decoupling term. The approach deliberately avoids inertia shaping in order to obtain a control law which does not require the measurement of external forces and becomes less sensitive with respect to model uncertainties. While the controller formulation explicitly uses nullspace velocity coordinates, no integration of these velocities is required. Except for the kinematic singularities of the manipulator\u2019s Jacobian matrix, no further algorithmic singularities are introduced. Asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is shown by utilizing semi-definite Lyapunov functions. Finally, a short planar simulation study is presented which validates the effectiveness of the approach.",

A clustering algorithm is included in the filter to increase the robustness and adaptability of the multimodal estimation task. To preserve identity of the robot from the set of tracked objects, odometry readings are used to compute a Maximum Likelihood (ML) global trajectory identification.

        "abstract": "Breast biopsy guided by imaging techniques such as ultrasound is widely used to evaluate suspicious masses within the breast. The current procedure allows the physician to determine the location and extent of a tumor in the patient breast before inserting the needle. However, there are several problems with this procedure: the complex interaction dynamics between the needle force and the breast tissue will likely displace the tumor from its original position necessitating multiple insertions, causing surgeons' fatigue, patient's discomfort, and compromising the integrity of the tissue specimen. In this work, we present a new concept for real-time manipulation of a tumor using a robotic controller that monitors the image of the tumor to generate appropriate external force to position the tumor at a desired location. The idea here is to demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate a tumor in real-time by applying controlled external force in an automated way such that the tumor does not deviate from the path of the needle. A laboratory experiment has been presented on a phantom that demonstrates the essence of this concept. The success of this approach has the potential to reduce the number of attempts a surgeon makes to capture the desired tissue specimen, minimize tissue damage, improve speed of biopsy, and reduce patient discomfort.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we focus on the problem of assigning robots to places in a desired formation, considering random initial locations of the robots. Since we use a leader-follower strategy, we also address the task of choosing the leader to each follower. The result is a formation matrix that describes the relation between the robots and the desired formation shape. Simple algorithms are defined, that are based on the minimization of the distances of robots to places in the formation. All these algorithms are implemented in a decentralized way. We assume that communication is possible, but the requirements are of very-low bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Despite all the progress that has been made in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, traditional approaches seem unsuitable to build truly intelligent robots, exhibiting human-like behaviours. Many authors agree that the source of intelligence is, to a great extent, the use of a huge memory, where sequences of events that guide our later behaviour are stored. Inspired by that idea, our approach is to navigate a robot using sequences of images stored in a Sparse Distributed Memory-a kind of associative memory based on the properties of high dimensional binary spaces, which, in theory, exhibits some human-like behaviours. The robot showed good ability to correctly follow most of the sequences learnt, with small errors and good immunity to the kidnapped robot problem.",

The objective of this work is thus to devise distributed algorithms that allow agents to dynamically discover and maintain short evacuation routes connecting emergency exits to critical cells in the area. We propose two Evacuation Route Discovery mechanisms, Agent2Tag-ERD and Tag2Tag-ERD, and show how they can be seamlessly integrated with existing exploration algorithms, like Ants, MDFS and Brick&Mortar. We then examine the interplay between the tasks of area exploration and evacuation route discovery; our goal is to assess whether the exploration algorithm influences the length of evacuation paths and the time that they are first discovered. Finally, we perform an extensive simulation to assess the impact of the area topology on the quality of discovered evacuation paths.",

Three different schemes of therapy in VR have been tested in the clinical evaluation trial, which was conducted at the Santa Chiara Hospital in Pisa with nine chronic stroke patients. The results of this clinical trial, both in terms of patients performance improvements in the proposed exercises and in terms of improvements in the standard clinical scales which have been used to monitor patients progresses will be reported and discussed throughout the paper. It is to be noted that statistically significant improvements have been demonstrated in terms of Fugl-Meyer scores, Ashworth scale and increments of active and passive ROMs on shoulder, elbow and wrist joints of the impaired limb.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the design of a novel closed- loop trajectory tracking controller for an underactuated robotic airship having 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) and 3 controls, on forward, yaw and pitch motions using two side thrusters. A backstepping methodology is adopted as a design tool, since it is suitable for the cascaded nature of the vehicle dynamics. It also offers design flexibility and robustness against parametric uncertainties which are often encountered in aerodynamic modeling and air stream disturbances. Indeed, in our simulations we assume a 10% error in all dynamic parameters and yet the controller performs position, orientation, linear and angular velocities tracking successfully. We also impose an additional air stream disturbance and the controller corrects the vehicle's trajectory successfully too.",

        "abstract": "Gaining access to the peritoneal cavity through a natural orifice is potentially the next paradigm shift in minimally invasive surgery. Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) provides distinct patient advantages, but is surgically challenging. Access to the peritoneal cavity is limited by the size and complex geometry of the natural lumen, and existing tools do not adequately address these constraints. A miniature in vivo robot with two \"arms\" and a central \"body\" has been developed for NOTES. The robot can be advanced through the esophagus and into the peritoneal cavity using an overtube and endoscope. Once completely inserted, the robot provides a stable platform for visualization and dexterous manipulation from arbitrary orientations. In vivo testing of the NOTES robot in a porcine model has been successful. Using the robot, the surgeon was able to explore the abdominal cavity and perform small bowel dissection. In addition, benchtop testing has demonstrated the ability of the robot arm to follow a predetermined path in Cartesian space and shows good results towards future three- dimensional feedback control.",

We present a computationally efficient and robust visual odometry algorithm developed for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. This algorithm is a significant improvement over the algorithm developed for the Mars Exploration Rover Mission because it is at least four time more computationally efficient and it tracks significantly more features. The core of the algorithm is an integrated motion estimation and stereo feature tracking loop that allows for feature recovery while guiding feature correlation search to minimize computation. Results on thousands of terrestrial and Martian stereo pairs show that the algorithm can operate with no initial motion estimate while still obtaining subpixel attitude estimation performance.",

Egomotion estimation is performed in two steps: first, rotation is recovered using far features; then translation is estimated from near features using the estimated rotation. RANSAC is used for estimations of both rotation and translation. Experiments in various environments show that our approach is robust and provides good accuracy in real-time for large motions.",

        "abstract": "While realizing a task, human-beings are able to use grasping inside their environment in order to keep the most stable balance. Although such a behavior is quite natural for humans, it is very difficult to find the best formulation to adapt human motion to humanoid robots. This paper proposes a conceptually simple framework of human posture control based on optimization which takes into account grasp and friction and achieves robustness against external disturbances. A new stability criteria is also introduced. Contrary to most other approaches, our method deals not only with unilateral contacts with friction but also with bilateral grasps. This allows for arbitrarily pulling, pushing or twisting on a handhold. Additionally, and in contrast to classical methods based on ZMP, our method also accounts for contacts not being all in the same plane.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust method to estimate sound direction for mobile robot interface. In contrast to other methods, the proposed method estimates sound direction at intervals of short time to deal with deterioration by movement of sound source or robot. The two methods, discrete Kalman filter and time delay of arrival (TDOA) using generalized cross-correlation (GCC), are combined by quantifying reliability of TDOA. The combination prevents the deterioration by low power of signals, noise, and reverberation because discrete Kalman filter efficiently filters out such effects. The result of experiments, in which mobile robot estimates azimuth angle with three microphones, shows that the proposed method provides robustness on estimating sound direction even if the sound source or robot is moving during estimation procedure.",

Hardware modifications are derived to reduce the radio irregularity and to increase the uniqueness of the measured RSSI to distance. A novel algorithm is elaborated allowing for sub meter accuracy. It accounts for the noise and implicitly models the uncertainty. Additionally it is robust to node failures. To further improve the accuracy a particle filter is employed to perform probabilistic sensor fusion of odometry, ultrasonic and RSSI sensors and a map. The suitability of this approach is shown with real measurements achieving a mean positioning error of 0.32 m.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses variable-scale bilateral control for micro teleoperation. A method is proposed to synthesize robust variable-scale controllers that guarantee system stability and realize robust performance in contact with any arbitrary, but passive, operator and environment. The proposed method is based on the formulation as a robust output feedback constant scaled H\u221e problem. A variable scaled teleoperation system appears as a polytopic linear parameter-varying (LPV) plant, with an affine relation on the scale factors. Gain-scheduling is used to derive robust stable time-variant H\u221e controllers for online variable scaling. Improved controller performance is obtained through the introduction of an affine and scheduled-parameter-dependent weighting. The controller synthesis problem is formulated as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI\u2019s) augmented with a nonconvex rank condition. An efficient algorithm is constructed to synthesize a set of sub-optimal controllers over the parameter space. The validity of the proposed methods are confirmed experimentally.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for the identification of the internal structure and mechanical properties of biological soft tissue using a force sensitive wheeled probe to generate a 'mechanical image' by rolling across the surface of a solid organ. Initially, a testing facility for validating the concept ex-vivo was developed. Preliminary validation tests were carried out on a silicone phantom with embedded abnormalities with the aim to link the derived 'mechanical image' with the known internal structure. Ex-vivo validation tests were also conducted on excised porcine livers. The data were analyzed in four parts: 1) the dynamic analysis of wheel-tissue interaction to validate that the measured parameters are representative of underlying tissue stiffness; 2) the development of a 'mechanical image' from the rolling data; 3) a comparison of standard 1-DOF indentation testing with 2-DOF rolling and 4) the characterization of the relationship between force and tissue deflection from the data contained within the mechanical image. The results show that the 'rolling mechanical image' is capable of capturing information relating to the underlying tissue stiffness distribution and characterizing the force-tissue deflection profile for a tissue sample. Examples of scenarios, where this information could potentially be used, include providing a surgeon with the ability to probe solid organs in-vivo during robot-assisted MIS or providing prior information for the modeling of tool-tissue interactions, such as steerable needles.",

Operating at remote locations the sampler needs to deal with a variety of disparate rock sources while being essential to deliver samples in different forms and to accommodate the requirements of a wide range of scientific instruments. Existing highly efficient terrestrial drilling techniques have limited space applications due to their need for large axial forces and holding torques, high power consumption and inability to efficiently duty cycle, and the use of rigid handling platforms.

If a robot cannot execute a task by itself, it asks for help and, if possible, another robot will provide the required service. In the paper, tasks consisting in transmitting data in real-time that could require communication relay services are considered. On the other hand, the parameters of the algorithm can be adapted to give priority to either the execution time or the energy consumption in the mission. The potential generation of deadlocks associated to the relation between tasks and services is studied, and as an original result, a distributed algorithm that prevent them is proposed. The algorithm has been tested in simulations that illustrate the main features of the S+T algorithm.",

This paper describes a SLAM implementation using forward-looking sonar (FLS) data from a highly maneuverable, hovering AUV performing a ship hull inspection mission. The exactly sparse extended information filter (ESEIF) algorithm is applied to perform SLAM based upon features manually selected within FLS images. The results demonstrate the ability to effectively map a ship hull in a challenging marine environment.

Focus are cast on solving two major problems: 1) achieving global accuracy especially in non-cyclical environment, 2) tackling a mixture of data from both dynamic and static objects. Algorithms are developed, where GPS data and control inputs are used to diagnose pose error and guide to achieve a global accuracy; Classification of laser points and objects are conducted not in an independent module but across the processing in a framework of SLAM with moving object detection and tracking. Experiments are conducted using the data from two test-bed vehicles, and performance of the algorithms are demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "As the need of well-being life becomes popular, one of important issues is clean drinking water. Delivery of clean water from the main water fountain to the end user is very crucial. However, typical pipelines are being contaminated by rust and several chemicals. And thus the water being delivered to house is not trustful as the drinking water. Thus, cleaning and inspection of the in-house pipeline becomes an important issue. However, it is hard to find a small-sized motor adequate to the robot for the inspection of the in-house pipeline with diameter of 15mm. Thus, this paper introduces a new semi-automatic pipeline inspection robotic system for small-sized pipelines. Three different types of inspection robot system were developed, which have different combination of sensors to realize SLAM. The robot system is carried by an extension cable, which is in advance being penetrated into the pipeline by a compressed air. The feasibility of the proposed SLAM using this semi-automatic pipeline inspection robotic system was verified through experimentation.",

For complex tasks like topological localization, it would be desirable to use multiple cues, possibly from different modalities, so to achieve robust performance. This paper proposes a new method for integrating multiple cues. For each cue we train a large margin classifier which outputs a set of scores indicating the confidence of the decision. These scores are then used as input to a Support Vector Machine, that learns how to weight each cue, for each class, optimally during training. We call this algorithm SVM-based Discriminative Accumulation Scheme (SVM-DAS). We applied our method to the topological localization task, using vision and laser-based cues. Experimental results clearly show the value of our approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent years, collision safety has been one of the most important issues for service robots. To ensure collision safety assurance, a passive compliance method is preferred to an active one because it can provide faster and more reliable responses to dynamic collision. Since both positioning accuracy and collision safety are equally important, a robot arm should have very low stiffness when subjected to a collision force greater than the one causing human injury, but maintain very high stiffness otherwise. In order to realize these ideal features, a novel safe joint mechanism (SJM) composed of linear springs and a modified slider-crank mechanism is proposed in this paper. The SJM has the advantages of variable stiffness which can be achieved only by passive mechanical elements. Various experiments on static and dynamic collisions show the high stiffness of the SJM against an external force of less than the critical impact force, but an abrupt drop in the stiffness when the external force exceeds this critical force, which guarantees positioning accuracy and collision safety. Furthermore, the critical impact force can be set to any value depending on the application and the environment.",

The approach is employed in combination with an extended Kalman filter to obtain accurate estimates of the robot\u2019s position, heading and velocity. Good estimates of these variables were obtained during tests performed using a differential drive robot in a populated environment, thus demonstrating that the approach provides a reliable and computationally feasible alternative for mobile robot localization and autonomous navigation",

        "abstract": "Bevel-tip flexible needles have greater mobility than straight rigid needles, and can be used to reach targets behind sensitive or impenetrable areas. Accurately planning and executing the optimal motions for such steerable needles is difficult, however, and requires solving inverse kinematics for a nonholonomic system. This paper presents an approach to 3D motion planning for bevel-tip needles in an environment with obstacles. Instead of discretizing the configuration space as in earlier work, we discretize the control space, such that the trajectory of the needle can be expressed analytically without the need for approximate numerical simulation. This results in a fast optimization routine that finds a locally optimal path in a 3D environment with obstacles, requiring just a few seconds of computation time on a standard PC. We introduce two different discretization strategies that lead to differently structured paths and show that both produce valid trajectories from start to goal. To our knowledge, the presented method is the first to address motion planning for bevel-tip needles in a 3D environment with obstacles.",

The proposed algorithm extracts depth information of target cells from their diffraction patterns. High-speed focusing of yeast cells with 20 ms response time was demonstrated. Continuous autofocusing of yeast cells with a scanning microscope was also demonstrated. The successful continous autofocusing suggests that image-based high-throughput measurement of cells could be realized using the proposed algorithm.",

For shape recognition, we propose to use a simple 2D version of the visual volume intersection method which takes advantage of a special feature of the omnidiretional camera attached to the hand. For grasping we propose a simple grasp quality criterion to obtain the best grasping position for the two soft fingers based on a visual hull in a horizontal grasp plane. We conducted several experiments and the results show the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "An autonomous biped controller synthesizing the ZMP manipulation and the foot location is proposed; each of them has a strongly nonlinear property, so that they had been hard to be synthesized without referential trajectories given as functions of time. The former is equivalent to the partial indirect manipulation of the reaction force through the contact points with the environment to control the center of mass (COM) under the current supporting state. The latter means discontinuous relocation of grounding feet in order to deform the supporting region to include the desired but unachievable ZMP in the future. They run on an identical control system without any confliction, since they originate from the same simulated regulator in the sense that the feasible region of ZMP is not bounded. It is also shown that a cyclic walk is automatically generated without giving a walking period explicitly by coupling the support-state transition and the goal-state transition in a simulation.",

The working principle is based on the mobile platform RollBot. The new feature is the combination of three rolling steel spheres driven by three laser structured piezoactuators, each containing three ruby hemispheres. Because of the piezoactuator's special design, the hemisphere's stick-slip displacements decrease and enable a more precise control. The platform's properties concerning rigidity, resolution and maximum velocity improve. After an introduction of RollBot's and the new actuation principle, a short description of the laser structuring process is given. Several finite-element (FE)-simulations are presented to understand the expected performance of the mobile platform. Finally, measurements of step sizes and maximum velocities are shown. The application of the actuator in a mobile platform proves the derived properties.",

Probabilistic techniques using high-end range finding devices are well established in the field, but recent work has investigated visiononly approaches. This paper presents a method for generating approximate rotational and translation velocity information from a single vehicle-mounted consumer camera, without the computationally expensive process of tracking landmarks. The method is tested by employing it to provide the odometric and visual information for the RatSLAM system while mapping a complex suburban road network. RatSLAM generates a coherent map of the environment during an 18 km long trip through suburban traffic at speeds of up to 60 km/hr. This result demonstrates the potential of ground-based vision-only SLAM using low cost sensing and computational hardware.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a procedure of avoiding singularity for a redundantly-driven, dual-arm, master-slave robotic system. In cooperative operation, the procedure starts with a periodic check if one of the dual arms is close to a singular configuration by examining the manipulability of the arm. If it is close to a singularity, then the system stops its cooperative operation and control scheme switches to redundancy control. Then the operator manipulates the joint until the arm moves away from the singular configuration by inputing angular velocity to a redundant axis. The fact that the operator can select a new arm configuration to avoid singular configuration in teleoperation is the contribution of this research. After moving away from the singular configuration, the system can resume cooperative operation. Because this manual operation applies to a redundant axis only (in the null space of the Jacobian matrix), it does not affect the current end-effector pose and force status. Experimental examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed method.",

This paper proposes a skill-decomposition framework, which differs from previous work in its capability of decomposing a skill by self-categorizing it into significant stimulusresponse units (SRU). The proposed skill-decomposition framework can be realized by stages with a 5-layer neuro-fuzzy network with supervised learning, resolution control and reinforcement learning, to enable robots to identify a sufficient number of significant SRUs for accomplishing a given task. Computer simulations and experiments with a Pioneer DX-3 mobile robot were conducted to validate the self-categorization capability of the proposed skill-decomposition framework in learning and identifying significant SRUs from task examples.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the Riemannian distance and its application to skilled-motion plannings for the system. The Riemannian distance from one pose to another and vice versa is defined as the minimum curve-length measured by the Riemannian metric based upon the system inertia matrix among all curves connecting the two poses. The minimum-length curve in this meaning is called \u201cgeodesic\u201d and reflects a movement of the system affected only by inertia-tensor-originated force (i.e., pure inertia, centrifugal, and Coriolis forces). In order to investigate in detail such a movement along the geodesic, some computer simulations are conducted in the cases of planar motions by a 4-DOF robot arm and biped walkings by a wholebody robot. It is shown through simulation results that movements attaining the Riemannian distance (natural movements in inertial actions) in the two cases tend to be similar to those in human skilled motions when human-scale robot models are chosen. Based upon the Riemannian distance, motion plannings for multi-body systems using physical properties inherent in their own physical structures are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents slope traversal experiments with slip compensation control for lunar/planetary exploration rovers. On loose soil, wheels of the rover easily slip even when the rover travels with relatively low velocity. Because of the slip, following an arbitrary path on loose soil becomes a difficult task for the rover, and also, the slip will increase when the rover traverses a slope. To cope with the slip issue, the authors previously proposed path following control strategy taking wheel slippages into account. Through numerical simulations in the previous work, it has been confirmed that the proposed control effectively compensates and reduces the slip motions of the rover, and then, the rover can follow a given path. In order to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control for practical application, slope traversal experiments using a four-wheeled rover test bed are addressed in this paper. The control performance of the slip compensation is compared to that of no slip control based on motion traces of the rover in side slope traversal case. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed control is verified by quantitative evaluations of distance and orientation errors.",

In this paper, a new analysis method of the GCF signals is discussed for detection of the gait phases. Human gaits are complicated, and the gait phases can not be exactly distinguished by comparing sensor outputs to a threshold. This paper mainly discusses how to detect the gait phases continuously and smoothly. The proposed analysis method is intended for applications to power assistive devices for patients, as well as diagnostics of pathological gait. Smooth and continuous detection of the gait phases enables a full use of information obtained from GCF sensors. For experimental verification, smart shoes have been developed. Each smart shoe has four GCF sensors embedded between the cushion pad and the sole. The performances are experimentally verified for both normal and abnormal gaits, and a means for quantification of abnormalities in the gait is also introduced in this paper.",

Seeking to minimize the parasitic pitching motion in running, pronking is used as the target gait. The control design is based on the robot dynamics, allowing its application to a wide range of robots of the class studied. Moreover, the controller adjusts the robot speed and height, requiring knowledge only of the robot physical parameters. The control ensures that negative actuator work during the stance phase is zero, thereby reducing the power expenditure. Small, off-the-shelf DC motors are adequate for the control implementation, while results of application to a detailed robot model show good performance even when including leg mass, foot collision, motor limitations, foot slipping and other factors.",

A rigorous stability analysis that ensures the possibility to effectively achieve the defined tasks, however, is missing. In this paper, by resorting to a Lyapunov-based stability discussion for the prioritized inverse kinematics algorithms, an effective condition is given to verify that the tasks are properly matched; moreover, minimum bound for the control gains are determined.",

        "abstract": "A 2-D dynamic simulation of a quadruped robot with passive, directionally compliant legs has shown that with the proper leg configuration, increased stability of the robot can be achieved passively. Increased stability is defined as decreased pitching motion of the robot. A limited search of the design space of the legs resulted in the finding the leg parameters that minimized the pitching. Steady state trotting, changing speeds, and disturbances such as steps and holes were tested.",

It is shown that the closed-loop system\u2019s gain can be assigned arbitrarily by an appropriate choice of certain weighting function of the projection-based force reflection algorithm. In particular, this allows to achieve stability of the force-reflecting teleoperator system in presence of timevarying irregular delays for arbitrarily large force-reflecting gain and arbitrarily low damping and stiffness of the master. The proposed approach solves, to some extent, the trade-off between stability, manoeuvrability, and high force reflection gain in force-reflecting teleoperator system with network-induced communication constraints.",

        "abstract": "The position control of agents having double-integrator dynamic response, with explicit dependence on an estimator that simultaneously reconstructs agent states and refines a feature map, is considered. We show that under broad conditions the phase and gain margins of an equivalent control system based on absolute navigation sensors can be significantly eroded when the dynamic map is used. The closed-loop bandwidth achieved depends strongly on the bandwidth of the filter, which is in turn dictated by the ratio of process to sensor noise, on the control gains, and on the arrangement of features being tracked. The findings are relevant to the integration of SLAM algorithms in high-performance positioning of mobile agents. A specific example is the case undersea robots working near large structures, where traditional navigation systems may not be practical.",

        "abstract": "A static lumped parameter model is proposed for the design and analysis of nested piezoelectric cellular actuators with exponential strain amplification mechanisms. Piezoelectric ceramic material, such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), has large stress and bandwidth, but its extremely small strain, i.e. only 0.1%, has been a major bottleneck for broad applications. We have proposed a \u201cnested rhombus\u201d multi-layer mechanism for PZT actuators, which increases strain exponentially through its hierarchical cellular structure, for over 20% effective strain. To drive a large load, however, care must be taken in the design of the strain amplification structure. Through kinematic and static analysis this paper addresses how the output force and displacement are attenuated by the joint stiffness and beam compliance involved in the strain amplification mechanism. An insightful lumped parameter model is developed to quantify the performance degradation and facilitate design trade-offs. A prototype nested PZT cellular actuator that weighs only 15 g has produced 21% effective strain (2.49 mm displacement from 12 mm actuator length) and 1.7 N blocking force.",

The TPAWT adds a wind display system to the previously developed Treadport virtual environment, and this research builds upon prior work to provide improved control of headwind angle at the user position. Key to this research is the addition of a negative pressure plenum at the rear of the treadport to improve nominal flow stability. The previous controller based upon the small gain theorem with a dynamic extension is then modified to provide wind angle feedback control. A conditional angular rate-switching controller is added to reduce wind angle oscillations at the user. A vorticity-meter is developed to assure that the wind flow is centered at the user position. As a result, this research reduces wind angle error by 75% compared to previous work.",

This constrains landing sites to very benign terrain and limits the scientific goals of missions. We review sensor options for landing hazard detection, then identify an approach based on stereo vision and shadow analysis that appears to address the broadest set of missions with the lowest cost. We describe algorithms for slope estimation and rock detection with this approach, develop models of their performance, and validate those models experimentally. Instantiating our model of rock detection reliability for Mars predicts that this approach would reduce the probability of failed landing by at least a factor of 4 compared to blind landing. Conversely, for the safety level desired for the 2009 Mars lander, this approach would increase the fraction of the planet that is accessible for landing from about 1/3 to nearly 100%.",

In contrast to other works, the method includes a FEA-based link stiffness evaluation and employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations, which allows computing the stiffness matrix for the overconstrained architectures and for the singular manipulator postures. The advantages of the developed technique are confirmed by application examples, which deal with comparative stiffness analysis of two translational parallel manipulators.",

In the presented system, we discuss a strategy to minimize the amount of stored data by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of several cooperating recognition modules, and by using them through a prioritization scheme, which orders the data entries from the most likely to match to the least. We validate the system is a series of experiments at three large scale outdoor environments: a building complex (126 times 180 ft. area, 3583 testing images), a vegetation-filled park (270 times 360 ft. area, 6006 testing images), and an open-field area (450 times 585 ft. area, 8823 testing images) - each with its own set of challenges. Not only is the system able to localize in these environments (on average 3.46 ft., 6.55 ft. 12.96 ft. of error, respectively), it does so while searching through only 7.35%, 3.50%, and 6.12% of all the stored information, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The dexterity of active hand prosthetics is limited not only due to the limited availability of dexterous prosthetic hands, but mainly due to limitations in interfaces. How is an amputee supposed to command the prosthesis what to do (i.e., how to grasp an object) and with what force (i.e., holding a hammer or grasping an egg)? So far, in literature, the most interesting results have been achieved by applying machine learning to forearm surface electromyography (EMG) to classify finger movements; but this approach lacks, in general, the possibility of quantitatively determining the force applied during the grasping act. In this paper we address the issue by applying machine learning to the problem of regression from the EMG signal to the force a human subject is applying to a force sensor. A detailed comparative analysis among three different machine learning approaches (Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Locally Weighted Projection Regression) reveals that the type of grasp can be reconstructed with an average accuracy of 90%, and the applied force can be predicted with an average error of 10%, corresponding to about 5N over a range of 50N. None of the tested approaches clearly outperforms the others, which seems to indicate that machine learning as a whole is a viable approach.",

The key concepts involve maximizing some metric defined in relation to a manipulability ellipsoid, which represents the mapping between applied thrust and configuration space accelerations for the object. By casting this problem in the framework of redundant manipulation, the proposed method can be carried out in real time, in a possibly changing environment, and can accommodate nonholonomic vehicles and thrust limits on the swarm. The controller includes attachment pose optimization, engagement control as the ASVs approach and attach to the object, and the manipulation control. Simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Capsule endoscopy is a promising technique for diagnosing diseases in the small intestines. Here we propose a miniature swimming mechanism that uses MRI\u2019s magnetic fields for both propulsion and wireless energy delivery. Our method uses both the static and radio frequency (RF) magnetic field inherently available in MRI to generate propulsion force. The propulsion force is produced by a swimming tail containing waving beam consisting of three coils in a row. Alternating current in the coils acting on the static magnetic field of the MRI will generate waving movement to produce a propulsion force. RF magnetic field will provide power to generate the alternating currents in the coils. We developed a theoretical model to predict sinusoidal waves produced by the waving beam using the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation and multiple-input multiple-output system were solved using antenna design theory. This numerical model predicted that the maximal propulsion from a 10 mm long tail can produce a velocity of 7.9 mm/s force of 5.5 mN when placed in a 3T static magnetic field. A validation study with a single coil demonstrated that the theoretical and numerical model predicts well the proposed swimming mechanism and it is useful for the fabrication of swimming tails.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to the design and control of multi-fingered hands using hybrid DC motor - shape memory alloy (SMA) array actuators is presented in this paper. The fundamental design concept is based on the principle of motor control \"synergy\", a biomechanics terminology of coordinated motion generation. A couple of DC motors are used for driving multiple fingers with a particular velocity distribution over a vast number of finger joints corresponding to the direction of the most significant synergy. Principal component analysis is used for determining the most significant direction and the residual directions. SMA array actuators are used for driving the fingers in the residual directions. Although many actuator axes are needed for spanning the residual space, the required strokes are much shorter than the most significant direction. Compact and high energy-density SMA actuators meet these requirements. The paper presents synergistic integration of these two types of actuators having diverse characteristics. This allows us to embed all the actuators and transmission mechanisms in the palm, eliminating a bundle of tendons crossing over the wrist joints. An initial prototype hand is designed and built.",

A new tracking metric is derived that encodes the ability of each robot to reach an unsensed target before the uncertainty in its position passes a given upper bound. Target activation and tracking assignment using this method enable broader participation by individual robots in a cooperative surveillance architecture. Area search is added to the cooperative surveillance architecture through the use of a coordinated coverage map that represents the probability of new targets being detected in regions of the environment. A key feature of the coverage map is that it is updated by all robots, not just robots performing area search. Thus, tracking robots aid the search process. Simulation results validate the new integrated assignment process.",

Data were recorded from three athetoid patients during unassisted icon-clicking trials with an isometric joystick. In order to facilitate development and testing of filter designs without the difficulty of repeated testing with human subjects, a quantitative model of the recorded patient data was developed using pseudoinverse methods. Using this model within the visuomotor control loop for the icon-clicking task, a prediction filter was then developed to reduce the target acquisition time. The filter is based on a novel \"autoregressive stretching window\" model which selects five data points evenly distributed across the input and output histories to predict the intended target, together with a second-order system that smoothes the movement of the cursor. On average, the filter demonstrated a reduction of target acquisition time by a factor of 2.7 in experiments with the patient models.",

        "abstract": "It is widely agreed that efficient visual search requires the integration of target-driven top-down information and image-driven bottom-up information. Yet the problem of gaze planning - that is, selecting the next best gaze location given the current observations - remains largely unsolved. We propose a probabilistic system that models the gaze sequence as a finite-horizon Bayesian sequential decision process. Direct policy search is used to reason about the next best gaze locations. The system integrates bottom-up saliency information, top-down target knowledge and additional context information through principled Bayesian priors. This results in proposal gaze locations that depend not only the featural visual saliency, but also on prior knowledge and the spatial likelihood of locating the target. The system has been implemented using state-of- the-art object detectors and evaluated on a real-world dataset by comparing it to gaze sequences proposed by a pure bottom-up saliency-based process and to an object detection approach that analyzes the full image. The target-directed attention system is shown to result in higher object detection precision than both competitors, to attend to more relevant targets than the bottom-up attention system, and to require significantly less computation time than the exhaustive approach.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned ground vehicles (UGV's) commonly used in military applications must possess the capability to traverse various terrains that may largely affect the performance and controllability of the vehicle. A UGV that can autonomously perceive its terrain using navigational sensors can make necessary changes to its control strategy. The research presented uses the output of the induced vehicle's vibration measured by navigational sensors to classify the underlying terrain at multiple speeds. The classification algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimension reduction. The PCA transformation coefficients are then used to develop a manifold curve that uses these known coefficients to interpolate unknown coefficients of the terrains as the robot's speed changes. Experimental data is collected using two distinctly different unmanned ground vehicle platforms. Results demonstrate the performance of the method for classifying multi-differentiated terrains broadly classified as grass, asphalt, mud, and gravel.",

The OT-4, shown in Figure 1, can climb over obstacles that are much higher than the robot itself, propel itself inside pipes of different diameters, and traverse even the most difficult terrain, such as rocks or the rubble of a collapsed structure.",

The proposed method employs Interactive Closest Point(ICP) algorithm to find corresponding point, even if the input scan points are in the outside of the reference grid area. It also enlarges the convergence area by modifying the eigenvalue of normal distribution so that the evaluation value can be driven effectively by all the pairing data for improving convergence speed. In the normal NDT scan matching algorithm, the grid size especially has much effect on the capability of convergence area and speed. Thus, it is difficult to generate the detailed map with small grids. The proposed convergence approach can solve the problem by the phased adjustment of convergence area. Experimental result shows the feasibility of the detailed environmental map generated by the NDT grid mapping.",

This paper focuses on the influence of permanent magnet DC electric drives on the size of quadruped running robots. The reason is twofold. First, many of the existing legged machines have used such actuators for propulsion. The second, the performance of electric motors scales differently from torque- speed requirements of legged robots. Specifically, we show that there exists a particularly sized quadruped running robot that is superior according to desired performance criteria, and under the existing technologic limitations and economic restraints. Therefore, valuable information on legged systems design and insight for optimizing the size of a quadruped robot emerges.",

Several robots with weights ranging from 15\u20132500 kg are impacted at different velocities with a mechanical human head mockup. This is used to measure the so-called Head Injury Criterion, mainly a measure for brain injury. Apart from injuries indicated by this criterion and a detailed analysis of chest impacts we point out that e.g. fractures of facial bones can occur during collisions at typical robot velocities. Therefore, this injury mechanism which is more probable in robotics is evaluated in detail.",

Presumably, this is to a great extent caused by the possibility of clamping the human in the confined workspace of the robot. Before generally allowing physical cooperation of humans and robots in future applications it is therefore absolutely crucial to analyze this extremely dangerous situation. In this paper we will investigate many aspects relevant to this sort of injury mechanisms and discuss the importance to domestic environments or production assistants. Since clamped impacts are intrinsically more dangerous than free ones it is fundamental to discuss and evaluate metrics to ensure safe interaction if clamping is possible. We compare various robots with respect to their injury potential leading to a main safety requirement of robot design: Reduce the intrinsic injury potential of a robot by reducing its weight.",

When applying vision sensors to measuring objects in liquid, light refraction is an important problem. Therefore, we estimate refractive indices of unknown liquids by using images of water surface, restore images that are free from refractive effects of the light, and measure 3-D shapes of objects in liquids in consideration of refractive effects. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through experiments.",

While it has been successful in various industrial tasks, joint position control is severely limited in performing advanced robotic tasks, especially in unstructured dynamic environments. This paper presents the concept of torque-to-position transformer designed to allow the implementation of joint torque control techniques on joint position-controlled robots. Robot torque control is essentially accomplished by converting desired joint torques into instantaneous increments of joint position inputs. For each joint, the transformer is based on the knowledge of the joint position servo controller and the closed-loop frequency response of that joint. This transformer can be implemented as a software unit and applied to any conventional position-controlled robot so that torque command to the robot becomes available. This approach has been experimentally implemented on the Honda ASIMO robot arm. The paper presents the results of this implementation which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

In order to accurately simulate the complete robotic system we propose a framework that allows designers to describe the robotic system as an interconnection of mechanical, electrical, and software components, with well defined mechanisms for communicating with each other. Through this, we form a multi-disciplinary model that captures both the dynamics of the individual subsystems, and the dynamics resulting from the interconnection of the above subsystems.

        "abstract": "How to teach actions to a robot as well as how a robot learns actions is an important issue to be discussed in designing robot learning systems. Inspired by human parent-infant interaction, we hypothesize that a robot equipped with infant-like abilities can take advantage of parental proper teaching. Parents are known to significantly alter their infant-directed actions versus adult-directed ones, e.g. make more pauses between movements, which is assumed to aid the infants' understanding of the actions. As a first step, we analyzed parental actions using a primal attention model. The model based on visual saliency can detect likely important locations in a scene without employing any knowledge about the actions or the environment. Our statistical analysis revealed that the model was able to extract meaningful structures of the actions, e.g. the initial and final state of the actions and the significant state changes in them, which were highlighted by parental action modifications. We further discuss the issue of designing an infant-like robot that can induce parent-like teaching, and present a human-robot interaction experiment evaluating our robot simulation equipped with the saliency model.",

This initial design and study is necessary to further understand how to improve on many of the shortcomings in the standard RFA procedure. Combining needle driving with advanced image tracking techniques could provide improved solutions to these clinical limitations. In this paper, we present a hydraulically-actuated 1-DOF needle driver robot that is capable of advancing a radiofrequency (RF) probe into tissue at controllable velocities and positions within an MRI scanner, while collecting force feedback data and maintaining all standards of MRI-compatible design. We also present a method of interfacing the robot with a PHANToM haptic feedback device controlled from outside the MRI scanning room. Experiments demonstrating the PHANToM\u2019s ability to receive force feedback and guide the RFA tool to a tumor nodule within a phantom breast model while continuously imaging within MRI have been presented. Our haptic feedback system enabled us to detect normal vs. tumor phantom tissue in the preliminary experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate the compatibility of the entire system for operation during continuous MRI imaging.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the components of a novel algorithm for the extraction of dominant orthogonal planar structures from monocular images taken in indoor environments. The basic building block of our approach is the use of vanishing points and vanishing lines imposed by the frequently observed dominance of three mutually orthogonal vanishing directions in man-made world. Vanishing points are found by an improved approach, taking no assumptions on known internal or external camera parameters. The problem of detecting planar patches is attacked using a probabilistic framework, searching for the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) in a Markov Random Field (MRF). For this, we propose a novel formulation fusing geometric information obtained from vanishing points and features, such as rectangles and partial rectangles, together with a color-homogeneity criteria imposed by an image over-segmentation. The method was evaluated on a set of images exhibiting largely varying characteristics concerning image quality and scene complexity. Experiments show that the method, despite the variations, works in a stable manner and that its performance compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.",

The presented navigation function is C2 and as a result the computational complexity is very low, while the construction uses local knowledge and information. Moreover, an almost locally computable diffeomorphism between convex obstacles and spheres is presented, allowing the NF scheme to be used in a workspace populated by convex obstacles. Our approach is not strictly local in the epsiv sense, i.e., the field around a point is not influenced only by an e region around the point, but rather it is local in the sense that the NF around each obstacle is influenced only by the obstacle and the adjacent obstacles. In particular, we require, in the vicinity of an obstacle, the distance between the obstacle and the adjacent obstacles. Simulations are presented to verify this approach.",

        "abstract": "Localization and context interpretation are two key competences for mobile robot systems. Visual place recognition, as opposed to purely geometrical models, holds promise of higher flexibility and association of semantics to the model. Ideally, a place recognition algorithm should be robust to dynamic changes and it should perform consistently when recognizing a room (for instance a corridor) in different geographical locations. Also, it should be able to categorize places, a crucial capability for transfer of knowledge and continuous learning. In order to test the suitability of visual recognition algorithms for these tasks, this paper presents a new database, acquired in three different labs across Europe. It contains image sequences of several rooms under dynamic changes, acquired at the same time with a perspective and omnidirectional camera, mounted on a socket. We assess this new database with an appearance- based algorithm that combines local features with support vector machines through an ad-hoc kernel. Results show the effectiveness of the approach and the value of the database.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we lay the groundwork for extending our previously developed ASyMTRe architecture to enable constructivist learning for multi-robot team tasks. The ASyMTRe architecture automatically configures schemas within, and across, robots to form the highest utility solution that achieves a given multi-robot team task. We believe that the schema- based approach used in ASyMTRe is a useful abstraction not only for forming heterogeneous coalitions, but also for enabling constructivist learning, in which chunks of schemas that solve intermediate subproblems are learned and then made available for future task solutions. However, the existing ASyMTRe search algorithm for finding configurations of schemas that completely solve given tasks (Centralized ASyMTRe - CA) is not well-suited for identifying useful chunks of schemas that could solve intermediate subtasks that may be useful in the future. Thus, in this current work, we explore an Evolutionary Learning (EL) technique for the offline learning of schema chunks that could be saved and used later in an online search (using the regular CA algorithm) for coalition configurations. However, we do not want to sacrifice solution quality in making use of the evolutionary search technique. Thus, we compare the solutions discovered by the EL algorithm with those that are found using CA, as well as with a third algorithm that randomizes the CA algorithm, called RA. Four different applications in simulation are used to evaluate the EL, CA, and RA techniques. Our results show that the EL approach indeed finds solutions of comparable quality to the CA technique, while also providing the added benefit of learning highly fit partial solutions, or schema chunks, that may be beneficial for future tasks via constructivist learning. We conclude by arguing that the combination of the online CA search for solving current multi-robot tasks can be combined with the offline EL approach that can identify intermediate solutions (or schema c...

In addition to a set of water quality sensors it also carries an ultra-miniature side-scan sonar. In this paper we show the development of methods for autonomous range detection, spatial and semantic mapping in underwater environments.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework for utilizing fixed, ultra-wideband ranging radio nodes to track a moving target node through walls in a cluttered environment. We examine both the case where the locations of the fixed nodes are known as well as the case where they are unknown. For the case when the fixed node locations are known, we derive a Bayesian room-level tracking method that takes advantage of the structural characteristics of the environment to ensure robustness to noise. We also develop a method using mixtures of Gaussians to model the noise characteristics of the radios. For the case of unknown fixed node locations, we present a two-step approach that first reconstructs the target node\u2019s path and then uses that path to determine the locations of the fixed nodes. We reconstruct the path by projecting down from a higher-dimensional measurement space to the 2D environment space using non-linear dimensionality reduction with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs). We then utilize the reconstructed path to map the locations of the fixed nodes using a Bayesian occupancy grid. We present experimental results verifying our methods in an office environment. Our methods are successful at tracking a moving target node and mapping the locations of fixed nodes using radio ranging data that are both noisy and intermittent.",

The loss of observability resulting from the use of a single monocular camera is dealt with by constraining the target vehicle to follow ground terrain. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) provides a simultaneous localization and mapping solution for the estimation of aircraft states and feature locations, which define the target's local environment. Another filter, a loosely coupled Kalman filter for the target states, receives 3D measurements of target position with estimated covariance obtained by an unscented transformation (UT). The UT uses the mean and covariance from the camera measurements and from the UKF estimated aircraft states and feature locations to determine the estimated target mean and covariance. Simulation results confirm the concepts developed.",

The agents move unpredictably and may be fully distinguishable, partially distinguishable, or completely indistinguishable. The key is to introduce information spaces that extract and maintain combinatorial sensing information. This leads to monitoring the changes in connected components of the shadow region, which is the set of points not visible to any sensors at a given time. When used in combination with a path generator for the robots, the approach solves problems such as counting the number of agents, determining movements of teams of agents, and solving pursuit-evasion problems. An implementation with examples is presented.",

        "abstract": "Successful multi-target tracking requires locating the targets and labeling their identities. For the laser based tracking system, the latter becomes significantly more challenging when the targets frequently interact with each other. This paper presents a novel on-line supervised learning based method for tracking interacting targets with laser scanner. When the targets do not interact with each other, we collect samples and train a classifier for each target. When the targets are in close proximity, we use these classifiers to assist in tracking. Different evaluations demonstrate that this method has a better tracking performance than previous methods when interactions occur, and can maintain correct tracking under various complex tracking situations.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots represent great promise for transport in unstructured environments. However, it has been difficult to devise motion planning strategies that achieve a combination of energy efficiency, safety and flexibility comparable to legged animals. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting a trajectory generation strategy for dynamic bipedal walking robots using a factored approach to motion planning - combining a low-dimensional plan (based on intermittently actuated passive walking in a compass-gait biped) with a manifold learning algorithm that solves the problem of embedding this plan in the high-dimensional phase space of the robot. This allows us to achieve task level control (over step length) in an energy efficient way - starting with only a coarse qualitative model of the system dynamics and performing a data-driven approximation of the dynamics in order to synthesize families of dynamically realizable trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with simulation results for a multi-link legged robot.",

The method learns offline a conditional density model of the joint angles given the workspace coordinates. This density implicitly defines the multivalued inverse kinematics mapping for any workspace point. At run time, given a trajectory in the workspace, the method (1) computes the modes of the conditional density given each of the workspace points, and (2) finds the reconstructed angle trajectory by minimising over the set of modes a global, trajectory-wide constraint that penalises discontinuous jumps in angle space or invalid inverses. We demonstrate the method with a PUMA 560 robot arm and show how it can reconstruct the true angle trajectory even when the workspace trajectory contains singularities, and when the number of inverse branches depends on the workspace location.",

Herein, the possible inverse kinematic solutions for a desired relative camera pose are evaluated to determine whether the interpolated trajectories satisfy field of view constraints for the target of interest. If no immediately feasible trajectory exists, additional waypoints are specified to guide the robot towards its goal while maintaining visibility. The insertion of an additional visible and feasible waypoint divides the problem into two sub-problems of the same form, but of lesser difficulty by reducing the robot's interpolation distance. Virtual image-based visual servoing (IBVS) is used to generate an ideal image trajectory to guide the selection of waypoints. A damped least- squares inverse kinematics solution is implemented to handle robot singularities. The methods are simulated for a CRS-A465 robot with a Sony XC-HR70 camera.",

The stability of the closed-loop system, the convergence of the NN weight-updating process, and the boundedness of the NN weight estimation errors are all strictly guaranteed. Through theories analysis, we know the controller is also capable of disturbance-rejection in the presence of time varying disturbances. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed NNSMC approach can guarantee the whole system\u2019s convergence to the desired manifold with prescribed performance.",

        "abstract": "In electrostatic levitation systems, thin flat objects, such as silicon wafers, can be levitated by controlling the electric field between object and an electrode pattern, depending on the measured gap between them. This allows to manipulate these objects without making physical contact. As the gap between object and electrodes is actively controlled, the system is fairly robust for accelerations perpendicular to the objects surface. However, the restoring force for any lateral disturbance is much lower, as it is not actively controlled. This restricts the allowable lateral accelerations and poses a serious limitation on practical implementation of electrostatic levitation system as a good non-contact object handler. In this paper, the allowable lateral accelerations are increased by tilting the electrodes and object during lateral acceleration. Experimental results show how with tilting control, a levitated aluminium disk always remains aligned with the electrodes, while without tilt control it oscillates around the central point.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous deployment of mobile agents for coverage enhancement is an important issue in wireless sensor networks. The major challenge lies in the requirement of efficient distributed and localized computing. In addition, managing the coverage of heterogeneous sensing model is complicated due to the diversity of sensing ranges and the irregularity of coverage holes. This paper presents two distributed algorithms for maximizing the sensing coverage in heterogeneous sensor networks. The first algorithm is based on a circle packing technique. We prove the uniqueness of a circle packing up to a given triangulation and boundary conditions, thus the designated coverage layout can be achieved by controlling the boundary conditions. In the second algorithm, we give a formulation of virtual forces among sensor nodes to reduce redundant overlaps and avoid coverage holes. We prove that these virtual forces always give a quasioptimal local coverage. This method is applicable for deployment of sensor nodes in, not only an open field, but also any bounded field of interest and/or in the presence of obstacles. Numerical simulations are showed and these examples verify that the proposed algorithms always yield sensor deployments of wide coverage and collision free motions among sensor nodes. The proposed strategies utilize only the local information about a sensor node and its neighbors, thus providing distributed, efficient and scalable solutions to the deployment problem.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to accurately classify the speech signals originating from the front even in noisy home environments. This ability can help robots to improve speech recognition and to spot keywords. We therefore developed a new voice activity detection (VAD) based on the complex spectrum circle centroid (CSCC) method. It can classify the speech signals that are received at the front of two microphones by comparing the spectral energy of observed signals with that of target signals estimated by CSCC. Also, it can work in real time without training filter coefficients beforehand even in noisy environments (SNR \u226b 0 dB) and can cope with speech noises generated by audio-visual equipments such as televisions and audio devices. Since the CSCC method requires the directions of the noise signals, we also developed a sound source localization system integrated with cross-power spectrum phase (CSP) analysis and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This system was demonstrated to enable a robot to cope with multiple sound sources using two microphones.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are the subject of an increasing interest in many applications and a key requirement is the stabilization of the vehicle. Some previous works have suggested using catadioptric vision, instead of traditional perspective cameras, in order to gather much more information from the environment and therefore improve the robustness of the UAV attitude estimation. This paper belongs to a series of recent publications of our research group concerning catadioptric vision for UAVs. Currently, we focus on the estimation of the complete attitude of a UAV flying in urban environment. In order to avoid the limitations of horizon-based approaches, the difficulties of traditional epipolar methods (such as rotation-translation ambiguity, lack of features, retrieving motion parameters from matrix decomposition, etc..) and improve UAV dynamic control, we suggest computing infinite homography. We show how catadioptric vision plays a key role to: first, extract a large number of lines, second robustly estimate the associated vanishing points and third, track them even during long video sequences. Therefore it is not only possible to estimate the relative rotation between consecutive frames but also compute the absolute rotation between two distant frames without error accumulation. Finally, we present some experimental results with ground truth data to demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of our method.",

The classification methodologies used, process time series generated by an indoor ubiquitous 3D tracker which generates spatial points based on 23 reflectable markers attached on a human body. This investigation focuses mainly on class discrimination of normal and aggressive action recognition performed by an architecture which implements an interconnection between an ubiquitous 3D sensory tracker system and a mobile robot to perceive, process, and classify physical human actions. The 3D tracker and the robot are used as a perception-to-action architecture to process physical activities generated by human subjects. Both classifiers process the activity time series to eventually generate surveillance assessment reports by generating evaluation statistics indicating the classification accuracy of the actions recognized.",

        "abstract": "Achieving energy-efficient dynamic walking has become one of the main subjects of research on robotic bipedal locomotion. Approaches based on passive-dynamic walkers can accomplish bipedal locomotion. However, passive dynamic walking has only been studied with the legs, and the effect of an upper body has not been clarified. This paper investigates the effect of an upper body on the efficiency and stability of dynamic bipedal locomotion based on observations. We first investigated a suitable upper body, which was a simple 1-link torso with a bisecting hip mechanism that would not destroy natural dynamics of the biped model. Second, we analyzed the robot's driving mechanism and chose underactuated virtual passive dynamic walking as the method for generating an efficient dynamic gait. We confirmed that efficient dynamic walking was possible with a specific resistance of 0.01 and investigated the effect of the physical parameters of the upper body through numerical simulations.",

Our approach yields a compact Bayesian network for the robot\u2019s kinematic structure including the forward and inverse models relating action signals and body pose. We propose to simultaneously learn local action models for all pairs of perceivable body parts from data generated through random \u201cmotor babbling.\u201d From this repertoire of local models, we construct a Bayesian network for the full system using the pose prediction accuracy on a separate cross validation data set as the criterion for model selection. The resulting model can be used to predict the body pose when no perception is available and allows for gradient-based posture control. In experiments with real and simulated manipulator arms, we show that our system is able to quickly learn compact and accurate models and to robustly deal with noisy observations.",

The control is designed to drive the quadruped to a steady-state motion with desired forward speed and apex height, using only one actuator per leg. The body pitching motion is controlled to be small. The controller is applied to the robot and the complete system is used to develop a parametric study for the robot. The study examines the behavior of the actuator effort and the leg touchdown angles, over a parametric region of both the robot physical parameters and the gait parameters. Interesting results appear, not previously reported, that may contribute to enhanced robot design and better gait selection for a given robot. Typical findings are that a robot should be lighter- weight when running on more slippery terrain, as well as that certain higher forward speeds require less actuator effort than other slower speeds.",

We present a derivation of the bounds that affect the processing window of the leader robot and an algorithm for determining the feasible window or adjusting the parameters that affect the processing window in case a feasible processing window cannot be achieved because of an overload condition.

        "abstract": "Most of the mobile robot control frameworks are based on a middleware layer with several independent modules that implement primitive actions and report events about their state. These modules are usually connected with different interprocess communication mechanisms. Here, we propose to use hierarchical interpreted binary Petri nets to coordinate the activity of these modules. Tasks are described using an interpreted Petri net editor and saved in a xml file. A dispatcher loads these files and executes the different Petri nets under user requests. A monitor that shows the state of all the running nets is very useful for debugging and tracing purposes. The whole system has been applied to a guide robot (vixiabot) that has been guiding users in a public event (XuventudeGalicia.net) for three days in April 2007 and is now extended to a multirobot surveillance application.",

        "abstract": "\"Developmental robotics\" proposes that, instead of trying to build a robot that shows intelligence once and for all, what one must do is to build robots that can develop. These robots should be equipped with behaviors that are simple but enough to bootstrap the system. Then, as the robot interacts with its environment, it should display increasingly complex behaviors. In this paper, we propose such a development scheme for a mobile robot. J.J. Gibson's concept of \"affordances\" and a formalization of this concept provides the basis of this development scheme. We show that an autonomous robot can start with pre-coded primitive behaviors, and as it executes its behaviors randomly in an environment, it can learn the affordance relations between the environment and its behaviors. We then present two ways of using these learned structures, in achieving more complex, intentional behaviors. In the first case, the sequencing of these primitive behaviors are such that new more complex behaviors emerge. In the second case, the robot makes a \"blending\" of its pre-coded primitive behaviors to create new behaviors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents design and performance of a novel joint based actuator for a robot run by variable stiffness actuation, meant for systems physically interacting with humans. This new actuator prototype (VSA-II) is developed as an improvement over our previously developed one reported in [9], where an optimal mechanical-control co-design principle established in [7] is followed as well. While the first version was built in a way to demonstrate effectiveness of variable impedance actuation (VIA), it had limitations in torque capacities, life cycle and implementability in a real robot. VSA-II overcomes the problem of implementability with higher capacities and robustness in design for longer life. The paper discusses design and stiffness behaviour of VSA-II in theory and experiments. A comparison of stiffness characteristics between the two actuator is discussed, highlighting the advantages of the new design. A simple, but effective PD scheme is employed to independently control joint-stiffness and joint-position of a 1-link arm. Finally, results from performed impact tests of 1- link arm are reported, showing the effectiveness of stiffness variation in controlling value of a safety metric.",

This paper especially focuses on a motion control algorithm of multiple passive mobile robots for handling a single object in cooperation with a human. By controlling each passive mobile robot in the decentralized way, we realize several kinds of motion characteristics of the object to improve the maneuverability for the human operator. By changing the apparent dynamics of the representative point of the object and its position, we realize an anisotropic apparent motion characteristic of the handling object and the obstacle avoidance function as examples. The proposed motion control algorithms are implemented to two PRPs actually, and experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed algorithms.",

Loosely-coupled multisensor fusion and sensor fault detection issues are discussed as well. An extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used for sensor fusion estimation where a GPS noise pre-filter is used to avoid introducing biased GPS data (affected by multi-path). Normalized Innovation Squared (NIS) tests are performed when a GPS measurement is incorporated to reject GPS data outliers and keep the consistency of the filter. Finally, experimental results show the performance of the localization system compared to a previously measured ground truth.",

        "abstract": "Terrain variations can greatly influence autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) performance. However, if the terrain is properly identified, the AGV control systems can be adjusted to better suit the terrain. Current terrain classification techniques are largely based on vision and terrain dependent vehicle reactions. But at this time both methods have limitations. Visual methods can easily be fooled by fallen leaves or other superficial ground coverings, whereas response-based methods yield poor results when the AGV speed is significantly different from the training speeds. In addition, current response-based methods are not capable of identifying the multiple terrains that a vehicle may simultaneously traverse, e.g., when one subset of wheels is on-road and one is off-road. This paper proposes a response-based method called terrain input classification to solve the issue of speed dependency and multiple terrain traversal. This method is dependent upon knowing the vibration transfer function of the AGV. The method has been verified through terrain-based simulation results and is ready for experimental testing.",

The system developed consists of a 3D virtual environment, which allows the user to input a desired position for the crane tip using either the mouse or a joystick. The desired position is then transmitted (via UDP/IP) to a local control system. The crane is a redundant manipulator, so movements of the individual links are calculated using a pseudoinverse method, and controlled using PIDs with friction compensation. Encoder data from the crane links are continuously sent back to the user side, and the crane\u2019s movement is visualized in the virtual environment. The system has been tested on a real forwarder crane, experimental results and a video of the system\u2019s performance are provided.",

        "abstract": "Rigid robotic manipulators employ traditional sensors such as encoders or potentiometers to measure joint angles and determine end-effector position. Manipulators that are flexible, however, introduce motions that are much more difficult to measure. This is especially true for continuum manipulators that articulate by means of material compliance. In this paper, we present a vision based system for quantifying the 3-D shape of a flexible manipulator in real-time. The sensor system is validated for accuracy with known point measurements and for precision by estimating a known 3-D shape. We present two applications of the validated system relating to the open-loop control of a tendon driven continuum manipulator. In the first application, we present a new continuum manipulator model and use the sensor to quantify 3-D performance. In the second application, we use the shape sensor system for model parameter estimation in the absence of tendon tension information.",

The system architecture integrates two small processor units; the first performs vehicle control and implements a virtual force based docking strategy, with the second performing vision-based target segmentation and tracking. Furthermore, the architecture utilises wireless sensor network technology allowing the vehicle to be observed by, and even integrated within an ad-hoc sensor network. Simulated and experimental results are presented demonstrating the autonomous vision- based docking strategy on a proof-of-concept vehicle.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For a mobile robot it is critical to detect and compensate for slippage, especially when driving in rough terrain environments. Due to its highly unpredictable nature, drift largely affects the accuracy of localization and control systems, even leading, in extreme cases, to the danger of vehicle entrapment with consequent mission failure. This paper presents a novel method for lateral slip estimation based on visually observing the trace produced by the wheels of the robot, during traverse of soft, deformable terrain, as that expected for lunar and planetary rovers. The proposed algorithm uses a robust Hough transform enhanced by fuzzy reasoning to estimate the angle of inclination of the wheel trace with respect to the vehicle reference frame. Any deviation of the wheel trace from the planned path of the robot suggests occurrence of sideslip that can be detected, and more interestingly, measured. This allows one to estimate the actual heading angle of the robot, usually referred to as the slip angle. The details of the various steps of the visual algorithm are presented and the results of experimental tests performed in the field with an all-terrain rover are shown, proving the method to be effective and robust.",

The localiser uses a sparse 3D-edge-map of the environment and a particle filter to estimate the pose of the vehicle. The vehicle operates in dynamic and non-uniform outdoor lighting conditions, an issue that is addressed by using knowledge of the scene to intelligently adjust the camera exposure and hence improve the quality of the information in the image. Results from the industrial vehicle are shown and compared to another laser-based localiser which acts as a ground truth. An improved likelihood metric, using per-edge calculation, is presented and has shown to be 40% more accurate in estimating rotation. Visual localization results from the vehicle driving an arbitrary 1.5km path during a bright sunny period show an average position error of 0.44m and rotation error of 0.62deg.",

A global model describing the behavior of the robotic system equipped with the camera is used to predict the evolution of the visual feature on a future horizon. The main interest of this method is the capability to easily take into account different constraints like mechanical limitations and/or visibility constraints. Simulation experiments are performed on a planar manipulator with an omnidirectional camera. Comparisons with the classical control law based on the interaction matrix highlight the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed approach, especially in difficult initial configurations and large displacements.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion of research on the computational modeling of human visual attention in task free conditions, i.e., given an image predict where humans are likely to look. This area of research could potentially provide general purpose mechanisms for robots to orient their cameras. One difficulty is that most current models of visual saliency are computationally very expensive and not suited to real time implementations needed for robotic applications. Here we propose a fast approximation to a Bayesian model of visual saliency recently proposed in the literature. The approximation can run in real time on current computers at very little computational cost, leaving plenty of CPU cycles for other tasks. We empirically evaluate the saliency model in the domain of controlling saccades of a camera in social robotics situations. The goal was to orient a camera as quickly as possible toward human faces. We found that this simple general purpose saliency model doubled the success rate of the camera: it captured images of people 70% of the time, when compared to a 35% success rate when the camera was controlled using an open-loop scheme. After 3 saccades (camera movements), the robot was 96% likely to capture at least one person. The results suggest that visual saliency models may provide a useful front end for camera control in robotics applications.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel approach to robust visual servoing. This method removes the feature tracking step from a typical visual servoing algorithm. We do not need correspondences of the features for deriving the control signal. This is achieved by modeling the image features as a Mixture of Gaussians in the current as well as desired images. Using Lyapunov theory, a control signal is derived to minimize a distance function between the two Gaussian mixtures. The distance function is given in a closed form, and its gradient can be efficiently computed and used to control the system. For simplicity, we first consider the 2D motion case. Then, the general case is presented by introducing the depth distribution of the features to control the six degrees of freedom. Experiments are conducted within a simulation framework to validate our proposed method.",

Instead of using geometric features (points, straight lines, pose, homography, etc.) as it is usually done, we use directly the luminance of all pixels in the image. Since most of the classical control laws fail in this case, we turn the visual servoing problem into an optimization problem leading to a new control law. Experimental results validate the proposed approach and show its robustness regarding to approximated depths, non Lambertian objects and partial occlusions.",

The advantage of this design is that it can estimate the target status and target image velocity without using the knowledge of target\u2019s 3D motion-model information. This advantage is helpful for real-time visual tracking controller design. In order to increase the robustness against random observation noise, a neural network based self-tuning algorithm is proposed using echo state network (ESN) technique. The visual state estimator is designed by combining a Kalman filter with the ESN-based self-tuning algorithm. The performance of this estimator design has been evaluated using computer simulation. Several interesting experiments on a mobile robot validate the proposed algorithms.",

This paper also integrates the visual tracking method and visual servo control into a vision-based control method with occlusion handling. The proposed method chooses a set of correctly extracted image features, and it then obtains an estimate of all the image features from the correctly extracted image features. The estimation procedure makes it possible to track image features even when occlusion occurs. The method has low computational complexity, since the image Jacobian is used for the image feature selection and estimation. In addition, even when the controller fails to track a moving image feature, it can find the failed image feature without a global search over the entire image plane. As a result, it can track the failed image feature again quickly.",

Wavelets have the ability to estimate random friction maps without any prior modeling while preserving linearity in the model parameters. The WN friction model was compared against the Coulomb+viscous (CV) model through experiments with the PHANTOM Omni haptic device (SensAble Technologies, MA, USA); however, the theory is valid for any serial-chain robotic manipulator. Ability to estimate applied motor torques was used as the performance metric, quantified using relative RMS values. During training of the WN model it outperformed the CV model in all cases, with an improvement in relative RMS ranging from 0.4 to 7.5 percentage points, illustrating the potential of the WN friction model. However, during testing of the WN model on an independent data set results were mixed, highlighting the challenge of achieving sufficient training.",

Face recognition has been studied in the past decade exhaustively in the context of security systems and with significant progress on huge datasets. However, these capabilities are not in focus when it comes to social interaction situations. Humans are able to remember people seen for a short moment in time and apply this knowledge directly in their engagement in conversation. In order to equip a robot with capabilities to recall human interlocutors and to provide user- aware services, we adopt human-human interaction schemes to propose a face memory on the basis of active appearance models integrated with the active memory architecture. This paper presents the concept of the interactive face memory, the applied recognition algorithms, and their embedding into the robot's system architecture. Performance measures are discussed for general face databases as well as scenario-specific datasets.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many advanced motion control strategies developed in robotics use captured human motion data as valuable source of examples to simplify the process of programming or learning complex robot motions. Direct and online control of robots from observed human motion has several inherent challenges. The most important may be the representation of the large number of mechanical degrees of freedom involved in the execution of movement tasks. Attempting to map all such degrees of freedom from a human to a humanoid is a formidable task from an instrumentation and sensing point of view. More importantly, such an approach is incompatible with mechanisms in the central nervous system which are believed to organize or simplify the control of these degrees of freedom during motion execution and motor learning phase. Rather than specifying the desired motion of every degree of freedom for the purpose of motion control, it is important to describe motion by low dimensional motion primitives that are defined in Cartesian (or task) space. In this paper, we formulate the human to humanoid retargeting problem as a task space control problem. The control objective is to track desired task descriptors while satisfying constraints such as joint limits, velocity limits, collision avoidance, and balance. The retargeting algorithm generates the joint space trajectories that are commanded to the robot. We present experimental and simulation results of the retargeting control algorithm on the Honda humanoid robot ASIMO.",

Such tasks require complicated manipulations involving the whole-body and fine coordination between legs, arms and torso motions. We introduce here a whole-body motion planner that allows a humanoid robot to autonomously plan a pivoting strategy that accounts for the various constraints: collision avoidance, legs-arms coordination and stability control. Based on a previous result by the authors [1] proving the small-time controllability of a pivoting system, the planner is proven to inherit from the probabilistic completeness of the samplingbased motion planning method it is built on. The geometric and kinematic capacity of the proposed planner is mainly demonstrated through simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of feedback provided by an autonomous robot (BIRON) on users' discursive behavior. A user study is described during which users show objects to the robot. The results of the experiment indicate, that the robot's verbal feedback utterances cause the humans to adapt their own way of speaking. The changes in users' verbal behavior are due to their beliefs about the robots knowledge and abilities. In this paper they are identified and grouped. Moreover, the data implies variations in user behavior regarding gestures. Unlike speech, the robot was not able to give feedback with gestures. Due to the lack of feedback, users did not seem to have a consistent mental representation of the robot's abilities to recognize gestures. As a result, changes between different gestures are interpreted to be unconscious variations accompanying speech.",
