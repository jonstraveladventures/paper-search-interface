The objective is to provide a fast and general solution to the inverse kinematic problem when it is extensively evaluated in the design processes of manipulators. A mathematical function is evolved through genetic programming according to the known direct kinematic model to determine an analytical expression which approximates the joint variable solution for a given end-effector configuration. As an illustration of this evolutionary symbolic regression process, the inverse kinematic models of the PUMA and GMF Arc Mate are approximated before applying the algorithm to general 6R manipulators.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a comparison of PD controls in joints space for serial manipulators whose dynamics is expressed in terms of two different kinds of quasi-velocities. Robot dynamic algorithms in terms of so called normalized and unnormalized quasi-velocities are recursive in nature and consists of two recursions: one starts from a base of the manipulator towards its tip, and the other in an opposite direction. Both recursions are described by using a vector-matrix notation. An instantaneous eigenstructure quasi-velocity formulation, as a result of numerical mass matrix factorization, is introduced. The two PD controls were tested on the model of a manipulator with two degrees of freedom. The standard control algorithms known in robotic literature are considered for a case when the robot dynamics is formulated in terms of quasi-velocities.",

We also show, through simulations, that these conclusions appear to extend to a moving vehicle with process noise. However, these inconsistencies only become apparent after several hundred beacon updates.",

In order to increase the sensitivity by exact tuning the resonant modes without instability problem, we devised two torsion springs for sensing mode in addition to four driving springs attached to outer gimbal. For the fabrication of the proposed gyroscope with high aspect ratio and wafer level vacuum packaging, we used the mixed micro-machining process which has the merits of a conventional surface and bulk micro-machining process. The measured vacuum level of the fabricated gyroscope was about 100 mTorr and the driving and sensing mode frequencies were tuned in 5 Hz. The gyroscope has the sensitivity of 0.013 deg./sec and bandwidth of 60 Hz. The output non-linearity is below than 2% in +100 deg./sec full scale.",

The model used for identification of the dynamics of the human-robot system consists of the NN and a reference model which represents the main characteristic of a skilful operator. This paper explains the working principle of the training method and shows the validity of the proposed method through experiments by non-skilled operators.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel quantitative measure of redundancy, called refined redundancy index (RRI), which is measured in the joint-rate level, is proposed. Based on the concept that a larger solution space of the inverse kinematics problem represents larger redundancy, the RRI is defined as the normalized magnitude of the solution spaces. The value of the RRI varies from 0 to 1, and larger RRI corresponds to larger redundancy. Unlike joint-angle-level approaches, our method does not have the problem that different regions of joint angles correspond to the same primary task. The proposed RRI is computationally efficient and easy to apply for real-time applications. Simulation results show that with RRI the manipulator can reduce the execution time of a given task significantly, compared to the conventional approach. The results also illustrate that motion failures can be avoided with RRI. It is believed that RRI can be applied to a variety of applications of redundant robots in the future.",

        "abstract": "In applications of industrial robots, the robot manipulator must traverse a pre-specified Cartesian curve (path) with its hand tip while links of the robot safely move among obstacles. In order to reduce the costs of collision detection, the number of collision checks can be reduced by enclosing a few obstacles (a cluster) with a larger (artificial) bounding volume, e.g. by their convex hull, without cutting the specified curve. In the paper, an efficient and convergent recursive algorithm for refining an initial randomly generated set of clusters is proposed to tackle the problem of clustering convex polygonal obstacles in a 2D robot's scene. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm acquires less number of clusters and computationally more efficient. In addition, the algorithm can be easily applied to dynamic environment based on the idea of seeds in clusters.",

Utilizing the snake (its forms and motion) as a model to develop a snake-like robot that emulates a snakes' function is important for generating a new type of locomotor and expanding the possible use of robots. We developed a simulator to simulate the creeping locomotion of a snake-like robot, in which the robot dynamics is modeled and its interaction with the environment is considered through Coulomb friction. This simulator makes it possible to analyze the creeping locomotion with the normal-direction slip coupled to gliding along the tangential direction. Through the developed simulator, we investigated the snake-like robot creeping locomotion which is generated only by swinging each of the joints from side to side, and discussed the optimal creeping locomotion of the snake-like robot that is adaptable to a given environment.",

        "abstract": "We propose a greatly simplified femoral canal shaping method for robot-assisted total hip replacement surgery that requires neither CT/MRI imaging nor insertion of fiducial markers before surgery. A reamer-shaped registration gauge is inserted into the femoral canal and used to position a base for a robot that is mounted on the top of the femur and used to prepare the femoral canal. In a study using 5 fresh cadavers, the average registration error for selected points near the surface of the femoral cavity was 0.59 mm; this is comparable to the errors reported for the geometry-based registration methods.",

We identify the nonlinear system by updating the weights of the DDNNs and then design the controller adaptively based on the neural networks model to achieve the model following purpose. An analysis via Lyapunov stability criteria shows that the proposed control algorithm guarantees parameter estimation convergence and system stability, with the output of the system following the specified reference model.

The parameters of system are assumed to be unknown and only the motor position and link position measurements are used for the synthesis of the controller. A canonical state representation of the system is derived and filters are designed to obtain estimates of the derivatives of motor angle and link angle. Then an adaptive control law for the trajectory control of link displacement angle is derived. Compared to the same adaptive controller which only measures the link displacement angle, the order of the proposed controller is halved (order of 2) and the complexity of the control law can be reduced dramatically. Also, the proposed controller does not require the bounds on uncertain parameters for the control law derivation as compared to other output adaptive control laws.",

The proposed control method for cooperative mobile robots is constructed by extending the PVFC. This research is different from the previous work in which a common desired velocity field for cooperative PVFC and all cooperative mobile robots was only following the same desired velocity field using the proposed method supervisor can easily specify the behavior of the mobile robots. The stability and boundedness of the resultant system with the proposed control algorithm is also guaranteed. Finally, the proposed control algorithm is examined by computer simulations for cooperative tasks with two mobile robots, and the results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A variable structure controller design for the tip position control of a flexible one-link manipulator was presented by Thomas et al. (1997). The control torque obtained using this design methodology was subjected to high frequency chattering. This makes it impossible to implement the controller in practice. The absence of a sign(S) function in the control law makes it impossible to implement the boundary layer technique of chatter reduction where the sign(S) function is replaced by a saturation type function to yield a continuous control signal approximation that confines the system trajectory to a small band neighboring the switching surface. This paper presents a new switching law which not only alleviates chattering in the control signal but also ensures ideal sliding mode motion. Simulation results are presented to verify the claims attributed to the proposed method.",

It is difficult to determine an optimal network architecture for a specific system. We propose an architecture of the network-based control system applicable to a specific AGV system with a manipulator arm. The fixed number of periodic messages to be occurred is pre-defined in this system. To determine whether the proposed system architecture is effective or not, we perform a traffic analysis for the real-time communication of all messages. Through simulation, the range of transmission speed is found satisfying the required conditions, and the number of possible sensors to be added is investigated for improving the system performance, when the sampling periods of analog sensors are determined under a fixed condition that the transmission speed is over 500 Kbits/sec.",

Our framework includes a high-level planner which integrates and coordinates path planning and localization modules with the aid of a module for computing regions which are expected, with high probability, to contain the robot at any given time. The localization method is based on simple geometric properties of the environment which are computed during a preprocessing stage. The roadmap-based path planner enables one to select routes, and subgoals along those routes, that will facilitate localization and other optimization criteria. In addition, our framework enables one to quickly plan new routes, dynamically, based on the current position as computed by intermediate localization operations. We present simulation and hardware experimental results that illustrate the practicality and potential of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Customers are demanding shorter lead times and higher product variety without making concessions on product price and quality. To remain competitive, a manufacturing system needs to react adequately to perturbations on its environment and uncertainties in manufacturing processes. The paper touches upon three research topics for the development of a scheduler based on manufacturing system states: development of a simulator for the simulation of a manufacturing system, the clustering method for manufacturing system states, and the search method for the most compatible dispatching rule to a manufacturing system state. Finally, the results of simulation experiments are given to compare the proposed method with other scheduling methods. The result shows that the superiority of the proposed scheduler. In the process of developing the scheduler, a general methodology for the development of a simulator and the clustering method for system states were developed. The proposed methodology for the development of simulators seems to be useful for developing simulators for various domains. The clustering method of system states and the knowledge acquisition method for scheduling rules are shown to be efficient for the development of an autonomous real-time scheduling system.",

A new subnet called the step-aligned subnet, which can describe various kinds of PN structures such as marked graphs, state machines and asymmetric nets, is introduced. The step-evaluation method is developed to efficiently investigate the reachable marking problem in step-aligned subnets instead of the full search of reachability graph. The crucial idea of the method is to decompose a large reachable marking problem into a number of smaller subproblems. This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition in order to find maximally permissive controls in the context of step-aligned subnets. Theoretic results are applied to modeling and control of a flexible assembly cell.",

It is shown that the behavior of singularity of parallel mechanisms could be more complicated than that of serial ones. However, it is not very clear whether singularity will bring problems to kinematics, dynamics or other characteristics and what result will be caused when parallel mechanisms fall into the neighborhood of a singularity. We focus on the study of the undesired effects of singularity in parallel mechanisms and propose a method to solve them, namely the method of redundancy. Three kinds of redundant methods are developed and their advantages are discussed. In the experiments, we concentrate on the control of redundantly actuated parallel mechanisms. We control the parallel mechanisms tracking a given trajectory by kinematic control method and dynamic control method respectively. Experimental results verified the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",

This paper presents a non-regressor based adaptive control scheme with a disturbance observer for tracking the trajectory of underwater mobile platform-mounted manipulators. The presented control system does not require any information about the system. The disturbance observer regards the difference between the actual output and the output of the nominal model as an equivalent disturbance applied to the nominal model. The adaptive control law then estimates control gains defined by the combinations of the bounded constants of parameter matrices of the nominal model with disturbance error. The performance of the proposed control scheme was evaluated by a computer simulation with a two-link planar manipulator mounted on a one 1-DOF mobile platform. The effect of hydrodynamic forces acting on the manipulator was also considered.",

The immune system is a living body's self-protection and self-maintenance system. These features can be applied to decision making of optimal swarm behavior in a dynamically changing environment. For applying the immune system to DARS, a robot is regarded as a B-cell, each environmental condition as an antigen, a behavior strategy as an antibody and control parameter as a T-cell respectively. The executing process of proposed method is as follows. When the environmental condition changes, a robot selects an appropriate behavior strategy and its behavior strategy is stimulated and suppressed by other robots using communication. Finally much stimulated strategy is adopted as a swarm behavior strategy. This control scheme is based on clonal selection and the idiotopic network hypothesis. It is used for decision making of optimal swarm strategy. By T-cell modeling, adaptation ability of robot is enhanced in dynamic environments.",

The system generates a procedural program, identical in function to a procedural program developed in a conventional robot programming language, that can be easily re-used in similar but different application tasks. In essence, based on the skills demonstrated by a human teacher, a robot can be automatically programmed to perform complex assembly tasks. Robot users with no programming skills will be able to \"bootstrap\" themselves to a semi-autonomous operation after a small number of taught examples. In addition, as the task requirements change, the robot can be re-programmed as easily as it was initially programmed. Unlike the conventional program development process, the operator need not postulate about the value of sensor feedback variables required at a particular level of the controller. In fact, the operator need not be familiar with the syntax and semantics of the programming language at all.",

The guidance control strategy is based on a path tracking error generation methodology that takes into account both the distance and the angular errors of the airship with respect to the desired trajectory. The control strategy uses a PI controller for the tail surfaces' deflection.",

A patient can maintain inverse pendulum control of the wheel chair after raising its front wheels. Next, a patient can move to the step maintaining the inverse pendulum control, and can climb over the step being assisted by DC motor force. A light weight wheel chair system was optimally designed using small DC motors. The system required the patient's assistance to start the front wheel raising. A new front wheel raising scheme is proposed in the paper, which does not require the patient's assistance. The new scheme is using the back and forward moving scheme in which the wheel chair goes back first and then goes forward in order to start the front wheel raising.",

Its basic idea is to keep several sub-populations that are processed by genetic algorithms. Furthermore, a migration mechanism produces a chromosome exchange between sub-population. In this paper, a new selection method based on nonlinear fitness assignment is presented. The use of the proposed ranking selection permits higher local exploitation search, where the diversity of population is maintained by a parallel sub-population structure. Experimental results show the relation between the local-global search balance and probabilities of reaching the desired solutions using test functions and nonstationary route-planning problems.",

We then describe an emerging layered-manufacturing technology that allows us to fabricate the robots with passive mechanical properties like those found in nature. Finally, we present preliminary tests over different terrains and conditions which show speed and robustness approaching the performance of small animals.",

To achieve this result, several algorithms were combined: a dynamic adaptive sliding mode control; a time base generator (TBG) to yield a time-varying gain, which allows us to obtain finite time convergence; continuous parametrization to compensate for unknown dynamic friction, which in turn yields a continuous friction compensator; and a moving sliding surface, without knowledge of initial conditions, to obtain sliding mode all the time, and hence robustness. Two controllers are derived, the adaptive and the sliding mode version, both with similar closed-loop stability properties. Simulation data of a rigid robot arm is discussed.",

        "abstract": "A second prototype of a biped walking robot, called EP-WAR2 (Electropneumatic WAlking Robot), has been designed and built at LARM (Laboratory of Robotics and Mechatronics) in Cassino. In addition to the performances of the previous prototype EP-WAR, EP-WAR2 is able to climb stairs because of a new actuation system. A suitable programming of the programmable logic controller has been based on several subroutines, which run different walking motions and specifically to climb stairs. Experimental tests prove the validity of the proposed low-cost design and programming technique.",

This planner is based on a technique for computing the minimum translational distance between two mobile objects. This distance is then used for predicting and avoiding a collision. The computation of this distance is based on the application of the GJK algorithm to a particular subset of the Minkowski difference set of the involved objects. This subset states the separation or penetration distance between two objects along their given motions. When a collision is predicted, a collision-free intermediate temporal-position is generated avoiding such a collision.",

The more the size of robotic excavators increase, the more the length and mass of excavator's links; the more the parameters of a robotic excavator vary. A time-delay control with switching action (TDCSA) using an integral sliding surface is proposed for the control of a heavy-duty robotic excavator. The proposed controller is applied to straight-line motions of a robotic excavator with a speed level at which skilful operators work. Experiments, which were designed for surfaces with various inclinations and over broad ranges of joint motions, show that the proposed controller exhibits good performance.",

Large actuation effort may grow up to compensate for these errors. The sudden increases of actuator torque may violate the torque limit. We propose to employ a redundant actuation mode to facilitate disturbance rejection. An optimal load distribution algorithm for redundantly actuated system is introduced to reduce the effect of shocks. This scheme distributes the compensating effort to the system actuators in consideration of the torque limit. The disturbance rejection capability of the proposed scheme is compared with those of other load distribution methods by simulation and experiment. A five-bar mechanism is employed as an exemplary plant.",

The motions of an underwater manipulator can affect the attitude and position of the ROV which should remain stationary in seabed operation. To compensate for the dynamic effect of the underwater manipulator on the ROV, the force-torque (F/T) information between the manipulator and the vehicle is used to regulate the states of the ROV. When an F/T sensor is practically unavailable, a disturbance observer can fill the role of the F/T sensor. This paper proposes a disturbance observer for estimating the interaction forces between the ROV and the manipulator. A two-link manipulator mounted on an ROV is considered and numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the improvement on the manoeuvrability of the proposed controller.",

PZT-SH and PZN-PT are investigated as piezoelectric layers in the unimorph actuators. Design issues for microaerial flapping actuators are discussed, and criteria for the optimal dimensions of actuators are determined. For low power consumption actuation, a square wave based electronic driving circuit is proposed. Fabricated piezoelectric unimorphs are characterized by an optical measurement system in quasi-static and dynamic mode. Experimental performance of PZT-5H and PZIV-PT based unimorphs is compared with desired design specifications. A 1-DOF flapping mechanism with a PZT-SH unimorph is constructed, and 180/spl deg/ stroke motion at 95 Hz is achieved. Thus, it is shown that unimorphs could be promising flapping mechanism actuators.",

On the other hand, active type prostheses can improve the swing phase gait but these are expensive, heavy and consume large energy. Thus we propose a semi-active prosthesis using the rotary magnetorheological (MR) damper. The torque dissipation in the knee joint can be controlled by the magnetic field induced by the solenoid. A 3-DOF leg simulator has been developed to generate various hip motions and analyze the results of walking motions. The tracking control of knee joint angle was performed with this leg simulator. The experiment shows that the proposed prosthesis system has good performance in swing phase. We applied the repetitive controller in conjunction with the computed control law and PD control law. This algorithm reduces the RMS tracking error as the repetitions of the tracking. Moreover, the proposed prosthesis system is adaptable to walking speed.",

Computer simulations were performed in order to find the traces of the guide stick at three different paths using an in-house Visual C/sup ++/ software. Actual experiments were also performed to compare with the computer simulation results. The difference between the actual experiment and the simulation was 1.19 cm in the straight path. However, the difference alter the first 90/spl deg/ turn was 9.3 cm and became 11.9 cm after the second 90/spl deg/ turn. Nevertheless, the intelligent guide stick followed the path of the road successfully avoiding the obstacle.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the developmental software environment for humanoids is introduced. This environment has the following features: 1) a hardware concealment function which saves the trouble with hardware improvements; 2) an incremental expansion function which supports a long-term development by many developers; and 3) a centralised management of body information which enables the robots to share software among different bodies. These features are realized by the plug-in architecture, the universal robot model and its compilers. Using plug-ins enables one to accumulate functions developed by different developers and to switch computer interfaces of the robot body. The universal robot model and compilers promote the use of external software and share software modules among different bodies.",

The concept consists of using a massively parallel microactuator array to generate a pressure field on a planar surface. The objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped by controlling this pressure field surrounding the objects. The architecture of the active surface device is designed in a modular manner, which allows the array to be expanded by simply adding modules to the system. A general-purpose test bed has been built to experiment with this new design. An object recognition algorithm and several control techniques have been successfully implemented to perform basic sensing and handling operations. The architecture and mechanisms of this prototype test bed and the implementation of algorithms are presented.",

The application in mind is that of a walking robot and particular attention is paid to the large and abrupt changes in accelerations that can be expected in such an environment. We propose a state estimation algorithm that fuses data from rate gyros and accelerometers to give long-term drift free attitude estimates. The algorithm does not use any local parameterization of the rigid body kinematics and can thus be used for a rigid body performing any kind of rotations. The algorithm is a combination of two non-standard, but in a sense linear, Kalman filters between which a trigger based switching takes place. The kinematics representation used makes it possible to construct a linear algorithm that can be shown to give convergent estimates for this nonlinear problem. The state estimator is evaluated in simulations demonstrating how the estimates are long term stable even in the presence of gyrodrift.",

Based on the proposed method, the robot can select an appropriate module according to the priority. In addition, we apply the module conflict resolution to a multiagent environment. Consequently, multiple tasks are automatically allocated to the multiple robots. As a task example, a soccer game is selected to show the validity of the proposed method.

        "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated the ability for automatic design of the morphology and control of real physical robots using techniques inspired by biological evolution. The main criticism of the evolutionary design approach, however, is that it is doubtful whether it will reach the high complexities necessary for practical engineering. Here we claim that for automatic design systems to scale in complexity the designs they produce must be made of re-used modules. Our approach is based on the use of a generative design grammar subject to an evolutionary process. Unlike a direct encoding of a design, a generative design specification can re-use components, giving it the ability to create more complex modules from simpler ones. Re-used modules are also valuable for improved efficiency in testing and construction. We describe a system for creating generative specifications capable of hierarchical modularity by combining Lindenmayer systems with evolutionary algorithms. Using this system we demonstrate for the first time a generative system for physical, modular, 2D locomoting robots and their controllers.",

A special gear train with omnidirectional mechanism was developed using conventional tire wheels. Several control laws are provided by considering the robot as a redundantly actuated wheeled mobile robot on the plane. Since the robot has three degrees of freedom in motion, failure in any one of the motor can be compensated by the other two motors in posture control although the omnidirectional mobility is lost. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed omnidirectional mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a fast algorithm to compute collision translations for pairs of convex polyhedra with some interesting features. From a theoretical viewpoint, besides the novelty of the approach, the polylog asymptotic trend in the average case is as good as that of the best algorithms proposed to solve the similar problems. On the other hand, the measured performances to detect possible collisions from scratch are satisfactory, and this is especially true in cases where the bodies do not collide. However, the most peculiar feature is a simple and flexible mechanism to exploit spatial coherence in a continuous range, which distinguishes this algorithm from all the other proposals we know. Furthermore, the nature of the approach is such that the self-tuning capability is attained at negligible additional costs even for unrelated collision tests. After a brief outline of the main ideas characterizing the approach, a set of numerical results are summarized. The proposed algorithm may be appropriate to plan collision-free paths, both online and off-line, on the basis of fine-grain descriptions of the objects in the workspace.",

In order to handle some small objects, an electrostatic micromanipulator driven by the piezo-bimorph is also incorporated on the robot. The small sliding table on the robot can transport them at SEM focusing point accurately. This arrangement can allow the X-Y accurate positioning at any location within the chamber. On the sample table, a micromanipulator from another small robot can pick up and down the small objects simultaneously. In addition, the fiber guided YAG-laser is also employed to provide the micro-material abrasion. The operator can control each small robot easily with the help of the real time monitoring of SEM image and the PC assisted interface.",

In the case of a careless collision between a robot and a human, impact force and impact stress are chosen as evaluation measures, and a danger-index is defined to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of each safety strategy used for control. As in a previous paper on safety design, this proposed method allows us to assess the contribution of each safety control strategy to the overall safety performance of a human-care robot. In addition, a new type of 3D robot simulation system for danger-evaluation is constructed on PC. The system simplifies to evaluate danger about both design and control of various kind of human-care robots to quantify the effectiveness of various safety strategies.",

        "abstract": "Trajectory of an underactuated manipulator is usually generated according to both kinematics and dynamics of the manipulator, different to that of conventional manipulator. The real trajectory by a real system may differ greatly from the trajectory generated from the dynamics model because there always exist errors in the dynamic model, and the feedback control is less effective in an underactuated manipulator. A method for generation of optimal trajectory for the real system of an underactuated manipulator with nonholonomic constraints is proposed. By using this method, the dynamics model of a real system can be improved by learning, and an optimal trajectory is generated according to the model improved sequentially. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by experiment with a golf swinging robot. The implementation and experimental results obtained of the control method are described.",

Furthermore, it is proven that the \"centripetal screw\" as well as the momentum of a rigid body together with all its derivatives, are also screws, and that a rigid body's dynamics can be geometrically expressed as a screw equation. The paper relies on a somewhat more formal treatment of the screw theory than usual, in order to clarify these \"controversial\" issues concerning the motion of rigid systems, and in order to make the link with the more general (and historically much richer) field of differential geometry.",

The walking cycle is divided in two phases: single support, in which one leg is in contact with the ground and the other leg swings forward, and double support, in which the forward leg absorbs the impact and gradually accepts the robot's weight. The contact of the foot with the constrained surface is modelled through linear and nonlinear spring-damper systems. The proposed control approach is based on simple motion goals taking into account the reaction forces between the feet and the ground. The control algorithm is tested through several experiments and its effectiveness and robustness is discussed.",

Although one does not expect such a simple mapping method to minimize the travel distance of the robot, we present analytical results that show (perhaps surprisingly) that the travel distance of the robot is reasonably small. This is interesting because greedy mapping has a number of desirable properties. It is simple to implement and integrate into complete robot architectures. It does not need to have control of the rebut at all times, takes advantage of prior knowledge about parts of the terrain (if available), and can be used by several robots cooperatively.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the human interface of an eating assistant robot to assist people with severe disability to gain/regain independence in eating. A spoon and a CCD camera are attached on the tip of the robotic arm. The spoon can be actuated in three orthogonal directions, and can also be rotated. The PC display indicates the image of the CCD camera and a control panel of the robot. The human interface proposed uses the PC display and a head pointing device. A user can easily control the eating assist robot by using his/her head action and a puff activated switch. This paper describes also the evaluation of user's emotion during the operation of the eating assistant robot. A galvanic skin reflex (GSR) sensor is used to detect the user's emotion. Using the experimental results of the GSR sensor, an optimal movement scheme by considering the user's emotion has been decided. The eating assistant experiments on a disabled person with cervical vertebrae damage are also described briefly.",

        "abstract": "Studies a two-legged kneed walking robot with point feet. At any given moment, only one foot is in contact with the ground, and the switching is instantaneous. The robot can be considered as a simplified model of human walking. The periodic torque histories applied to each link are a priori prescribed for a motion and are not changed by any feedback interference. Nevertheless the robot is capable of naturally recovering from perturbations, returning to standard gait-a property that we call open-loop stable. We formulate the problem of open-loop stabilization as an optimal control problem. Design parameters and periodic torque inputs that lead to a stable configuration are computed using a two-level optimization procedure. We believe that this is the first demonstration of the ability to create stable actuated open-loop gaits of bipedal walking robots.",

        "abstract": "Adaptation of biological systems can be viewed as decreasing local interaction among subsystems to realize effective cooperation. Conversely, it is important for effective cooperation to evaluate and control local interaction. Based on this idea we present a method of realizing cooperative rope turning by a man and a manipulator. The rotating motion of the manipulator arm for rope turning can be specified by frequency and phase difference between the arm and the rope. The frequency is determined in real-time by rhythm entrainment using a phase-locked loop. The phase difference is related to the quantity of local inter-action, that is, energy transfer from the arm to the rope. Therefore it is controlled to realize desired energy transfer, which is estimated from human demonstration. In the experiment the manipulator can successfully adapt its motion to that of the human partner.",

        "abstract": "Since a biped humanoid inherently suffers from instability and always risks tipping over, ensuring high stability and reliability of walking is one of the most important goals. The paper proposes a walk control consisting of a feedforward dynamic pattern and a feedback sensory reflex. The dynamic pattern is a rhythmic and periodic motion, which satisfies the constraints of dynamic stability and ground conditions, and is generated assuming that the models of the humanoid and the environment are known. The sensory reflex is a simple, but rapid motion programmed with respect to sensory information. The sensory reflex, we propose, consists of the body posture control, the actual ZMP (zero moment point) control, and the landing time control. With the dynamic pattern and the sensory reflex, it is possible for the humanoid to walk rhythmically and to adapt itself to environmental uncertainties. The effectiveness of our proposed method was confirmed by walk experiments of an actual 26 DOF humanoid on an unknown rough terrain and in the presence of disturbances.",

The control method is based on an immobilization theory which ensures that when a spider-like mechanism is bracing against the environment at an immobile posture, the naturally occurring compliance at the contacts stabilizes the mechanism as a single body. Based on this result, we present two versions of a position control law for general k-limbed spider robots. We show that if the controller's stiffness (i.e. proportional gain) is above a lower limit determined by the spider and environment parameters, stability of the closed-loop spider system is guaranteed. We present dynamic simulations of a spider robot moving in a tunnel under the influence of the immobilization-based control law. The simulations show excellent convergence properties of the control algorithm. A four-legged spider prototype has been built, and we conclude with a description of initial experiments with this robot.",

The devices using MR fluids have an ability to provide high-torque, low-inertia, a safe device and simple interface. In this study, we report on an actuator developed using the MR fluid, which consists of an input part, an output part and an MR fluid clutch between them. First, the basic experiments are examined to investigate the characteristics of the actuator. Next, the torque control system of the MR-fluid actuator is proposed. Finally, the closed-loop control experiments were carried out and it is confirmed that the torque-feedback control is effective for improving the response properties of MR actuators.",

        "abstract": "Presents a situation-driven reconfigurable architecture for a schema-based robot controller which is operating in partially known indoor environments. Instead of the purely repulsive forces from the obstacles, we employ the linear combination of the repulsive and the detouring forces around the obstacle, so that the obstacles generate virtual forces pushing the robot toward the goal rather than just blocking it. By reconfiguring the detouring direction and the activation level of each schema based on the geometric and/or topological information provided by the variable resolution maps, the robot can navigate through the environments in very natural way. Simulation results show that our approach can remarkably improve the intrinsic defects of traditional potential field-bused schemas.",

        "abstract": "Discusses an inverse dynamics problem and proposes a trajectory generation method for wire-suspended mechanisms. The wire-suspended mechanisms are classified into two types, which are completely restrained type mechanisms and incomplete by restrained type mechanisms. For the incompletely restrained type mechanisms, consideration of dynamics is important, because the motion of this mechanism is governed by its dynamics and kinematics, whereas the motion of the completely restrained type mechanism is determined by only its kinematics. The paper discusses mainly the incompletely restrained type mechanisms from the viewpoint of dynamical properties. The incompletely restrained type wire-suspended mechanism has a merit that it enables three dimensional positioning and orientating of suspended object with simple mechanism using a small number of wires. However it also has a drawback that the manipulated object is easy to swing as seen in overhead crane which as a simple incompletely restrained type mechanism. To overcome the problem, inverse dynamics for general incompletely restrained type wire-suspended mechanism is discussed, then a condition on desired trajectory of manipulated object is presented on the basis of the inverse dynamics analysis. Using the desired trajectory, an online trajectory modification method for the control of manually operated overhead crane is proposed.",

For systems satisfying this property, the problem of planning fast collision-free trajectories between zero velocity states can be decoupled into the computationally simpler problems of path planning for a kinematic system followed by time-optimal time scaling. While this approach is well known for fully actuated systems, until now there has been no way to apply it to underactuated dynamic systems. The results in this paper form the basis for efficient collision-free trajectory planning for a broad class of underactuated mechanical systems including manipulators and vehicles in space and underwater environments.",

Nanorobots and other NEMS are expected to find revolutionary applications in science, engineering and everyday life. Until now, nanostructures have been built primarily in 2D, because of the difficulties of 3D fabrication. This paper describes a promising approach to the construction of 3D nanostructures by working in successive layers, much like the rapid prototyping techniques used in the macroscopic world. Each object nanolayer is built by nanomanipulation, or possibly by programmed self-assembly, and then surrounded by a sacrificial layer that planarizes the sample and serves as a substrate for the deposition of the next object nanolayer. Initial experimental results which show that the approach is feasible are presented.",

In human motion control, it is important to learn a feedback controller for the hand position error in the human inverse kinematics solver. This paper proposes a novel model that uses disturbance noise and the feedback error signal to learn coordinate transformations of the human visual feedback controller. The proposed model redresses drawbacks in current models because it does not rely on complex signal switching, which does not seem neurophysiologically plausible.

The robot is used for scanning natural terrain and detecting metal objects hidden beneath the terrain surface (e.g., landmines) using a metal detector. The range image may be interpreted for visual servoing, map building and path planning, or object recognition. In the work, the image is used to build a terrain map for obstacle free path planning. Because the working area of the robot is extremely dynamic (i.e., not only the robot travels but also the environment is also subject to change) an active range sensing method is selected to provide the range image. The range values are acquired using a laser range finder with a rotating mirror for scanning so that sensor fusion in the form of collecting sensor readings over an extended period of time is required. In addition, range readings of two ultrasonic range finders are fused at signal level to tackle both sensor imperfection and environmental illumination that induce uncertainty at the system. We explain the use of a real-time programming platform that executes an online map-building process in parallel for robot manipulation and control.",

Combined with an example, some key items are pointed out during modeling. The simulation results on a parallel machine tool show that the model based on the method is of high accuracy and the error modeling method is correct and reliable. No matter what the error parameter of position and orientation is, the ideal error model would be obtained by means of the method. The accuracy of a parallel machine tool can be raised greatly by using the model to compensate the position and orientation.",

Today, robots with dimensions of a few cm/sup 3/ can be developed. Like conventional robots, microrobots represent a complex system that usually contains several different types of actuators and sensors. The measurement of gripping forces is the most important sensor application in micro-manipulation besides visual servoing to protect the parts from excessive surface pressures and thereby damage the object during the assembly process. In this paper suitable force sensing methods are described, and a concept for the measurement of gripping forces in micro-robotics with AFM cantilevers is introduced. Furthermore, the signal processing and haptic interface used are presented.",

        "abstract": "Wafer fabrication is one of the most competitive manufacturing business in the world. In order to survive in such a strongly competitive environment, finding an effective schedule which can result in higher machine utilization and throughput rate, shorter cycle time, and lower WIP (work-in-process) inventory becomes a major task. Besides that, in order to help customers to make ordering decisions as well as to let the manager control the processing conditions of the fab, we need to predict some performance measures efficiently. We propose a modeling tool called queueing-Petri net (Q-PN) which combines the characteristics of queueing theory and Petri nets. It can be used to model various details of the manufacturing systems as well as to evaluate its performance very efficiently. Then, a general Q-PN model is presented to simulate the semiconductor manufacturing system. Based on this model, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based scheduler and an analysis-based predictor. In the GA scheduler, the chromosome represents a combination of scheduling policies, including lot release policies, machine selection rules, dispatch rules and batch rules. So, when the GA finishes its optimization process, an optimal scheduling policy is produced. As for the predictor, because it inherits the analytical property of queueing theory from the Q-PN model, we can use it to predict those performance measures efficiently such as the exact due date of some particular lot.",

We introduce the nonlinear velocity obstacle, which takes into account the shape, velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. The nonlinear v-obstacle allows selecting a single avoidance maneuver (if one exists) that avoids any number of obstacles moving on any known trajectories. For unknown trajectories, the nonlinear v-obstacles can be used to generate local avoidance maneuvers based on the current velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. This elevates the planning strategy to a second order method, compared to the first order avoidance using the linear v-obstacle, and zero order avoidance using only position information. Analytic expressions for the nonlinear v-obstacle are derived for general trajectories in the plane. The nonlinear v-obstacles are demonstrated in a complex traffic example.",

        "abstract": "Dual Stator Variable Reluctance Motors (VRM) are electrically commutated ac machines and can be used as direct drive actuators, but inherent nonlinearity of VRM results in difficulties, when smooth and quiet operation are required. In this paper, a high performance control system for VRM is presented. The whole control algorithms consist of four closed-loop controllers: position, velocity, torque and current controller. In the torque controller, the torque ripple is reduced via the torque-sharing function and current PWM control, and the command current is easily obtained from the shared torque command via the proposed nonlinear model of the motor. The velocity controller is a combination of fuzzy and proportional-integral algorithm. The lead angle algorithm is also introduced to improve the performance of system in high speed. The position controller is intended for velocity trajectory tracking. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the control system.",

We present a physical model based adaptive robust control (ARC) strategy to explicitly take into account the strong coupling among various hydraulic cylinders (or joints). The property that the adjoint matrix and determinant of the inertial matrix could be linearly parametrized by certain suitably selected parameters is fully exploited and the overparametrizing method is used. Furthermore, the proposed ARC controller guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties only. Simulation and experimental results on a three degree-of-freedom hydraulic robot arm are presented to illustrate the proposed control algorithm.",

Experimental results showing the quality of the results and the low computational cost are presented.",

We first have a brief review and discussion on different dynamics formulations in the literature (Newton-Euler, direct Lagrangian, and Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation on the reduced system). Then we show the equivalence of these methods. Based on the concepts from differential manifolds, we prove that away from configuration singularity, there exists a projection from the joint space to parameterize the configuration space. The fact that the dynamics is well defined even at actuators singularity, end-effector singularity and other kinds of parameterization singularity is highlighted. For the method of reduced systems, there are two main drawbacks. Firstly the joints being cut for forming the tree system are presumed to have no external torque. Secondly the force and torque applied to other links of the manipulator is not considered. We propose two methods to remedy the situation. Firstly by cutting a link instead of a joint, all the joints torque can be incorporated into our equations of motion. This is useful not only for the case of actuating all the joints, but also if we consider compensating the joints friction. Secondly we propose a concept of transforming force to the generalized force space so that all the other forces and torque can be considered.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a class of parallel mechanisms, called Gough-Stewart platforms. For these mechanisms, pre-loaded by driving forces, the stiffness matrix is derived and its basic properties are established. It is shown when the stiffness matrix becomes asymmetric, how the parametric imbalance may influence the system stability, and how the center of stiffness depends on the force pre-loading. Next, some necessary and some sufficient conditions for the stability are established in an analytical form by transforming the stiffness matrix to the center of stiffness.",

The conventional mapping was shown, to lead to physically inconsistent results when external force is present in stiffness control. Theoretical proofs are also provided to show the conservative nature of the CCT, and the non-conservative property of the conventional mapping. The CCT is established as the general and valid mapping of the stiffness matrices between the joint and Cartesian spaces of robotic manipulators. In this paper, the work of CCT is extended to a redundant planar manipulator. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate issues related to the application of generalized inverse in the analysis of redundant manipulators.",

Different computer vision algorithms have been tested from the images acquired from different camera configurations and bending angles with respect to the vertical axis.

Analytic gradients are required to solve the optimal control problem reliably; obtaining them is made possible by a hybrid recursive algorithm that calculates the system dynamics and its exact derivatives. Each motion segment, or primitive, is determined by a unique cost function, so that a complete movement is created from the robot model, the customized optimal control problem, and the objective function, without need for detailed path planning by a person. Once the primitives are generated, they are used to control an experimental robot as it performs the motion in the primitive. The problem formulation takes into account limitations such as torque and velocity limits of the motors on the experimental robot.",

The first technique is an extension of our previous work (2000) that only addressed process-module residency constraints. For cases with long process times, this technique can take a long time to find the solution and is not practical. Hence, we use this algorithm mainly as a benchmark for comparison. The second technique that uses a linear programming method with several heuristics can find the optimal solution very efficiently. An analytical and experimental analysis of this technique shows the correctness, completeness and efficiency of this technique.",

A planetary rover is required to travel safely over a long distance for many days in unfamiliar terrains. Hence it is very important how a planetary rover processes sensory information in order to understand the environment and to make decisions. The authors have newly developed a small rover for future lunar or planetary exploration. As a new data structure for map information, an extended elevation map is introduced, which includes the effect of the size of the rover. The proposed path planning can be conducted in such a way as if the rover were a point while the size of the rover is automatically taken into account. The map obtained by sensors includes uncertainties. Thus a path planning scheme based on traversability and probability is also proposed. The validity of the proposed method is verified by computer simulations.",

Then, the design of the PN controller is introduced with two steps. The first step of the design is to track the state of the system. Then, the weighted inhibitor arcs are exploited to disable the relative transitions in the case that the firing of these transitions will violate the constraints.

        "abstract": "A planning methodology for nonholonomic mobile manipulators that employs smooth and continuous functions such as polynomials is developed. The method decouples kinematically the manipulator from the platform by constructing admissible paths that drive it to a final configuration and is based on mapping the nonholonomic constraint to a space where it can be trivially satisfied. In addition, the method allows for direct control over the platform orientation. The developed transformation also maps Cartesian space obstacles to transformed ones and allows for obstacle avoidance by increasing the order of the polynomials that are used in planning trajectories. The additional parameters required are computed systematically. It is shown how the method can be extended for avoiding obstacles of any number.",

The applications range from mundane daily life objects to more fancy art structures. In contrast to a multiple degree-of-freedom structure, a single degree-of-freedom structure can be driven by a single actuator, reducing the cost and simplifying the control. In this paper, we study single degree-of-freedom structures that can be formed by a lattice of single degree-of-freedom polyhedral expanding units. Due to built-in symmetries, the entire structure can expand and contract as one of the units in the structure is actuated.",

Unlike our previous approach of set-point position control, (Sun and Liu, 1997, and Liu and Sun, 2000), in the trajectory tracking, the system coordinates are hard to regulate to the desired states with non-zero tracking velocities under continuous feedback control. In this study, we design a hybrid position and force tracking controller while using saturation control to compensate the effect of beam vibration dynamics to the tracking performance. All parameters and states used in the controller are readily available so that the proposed method is feasible in implementation. Under the proposed controller, the tracking error asymptotically converges to a predetermined boundary. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.",

Wavefront object files are used as the surface model that describes geometry of the surface. The bed has 210 pressure sensors that are under the mattress. It can measure a pressure distribution image of a lying person. The lying person's motion is tracked by considering potential energy, momentum and a difference between the measured pressure distribution image and a pressure distribution image that is calculated by the full body model. Experimental results reveal that the realized system can track not only horizontal motions such as opening and closing legs but also vertical motions such as raising the upper body.",

In this paper we use the partial knowledge of configuration space (C-space) derived in the previous work by Chen et al. (2000) to remove suboptimal actions from a demonstration. Our idea is to use demonstrated paths to predict what regions in C-space are obstacle free. Suboptimal actions in a demonstration are then avoided by planning alternative actions that pass through the obstacle free regions. Experimental results show the validity of the approach. A demonstrated path containing significant sub-optimality was converted by the approach into a short, efficient path suitable for execution by the robot.",

We introduce two new controllers, one for climbing constant slope inclinations and one for achieving higher speeds via pronking, a gait that incorporates a, substantial aerial phase. In both cases, we make use of an underlying open-loop control strategy, combined with low bandwidth feedback to modulate its parameters. The inclination behavior arises from our initial alternating tripod walking controller and adjusts the angle offsets of individual leg motion profiles based on inertial sensing of the average surface slope. Similarly, the pronking controller makes use of a \"virtual\" leg touchdown sensing mechanism to adjust the frequency of the open-loop pronking, effectively synchronizing the controller with the natural oscillations of the mechanical system. Experimental results demonstrate good performance on slopes inclined up to /spl sim/250 and pronking up to speeds approaching 2 body lengths per second (/spl sim/1.0 m/s).",

        "abstract": "For realizing a robot working in human society, interaction with humans is the key issue. We have developed a robot that interacts with humans based on visual recognition. This robot has two vision systems: an omnidirectional vision system for acquiring necessary visual information and a binocular stereo vision system. The binocular vision system indicates what the robot is looking at and is not used for locomotion. Gaze control plays an important role in human-robot interaction. This paper reports how the robot's gaze influences subjects' impressions of the robot. With a statistically significant number of robot observers, we employed psychological methods, the semantic differential method (SD), and factor analysis. This careful psychological analysis of robot impressions is the first trial in robotics. Through the experiment, we have found that the impressions mainly consist of four factors: familiarity, enjoyment, activity, and performance. The computer skills of subjects affect their impressions of the robot.",

The robot searches suitable actions based on the environmental information which is improved step by step in the sense of this criterion. According to this, we can harmonize the trade-off between the calculation amount and information quality, and make the search process faster. The proposed method is applied to the moving obstacles avoidance problem, and its usefulness is shown through some simulation results.",

        "abstract": "A biologically inspired neural network approach is proposed for real-time collision-free path planning and tracking control of a nonholonomic mobile robot in a nonstationary environment. The real-time robot trajectory with obstacle avoidance is rated by a topologically organized neural network, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized by a shunting equation. The varying environment is represented by the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network. Where the neural activity propagation is subject to the kinematic constraint of the nonholonomic mobile robots. The real-time tracking velocities are generated by a novel neural dynamics based controller, which is based on two shunting models and the backstepping technique. Unlike the backstepping controllers that produce non-smooth velocity commands with sharp jumps, the proposed tracking controller is capable of generating smooth, continuous commands not suffering from velocity jumps. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies.",

In this architecture, the controller software consists of a set of well-defined components and a set of behavior specifications. Each component is modeled with event-based external interfaces, a control logic driver and service protocols. Behaviors of components and their integration are modeled as finite state machines and nested finite state machines. The behaviors of software can be specified in Control Plan programs and executed by control logic drivers at run-time. Such software supports executable code-level reconfiguration as well as remote behavioral reconfiguration. Reconfiguration with heterogeneous implementations and vendor-neutral products is also supported. Our evaluation of the motion control software for a milling machine controller demonstrated that the software constructed with this architecture has high reconfigurability and low development and maintenance costs.",

Unlike previous works which consider primarily the problem of reconstructing a single tensor B-spline patch based on deformed planar or spherical domain, the surface reconstructed here is a network of triangular B-spline patches based on arbitrary topological domain and can maintain tangent plane continuity. The input is unorganized tactile sensing 3D data points with normal information of arbitrary topological type surfaces, which are obtained by a dextrous multifingered hand equipped with force/moment tactile sensors. The surface reconstructed is a parameterization of the data over these patches. An adaptive refinement is explored on the patch network in order to satisfy a given error tolerance.

        "abstract": "A servomotor design that is powered and controlled through only one wire is presented. A traditional servomotor needs both a power cable and a control cable connecting the motor to a control amplifier. Cables are bulky, heavy, and expensive and, more importantly, difficult to install and maintain in many applications. Particularly for multi-axis applications, like robots and machine tools, cable harnesses become thick and long, and are difficult to run through a stack of many axes, this is a major burden and bottleneck in electromechanical drives. The objective of this research is to eliminate such bulky cables by integrating and consolidating power cables and signal cables into a single wire, and transmitting control signals through the signal wire. Signals are coded by using a CDMA protocol and are superimposed on the single wire that supplies a DC voltage to each motor. In the paper first the principle of reduced-cable smart motors is described, followed by the architecture of the signal transmission system using direct sequence spread spectrum. A prototype system is designed, and the signal transmission line is simulated to verify the principle.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a neural network based on the projection and contraction method is employed to compute the minimum infinity-norm joint torques of redundant manipulators, which explicitly takes into account the joint torque limits. While the desired accelerations of the end-effector for a specified task are fed into the network, a driving joint torque vector which has the maximum component in magnitude being minimized and is never exceeding the joint torque limits is generated as the neural network output. The proposed neural torque control scheme is shown to be capable of effectively generating the bounded minimum infinity-norm driving joint torques of redundant manipulators.",

        "abstract": "Biped robots are expected to walk on many different and previously unknown terrains, and thus they may walk on a slippery surface with low friction with no information on the surface a priori. Any fall-down due to unexpected slipping could cause costly damage to the robot and thus should be avoided. The paper proposes a reflex control method for biped robots to quickly recover their posture from a slip soon after a detection of the slip. Computer simulations with a 12-DOF biped robot and a 6-DOF environment model that consists of nonlinear dampers, and linear and nonlinear springs, show that the proposed method is very effective in preventing a fall-down of biped robots on a slippery surface.",

Moreover, the discovery of new meteorite samples is of great value because meteorites are the only significant source of extraterrestrial material available to scientists. In this paper we focus on the primary outcomes and technical lessons learned from the first field demonstration of autonomous search and in situ classification of Antarctic meteorites by a robot. Using a novel autonomous control architecture, specialized science sensing, combined manipulation and visual servoing, and Bayesian classification, the Nomad robot classified five indigenous meteorites during an expedition to the remote site of Elephant Moraine in January 2000. Nomad's expedition proved the rudiments of science autonomy and exemplified the merits of machine learning techniques for autonomous geological classification in real-world settings. On the other hand, the expedition showcased the difficulty in executing reliable robotic deployment of science sensors and a limited performance in the speed and coverage of autonomous search.",

It removes the need to measure orientation, which is intricate and error-prone, by algebraic elimination. This approach, relying on resultant and dialytic elimination, produces an equivalent, yet simpler, set of equations. A numerical simulation is given to compare the existing techniques with our method using partial information, which proves to be significantly more robust, without compromising accuracy. It reduces initial error in pose determination by 99% and 80-98%, in two sets of experiments with realistic conditions. We compare different choices for the measured configurations and show the relevance of configurations at the workspace's boundary. This increases reliability by avoiding to use any random measured configurations.",

        "abstract": "We present a methodology for agent modeling that is scalable and efficient. It is based on the integration of nonlinear dynamical systems and kinetic data structures. The method consists of three-layers that model steering, flocking, and crowding agent behaviors among moving and static obstacles in 2 and 3D. The first layer, the local layer is based on the the use of nonlinear dynamical systems theory and models low level behaviors, it is fast and efficient, and does not depend on the total number of agents in the environment. The use of dynamical systems allows the use of continuous numerical parameters with which we can modify the interaction of each agent with the environment. This creates controllable distinctive behaviors. The second layer, a global environment layer consists of a specifically designed kinetic data structure to track efficiently the immediate environment of each agent and know which obstacles/agents are near or visible to the given agent. This layer reduces the complexity in the local layer. In the third layer, a global planning layer, the problem of target tracking is generalized in a way that allows navigation in maze-like terrains, avoidance of local minima and cooperation between agents. We implement this layer based on two approaches that are suitable for different applications. One is to track the closest single moving or static target. The second is to use a pre-specified vector field. This vector can be generated automatically (with harmonic functions, for example) or based on user input to achieve the desired output. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a series of experiments simulating single/multiple agents and crowds moving towards moving/static targets in complex environments.",

        "abstract": "Current generation unmanned underwater vehicles, equipped with robotic manipulators, are teleoperated and consequently place a large workload burden on the human operator. A greater degree of automation could improve the efficiency and accuracy with which underwater tasks are carried out. These tasks can involve manipulator motion that is both unconstrained and/or constrained. For unconstrained motion, where a trajectory requires following, a prerequisite is good joint angle control. An adaptive self-tuning pole-placement controller is used for joint angle control. Practical results show the benefits compared to the conventional fixed-gain control. For constrained motion, simultaneous controls of position and force are often required. An adaptive hybrid position/force controller is proposed and compared to a fixed-gain version. Simulation and practical results illustrate the merits and drawbacks of each scheme.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the assembly of a mobile odour sensing system and investigates its practical operation in an indoor environment without a constant airflow. Lacking a constant airflow leads to a problem which cannot be neglected in real world applications. The response of the metal oxide gas sensors used is dominated by air turbulence rather than concentration differences. We show that this problem can be overcome by driving the robot with a constant speed, thus adding an extra constant airflow relative to the gas sensors location. If the robot's speed is not too low the system described proved to be well suited to detect even weak odour sources. Since driving with constant speed is an indispensable condition to perform the basic tasks of a mobile odour sensing system, a new localization strategy is proposed, which takes this into account.",

Because of their low drift rate attention is warranted to sources of errors that were previously considered as of secondary importance. In the KVH E-Core RD2100 gyros, we found that the temperature dependency and the non-linearity of the scale-factor caused significant errors. A precision calibration procedure, described in the paper, reduces the resulting errors by one order of magnitude. In addition to the calibration procedure, we integrated the gyro with the odometry system of a four-wheel drive, skid-steer Pioneer AT mobile robot by means of an indirect feedback Kalman filter that fuses the sensor data from both sensor modalities. Based on our experimental results the paper compares the relative effectiveness of both enhancements (precision gyro calibration and Kalman filter).",

In particular, we prove that the application of this synchronization method to two hopping robots, each of which individually achieves only asymptotically stable hopping, results in an asymptotically stable limit cycle for the coupled system exhibiting the desired phase difference. This extends our previous work wherein the application of the method to two individually deadbeat-stabilized oscillators (paddle juggling mechanisms) was shown to yield the desired result. Central to this method is the idea that cyclic systems may be composed into a larger, aggregate, cyclic system. Its application entails moving from physical coordinates (for example, the position and velocity of each constituent mechanism) to the coordinates of phase and phase velocity. Within this canonical coordinate system we construct a model dynamical system, called a reference field, which encodes the desired behavior of each cyclic system as well as the phase relationships between them. We then force the actual composite system to behave like the model.",

The stiffness model of each substructure is formulated by assuming that the components in the other substructure are rigid. This is followed by the second step that enables the stiffness model of the machine structure to be achieved by linear superposition. A 3D representation of the stiffness distributions within the usable workspace are depicted with comparison to those obtained through the finite element analysis.",

Thus, this method has the advantage of accurate hybrid control results, as well as the advantage of impedance control for not using the explicit switch between the force control mode and position control mode. Experimental results verify the theory and confirm the effectiveness of the method.",

For this purpose we use wavelet shrinkage, which was originally proposed by Donoho and Johnstone as a method to remove Gaussian white noise (1994, 1995). We also propose a modification of wavelet shrinkage to selectively remove textural information as noise. Once the textural information, is removed from textile surfaces, the remaining inspection processes can be conducted in the image domain. In this way, we can utilize the image processing methods and techniques developed so far for the visual inspection of other industrial products.",

Our paper addresses the global problem, where we compute orientation and position estimates from noisy inter-frame measurements. This is accomplished by building a graph of infer-frame relations, selecting a set of basis cycles which fully describe the graph, and distributing accumulated error about the basis cycles.",

The development of such an arm is useful for gentle exploration of unknown objects in unstructured environments. Similar to a human, the robotic arm should minimize the contact forces in the event of unanticipated contact with unknown objects in the absence of visual feedback. To accomplish this, our strategy is to develop a good model of the robotic system so that we can use low gains which in turn will lead to low impedance and hence low contact forces in manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. The paper demonstrates how good modeling and feedforward compensation can result in low interaction forces without any external force sensing. We present experimental results to demonstrate the validity of our model and approach.",

        "abstract": "Presents the velocity kinematic modeling of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) by applying the matrix coordinate transformation to every pair of WMRs including wheeled pairs which were dealt with in ad-hoc manners in previous methodologies. A wheeled pair is not replaced with a planar pair and its kinematics is formulated together with those of lower pairs, even though there exists 2 DOF motion at a wheeled pair. The proposed method is implemented successfully to obtain the forward velocity kinematics of a WMR, and it is therefore regarded as a real counterpart to transformation methodologies widely used for kinematics of the robot manipulators.",

        "abstract": "Presents the design of the software simulator, VIFS, for insect flight. In particular, it is intended to estimate flight control algorithms and performance for a micromechanical flying insect (MFI), a 10-25 mm (wingtip-to-wingtip) device eventually capable of sustained autonomous flight. The VIFS is an end-to-end tool composed of several modular blocks which model actuator dynamics, wing aerodynamics, body motion, visual and inertial sensors, environment perception, and control algorithms. A 3D virtual environment simulation is also developed as a visualization tool. We present the current state of art of its implementation and preliminary results.",

        "abstract": "Intention reading is one of the essential functions of human-friendly rehabilitation robots. First, the overall structure of a new wheelchair-based robotic arm system, KARES II, and its human-robot interaction technologies are presented. Among those technologies, we concentrate on visual servoing that allows this robotic arm to operate autonomously via visual feedback. Effective intention reading, such as recognizing the positive and negative meaning of the user, is performed on the basis of changes of the facial expression around lips that is strongly related to the user's intention while serving the user. For the efficient visual information processing, log-polar mapped images are used to control the stereo camera head that is located in the end-effector of the robotic arm. The visual servoing with effective intention reading was successfully applied to serve a beverage for the user.",
