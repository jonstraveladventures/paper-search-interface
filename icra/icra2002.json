        "abstract": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company launched the first 300 mm fully automation foundry in 1999. The newly introduced technology will automate the 300 mm fab for better manufacturing control and less human labor. Based on the accumulated TSMC data from year 1999 to year 2000, it is found that to maintain is more difficult than to build up the system. It is a great challenge to integrate so many hardware and software components closely. In fact, few 300 mm foundries are successful from the maintenance point of view. TSMC is still continuing to improve the full fab automation by strict integration test methodology and refer to daily problem analysis system. TSMC enlarges the acceptance test scope to cover the process equipment, transportation, material control and manufacturing system. In order to make sure the integration is smooth and on the right track, TSMC has developed a methodology to execute hardware and software integration. Here TSMC exposes some of the critical issues and shares the experience for unmanned factory. TSMC believes these can help the 300 mm fab to speed up the system construction task and find out their own problems by TSMC's methodology and experience.",

        "abstract": "A trajectory tracking control problem for a nonholonomic mobile robot by making use of a kinematic oscillator has been solved. Firstly, a time varying oscillator is examined to control the nonholonomic mobile robot based only its kinematics. Secondly, a backstepping procedure is proposed to include robot dynamics and the servo loop. It is shown that overall multilevel controller is asymptotically globally stable to a small error different from zero. A wide range of simulation results are presented which illustrate the behaviour of the controller with respect to tuning its parameters. Some preliminary experiments are reported too.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose three types of sensor-based path-planning algorithms and compare them as the image-based path-planning algorithm for a huge search space. In the general image-based path-planning, a camera mounted on a tip of a manipulator is seeking for an objective image while the manipulator is controlled in a joint space. As long as the number of degrees-of-freedom of a manipulator increases, the search space becomes exponentially huge. Though the sensor-based path-planning algorithm is a noncombination search, it sometimes spends much time to escape from a valley minimized by a local minimum. To overcome this problem, we use a modified version of the randomized algorithm as the best image-based path-planning algorithm for a huge search space. This tendency is checked by several simulation results. In addition, the version can be easily applied for a real problem as the classic visual servoing (the steepest descendent method) with memorizing a set of visited points and another set of their neighbor points, as well as generating a sequence of random motions.",

As speech communication plays an essential part of our daily life, the utilization of speech sound is expected to make human-robot communication smooth. The proposed model forms the state of emotion based on the prosodic components because the emotional aspects of human speech sounds are found in the prosodic change. The model is based on an agent network architecture. Also the model is taken account of the motor command generation according to the state of emotion. The validity of the model is examined by the computer simulation. From the results of the simulation, it is shown that the formation of emotion in the model is adequate for speech sounds, and the motor command generation is also adequate.",

A new module is introduced here to compensate for the error caused by the deviation of the contact locations due to the rolling contacts between the fingertips and the handled object. On the basis of the contact kinematics, the \"rolling contact\" module updates the contact locations to modify the position and force references sent to each local finger controller in order to account for the motion of the contact points.",

Several sensors and actuators including a custom made gripper are used to accomplish the demanded tasks. The robot was built and tested in real operational situations and proved to be both efficient and robust. It will enable power distribution companies to replace current highly dangerous operations which are normally performed by a human operator placed in a helicopter hovering a few meters away of hotlines. Broader use of this robot in several other common tasks such as line inspection and cleaning, cable changing and object transportation are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Sampling multisensory information and taking the appropriate motor action is critical for a biological organism's survival, but a difficult task for robots. We present a Neurally Organized Mobile Adaptive Device (NOMAD), whose behavior is controlled by a simulated nervous system based on the anatomy and physiology of the vertebrate brain, that is capable of action selection in a real world environment. NOMAD's nervous system consists of an auditory system, a visual system, a taste system, sets of motor neurons capable of triggering behavior, a tracking system driven by visual stimuli, and a value system. The device itself, which moves autonomously, has a CCD camera for vision, microphones for hearing, and a gripper manipulator to pick up and taste objects by measuring the object's conductivity. Similar to a biological organism, NOMAD learns to categorize sensory information from its environment with no prior instruction, associate positive and negative value with this sensory information, and then learn to select the appropriate motor actions. We suggest that this neurobiological approach to action selection may be generalized to other robot systems.",

A neural network controller combining both kinematic control and dynamic control is developed. The neural network assumes a single layer structure, by taking advantage of the robot regressor dynamics that express the highly nonlinear robot dynamics in a linear form in terms of the known and unknown robot parameters. The learning algorithm is computationally efficient. The system stability and the convergence of tracking errors to zero are rigorously proved using a Lyapunov stability theory. The real-time fine control of a mobile robot is achieved through the online learning of the neural network. In addition, the developed controller is capable of learning the kinematic parameters online. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed controller is demonstrated by simulation studies.",

The proposed algorithm is tested and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional BP algorithm in convergence speed and the ability to escape from learning stalls. The paper presents a convergence analysis of the three-term BP algorithm. It is shown that if the learning parameters of the three-term BP algorithm satisfies certain conditions given in this paper, then it is guaranteed that the system is stable and will converge to a local minimum. The paper shows that all the local minima of the cost function are stable for the three-term backpropagation algorithm.",

It has been successfully applied to many areas such as robot motion control, multirobot coordination, force and impact control, robotic teleoperation and manufacturing automation. In this paper, a non-time based tracking controller for multiple nonholonomic mobile robots is proposed by combining the conventional event based control technique with a biologically inspired shunting model first proposed by Grossberg (1982). The proposed control algorithm can generate smooth and continuous velocity control commands. These commands remove the small tracking error constraints in the conventional non-time based controllers. Thus, these controllers keep multiple robots in a required formation and coordinate in the presence of environment change. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by simulation and comparison studies.",

The major contribution of this work is in devising an elegant and pragmatic approach for 3D visual tracking. The proposed modified Smith predictor (MSP)-DeMenthon-Horaud (DH) visual servoing system has shown to be reliable and yielded good target tracking performance. It differ from the other techniques found in the vast visual servoing literature, in its approach for image interpretation and the introduction of a Smith-like predictor control structure to overcome the inherent vision delay. A complete description will be made on the MSP-DH visual servoing system. Experiments on the target tracking performance on AY planar motion using an AdeptOne robotic system are presented to illustrate the controller performance. Also, experimental results clearly showed the capability of the MSP-DH visual servoing system in performing 3D-dynamic visual servoing.",

These demands calls for high flexible assembly systems, containing of standardised, process-oriented assembly modules, offering a robust process and high reuse ability of the equipment. To generate such a system a new concept for cross-functional development of products and the assembly system is being developed. The concept belief is that extreme and long-lasting flexibility cannot be achieved without a distinct connection between product design and the assembly system, i.e. assembly process knowledge must be structured. To achieve this, the assembly module platform (AMP) is being developed, containing all possible modules to assemble the products. The AMP is generating the module process description (MPD), which totally defines the process executed by the specific module. The design of the product can now be guided by the MPD, creating a process-oriented product design. Furthermore, the AMP-database is under construction, linking functions as economical evaluation tools, to compare possible configurations assembly costs and investments.",

In conventional manipulators, a collision between an arm and the joint stop is avoided by barriers from both software and electronic hardware. Comparing to those conventional manipulators, human utilizes structural joint stop usefully in many manipulations, especially in hyper dynamic manipulations. In this paper, we propose a general utilization of structural joint stop in a manipulator to improve the capability of the manipulator in a large extent by a simple modification of the structure of joint.

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of computing the motions of one or more robot observers in order to maintain visibility of one or several moving targets. The targets are assumed to move unpredictably, and the distribution of obstacles in the workspace is assumed to be known in advance. Our algorithm computes a motion strategy by maximizing the shortest distance to escape $the shortest distance the target needs to move in order to escape the observer's visibility region. Three main points are discussed: 1) the design and implementation of a reactive planner; 2) the integration and testing of such a planner in a robot system which includes perceptual and control capabilities; and 3) the design and simulation of a motion planner for the task of maintaining visibility of two targets using two mobile observers.",

The method is based on the fusion between the range readings delivered by the laser and the feedback control input computed to constrain the robot to move in its free workspace. The relative motion of the robot between two successive sampling times of the control loop is estimated:(1) computing a prediction by comparing the local maps built at these instants, (2) integrating the feedback control input computed from the laser readings to produce the desired motion and (3) performing a fusion between these two predictions. These computations are performed at sampling rate during the robot's evolution and are embedded in a probabilistic approach taking into account the uncertainties associated to the laser readings. Experimental results are presented validating the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a unique robotics project, Comprehensive Access to Printed Materials (CAPM), within the context of libraries. As libraries provide a growing array of digital library services and resources, they continue to acquire large quantities of printed material. This combined pressure of providing electronic and print-based resources and services has led to severe space constraints for many libraries, especially academic research libraries. Consequently, many libraries have built or plan to build off-site shelving facilities to accommodate printed materials. An autonomous mobile robotic library system has been developed to retrieve items from bookshelves and carry them to scanning stations located in the off-site shelving facility. In subsequent stages, remote users will be able to trigger this process through a web interface in order to achieve real-time browsing of printed materials. Enhanced commercial robot systems are used in this project. The developments of the robot design, control systems, simulations, experiments and results are presented.",

The skew-axis design increases the joint travel over traditional gimballed configurations while the excess degree of freedom can be used to avoid singularities. A generalized inverse kinematics procedure locally minimizes the joint velocities for a given tool orientation while steering the wrist away from singular regions and mechanical hard stops. The singularity surfaces are mapped in 3D-space, and simulations are used to illustrate the operation of the wrist. Hardware integration and testing of the wrist on the new dexterous manipulator for the Ranger Telerobotic Shuttle Experiment are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has recently been receiving much attention as a learning method for not only toy problems but also complicated systems such as robot systems. It does not need priori knowledge and has higher capability of reactive and adaptive behaviors. However, increasing of action-state space makes it difficult to accomplish the learning process. In most of the previous works, the application of the learning is restricted to simple tasks with a small action-state space. Considering this point, we present a new reinforcement learning algorithm: Q-learning with dynamic structuring of exploration space based on genetic algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to systems with high dimensional action and interior state spaces, for example, a robot with many redundant degrees of freedom. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm simulations of locomotion patterns for a 12-leged robot were carried out. As the result, an effective behavior was obtained by using our proposed algorithm.",

Scanning the upper layer of the pallet yields a 2.5D image to which edge detection and robust line fitting are applied to extract 3D vertices. This vertex information is used as an input for a model based object recognition system. Model vertices are matched to scene vertices and object location hypothesis are formed. These hypotheses are verified or rejected using a two-step verification process. Due to the fact that we use edges to extract vertices, rather than surfaces, we are able to detect target objects, in both cluttered and ordered configurations. Our experiments with different configurations of cardboard boxes and paper tissue packets demonstrate the validity of our approach. The main advantages of our system are it's versatility, simplicity, efficiency and robustness.",

Landmarks are planar, quadrangular surfaces, which must be distinguished from the background, typically a poster on a wall or a door-plate. In a first step, these landmarks are detected and their positions with respect to a global reference frame are learned; this learning step is supervised so that only the best landmarks are memorized, with an invariant representation based on a set of interest points. Then, when the robot looks for visible landmarks, the recognition procedure takes advantage of the partial Hausdorff distance to compare the landmark model and the detected quadrangles. The paper presents the landmark detection and recognition procedures, and discusses their performances.",

The identification model is a linear model in relation to a minimal set of parameters. The dynamic parameters are estimated by using the solution of weighted least squares of an over determined linear system obtained from the sampling of the dynamic model along a closed loop tracking trajectory. An experimental study exhibits the identification results depending on two types of sensors (position, acceleration) and different locations (motor, load).",

        "abstract": "Tracked mobile robots in the 20 kg size class are under development for applications in urban reconnaissance. For efficient deployment, it is desirable for teams of robots to be able to automatically execute path following behaviors, with one or more followers tracking the path taken by a leader. The key challenges to enabling such a capability are (1) to develop sensor packages for such small robots that can accurately determine the path of the leader and (2) to develop path following algorithms for the subsequent robots. To date, we have integrated gyros, accelerometers, compass/inclinometers, odometry, and differential GPS into an effective sensing package. The paper describes the sensor package, sensor processing algorithm and path tracking algorithm we have developed for the leader/follower problem in small robots and shows the results of performance characterization of the system. We also document pragmatic lessons learned about design, construction, and electromagnetic interference issues particular to the performance of state sensors on small robots.",

First, a method is given to obtain which combination of the object edges is possible to be used for grasping. Then, a graspable finger position region (GFPR) on a combination of edges is defined where the object can be held successfully. It is shown that the region is bounded by several boundary hyperplanes. By combining these boundary hyperplanes, two propositions for analytically and exactly obtaining the GFPR are proposed. An algorithm is proposed to find a stable GFPR that contains the biggest inscribed hypersphere of GFPR and has the largest volume. Finally, a numerical example is performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed grasp planning approach.",

        "abstract": "Traditional approaches to the motion-planning problem can be classified into single-query and multiple-query problems with the tradeoffs on run-time computation cost and adaptability to environment changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem that can learn incrementally on every planning query and effectively manage the learned roadmap as the process goes on. This planner is based on previous work on probabilistic roadmaps and uses a data structure, called reconfigurable random forest (RRF), which extends the rapidly-exploring random tree structure proposed in the literature. The planner can account for environmental changes while keeping the size of the roadmap small. The planner removes invalid nodes in the roadmap as the obstacle configurations change. It also uses a tree-pruning algorithm to trim RRF into a more concise representation. Our experiments show that the planner is flexible and efficient.",

During an automated procedure derived from this approach, the mobile robot can be loosely positioned in front of a calibration pattern. Through our procedure, both the camera calibration and the neck-eye calibration are obtained. With this set of calibration matrices, the XYZ coordinates of a landmark can be determined with respect to the robot coordinate frame. The so calculated XYZ coordinates are accurate regardless of the orientation of the stereo head, even for orientations that were not used for calibration. This paper validates our approach by presenting results as accurate as a few millimeters in the calculation of the XYZ coordinates of objects at 1.5m from the stereo head.",

The wire-suspended mechanisms are classified into two types, which are completely restrained type mechanisms and incompletely restrained type mechanisms. The paper discusses mainly incompletely restrained type mechanisms form the viewpoint of actual control. The incompletely restrained type wire-suspended mechanism has the merit that it enables three dimensional positioning and orientation of suspended object with simple mechanism using a small number of wires. However it also has the drawback that the manipulated object is easy to swing as seen in overhead crane which is a simple incompletely restrained type mechanism. For this reason, an anti-sway control method for incompletely restrained type mechanisms is needed. To resolve the problem of swing, inverse dynamics for general incompletely restrained type wire-suspended mechanism is discussed, then a feedback control method based on dynamics compensation is presented.",

The vehicle is equipped with a down-looking camera which is used to compute its motion with respect to the seafloor. As the mosaic increases in size, a systematic bias is introduced in the alignment of the images which form the mosaic. Therefore, this accumulative error produces a drift in the estimation of the position of the vehicle. When the arbitrary trajectory of the AUV crosses over itself, it is possible to reduce this propagation of image alignment errors within the mosaic. A Kalman filter with augmented state is proposed to optimally estimate both the visual map and the vehicle position.",

Towards this end, we have developed an approach for improved state estimation by augmenting traditional inertial navigation techniques with image-based motion estimation (IBME). A Kalman filter that processes rotational velocity and linear acceleration measurements provided from an inertial measurement unit has been enhanced to accommodate relative pose measurements from the IBME. In addition to increased state estimation accuracy, IBME convergence time is reduced while robustness of the overall approach is improved. The methodology is described in detail and experimental results with a 5 DOF gantry testbed are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the automation of insertion work, such as inserting a metal sleeve into a wire terminal, necessary in distribution work. The major technical issues for this task automation are considered as: the detection of a target object in an unstructured, complex outdoor environment; and the insertion executed at the work site with restricted clearance. In the former, the target object is detected by applying 3D image processing and template matching techniques, based on the position and posture relationship between CCD cameras, the target object, and the background. In addition, the manipulator's targeting position is updated by commands from the visual sensor system, applying the video-rate stereo camera method. This allows for realtime visual feedback control; thus, misalignment due to deviation arising from manipulator's mechanism is avoided. In the latter issue, a new algorithm was developed for insertion. This algorithm can estimate contact force, based on the deviation between the present position and command position of the manipulator. An experiment using a testing robotic system revealed that the proposed robotic technology was effective for performing insertion work without assistance by humans.",

        "abstract": "Describes a concept of a distributively placed modular robot system and a methodology of parameter identification of the system. The robot system consists of modules which have monofunction (e.g. sensor or actuator) and radio communication. Depending on tasks, the system is constructed by attaching modules to an object or in a working area distributively. Then the modules achieve a task by their cooperation. In our algorithm, the parameters are identified by executing motions with actuators, and observing the changes of the state with sensors. The motion which we call testing motion influences accuracy of identification because of sensing errors. Accounting for this, especially for the case of a mobile robot and a ceiling camera module, the design of modules' testing motion is made by evaluating the influence of the camera's sensing error and dead-reckoning's locating error. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown in the simulation and a basic experiment.",

The surgical instrument is mounted on the end-effector of a surgical robot which can be controlled by automatic visual feedback. The goal of the automated task is to bring the instrument at a desired location from an unknown or hidden position. To achieve this task, a special instrument-holder is designed with optical fibers and collimators. This instrument-holder projects laser dot patterns onto the organ surface which are seen in the endoscopic images. Then, the instrument is retrieved and centered in the image plane using a visual servoing algorithm. With this system, the surgeon can also specify a desired position for the instrument in the image. Our approach is successfully validated in a real surgical environment by performing experiments on living animals in the surgical training room of IRCAD.",

The control input space is divided into a couple of subspaces according to a priority order depending on the progress and stability of learning. In the proposed method, the search noise which is required for reinforcement learning is restricted within the first priority subspace. Then the constraint is relaxed with the progress of learning, and the search space extends to the second priority subspace in accordance with the history of learning. The method was applied to the musculoskeletal system as an example of biological control systems. Dynamic manipulation is obtained through reinforcement learning with no previous knowledge of the arm's dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by computational simulation.",

The approach is based on the model of cerebro-cerebellar interaction during the learning of new visuo-motor transformation. The model in turn is based on four main prerequisites: the Marr-Albus-Ito theory of cerebellar learning, the equilibrium point theory of motor control, the columnar organization of the cerebral cortex and the differential neurocontroller theory. The convergence of the learning procedure is proved for the linear plant. Its convergence for nonlinear plants are confirmed by computer simulation of arm reaching movements in the horizontal plane.",

        "abstract": "We describe results on combining depth information from a laser range-finder and color and texture image cues to segment ill-structured dirt, gravel, and asphalt roads as input to an autonomous road following system. A large number of registered laser and camera images were captured at frame-rate on a variety,of rural roads, allowing laser features such as 3-D height and smoothness to be correlated with image features such as color histograms and Gabor filter responses. A small set of road models was generated by training separate neural networks on labeled feature vectors clustered by road \"type.\" By first classifying the type of a novel road image, an appropriate second-stage classifier was selected to segment individual pixels, achieving a high degree of accuracy on arbitrary images from the dataset. Segmented images combined with laser range information and the vehicle's inertial navigation data were used to construct 3-D maps suitable for path planning.",

        "abstract": "A master-slave type remote ultrasound diagnostic system was developed. The controller has impedance control capability for the master and slave manipulators' positions and has a continuous path (CP) control capability for the slave manipulator's orientation. The paper presents the controller of the slave manipulator's orientation. The remote ultrasound diagnostic system is one of remote medical systems through a communication network. Therefore it is difficult to transfer information for control at high sampling rate. To cope with this problem, we introduce a CP controller to this remote medical system. CP control realizes a smooth and less vibrated motion of the slave manipulator even if it is available to use a lower sampling rate of transmitting orientation data of the master manipulator. As a result, it allows the slave manipulator to improve safety and to decrease the volume of transmitting data. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the path control of the slave manipulator during CP control in the master-slave manipulation system. The experimental results also show that a medical doctor can perform diagnosis properly using the developed system.",

We focus on two topics: assembly by two hands and understanding human instructions in natural language as a precondition for assembly systems being perceived by humans as \"intelligent\". A typical application of such a system is interactive assembly. A human communicator sharing a view of the assembly scenario with the robot instructs the latter by speaking to it in the same way that he would communicate with a child. His instructions can be under-specified, incomplete and/or context-dependent. After introducing the general purpose of our project, we present the hardware and software components of our robots necessary for interactive assembly tasks. The control architecture of the robot system with two stationary robot arms is discussed. We then describe the functionalities of the instruction understanding, planning and execution levels. The implementations of a layered-learning methodology, memories and monitoring functions are briefly introduced. Finally, we outline a list of future research topics for extending our system.",

Most of mobile assist systems have a heavy mobile base for stability. We propose an approach for motion control of a mobile manipulator to remove unnecessary movement of the mobile base. In our proposed scheme, the mobile base does not move until the manipulator tip position or the mobile base goes over the preferred operating area which compensates the manipulability and the stability. The boundary of the area is the virtual impedance wall consisting of a spring and a damper by impedance control. If the manipulator tip position or the mobile base reaches the boundary, the mobile base starts to move by a repulsive force from the virtual wall and recovers the system conditions. To verify the validity of the proposed scheme, we have carried out experiments employing a graphic simulator and a real robot. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "An adaptive actor-critic algorithm is proposed under the assumption that a predictive model is available and only the measurement at time k is used to update the learning algorithms. Two value-functions are realized as a pure static mapping, according to the fact that they can be reduced to nonlinear current estimators, which can be easily constructed by using any artificial neural networks (NNs) with sigmoidal function or radial basis function (RBF), if all the inputs to the present value-functions are based on simulated experiences generated from the predictive model. In addition, if a predictive model is assumed to be used to construct a model-based actor (MBA) in the framework of adaptive actor-critic approach, then this type of MBA can be viewed as a network whose connection weights are composed of the elements of feedback gain matrix, so that the temporal difference (TD) learning can also be naturally applied to update the weights of the actor. Since the present method can update the learning by using only one measurement at time k, a relatively fast learning is expected, compared with the previous approach that needs two measurements at times k and k + 1 to update the actor-critic networks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulating a trajectory-tracking control problem for a nonholonomic mobile robot.",

Using an explicit model of the physics of the pneumatic spring and some symmetry assumptions, we derive the desired leg-length setting to regulate apex hopping height using a PD controller. Simulation experiments of hopping in the sagittal plane show reasonable height regulation. For low-speed running, we take advantage of the small variations in the leg angle about the vertical, and demonstrate that the original symmetry assumptions may be relaxed by restricting the leg angle to /spl pi//2. Simulations show that the restricted model outperforms the original model by a small but significant amount.",

We show that they can reconfigure to a 5R closed kinematic chain which has the same number of actuators as its degrees of freedom. They can also reconfigure to a 4R closed kinematic chain plus one actuated link. The parallel robot has only two actuators but can have multiple functions by reconfigurations. Due to the passive joints, whether or not the 2R open kinematic chains can couple with each other is a non-trivial problem. We propose coupling sequences for forming the 4R and 5R closed kinematic chains and verify those experimentally.",

        "abstract": "We consider a modern warehousing system composed of a number of aisles, each one is served by a crane and sided by a pair of racks, and a shuttle charging one unit load at a time moves along a mono-dimensional path placed orthogonally with respect to the aisles axis. Two control algorithms to optimize the operations of the cranes (moving within the aisles of the warehouse) and the operations of the shuttle (moving on a straight line placed between aisles and the picking/refilling area) respectively, are proposed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed control algorithms we define three different cost indices: the first two indices look to the crane/aisle and shuttle areas as they were independent systems, while the third index measures the performance of the whole warehousing system. Finally, extensive simulations are performed on the model developed by Basile at al. (2001) to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.",

The objective of this project is to provide an interactive ball-throwing robotic arm for illustrating the roles of engineers and computer scientists in the design and usage of such a system to high school or pre-engineering students. Activities in particle dynamics and trajectory calculation will provide basic hands on engineering experience and the opportunity to interact with the robot. In order to effectively provide this activity, the robot must consistently throw the ball from a known point with a desired velocity. This requires a minimum of a two-link manipulator with control strategies sufficient to converge two joint positions and velocities simultaneously. Due to limited microcontroller computational resources, feedforward torques are calculated off-line based on 3/sup rd/ order cubic spline trajectories. Feedback compensation for position and velocity error is then examined and compared for ball throwing accuracy and precision to a technique supplementing the previous controller with acceleration error compensation. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the improved accuracy and reduced repeatability of the later technique. Gripper design providing consistent hold on the ball and rapid release is also examined.",

The objective of the AFTS project was to develop a programmable automated footwear testing system for assessing specific performance characteristics of sport shoes. To achieve this objective, the AFTS would have to emulate foot-ground interactions that accompany a variety of athletic movements including walking, running, side shuffling, and, later, stopping, cutting, and jumping. Furthermore, the machine must emulate a variety of human body weight, gender, shoe size, and running style combinations. The AFTS prototype produced valuable insight both into the future of automated footwear testing and high-performance Stewart-Gough platform design.",

We take a 5 link, 4 joint serial link in a vertical plane as an example of a multi DOF jumping robot. We discuss the process to determine its design parameters from the viewpoint of realizing actual mechanical models. The design parameters include not only mechanical parameters but also motion planning parameters, because the motion condition of each joint strongly depends on motion planning. First, we show the type of jumping motion that we deal with and derive the conditions to achieve that. Then, we propose the motion planning method for jumping motions on the basis of a boundary state between ground and aerial phases. Next, we deliberate the limit characteristic of DC motors that are suitable for multi-DOF jumping robot design, and show the equations that express the limit characteristic. Then, we present one set of practical design parameters, and show simulation results of two types of jumping motions, normal jump and somersault.",

It stores the kinetic energy as a potential energy during stance and also absorbs the impulse at touch down. Inspired by such biomechanical studies, we propose a simple mechanical model for the hindlimb of a dog to realize a robot that imitates a dog running, and the hardware design of a one-legged running robot, \"Kenken\". The robot has an articulated leg and uses two hydraulic actuators as muscles and a tensile spring as a tendon. The spring being attached like the gastrocnemius or plantaris enables the robot to produce sufficient propulsion force by virtue of the \"energy transfer\" from the knee, even if there is no actuator at the ankle joint. Using an empirical controller based on the characteristic dynamics of the model, the robot has succeeded in planar one-legged hopping. Although the problem related to the stability at higher speeds remains, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hindlimb mechanism is effective for legged running.",

        "abstract": "There are hundreds of equipment in a semiconductor factory. In order to increase equipment utilization and improve product quality yield, more reliable services provided by equipment managers are expected. Therefore, it is essential to develop a reliable service management scheme (SMS) for semiconductor factory management systems. In this work, the SMS is developed by applying the Jini and contract technologies. A generic evaluator (GE) is also developed in the SMS to possess error-detection and function-replacement. The GE can also maintain the credit values of all the equipment managers. With the SMS, the process status and parameters of equipment managers in service are stored periodically. If an equipment manager malfunctions, the GE detects and confirms it and sends an event notice to the factory manager. Then, the factory manager finds a spare equipment manager and transfers the backup process status and parameters to the spare equipment manager. Finally, the spare equipment manager can continue monitor the manufacturing process starting from the point where the malfunctioned one left off. Evaluation of reliability improvement and an illustrative example of the SMS are also presented.",

Also, it enlarges servo stiffness in direct-drive motor system. However, conventional research into ER fluids is based on parallel electrodes with ER fluids between them while ER fluids are used in a shear mode. Since a high voltage is required for use of ER fluids with parallel electrodes, problems of cost, safety and wiring to moving part for practical applications are of concern. In order to solve some of the above problems, we have proposed a one-sided pattern electrode, which is an electrode in a pattern arranged on only one of the two surfaces of a pair of electrodes, with an insulator arranged on the other surface. We experimentally verify the manifestation of ER effects in a homogeneous ER fluid. Moreover, the effect of disk gap upon viscosity change was investigated. The proposed configuration leads to new damping devices for robots and mechatronics systems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a tactile sensing element that communicates through two dimensional conductive skin layers without individual wires. Each tactile element has sensors and signal processors, and it broadcasts coded tactile signals through a couple of conductive layers. Since the conductive layers can be used for both the electrical power supply and the communication, simply sandwiching the chips between the layers completes electrical connection of tactile sensing chips. Since no metal wires exist, the skin is elastic and tough. High-resolution sensor skins can be easily fabricated in various shapes. In addition, because the tactile elements transmit the locally detected stress data with coded signals, we can obtain high-SN-ratio data from a very small sensing element put at a remote location. This paper describes the skin structure, the communication architecture, the structure of the sensing chip, and the results of basic experiments.",

The limitation of 60 Hz video sample rates is overcome by using multiple RS-170 cameras synchronized over a network to capture at different instants in time. Each camera node has its own computer that processes video at field rates to determine the pose of a planar robot joint using eigenspace methods. Position information is fed back over a network to a master computer to perform direct visual servoing. The resulting vision feedback from the multiple cameras uses a Kalman filter to estimate position and to model the vision computation and transport delays. Computer simulation results are provided as the number of cameras are varied. Finally, real-time experimental results are presented that verify the approach using a network of four cameras performing direct visual servoing of a simple planar robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a two-phased approach for effective dynamic overhead hoist transport (OHT) allocation and dispatching in large-scaled, 300 mm automatic material handling system (AMHS) management. The OHT dispatching problem is first explored with the help of simulation models of each OHT loop. The best OHT dispatching policy that efficiently controls OHT transports is then selected among several OHT dispatching rules. For each OHT loop, its required number of OHT vehicles can be calculated from the simulation results on the given service requirements to this loop. However, as the total number of OHT vehicles in the fab is limited, the allocation of OHT vehicles for this loop is determined by considering the total requirements on OHT services from all the other loops. Our objective of OHT allocation and dispatching has two folds: (1) to meet the transport requirements of throughput; and (2) to minimize the carrier delivery times. Numerical results based on realistic data from a local 300 mm mass production fab demonstrate that this two-phased approach performs well both in minimizing the averages and variances of carrier delivery times as well as in achieving the target requirements.",

Specifying the low-level mapping from sensors to actuators is prone to programmer misconceptions, and debugging such a mapping can be tedious. The idea of having a robot learn how to accomplish a task, rather than being told explicitly, is an appealing one. It seems easier and much more intuitive for the programmer to specify what the robot should be doing, and to let it learn the fine details of how to do it. In this paper, we introduce a framework for reinforcement learning on mobile robots and describe our experiments using it to learn simple tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient approach to real-time scheduling of integrated equipment in semiconductor fabrication. To accomplish high level of automation and flexibility, the supervisory control system of an integrated equipment should comprehend the management of machine failures and deadlock while optimizing equipment utilization. This paper proposes a real-time scheduling approach that can perform scheduling and deadlock management in an efficient way in spite of machine failures. First, we present a novel framework where we decompose deadlock management problem into sub-problems for computational efficiency, and then integrate them with scheduling algorithms. To realize the proposed framework, a resource request matrix representation is introduced to identify deadlock-prone modules, and to apply deadlock management algorithms. We also present algorithms of polynomial complexity to identify deadlock-prone modules, and algorithms to manage deadlock considering machine failures.",

        "abstract": "Shows how a Sensory EgoSphere (SES), a robot-centric geodesic dome that represents the short term memory of a mobile robot, could enhance a human-robot interface. It is proposed that the addition of this visual representation of the sensor data on a mobile robot enhances the effectiveness of a human-robot interface. The SES migrates information presentation to the user from the sensing level to the perception level. The composition of the vision with other sensors on the SES surrounding the robot gives clarity and ease of interpretation. It enables the user to better visualize the present circumstances of the robot. The human-robot interface (HRI) will be implemented through a graphical user interface (GUI) which contains the SES, command prompt, compass, environment map, sonar and laser display. This paper proposes that the SES increases situational awareness and allows the human supervisor to accurately ascertain the present perception (sensory input) of the robot and use this information to assist the robot in getting out of difficult situations.",

        "abstract": "In a number of contexts relevant to control problems, including estimation of robot dynamics, covariance, and smart structure mass and stiffness matrices, we need to solve an over-determined set of linear equations AX /spl ap/ B with the constraint that the matrix X be symmetric and positive definite. In the classical least squares method, the measurements of A are assumed to be free of error. Hence, all errors are confined to B. Thus, the \"optimal\" solution is given by minimizing /spl par/AX - B/spl par//sub F//sup 2/. However, this assumption is often impractical. Sampling errors, modeling errors, and, sometimes, human errors bring inaccuracies to A as well. We introduce a different optimization criterion, based on area, which takes the errors in both A and B into consideration. The analytic expression of the global optimizer is derived. The algorithm is applied to identify the joint space mass-inertia matrix of a Gough-Stewart platform. Experimental results indicate that the new approach is practical, and improves performance.",

LOT is a model of the motion strategy that explains the rationality of the running path of outfielder in catching the balls. However, this model does not provide concrete shape about how fielders decide the running direction and velocity according to the ever-changing position of balls. We consider the ball catching task by an autonomous mobile robot and derive a visual feedback control method based on LOT. We also demonstrate that the proposed method enables the mobile robot to catch the balls that fly in three-dimensional space only by using the monocular vision system.",

The planner determines a sequence of obstacle boundaries that the robot must follow to reach the goal. Since this planner is used in the context of a coverage algorithm already presented by the authors, we assume that the free space is already, completely or partially, represented by a cellular decomposition whose cell boundaries are defined by critical points of Morse functions (isolated points at obstacle boundaries). The topological relationship among the cells is represented by a graph where nodes are the critical points and edges connect the nodes that define a common cell (i.e., the edges correspond to the cells themselves). A search of this graph yields a sequence of cells that directs the robot from a start to a goal. Once a sequence of cells and critical points are determined, a robot traverses each cell by mainly following the boundary of the cell along the obstacle boundaries and minimizes the accumulated dead-reckoning error at the intermediate critical points. This allows the robot to reach the goal robustly even in the presence of dead-reckoning error.",

        "abstract": "Conventionally, mobile robots are controlled through an action selection mechanism (ASM) that chooses among multiple proposed actions. This choice can be made in a variety of ways, and ASMs have been developed that demonstrate many of them, from strict priority schemes to voting systems. We take a different approach, which we call concurrent control. Abandoning explicit action selection, we rely instead on the physical dynamics of the robot's actuators to achieve robust control. We claim that with many noisy controllers and no arbitration among commands we can elicit stable predictable behavior from a mobile robot. Specifically, we concern ourselves with the problem of driving a single planar mobile robot with multiple controlling agents that are concurrently sending commands directly to the robot's wheel motors. We state analytically conditions necessary for our concurrent control approach to be viable, and verify empirically its general effectiveness and robustness to error through experiments with a physical robot.",

        "abstract": "In an outdoor, off-road mobile robotics environment, it is important to identify objects that can affect the vehicle's ability to traverse its planned path, and to determine their three-dimensional characteristics. In the paper, a combination of three elements is used to accomplish this task. An imaging ladar collects range images of the scene. A color camera, whose position relative to the ladar is known, is used to gather color images. Information extracted from these sensors is used to build a world model, a representation of the current state of the world. The world model is used actively in the sensing to predict what should be visible in each of the sensors during the next imaging cycle. The paper explains how the combined use of these three types of information leads to a robust understanding of the local environment surrounding the robotic vehicle for two important tasks: puddle/pond avoidance and road sign detection.",

        "abstract": "Sun-synchronous exploration is accomplished by reasoning about sunlight: where the Sun is in the sky, where and when shadows will fall, and how much power can be obtained through various courses of action. In July 2001 a solar-powered rover, named Hyperion, completed two sun-synchronous exploration experiments in the Canadian high arctic (75/spl deg/N). Using knowledge of orbital mechanics, local terrain, and expected power consumption, Hyperion planned a sun-synchronous route to visit designated sites while obtaining the necessary solar power for continuous 24-hour operation. Hyperion executed its plan and returned to its starting location with batteries fully charged after traveling more than 6 kilometers in barren, Mars-analog terrain. We describe the concept of sun-synchronous exploration. We overview the design of the robot Hyperion and the software system that enables it to operate sun-synchronously. We then discuss results from analysis of our first experiment in sun-synchronous exploration and conclude with observations.",

        "abstract": "When designing flexible multi-sensor based robot systems, one important problem is how to combine the measurements from disparate sensors such as cameras and force sensors. In this paper, we present a method for combining direct force control and visual servoing in the presence of unknown planar surfaces. The control algorithm involves a force feedback control loop and a vision based reference trajectory as a feed-forward signal. The vision system is based on a constrained image-based visual servoing algorithm designed for surface following, where the location and orientation of the planar constraint surface is estimated online using position-, force- and visual data. We show how data from a simple and efficient camera calibration method can be used in combination with force and position data to improve the estimation and reference trajectories. The method is validated through experiments involving force controlled drawing on an unknown surface. The robot will grasp a pen and use it to draw lines between a number of markers drawn on a white-board, while the contact force is kept constant. Despite its simplicity, the performance of the method is satisfactory.",

We have already derived a generation algorithm for the regrasping strategy by evolutionary programming. The regrasping strategy however becomes inapplicable when the relative position and posture between a hand and an object is not same as those in numerical simulation. We therefore propose some adjusting methods which can change the intermediate position and posture when grasping an object. This method can avoid the limitation of joint work area and fingertip slip so that it could extend the tolerable area of the position and posture error. We show its effectiveness for the regrasping motion with numerical simulations and experiments.",

Under these assumptions, formations are made so that the dynamic equations and constraints are satisfied. Illustrative simulations of groups of unmanned ground vehicles in formations are presented. The results are also implemented on a laboratory facility with three unmanned ground vehicles.",

These systems are taking remarkable activities in industrial field but not in daily life of human. Main disadvantage of these robot systems is the fatal risk to human body when they lose control in the case of breakdown. On the contrary, we focus on flexible robot systems that work passively without actuators. These systems are intrinsically safe to human body since they never exert any excessive forces. In this paper, we present a novel passive element that varies its stiffness to internal vacuum pressure. This passive element is a soft vinyl tube embedded with Styrofoam beads, and is therefore soft and light contrary to conventional passive elements. Using the flexibility and the controllable stiffness, we developed a wearable haptic display that provides a sensation of elasticity and viscosity. The design of this new passive element and the applications to haptic displays are discussed.",

It has a single degree of freedom that is actuated by a motor and a brake pair. The use of a motor and a brake allows various objects to be simulated without a stability problem and related safety issues involved with using high torque motors only. The device performance is measured by its ability to simulate various test objects. Simple test objects are modeled as a benchmark test of the system's performance. The force feedback device is capable of simulating forces in a variety of virtual environments. This device demonstrates the effectiveness of a hybrid active/passive haptic actuator. An analysis of the use of hybrid active/passive actuators in the 2 degrees of freedom case finds that they are capable of simulating a rigid body in a broad range.",

        "abstract": "Homing and navigation capabilities are essential in many autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) applications. The paper presents both problems with respect to a single beacon. The difficulties of this approach are due to the fact that a single range measurement does not completely constrain the beacon's position in the vehicle frame. In order to triangulate his position, the AUV needs to maneuver while measuring its displacements between ranges. In addition, range measurements are noisy and sometimes spurious, speed bias and underwater currents affect dead-reckoning measurements. Homing and navigation procedures are the same beginning. In a first time, we have an initialization phase which is necessary to obtain an initial estimate of the vehicle's absolute position and of the disturbances affecting the quality of the dead reckoned displacements. These initials estimates are refined during the actual displacement towards the beacon by means of a Kalman filter. Two kinds of navigation are used so as to maximize the information matrix and to maintain an accurate absolute position. We present also postprocessing results and a comparison with LBL navigation.",

        "abstract": "The principal deficiency of image-based visual servoing is that the induced (3D) trajectories are not optimal and sometimes, especially when the displacement to realize is large, these trajectories are not physically valid leading to the failure of the servoing process. Furthermore, visual control needs a matching step between the features extracted from the initial image and the desired one. This step can be problematic (or impossible) when the camera displacement between the acquisitions of the initial and desired images is large and/or for complex scenes. To resolve these deficiencies, we couple an image interpolation process between N relay images extracted from a database and an image-based trajectory tracking. The camera calibration and the model of the observed scene are not assumed to be known. The relay images are interpolated in such a way that the corresponding camera trajectory is minimal. First a closed form collineation path is obtained and then the analytical form of image features trajectories are derived and efficiently tracked using a purely image-based control. Experimental results obtained on a six DOF eye-in-hand robotic system are presented and confirm the validity of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to improve the path tracking accuracy of an industrial robot without replacing the standard industrial controller. By calculating off-line an appropriate trajectory pre-compensation, the effects of the nonlinear dynamics are compensated. This is realized by filtering the desired trajectory with the inverse dynamic model of the robot and its velocity controller. This compensation is applied as a velocity feedforward in the standard industrial controller avoiding the need for a torque control interface. The method presented is validated experimentally on a KUKA IR 361 industrial robot. The results show clearly an improved path tracking accuracy on circular trajectories.",

Most integration works involve the task planner providing discrete commands to the low-level controller, which performs kinematics and control computations to command the motor and joint actuators. This paper presents a framework of the integrated planning and control for mobile robot navigation. Unlike existing integrated approaches, it produces a sequence of checkpoints instead of a complete path at the planning level. At the motion control level, a neural network is trained to perform motor control that moves the robot from one checkpoint to the next. This method allows for a tight integration between high-level planning and low-level control, which permits real-time performance and easy modification of motion path while the robot is enroute to the goal position.",

By the interactions between a mobile manipulator and the unknown object, a nonholonomic cart, sensory information has been collected to estimate the model parameters of the cart, which are used to control the cart. Since the raw data are contaminated by noise they can not be modeled statistically, a wavelet based least square method is proposed to estimate these parameters for the cart. The raw signal has been decomposed into a certain bandwidth to generate a series of new signals, which are used to estimate the parameters. The new signal, which has the minimal estimation residual in least square sense is adopted as the best estimation. The error convergence of the estimation approach is given. The experimental results indicate that the estimation accuracy can be significantly improved by the use of the proposed method.",

The robot can arbitrarily begin to move in any direction to the target, and autonomously roll and reach any desired position. Our design considers a spherical robot with an internal mechanism for propulsion. The propulsion mechanism distributes weights radially along spokes fixed inside the sphere and enables the robot to accelerate, decelerate, and move with constant velocity. A mathematical model of the robot's dynamic and motion is instructed. An algorithmic motion planning is developed and, partly, pseudo-code of that is presented. For a number of missions, it is shown experimentally that the model agrees well with the results.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for learning models of people's motion behaviors in an indoor environment. As people move through their environments, they do not move randomly. Instead, they often engage in typical motion patterns, related to specific locations that they might be interested in approaching and specific trajectories that they might follow in doing so. Knowledge about such patterns may enable a mobile robot to develop improved people following and obstacle avoidance skills. This paper proposes an algorithm that learns collections of typical trajectories that characterize a person's motion patterns. Data, recorded by mobile robots equipped with laser range finders, is clustered into different types of motion using the popular expectation maximization algorithm, while simultaneously learning multiple motion patterns. Experimental results, obtained using data collected in a domestic residence and in an office building, illustrate that highly predictive models of human motion patterns can be learned.",

        "abstract": "Application of the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle to many tasks across the Department of Energy (DOE) complex logically leads to the realization that remotely operated equipment is highly desirable. The Pit Viper is a tele-operated system intended for pit operations at the Hanford Site. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components were used in an attempt to reduce integration hurdles and increase reliability. One key factor is that only a limited number of available, off-the-shelf robotic manipulator systems are available and all of them have some characteristics that present interfacing challenges. The state-of-the-art in remote technology is not as mature as many might hope. This paper describes the issues (and proposed improvements) that surfaced during the development and first deployment of the Pit Viper System. Important areas are contamination control, operator interface and operator training, adaptation of tools, and workspace interfaces. The Pit Viper, as is, provides significant improvement over the current baseline approaches.",

The multi-link robot is equipped with ultrasound sensors and a thermal sensor, which detects body heat and isolates any survivor. In this study, the objective is to develop a logical sensing and an intelligent perception model that learns to identify the most suitable zone for control by minimizing the control unpredictability due to uncertainty. This model is based on a radial basis function network trained with dynamic decay adjustment algorithm that classifies the control region into positive regions. Uncertainty irregularities in the control region is modeled using the statistical rough set theory based on beliefs assigned to control cells in a cellular space. Logical sensors are then fused together to construct a wide-angle logical sensor unit in the control zone. Simulation results are given, in order to illustrate the efficiency of the approach developed for an unstructured environment.",

However, these approaches are not applicable to the flowshop problems with the changeover cost which depends on the sequence of operations. In this paper, we propose a machine-oriented decomposition method for the flowshop problems using the Lagrangian decomposition and coordination technique. In the proposed method, each sub-problem for single machine is solved by the simulated annealing method. The solutions of the sub-problems are used to generate a feasible schedule by a heuristic procedure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing the results of the example problems solved by the proposed method with those solved by the conventional method. Furthermore, it has been shown that the proposed approach is easily applicable to the flow hop problem with resource constrains minimizing the changeover costs and due date penalties.",

These motions are intended to retrain the upper limb movements of patients that lose manipulation functions following stroke. We present a model that uses higher degree polynomials to define a trajectory and control the robot arm to achieve minimum jerk movements. It also studies different methods that can be driven from polynomials to create more realistic human-like movements for therapeutic purposes.",

Unlike previous path planners, TEMPEST solves the coupled path, path timing and resource management problem. It combines information about mission objectives, operational constraints, the planetary environment and rover performance, and employs the Incremental Search Engine, a search algorithm that produces optimal paths through high-dimensional spaces. In July 2001, TEMPEST supported the Sun-Synchronous Navigation Field Experiment on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic. The planner successfully selected time-sequenced, closed-circuit paths that enabled a solar-powered planetary rover prototype to traverse a multi-kilometer path over 24 hours with battery energy reserve. The field trial results motivate future work in mission re-planning, multiple resource constraint analysis and improved speed and memory performance. Our objective is to fulfill a need for resource-cognizant autonomy that is critical for future long-distance planetary surface missions.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot localization from large-scale appearance mosaics has been showing increasing promise as a low-cost, high-performance and infrastructure-free solution to vehicle guidance in man-made environments. The feasibility of this technique relies on the construction of a locally smooth and globally consistent high-resolution mosaic of the vehicle environment, efficiently done using observations that have low spatial and temporal persistence. The problem of loop closure in cyclic environments that plagues this process is one that is commonly encountered in all map-building procedures, and its solution is often computationally expensive. The paper presents a method that reliably generates consistent maps at low computational cost, while fully exploiting the topology of the observations. Extensions to a real-time implementation are discussed along with results using simulated data and those from real indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "A training algorithm for motion planning of a nonholonomic autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the strong water current is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm can be applied in the environment with obstacles placed in arbitrary configuration. In order to realize these functions, the Q-learning and teaching method are introduced and a multilayer structure is proposed. By introducing Q-learning, the motion of the nonholonomic AUV can be suitably treated. Taking advantage of the Baysian net, a motion planning algorithm in the case of an existence of obstacles, is derived automatically from the learned knowledge. The multilayer structure accelerates the learning process. Results of the demonstration by the simulation of control of R-One robot show the high performance of proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Addresses the issue of developing a motion planning algorithm for a general class of modular mobile robots. A modular mobile robot is essentially a reconfigurable robot system in which locomotive modules such as legs, wheels, propellers, etc. can be attached at various locations on the body. The equations of motion for the robot are developed in terms of a set of generalized inputs related to the constraints and configurations of each individual module. The motion planning method developed in Lafferriere and Sussmann (1991) and extended in Goodwine and Burdick (1997) can then be modified to generate required trajectories for the modular robot. These methods generally lead to sequential motion plans-we also develop conditions under which two consecutive plans can be executed simultaneously.",

A scale space method is used to extract points of maximum curvature from laser range scans of unmodified outdoor environments. This information is then fused with odometric information to provide localization information for an outdoor vehicle. The method described is invariant to the size and orientation of the range images under consideration (with respect to rotation and translation), is robust to noise, and can reliably detect and localize naturally occurring landmarks in the operating environment. The algorithm is demonstrated in the application of a road vehicle in an unmodified operating domain.",

The motivation of this study is the well-known observation that NPD control method can offer a means to improve the performance of plant systems. This study is also to examine how the mechanical structure of the manipulator affects dynamic performance. The design of mechanical structure follows the design-for-control (DFC) principle, and in particular it renders to a full force balanced mechanism. Simulation studies confirm that the concurrent consideration of mechanical structure design and NPD control can obtain good trajectory tracking performance for the parallel manipulators.",

Most online path planning methods are based on local algorithms that end up being inefficient due to their lack of global information (local minima problems). The method presented in this paper avoids local minima by using a two stage framework. The robots react to dynamic environments using a local and reactive planning method restricted to a subset of its configuration space. Since the subset has few degrees of freedom the computational cost of the online stage is very low. An off-line stage chooses the subset of the configuration space that minimizes the probability of blockades and inefficient motions.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a small mobile device, \"seal mechanism\", with three degrees of freedom (DOFs). An L-shaped structure of seal mechanism is proposed. This device consists of two controlled electromagnets FA and FB connected by two piezoelectric actuators EA and EB with electromagnet FC that generates a constant friction. The friction at FA and FB are alternated by an on-off control. The whole device wriggles with electromagnets FC by deforming piezoelectric actuators. The 3-DOF device can move up to micrometer steps in the x- and y-directions and rotates up to submilliradian steps in the /spl theta/-direction. The seal mechanism performs as well as the inchworm mechanism. Positioning accuracy in each direction is twice as small as the moving step. The seal mechanism has a smaller number of controlled actuators and is driven by a smaller number of steps than the multiple-DOF positioning stages employing the inchworm mechanism.",

A novel controller that can guarantee a fast convergence, like the exponential convergence, is proposed based on the switching controllers approach. The steady-state error can be specified in advance. Moreover, the convergent rate can be pre-assigned and the transient response can be improved using the pole-placement method. The proposed controller is shown to be robust with respect to some uncertainties in the model. Simulation results for a unicycle-modeled mobile robot that has a small bias in orientation, an unknown radius in the rear wheels and an unknown distance in between them are presented to validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

The paper proposes an innovative approach to human-robot cooperation where the robot will be able to recognize the psychological state of the interacting human and modify its (i.e., robot's) own action to make the human feel comfortable in working with the robot. Wearable biofeedback sensors are used to measure a variety of physiological indices to infer the underlying psychological states (affective states) of the human. The eventual idea is to correlate the psychological states with the actions of the robot to determine which action(s) is responsible for a particular affective state. The robot controller will then modify that action if there is a need to alter the affective state. A concept of such a control architecture, a requirement analysis, and initial results from human experiments for stress detection are presented.",

This paper introduces several kinds of tactile interactions between a user and the robot as well as interactions of the robot with the environment. All interactions are implemented in a single paradigm: Forces measured from tactile sensors result in motion vectors at the contact points. The motion vectors from different sensors are superimposed and then determine the robot's joint velocities. We present results from our experimental setup consisting of an 8 degrees of freedom manipulator arm mounted on a mobile platform. In the illustrated example, a human interacts with the robot using only the tactile interface.",

We propose a method of generating stroke movement based on virtual targets that means the point at which the ball should be struck and the paddle velocity just before hitting the ball. These targets are predicted using inputs-outputs maps implemented efficiently by means of a k-d tree (k dimensional tree). The paddle approaches these targets by using a visual feedback control scheme similar to the mirror law proposed by Koditschek. The results of the implementation are also given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic planning involves continuously updating a map by sensing changes in the environment and planning appropriate actions, with all tasks sharing common computational resources. We use harmonic functions for dynamic planning. Analogous representations of harmonic functions as Markov chains and resistor networks are used to develop the notion of escape probability and energy dissipation. These measures are used to indicate convergence (event that permits resources to be devote to non-planning tasks) more robustly than monitoring maximum or average field changes between iterations. The convergence of the harmonic function is related quadratically to the number of grid elements. An example of an irregular sampling strategy - quad tree - is developed for harmonic functions, which is complete yet imprecise. Quad trees are not a sufficient sampling strategy for addressing the exponential growth of multiple dimensions and therefore current investigations include other sampling strategies or dimensional parallelization.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust method to estimate planar regions using sequential stereo images for visual navigation of an autonomous vehicle. The proposed method estimates 2D projective transformations dynamically, which represent planes in space, for both stereo images and sequential images. This can be done robustly by utilizing sequential information, i.e. previous estimation of both the projective transformations and the corresponding planar region. In addition, a method for preventing misdetection due to textureless areas is proposed. The experimental results, using sequential stereo images taken from a moving vehicle, have shown that the proposed method can work robustly even in the conditions of undulation of the road and rolling and pitching of the vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Image-based visual servoing is a flexible and robust technique to control a robot and guide it to a desired position only by using 2D visual data. However, it is well-known that the visual servoing has one classical problem that the camera moves backward at infinity in case that the camera motion from the initial to desired poses is a pure rotation of 180 degrees around optical axis. It has been considered so far that the problem can not be essentially solved by the simplest conventional approach. This paper shows that the problem can be solved as simply as the conventional approach by introducing cylindrical coordinates into the formulation of visual servoing. Furthermore, we propose a new hybrid visual servoing that can control properly even in the situation coupling between translational and rotational motions by using a linear combination of velocity screws obtained from the Cartesian and cylindrical approaches with the rate of magnitudes of these translational velocities in z direction as a weight. This hybrid approach is modified to keep all feature points within the field of view by combining with another weight that is defined by a sigmoid function of the shortest distance to the edge of the image plane from the feature point.",

We use face and hand directional gestures as the input gestures. By combining the sensory environment information with the user's command given by gestures, the planner of the wheelchair robot selects an optimal motion.

First, we present a simple flocking task, and we describe a leaderless distributed flocking algorithm (LD) that is more conducive to implementation on embodied agents than the established algorithms used in computer animation. Next, we use an embodied simulator and reinforcement learning techniques to optimize LD performance under different conditions, showing that this method can be used not only to improve performance but also to gain insight into which algorithm components contribute most to system behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that a group of real robots executing LD with emulated sensors can successfully flock (even in the presence of individual agent failure) and that systematic characterization (and therefore optimization) of real robot flocking performance is achievable.",

In particular, we examine the combination of image-based structure-from-motion (SFM) data with bathymetric data obtained using pencil-beam underwater sonar, in order to recover the shape of the seabed terrain. We also combine image-based egomotion estimation with acoustic-based and inertial navigation data on board the underwater vehicle. When fusion is performed at the data level, each modality is used to extract 3D information independently. The 3D representations are then aligned and compared. In this case, we use the bathymetric data as ground truth to measure the accuracy and drift of the SFM approach. Similarly we use the navigation data as ground truth against which we measure the accuracy of the image-based ego-motion estimation. We examine how low-resolution bathymetric data can be used to seed the higher-resolution SFM algorithm, improving convergence rates, and reducing drift error. Similarly, acoustic-based and inertial navigation data improves the convergence and drift properties of egomotion estimation.",

The robot is assumed to be equipped with a large number of proximity sensors mounted on its body (a \"skin\" sensor). Robot's own motion is used to sense the free space, analogous to a blind person \"groping and exploring\" using his sense of touch. This sensed free space can be memorized and used to further plan the robot's motion. Using this key idea, we propose a general framework for such skin sensor based motion planning that is valid for robots with large degrees of freedom. The specific motion-planning algorithm developed uses a variant of the probabilistic roadmap method. A novel \"metric\" based on the notion of C-zone map for robot's movement that results in efficient exploration of configuration space is proposed and implemented. Planar simulations demonstrate our results.",

In haptic application, these singularities deteriorate the system performance generating reflecting force. Moreover, different from general manipulators, haptic systems can't avoid the singular point, because they are operated by user random command. Although many singularity-free algorithms for serial mechanisms have been proposed and studied, singularity-free algorithms for parallel haptic application have not been deeply discussed. In this paper various singularity-free algorithms, which are appropriate to parallel haptic system, will be discussed. Furthermore, to overcome singularity problems, a new design including redundant actuation is proposed. The proposed mechanism has fairly large workspace and is relatively light by employing non-floating actuators.",

        "abstract": "We are developing a mechanical model of a human vocal system based on a mechatronics technology. Although various ways of vocal sound production have been actively studied so far, a mechanical construction is considered to advantageously realize natural vocalization with its fluid dynamics. In the voice generation, the analysis of the behaviors of the vocal cords and the vocal tract are required to be employed in the mechanical system. Furthermore, the fluid mechanics is less stable to make the control difficult. Several motors are employed to manipulate the mechanical vocal system. A neural network works to establish the relations between motor positions and the produced vocal sounds by an auditory feedback in the learning phase. In the speech performance, the mechanical system is able to utter while vocal pitches and phonemes are adaptively controlled by an auditory feedback control. This paper presents the construction of a vocal tract part and its adaptive control by the neural networks.",

        "abstract": "We present two-dimensional monopods that are capable of stable periodic hopping motions without any feedback. It is shown that a large foot radius is not necessary for self-stabilization and that even one-legged robots with a point foot can perform open-loop stable motions although they have no statically stable standing position. The concept of open-loop stability implies that the actuators receive purely periodic torque or force inputs that are never altered with any feedback to prevent the robot from falling. The robots consist of a toroidal body and a leg that are connected by a hinge powered by a torque. The leg bounces on an adjustable spring. The design of these robots and the choice of model parameter values leading to stable motions is a difficult task that has been accomplished using newly developed stability optimization methods.",

        "abstract": "Stiffness is one of the important considerations in the design of Stewart platform based parallel kinematic machine (PKM). In most stiffness models of PKMs, the machine frames are thought of rigid bodies. In this paper, an approach is presented to establish the stiffness model of a Stewart platform-based PKM, considering the deformation of the frame. The deformation of legs and the frame is considered as kinematic parameter errors of Stewart platform. According to the differential error model, the machine structure is decomposed into two subsystems: the parallel links subsystem and the machine frame subsystem. The stiffness matrix of each subsystem is established respectively, assuming that the other one is a rigid structure. By linear superposition of the two subsystems, the stiffness model of the machine structure is obtained. A finite element analysis (FEA) model is used to simulate the physical structure. The FEA results are compared to those derived from a mathematical model, and the comparison shows the validity of this approach.",

        "abstract": "Locating arteries hidden beneath superficial tissue can be a difficult task in minimally invasive surgery. This paper reports the development of a system that finds the paths of arteries using tactile sensing. The surgeon begins by using the surgical robot to place the tactile sensor instrument on a known artery location. Signal processing algorithms locate the artery from its pulsatile pressure variation. An adaptive extrapolation algorithm then generates predicted locations for the artery based on previous measurements. After moving to the predicted location, if the artery is not located then a backtracking mechanism moves the sensor towards previously detected locations. Tests with model arteries show good tracking ability for circular arcs with curvatures as small as 80 mm, although problems with compliance in the system result in occasional loss of the artery path. Preliminary tests demonstrate the ability to transcutaneously track the radial artery in the human wrist.",

Because of the large gap between the conditions and constraints required to implement robotic systems and the conditions encountered in in situ D&D work, nearly all D&D activities that are too hazardous for direct human contact are presently executed using purely teleoperated remote systems. Advances in capability and efficiency can be achieved by developing new telerobotic control methodologies that integrate tasks ideally suited for robotic control with task definitions provided by more traditional teleoperated control. The objectives are to reduce task execution time, reduce the required operator skill level, and to enable the use of tools that are not suited for purely teleoperated control.",

        "abstract": "Human motion can provide a rich source of examples for use in robot grasping and manipulation. Adapting human examples to a robot manipulator is a difficult problem, however, in part due to differences between human and robot hands. Even hands that are anthropomorphic in external design may differ dramatically from the human hand in ability to grasp and manipulate objects due to internal design differences. For example, force transmission mechanisms in robot fingers are generally symmetric about flexion/extension axes, but in human fingers they are focused toward flexion. This paper describes how a tendon driven robot finger can be optimized for force transmission capability equivalent to the human index finger. We show that two distinct tendon arrangements that are similar to those that have been used in robot hands can achieve the same range of forces as the human finger with minimal additional cost in total muscle force requirements.",

        "abstract": "We report the holonomy analysis of three wheeled mobile robots. Two of these, Vuton II and Nomad, have full mobility and are claimed by their inventors to be holonomic. We show that, in fact, they are nonholonomic. Nevertheless, conditions are given under which these robots can be designed for quasiholonomy, a concept introduced elsewhere and recalled here. The third robot, Quasimoro, has a mobility of two and is unconditionally quasiholonomic. It is shown that if the wheel mechanism of a robot with full mobility is designed in such a way that the platform is much heavier than the wheel mechanism, then the underlying mathematical models are free of the nonholonomy term.",

        "abstract": "On-line clustering is required whenever huge amounts or continuous flows of data must be classified and/or described in a compact way. Most available unsupervised competitive learning methods exhibit the problem that the units of the self-organizing map \"accumulate\" in the regions of the sample space characterized by higher data density, while in clustering it is generally desired that just one node represents each data cluster, independently of the relative density of points in the different clusters. This paper presents a novel on-line, hard-competitive algorithm that deals with this basic limitation, showing very good performance in clustering data from artificial distributions, as well as real data within the problem of motion-based scene segmentation in automated video surveillance.",

The pq-histogram is obtained by discretising in logarithmic scale the local depth (p, q). Since this histogram gives a global view of the scene, it could be used as a fast clue for navigation. An arrangement of four pq-histograms, one for each image quadrant, can advise many orientations. The potential application of the pq-histogram is illustrated in two domains. Firstly, semi-automatic navigation of an endoscope inside the human colon. Secondly, mobile robot navigating in certain environments, such as corridors and mines. In both cases, the method was tested with real images with encouraging results.",

The experimental results show the maximum acceleration of 91G corresponding to almost two times higher than the conventional world record, and the total capturing time of 0.03 sec. Experiments on capturing a ball are also shown.",

Performance benefits such as increased damping or reduced tracking error have been experimentally demonstrated. Previous results (2000) have established Lyapunov stability of NPID control for full-state knowledge and for special cases of partial-state knowledge; but the general problem of stability with arbitrary state knowledge remained unsolved. In the present work, design methods for NPID control are extended to the case of arbitrary partial-state knowledge. Given any combination of a stabilizable linear system and NPID control law, an upper bound on control effort can be determined for which global asymptotic stability is assured. The result is based on a Lyapunov stability proof and is applied to establish the stability of NPID control for the Sarcos dexterous manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Addresses a practical problem arising in the calibration of bottom-lock Doppler sonar for the navigation of underwater robot vehicles. Employing a least-squares method, the rotational alignment offset between a bottom-lock Doppler sonar and a north-seeking gyroscope can be experimentally determined using sensors commonly deployed with a vehicle in the field. It requires sensor values from the vehicle's Doppler sonar and 3-axis gyroscope, and absolute vehicle position fixes from a long-baseline or short-baseline acoustic navigation system. The performance of the calibration method is evaluated with simulated Doppler data possessing measurement noise typical of that found in actual in-water vehicle sensor data.",

The two mobile manipulators dynamically change their configurations so that they do not collide with each other while not only maintaining the support for the object but also keeping the arm's configuration away from singularities.",

The proposed algorithm makes use of the common assumption that the disparities corresponding to continuous surfaces in the world vary smoothly; we use this assumption to alleviate the correspondence problem for pixels that cannot be reliably matched by the stereo algorithm. Our approach can be described as a reliability based filtering of the disparity image followed by a recursive propagation step. It can be applied to the output of almost any \"standard\" stereo algorithm with minimal modifications, and is computationally efficient.",

The system is based on a control algorithm that implements a broad class of guidance modes called virtual fixtures.

The implemented system uses vision as a sensor for providing a reference trajectory, and the control algorithm then provides haptic feedback involving direct, shared manipulation of a surgical tool. We have tested this system on the JHU Steady Hand robot and provide experimental results for path following and positioning on structures at both macroscopic and microscopic scales.",

        "abstract": "When a construction company builds a high structure, many piles should be driven into the ground by a hammer whose weight is 7,000 kg in order to make the ground under the structure safe and strong. So, it is essential to determine whether a pile is penetrated into the ground enough to support the weight of the structure since ground characteristics at different locations are different to each other. The paper proposes a visual measurement system for pile rebound and penetration movement including vibration using a high-speed line-scan camera and a specially designed mark to recognize two-dimensional motion parameters of the mark using only a line-scan camera. A mark stacking white and black right-angled triangles is used for the measurement, and movement information for vertical distance, horizontal distance and rotational angle is determined simultaneously. By adopting a line-scan CCD camera whose line rate is 20 kHz, the measurement performance of dynamic characteristics of the pile at impact instant is improved dramatically.",

Analysis and simulations demonstrate that a surprisingly simple proportional controller in the image coordinates can accomplish position and orientation alignment with parking lot lines. Unlike previous work, no image Jacobian matrix is necessary. Knowledge of the camera focal length is not required, but the camera and vehicle axes are assumed to be aligned, and the vehicle is assumed to rotate about the camera frame's y-axis.",

        "abstract": "Jose is a visually guided autonomous robotic waiter. He circulates around a room populated by groups of people, politely serving appetizers to humans. The serving task combines elements of robotics with human computer interaction, challenging control architecture with multiple task integration. This paper describes our purely vision-based approach to this task. Methods for mapping, localization and navigation are presented and discussed, including issues of safety for both robots and humans. Our work on human-robot interaction is covered, as well as our solutions to various tasks specific to serving food. We present results of our methods from sample experiments in our laboratory. We further discuss our experiences at the 2001 AAAI mobile robot \"Hors D'oeuvres Anyone?\" competition, at which Jose took first prize.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a design method of wholebody tactile interface for elevating human-robot coordination. The proposed surface cover sensor as the tactile interface enables robots to detect accurate 3D force vector applied on various parts of the body during physical interaction with humans. First, after analysis of a variety of contact situations between humans and robots, tactile and force information needed are specified, and the specifications are decided based on knowledge of human engineering. Next, a design method of a cover sensor that can detect accurate force vector and contact position is described. The cover sensor utilizes a force-torque sensor and is surrounded with several touch sensors. The mechanism was implemented on a humanoid robot, WENDY. Finally, evaluation experiments of locus tracking on the surface and force-following to humans were carried out. The experimental results demonstrate the high capabilities of the proposed cover sensor as human-robot interface, and indicate that the proposed design method of whole-body tactile interface is capable of enhancing human-robot coordination.",

        "abstract": "Kinematic and dynamic characteristics of Stewart platform based parallel manipulators are fixed once they are constructed. Thus parallel manipulators with various configurations are required to meet a variety of applications. In this research a variable arm type parallel manipulator (VAPM) was developed, in which the length of the arm linking the platform center to the platform-leg contact point can be varied by the actuator. Workspace of the VAPM is larger than that of a traditional Stewart platform and especially the range in which the maximum orientation angles can be maintained is significantly expanded. Furthermore, the characteristics of force and moment transmission between the legs and platform can be adjusted to meet the requirements of various tasks. Kinematic and dynamic analysis was performed to verify the usefulness of the VAPM and the actual hardware was built to demonstrate the feasibility.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper the workspace optimization of translational 3-UPU parallel platforms with prismatic and universal joint constraints is performed. The workspace is parameterized using two design parameters, which are the prismatic joint stroke and the difference between the distances of the center to one of the corners of the triangular plate of the base and of the moving platform. For a large range of values for these design parameters the workspace of the corresponding 3-UPU platforms is calculated. This workspace is called the constrained workspace. For each design of the constrained workspace, three performance indices are calculated: 1) the workspace volume; 2) the average of the inverse of the condition number; and 3) a global condition index which is a combination of the other two performance indices. Plots of each performance index as a function of the two design parameters are generated and optimal values for these design parameters are determined. Finally, for the optimal design, it is shown that by introducing limits to the angles of the universal joints axis, the isotropy of the parallel platform is improved.",
