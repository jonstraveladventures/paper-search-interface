        "abstract": "This paper introduces a high-speed vision system called IDP Express, which can execute real-time image processing and high frame rate video recording simultaneously. In IDP Express, a dedicated FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) board processes 512 \u00d7 512 pixel images from two camera heads by implementing image processing algorithms as hardware logic; the input images and processed results are transferred to standard PC memory at a rate of 2000 fps or more. Owing to the simultaneous high-frame-rate video processing and recording, IDP Express can be used as an intelligent video logger for long-term high-speed phenomenon analysis even when the measured objects move quickly in a wide area. We applied IDP Express to a mechanical target tracking system to record a high-frame-rate video at high resolution for a crucial moment, which is magnified by tracking the measured objects with visual feedback control. Several experiments on moving objects that undergo sudden shape deformation were performed. The results of the experiments involving the explosion of a rotating balloon and the crash of falling custard pudding have been provided to verify the effectiveness of IDP Express.",

        "abstract": "A lot of plumbings such as gas pipes and water pipes exist in public utilities, factories, power plants and so on. It is difficult for humans to inspect them directly because they are long and narrow. Therefore, automated inspection by robots equipped with camera is desirable, and great efforts have been done to solve this problem. However, many of existing inspection robots have to rotate the camera to record images in piping because a conventional camera with a narrow view can see only one direction while piping has a cylindrical geometry. The use of an omni-directional camera that can take images of 360\u00b0 in surroundings at a time is effective for the solution of the problem. However, the shape measurement is difficult only with the omni-directional camera. Then, in this paper, we propose a reconstruction method of piping shape by using an omni-directional camera and an omni-directional laser with a light section method and a structure from motion analysis. The validity of the proposed method is shown through experiments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a device that significantly improves the safety of ceiling-mounted robots whose end effector orientation remains constant with respect to the vertical direction (e.g. Scara-type robots). The device consists of a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism with the Delta architecture on which the revolute actuators have been replaced with torque limiters. The resulting Cartesian force limiting device (CFLD) is implemented as a mechanical connection between the robot and the effector. It is rigid unless excessive forces are applied on the end effector, for example during a collision. The magnitude of force that activates the mechanism is set by properly adjusting the threshold of the torque limiters. Furthermore, a collision can be rapidly detected with a limit switch placed on one of the links of the mechanism and a signal can be sent directly to brakes that will stop the robot, without passing through a controller and thus improving the reliability and reaction-time of the safety system. By mechanically disconnecting the robot from its end effector, the device ensures that the person involved in the collision is only subjected to the inertia of the end effector and thus potential injuries are greatly reduced. This work is the extension of a previous 2-DOF CFLD that was sensitive only to horizontal forces. The new architecture reacts to collisions occuring in any direction and is geometrically optimized for the proposed application.",

The method explodes the rich information obtained by a projective transformation of planar objects on a calibrated camera. The algorithm obtains the metric and projective components of a reference object (landmark or helipad) with respect to the UAV camera coordinate system, using a robust real time object tracking based on homographies. The algorithm is validated on real flights that compare the estimated data against that obtained by the inertial measurement unit IMU, showing that the proposed method robustly estimates the helicopter's 3D position with respect to a reference landmark, with a high quality on the position and orientation estimation when the aircraft is flying at low altitudes, a situation in which the GPS information is often inaccurate. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for complex control tasks, such as autonomous landing, accurate low altitude positioning and dropping of payloads.",

In this paper, a learning-from-demonstration strategy based on Hidden Markov Models is presented, which permits the robot system to adapt to user- as well as process-specific features. To evaluate the suitability of this approach for small-lot production, the learning strategy has been implemented for an arc welding robot and has been evaluated on-site at a medium sized metal-working company.",

The IMU measurements are integrated to obtain pose estimates, which are subsequently corrected using line-to-plane correspondences between linear segments in the laser-scan data and orthogonal structural planes of the building. Exploiting the orthogonal building planes ensures fast and efficient initialization and estimation of the map features while providing human-interpretable layout of the environment. The L-INS is experimentally validated by a person traversing a multistory building, and the results demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method for indoor localization and mapping.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a ZigBee indoor positioning scheme based on the location fingerprinting approach. The proposed scheme includes four workflows: (1) creating the location fingerprint table, (2) training the locating model using neural network (NN), (3) preprocessing data through the Signal-Index-Pair method, and (4) estimating the coordinate of the mobile target instantly. Testing results show that within the error distance of 5 meters, the NN locating model with the Signal-Index-Pair data preprocess method can increase the positioning precision by 17% compared with the original NN, in terms of the cumulative error probability (CEP). It also achieves 5% CEP higher than the k (k=5) nearest neighbor method and the weighted k (k=5) nearest neighbor method. Potential applications include patient tracking in hospitals, object tracking for factory monitoring, self-navigation of autonomous robots, and visitors monitoring in military buildings, and so on.",

Furthermore, homing can be introduced into a topological navigation system by cyclically setting Home positions at the keypoints/nodes in a topological map. In this work, we describe a bearing-only homing method based on only few matching keypoints to grant the mobile robot the homing ability. Our method considers the homing problem as a visual servoing problem in 2D plane and even in 3D space, using an omnidirectional camera as the visual sensor. It doesn't require the distance information to the reference feature points. The proof of the convergence for the algorithm is also given. The simulation results confirm the feasibility and robustness of our method.",

In this paper, a compact rotary series elastic actuator (cRSEA) is designed considering these requirements. To magnify the torque generated by an electric motor in the limited space of the compact device, a worm gear is utilized. However, the actual torque amplification ratio provided by the worm gear is different from the nominal speed reduction ratio due to friction, which makes the controller design challenging. In this paper, the friction effect is considered in the model of cRSEA, and a robust control algorithm is designed to precisely control the torque output in the presence of nonlinearities such as the friction. The mechanical design and dynamic model of the proposed device and the design of a robust control algorithm are discussed, and actuation performance is verified by experiments.",

This paper presents a constant-force mechanism (CFM) to regulate the contact force of a robot end-effector. The proposed CFM is a monolithic compliant mechanism that has no frictional wear and is capable of miniaturization. Due to the passive mechanism, additional sensors and control effort are minimized. We propose a design formulation to find the optimal CFM shape that produces the most constant force. The reaction force to input displacement curve is invariant of size and flexural rigidity. The curve can be manipulated depending on the desirable situations. The CFM is validated through an experiment. When equipped with the CFM, an illustrative end-effector can adapt to a surface of variable height, without additional motion programming. With the merits shown, we expect this type of elastic mechanism can be utilized in robot end-effectors to provide friendly contact with environment.",

One of the basic issues of visual odometry is relative scale estimation. We propose a method to compute the relative scales of a path by solving a bundle adjustment optimization problem. We introduce a constricted parameterization of the bundle adjustment problem, where only the distances between neighboring cameras are optimized, while the rotation angles and translation directions stay fixed. We will present visual odometry results for image data of a vehicle mounted onmidirectional camera for a track of 1000m length.",

Few assumptions on the device's shape as well as the utilized hardware are required. Our approach is based on an on-line estimation of the constraint manifold which serves as a reference input for an admittance-type controller providing the compliance required. The direction estimation is obtained from the velocity signal in task space. An on-line adaptation of the admittance controller according to the estimated moving direction reduces contact forces. The functionality of the control strategy is demonstrated on a mobile manipulator in a kitchen environment.",

Moreover, the DIS can incorporate position control at the initial contact with virtual objects to improve the perceived contact hardness. Through benchmark virtual wall experiments, we show that the DIS can significantly increase the impedance range that a haptic interface can stably display, and that the initial contact hardness that a user perceives can be noticeably improved by using the proposed position control method.",

We assume that the global position and orientation of the robot and objects are known. The system computes a dipole field around the object and moves the robot along the field. This simple algorithm resolves many subtle issues in implementing reliable pushing behaviors, such as collision avoidance, error recovery, and multi-robot coordination. We verify the effectiveness of the algorithm via several experiments with varying robot and object form factors. Although object delivery by pushing and motion control by a vector field are not new, the proposed algorithm offers easier implementation with fewer parameter adjustments because of its mode-less definition and scale-invariant formulation.",

        "abstract": "The performances of controlled systems can be improved by driving them with smooth reference signals. In case of rough signals, smoothness can be achieved with the help of appropriate dynamic filters. To this purpose a novel discrete-time filter is proposed in the paper. It has been appositely designed for real-time motion applications like those that can be encountered in robotic or mechatronic contexts. The filter generates output signals which are continuous together with their first and second time derivatives. Simultaneously, the first, the second, and the third time derivatives are bounded within freely assignable limits. If such limits are changed on-the-fly, the filter hangs the new bounds in minimum-time. An example case shows the filter while tracking steps, ramps and parabolas by means of bounded-dynamic transients.",

First we demonstrate how the strategy allows an ATRON robot to adapt to faults and changes in its morphology and we study the strategy's scalability. Second we extend the strategy to learn the parameters of gait-tables for ATRON and M-TRAN robots.We conclude that the presented strategy is effective for online learning of gaits for most types of modular robots and that learning can effectively be distributed by having independent processes learning in parallel.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of door-opening by using a modular re-configurable robot (MRR) mounted on a tracked mobile platform. The main concern of opening a door is how to prevent the internal forces that occur because of the positioning error or the imprecise modeling of the environment, i.e., the door parameters. Most previous research is based on compliant control, which makes the control system rather complicated. In addition, such approaches need expensive force/torque sensor to be implemented. With respect to the multiple working modes of the MRR modules, the complication has been avoided by switching the joints that has axis of rotation parallel to the door hinge to work in passive mode. As a result of this approach, the internal forces between the door and the mobile manipulator will vanish. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed door opening strategy.",

The objective is to find multiple fixed length paths for multiple robots that satisfy the following constraints: (i) bounded curvature, (ii) obstacle avoidance, (iii) and collision avoidance. First, we formulate a relaxation of the path planning problem using polygonal approximations. We show that path planning problem for multiple robots under various constraints and missions, such as curvature and obstacle avoidance constraints as well as rendezvous and maximal total area coverage, can be cast as a nonconvex optimization problem. Then, we propose an alternative dual formulation that results in no duality gap. We show that the alternative dual function can be interpreted as minimum potential energy of a multi-particle system with discontinuous spring-like forces. Finally, we show that using the proposed duality-based framework, an approximation of the minimal length path planning problem (also known as Dubins' problem) in presence of obstacles can be solved efficiently using primal-dual interior-point methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Although lots of planning algorithms have focused on the planning of fixed manipulators and mobile robots in moderate dynamic environments, seldom planning algorithms can be employed to deal with mobile agents in the presence of large scenario scales and unpredictable changing obstacles. Path planning for mobile robots in unpredictable environments would be an extreme challenge since computational complexity increase dramatically with high dimensionality, unpredictability and large scales. In this paper, a novel and real-time approach is proposed to solve this problem by generating subgoals dynamically according to time and potential values. This dynamic subgoal based approach includes two procedures, the subgoal generator and the inter-subgoal or inner replanner. On the one hand, a set of high-level subgoals is generated dynamically by an improved single shot strategy that could tailor itself adaptively. On the other hand, a roadmap is built during the preprocessing phase by employing a localized Dynamic Roadmap Mapping (local-DRM) for inter-subgoal replanning. Finally these two procedures will collaborate according to the potential field criterion to ensure completeness. Our approach can not only generate paths rapidly enough to satisfy the requirements of an anytime planer but also work for large scenario scales. Experimental results on different kinds of mobile agents, in large scenario scales and in the presence of unpredictable changing obstacles show that our approach can find out a collision free path on an average of 0.11s for a single planning, indicating an anytime planner.",

        "abstract": "A 5-SPU robot with collinear universal joints is well suited to handling an axisymmetric tool, since it has 5 controllable DoFs and the remaining one is a free rotation around the tool. The kinematics of such a robot having also coplanar spherical joints has previously been studied as a rigid subassembly of a Stewart-Gough platform, it being denoted a line-plane component. It was shown that this component has 8 assembly modes corresponding to the roots of a bi-quartic polynomial. Here we identify a whole family of these 5-SPU robots having only 4 assembly modes, which are obtained by solving two quadratic equations. This family is defined by a simple proportionality constraint relating the coordinates of the base and platform attachments. A geometric interpretation of the architectural singularities of this type of robots in terms of conics is provided, which facilitates their avoidance at the design stage. Parallel singularities obey also a neat geometric structure, which permits deriving a cell decomposition of configuration space. Two practical features of these quadratically-solvable robots are the large maneuverability within each connected component and the fact that, for a fixed orientation of the tool, the singularity locus reduces to a plane.",

Both methods are tested and analysed in simulation experiments. We show that the rule-based method performs well but the lack of information has to be paid for with increased energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Cochlear electrode insertion is a challenging manual procedure. One technique requires the physician to coordinate the motions of an electrode array approximately 1mm in diameter and the smaller stylet within it, using miniature forceps. A new minimally invasive access technique precludes forceps insertion because the electrode must travel through a small-diameter drilled hole to reach the cochlear access point. To address this, we present an automated insertion tool. This second generation device not only enables deployment in the minimally invasive setting, but also makes insertion velocity profiles repeatable and can sense insertion forces. Force sensing is essential because insertion forces can indicate impending damage to cochlear membranes, but are below the thresholds that can be sensed by human hands. The Automated Insertion Tool we present is designed to be compact and lightweight for straightforward integration into the operating room environment. It is able to insert an electrode with a resolution of less than 1\u03bcm, achieve velocities of up to 5 mm/sec and resolve forces as small as 0.005 N.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The design of a robotic exoskeleton often focuses on replicating the kinematics of the human limb that it is connected to. However, human joint kinematics is so complex that in practice, the kinematics of artificial exoskeletons fails to reproduce it exactly. This discrepancy results in hyperstaticity. Namely, uncontrolled interaction forces appear. In this paper, we investigate the problem of connecting an exoskeleton to a human member while avoiding hyperstaticity; to do so, we propose to add passive mechanisms at each connection point. We thus introduce a formal methodology for avoiding hyperstaticity when connecting wearable robotic structures to the human body. First, analyzing the twist spaces generated by these fixation passive mechanisms, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a given global isostaticity condition to be respected. Then, we derive conditions on the number of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) to be freed at the different fixations, under full kinematic rank assumption. We finally apply the general methodology to the particular case of a 4 DoF shoulder-elbow exoskeleton. Experimental results allow to show an improvement in transparency brought by the passive mechanism fixations.",

The operational support in construction machinery filed requires the compatibility with different types of support and the commonality among various operator skill levels. The proposed framework is therefore organized into two functions: real-time task phase identification and time-series attentional condition identification. The task phase is defined by utilizing the joint load applied according to the environment constraint condition. The attentional condition is defined as one of the internal work-state condition classified by the necessity level of operational support, and is dependent on the vectorial or time-series date selected by the identified task phase. Experiments are conducted using the hydraulic dual arm system to perform transporting and removing tasks. Results show that the number of error contacts, internal force applied, and mental workload is decreased without time-consumption increase. The result confirmed that the proposed framework greatly contribute to improving each operator's work performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of acquiring a hierarchically structured robotic skill in a nonstationary environment. This is achieved through a combination of learning primitive strategies from observation of an expert, and autonomously synthesising composite strategies from that basis. Both aspects of this problem are approached from a game theoretic viewpoint, building on prior work in the area of multiplicative weights learning algorithms. The utility of this procedure is demonstrated through simulation experiments motivated by the problem of autonomous driving. We show that this procedure allows the agent to come to terms with two forms of uncertainty in the world - continually varying goals (due to oncoming traffic) and nonstationarity of optimisation criteria (e.g., driven by changing navigability of the road). We argue that this type of factored task specification and learning is a necessary ingredient for robust autonomous behaviour in a \u201clarge-world\u201d setting.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many architectures have been proposed to solve tightly-coupled multirobot tasks (MT) through coalitions of heterogeneous robots. However, several issues remain unaddressed. As coalitions are formed, sensor constraints among robots are also established. For example, in a leader-follower task, follower robots must keep leader robots within their sights, while in a box-pushing task, a supervisor robot needs to track the moving direction of the box and monitor the pushing path to the goal for obstacle avoidance. The question of how to keep these constraints satisfied during the entire execution, from initial configurations to completeness of the task, remains an open issue. In addition, environmental factors, both static and dynamic, can influence the maintenance of the constraints. Moreover, problems arise when the constraints are unsatisfiable given the current circumstances. For example, the sight of the leader might be blocked or there might be obstacles blocking the view of the box. This paper proposes a general method to address these issues for various applications with sensors having certain characteristics. Our approach combines the use of sensor models, environment sampling, measures of information quality, a motion model with sampling, and a constraint model. We believe that this approach offers the first generic formulation of robotic sensor constraints that can be applied to a wide variety of applications. To illustrate this method, we apply the approach to solve robot tracking and navigation tasks both in simulation and with physical robots. Experimental results illustrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach.",

The VTOL vehicle is assumed to be a rigid body, equipped with a minimum sensor suite (camera, IMU and barometric altimeter), manoeuvering over a textured rough terrain made of a concatenation of planar surfaces. Assuming that the forward velocity is separately regulated to a desired non-zero value, the proposed control approach ensures terrain following and guarantees the vehicle does not collide with obstacles during the task. The proposed control acquires an optical flow from multiple spatially separate observation points, typically obtained via multiple cameras or non collinear directions in a unique camera. The proposed control algorithm has been tested extensively in simulation and then implemented on a quadrotor UAV to demonstrate the performance of the closed loop system.",

This number is less than the dimension of most of existing globally convergent adaptive observers. Global asymptotic convergence of system state estimates to their true values is achieved under no persistency of excitation condition. Smoothness of the dynamics of the proposed observer allows its easy implementation in comparison with non-smooth observers.

Assuming that the workspace is mapped into a tree graph and the initial and final configurations of robots are known, the robots' shortest start-to-goal paths on the tree are calculated independently. Then, a new rule-based prioritization scheme is applied in two phases: (a) Path Prioritization, which determines which robot can directly move along its shortest path and which robot should deviate from it, and (b) Motion Prioritization, which decides the order of robots' sequential moves. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for minimizing the number of moves by adding extra vertices to the tree.",

        "abstract": "The application range of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is expanding along with performance upgrades. Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has the merits of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Tail-sitting is the simplest way for the VTOL maneuver since it does not need extra actuators. However, conventional hovering control for a tail-sitter UAV is not robust enough against large disturbance such as a blast of wind, a bird strike, and so on. It is experimentally observed that the conventional quaternion feedback hovering control often fails to keep stability when the control compensates large attitude errors. This paper proposes a novel hovering control strategy for a tail-sitter VTOL UAV that increases stability against large disturbance. In order to verify the proposed hovering control strategy, simulations and experiments on hovering of the UAV are performed giving large attitude errors. The results show that the proposed control strategy successfully compensates initial large attitude errors keeping stability, while the conventional quaternion feedback controller fails.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a hybrid SLAM system for marine environments that combines cubic splines to represent the trajectories of dynamic objects, point features to represent stationary objects and an occupancy grid to represent land masses. This hybrid representation enables SLAM to be applied in environments with moving objects, where solutions using point features alone are computationally prohibitive or where dense objects e.g. landmasses can not be represented correctly using point features. Estimation is achieved using a sliding window framework with reversible data-association and reversible model-selection. Our main contributions are: (i) a hybrid representation of the environment; (ii) occupancy grid fusion is continually refined for the duration of the sliding window; (iii) the trajectories of dynamic objects are represented using cubic splines and (iv) radar scans are re-rendered at a sub-scan resolution to compensate for the egomotion during the scan acquisition period. We show that the continual refinement of the occupancy grid greatly improves the quality of the resultant map, leading to a better estimate of the egomotion and therefore better estimates of the trajectories of dynamic objects. We also demonstrate that the use of cubic splines to represent trajectories has two major advantages: (i) the state space is compressed i.e. many vehicle poses can be represented using a single spline section and (ii) the trajectory becomes continuous and so fusing information from asynchronous sensors running at multiple frequencies becomes trivial. The efficacy of our system is demonstrated using real marine radar data, showing that it can successfully estimate the positions/velocities of objects and landmasses observed during a typical voyage on a small boat.",

The algorithm is able to recognize highly curved roads in cluttered color images quite often appearing in offroad scenarios. To cope with large curvatures we apply gaze control and model the road using two different clothoid segments. A Particle Filter incorporating edge and color intensity information is used to simultaneously detect and track the road farther away from the ego vehicle. In addition the particles are used to generate static road segment estimations in a given look ahead distance. These estimations are predicted with respect to ego motion and fused utilizing Kalman filter techniques to generate a smooth local clothoid segment for lateral control of the vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Noise generated due to the motion of a robot is not desired, because it deteriorates the quality and intelligibility of the sounds recorded by robot-embedded microphones. It must be reduced or cancelled to achieve automatic speech recognition with a high performance. In this work, we divide ego-motion noise problem into three subdomains of arm, leg and head motion noise, depending on their complexity and intensity levels. We investigate methods that make use of single-channel and multi-channel processing in order to suppress ego noise separately. For this purpose, a framework consisting of a microphone-array-based geometric source separation, a consequent post filtering process and a parallel module for template subtraction is used. Furthermore, a control mechanism is proposed, which is based on signal-to-noise ratio and instantaneously detected motions, to switch to the most suitable method to deal with the current type of noise. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a humanoid robot using automatic speech recognition (ASR). The preliminary results of isolated word recognition show the effectiveness of our methods by increasing the word correct rates up to 50% compared to the single channel recognition in arm and leg motion noises and up to 25% in very strong head motion noises.",

However cooperative navigation of AUVs has thus far been limited to a single AUV supported by a dedicated surface vehicle with access to GPS. In this paper a scalable and modular framework is presented in which any number of vehicles can broadcast, forward and acknowledge range, dead-reckoning, feature and GPS measurements so that the full fleet of AUVs can navigate and cooperate in a consistent and accurate manner. The approach is independent of the resultant application-such as recursive state estimation or full pose optimization. Trade-offs between the number of vehicles, the condition of the communication channel and rate at which updates are available are also discussed. Finally performance is illustrated in a realistic experiment.",

        "abstract": "It is frequently accepted in the manipulation literature that tactile sensing is needed to improve the precision of robot manipulation. However, there is no consensus on how this may be achieved. This paper applies particle filtering to the problem of localizing the pose and shape of an object that the robot touches. We are motivated by the situation where the robot has enclosed its fingers around an object but has not yet grasped it. This might be the case just prior to grasping or when the robot is holding on to something fixtured elsewhere in the environment. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new model for position measurements of points on the robot manipulator that tactile sensing indicates are touching the object. We also propose a model for points on the manipulator that tactile measurements indicate are not touching the object. Finally, we characterize the approach in simulation and use it to localize an object that Robonaut 2 holds in its hand.",

These single-cell studies require cells to be individually positioned at defined locations on a microdevice. This paper presents a micromanipulation system for automated pick-place of single cells. Integrating computer vision and motion control algorithms, the system visually tracks a cell in real time and controls multiple motion devices coordinately. Via fine manipulation of picoliter fluids and pressure of a few Pascals, the system accurately picks up a single cell, transfers the cell, and deposits it at a target location at a speed of 15-30 sec/cell. The micromanipulation system has the advantages of non-invasiveness, high specificity, and high precision. It is suitable to pick-place both non-labeled and labeled cells and applicable to standard cell culture substrates and microdevices with an open top.",

Two types of cylinders are tested, the standard double acting cylinder and the rodless one. A position/pressure difference (or force) strategy is developed and implemented. As the behavior of the nonlinear cylinders is nonlinear, a feedback linearization strategy is adopted. A Generalized Predictive Controller (GPC) is synthesized for the position outer loop and a constrained LMI based H\u221e controller is synthesized for the pressure inner loop. Experimental results show the feasibility of the control strategies and good performances in terms of robustness and dynamic tracking.",

        "abstract": "Continuum robots made from telescoping precurved elastic tubes enable base-mounted actuators to specify the curved shapes of robots as thin as standard surgical needles. While free space beam mechanics-based models of the shape of these `active cannulas' exist, current models cannot account for external forces and torques applied to the cannula by the environment. In this paper we apply geometrically exact beam theory to solve the statics problem for concentric-tube continuum robots. This yields the equivalent of forward kinematics for an active cannula with general tube precurvature functions and arbitrarily many tubes, under loading from a general wrench distribution. The model achieves average experimental tip errors of less than 3 mm over the workspace of a prototype active cannula subject to various tip forces.",

Both functions are needed, however, for mobile robots on extended missions when actuators and generators must be used together. In this paper, we present a unique piezoelectric cellular system that combines motion generation and energy harvesting capabilities into a single, scalable device. Each of the discrete cellular units provides linear, contractile motion at 10% strain using the converse piezoelectric effect. These units may also be back-driven from environmental loading and thereby generate energy using the direct piezoelectric effect. Furthermore, each cell has the capability to toggle between a low stiffness ON state and a high stiffness OFF state, which allows an assembly of individual cells to tune both their static stiffness and structural resonant frequencies online. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our device for tuning both locomotion speed and the harvested power of an underwater flapping fin system.",

        "abstract": "This video presents experiments conducted on our multi-vehicle environmental testbed. The first experiment is the prioritized multi-sensing behavior, which uses a magnetic and light source for the robots to take sensor measurements. During the experiment robots create a Voronoi partitioning based on their current positions, then optimize the probability of detection map (POD) to determine a point in their own Voronoi partition that has the highest probability of obtaining good sensor readings from a magnetic or light source. When a point by each robot is identified, the robots navigate to that goal point while avoiding collisions with obstacles in the environment as well as with other robots. As the robots navigate to the goal point sensor measurements are taken. When each robot has reached its destination, sensor measurement information as well as position information is exchanged. This is then repeated for 30 iterations and the resulting magnetic and light intensity maps are shown. The second experiment conducted is the adaptive decentralized nonholonomic sensor network algorithm. Initially the robot at the right corner is exposed to the greatest concentration of light. Light measurements are taken using four precision light sensors mounted on the aluminum plate. Every robot is moving to their estimated center of mass of its respective Voronoi cell. As they are using a difference equation approximation of the adaptive law we notice back and forth motion. This is due to the centers of mass variation at every calculation time. In another top view, we see the actual distribution of the robots and their Voronoi partitions related to the light concentration. This is approximately a centroidal Voronoi tesselation based on the estimate distribution function which is illustrated as well. The light distribution is changed by switching the light source concentration. At this point the robots change their estimate parameter vectors in order to excite the adaptation law by in...

        "abstract": "This paper presents part of an on-going project to design a wearable supportive device to enhance facial expressiveness, in particular for the facial paralyzed patients. Earlier we introduced the SMA actuator based Robot Mask that can be used to enhance the expressiveness of the face. The basic concept of that design was pulling of the skin through wires attached to the face and we explained the human anatomy based criteria of selecting these pulling points and directions. The major reason to use SMA instead of traditional actuators such as motors was their silent acting nature. However, their dynamic properties been governed by thermal energy and their mechanical properties been affected by the hysteresis due to their metallurgy, SMA based actuators tend not to perform too well under cooling. This paper introduces a novel controlling scenario that use the actuation of only a limited number of SMA wires out of the total connected in series on either sides of a slider to control the direction and amount of movement of the slider. The advantage of this method is by keeping some SMA wires at low temperatures it was possible to achieve a high speed of actuation even when the direction of motion was changed. This paper also investigates on the amount of actuation rates that are required to generate natural looking smiles and later attempts to recreate them using the proposed actuation unit.",

        "abstract": "Automation in outdoor applications (farming, surveillance, etc.) requires highly accurate control of mobile robots, at high speed, accounting for natural ground specificities (mainly sliding effects). In previous work, predictive control algorithms dedicated to All-Terrain Vehicle lateral stability was investigated. Satisfactory advanced simulation results have been reported but no experimental ones were presented. In this paper, the prevention of a real off-road mobile robot rollover is addressed. First, both rollover dynamic modeling and previous work on a Mixed observer designed to estimate on-line sliding phenomena for path tracking control are recalled. Then, this observer is here used to compute a rollover indicator accounting for sliding phenomena, from a low-cost perception system. Next, the maximum vehicle velocity, compatible with a safe motion over some horizon of prediction, is computed via Predictive Functional Control (PFC), and can then be applied, if needed, to the vehicle actuator to prevent from rollover. The capabilities of the proposed device are demonstrated and discussed thanks to real experimentation.",

This projection operator allows performing secondary tasks even when the main task is full rank. To ensure the convergence of the system, a switching strategy is then defined to switch from the new projection operator to the classical one before the norm of the total error reaches zero. An adaptive gain is also defined to slow down the convergence of the main task. It allows the secondary tasks to be active for longer. The experimental results obtained show the agreement with the analytical study and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed projection operator with respect to the classical one.",

The approach is to consider the sensor/robot interaction that links the sensor signal variations to the robot velocity. By on-line calibration, we mean only the actual measurements are used to perform calibration under the condition that the interaction matrix is analytically known. This allows us to propose a very simple and versatile formulation of sensor parameter calibration. Various sensors can be considered, and calibration from different sensory data may be considered within the same process. Intrinsic and extrinsic parameters estimation are formulated as a non-linear minimization problem the Jacobian of which can be expressed analytically from the sensor model. Simulations and experiments are presented for a camera observing four points, showing good results in the case of separated intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, and illustrating the possible limitations in the case of simultaneous estimation.",

Although various systems measuring cell stiffness have been proposed so far, they are slow for adaptively connecting to cell sorters capable of handling more than 1000 [cells/sec]. This paper proposes a new approach that can indirectly evaluate the cell stiffness by measuring the passing time for a narrow channel. When a cell passes through the channel, it receives a viscous force depending upon how much deformation is exerted on the cell. We show that the stiffness is a function of both the passing time and the initial diameter of cell. We also show that the stiffness is proportional to the passing time and inversely proportional to the initial diameter, under the assumption that the thickness of fluid film is inversely proportional to the normal force. The experimental validation is given together with the basic working principle.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We have developed several innovative designs for a new kind of robot that uses peristalsis for locomotion, the same method that earthworms use, and report on the first completed prototype (Fig. 1). This form of locomotion is particularly effective in constrained spaces, and although the motion has been understood for some time, it has rarely been effectively or accurately implemented in a robotic platform. We address some reasons for this, including some common misconceptions within the field. We present a technique using a braided mesh exterior to produce fluid waves of motion along the body of a worm-like robot. We also present a new analytical model of this motion and compare predicted robot velocity to a 2-D simulation. Unlike previous mathematical models of peristaltic motion, our model suggests that friction is not a limiting factor in robot speed, but only in acceleration. The concept is highly scalable, and we present methods of construction at two different scales.",

Such feedback provides the remote pilot with an intuitive feel of the robot's state and perceived local environment that will ensure simple and safe operation in cluttered 3D environments common in inspection and surveillance tasks. Our approach is based on energetic considerations and uses the concepts of network theory and port-Hamiltonian systems. We provide a general framework for addressing problems such as mapping the limited stroke of a `master' joystick to the infinite stroke of a `slave' vehicle, while preserving passivity of the closed-loop system in the face of potential time delays in communications links and limited sensor data.",

        "abstract": "Advanced robotics needs a new breed of actuators, capable to exhibit a large number of desirable features, ranging from high power/torque density, high efficiency, zero backlash and low noise, to low reflected mechanical impedance, high bandwidth and accuracy. Even if it is quite evident that to fully match these requirements new basic actuation principles have to be investigated and developed in the long term, there is still scope now for innovating the field by combining mature components into new actuation schemes. This paper reports the development and the experimental evaluation of a new actuator, aiming at improving the torque density and the mechanical efficiency. The device has shown impressive performances being able to exert up to 500Nm continuous torque and 800Nm peak torque with 85% mechanical efficiency and zero backlash, up to 60\u00b0/s maximum output speed for a total weight of just 6Kg, comprising the structural case covering the internal mechanics. The actuator has been expressly conceived as an actuation module to be integrated in a fully powered whole body exoskeleton intended for material handling in tight and unstructured environments (see Fig.1).",

Contrary to standard Stewart platforms, an industrial anthropomorphic manipulator offers a considerably larger motion envelope and higher dexterity that let envisage it as a viable and superior alternative. Our work is divided in two papers. In this Part I, we discuss the main challenges in adopting a serial manipulator as motion platform, and thoroughly analyze one key issue: the design of a suitable inverse kinematics scheme for online motion reproduction. Experimental results are proposed to analyze the effectiveness of our approach. Part II [1] will address the design of a motion cueing algorithm tailored to the robot kinematics, and will provide an experimental evaluation on the chosen scenario: closed-loop simulation of a Formula 1 racing car.",

To overcome the matching ambiguity of single line segments, intersecting line pairs in 2D images are utilized for line matching. Coplanarity of the intersecting line pairs and their corresponding intersection context discriminate true intersecting line pairs from false intersecting ones in 3D world. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method can match line segments and estimate camera geometry simultaneously not knowing camera geometry in advance or not considering topological relations of all line segments. Comparison studies and experimental results prove the accuracy and speed of the proposed method in real world situations.",

This approach presents several advantages over existing techniques, such as the ability of computing multiple minimum-exposure paths online, while avoiding mutual collisions, as well as collisions with obstacles sensed during the motion. Other important advantages include the ability of utilizing heterogenous sensor models, and of meeting multiple objectives, such as minimizing power required, and reaching a set of goal configurations.

Spherical omnidirectional mechanisms allow isotropic motion, although many are limited from achieving true isotropic motion by practical mechanical design considerations. The mechanism presented in this paper uses a single motor to drive a point on the great circle of the sphere parallel to the ground plane, and does not require a gearbox. Three mechanisms located 120\u00b0 apart provide a stable drive platform for a mobile robot. Results show the omnidirectional ability of the robot and demonstrate the performance of the spherical mechanism compared to a popular commercial omnidirectional wheel over edges of varying heights and gaps of varying widths.",

        "abstract": "We consider the task of accurately controlling a complex system, such as autonomously sliding a car sideways into a parking spot. Although certain regions of this domain are extremely hard to model (i.e., the dynamics of the car while skidding), we observe that in practice such systems are often remarkably deterministic over short periods of time, even in difficult-to-model regions. Motivated by this intuition, we develop a probabilistic method for combining closed-loop control in the well-modeled regions and open-loop control in the difficult-to-model regions. In particular, we show that by combining 1) an inaccurate model of the system and 2) a demonstration of the desired behavior, our approach can accurately and robustly control highly challenging systems, without the need to explicitly model the dynamics in the most complex regions and without the need to hand-tune the switching control law. We apply our approach to the task of autonomous sideways sliding into a parking spot, and show that we can repeatedly and accurately control the system, placing the car within about 2 feet of the desired location; to the best of our knowledge, this represents the state of the art in terms of accurately controlling a vehicle in such a maneuver.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method whereby an autonomous mobile robot can search for a 3-dimensional (3D) object using an on-board stereo camera sensor mounted on a pan-tilt head. Search efficiency is realized by the combination of a coarse-scale global search coupled with a fine-scale local search. A grid-based probability map is initially generated using the coarse search, which is based on the color histogram of the desired object. Peaks in the probability map are visited in sequence, where a local (refined) search method based on 3D SIFT features is applied to establish or reject the existence of the desired object, and to update the probability map using Bayesian recursion methods. Once found, the 6D object pose is also estimated. Obstacle avoidance during search can be naturally integrated into the method. Experimental results obtained from the use of this method on a mobile robot are presented to illustrate and validate the approach, confirming that the search strategy can be carried out with modest computation.",

The approach implements a novel potential function generated from a probability density function (PDF) parameterized by an adaptive Gaussian mixture that is optimized to meet network-level objectives, such as cooperative track detection. The PDF represents the goal density that would be obtained by sampling a statistically-significant number of sensors from the mixture. However, since a smaller number of sensors may be deployed, and each sensor is represented by a disk, the potential function is generated by multiplying the PDF by a likelihood update model that produces networks with disjoint fields-of-view. The approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving ocean sensor networks deployed in a region of interest near the New Jersey coast.",

        "abstract": "Kinodynamic planning algorithms like Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees (RRTs) hold the promise of finding feasible trajectories for rich dynamical systems with complex, nonconvex constraints. In practice, these algorithms perform very well on configuration space planning, but struggle to grow efficiently in systems with dynamics or differential constraints. This is due in part to the fact that the conventional distance metric, Euclidean distance, does not take into account system dynamics and constraints when identifying which node in the existing tree is capable of producing children closest to a given point in state space. We show that an affine quadratic regulator (AQR) design can be used to approximate the exact minimum-time distance pseudometric at a reasonable computational cost. We demonstrate improved exploration of the state spaces of the double integrator and simple pendulum when using this pseudometric within the RRT framework, but this improvement drops off as systems' nonlinearity and complexity increase. Future work includes exploring methods for approximating the exact minimum-time distance pseudometric that can reason about dynamics with higher-order terms.",

The structure classification efficiently labels substantial amount of non-relevant image regions and guides the further computationally expensive process to focus on relatively small image parts; (ii)We improve the appearance-based classifiers based on HoG descriptors by performing template matching with 2D human shape contour fragments that results in improved localization and accuracy; (iii) We build a suite of classifiers tuned to specific distance ranges for optimized system performance. Our method is evaluated on publicly available datasets and is shown to match or exceed the performance of leading pedestrian detectors in terms of accuracy as well as achieving real-time computation (10 Hz), which makes it adequate for in-vehicle navigation platform.",

Our approach is inspired by recent results due to Vladimirsky in which path planning on time-varying maps is addressed using a new level-set approach, and for which computational costs are remarkably low. Toward practical implementation of these results for path planning in unstructured environments, we develop a receding-horizon formulation in which path planning for moving and static obstacles is addressed locally, while path planning for static obstacles is addressed globally. This formulation reduces the overall computational burden of path planning and makes it suitable for very large domains. The result is a suboptimal receding horizon planner and a matching condition that connects local planning with global planning. We present a rigorous analysis from which convergence to a desired endpoint is guaranteed.",

        "abstract": "This article presents the design of Iromec, a modular robot companion tailored towards engaging in social exchanges with children with different disabilities with the aim to empower them to discover a wide rage of play styles from solitary to social and cooperative play. In particular this paper focuses on the user-centred design approach taken to develop a robot able to engage in meaningful interaction with different typologies of disable children - Autistic children, Moderate Mentally Retarded children and Severe Motor Impaired children. Modularity and configurability contribute to the flexibility of the system in creating rewarding games that can be easily understood by the child and can promote fun and learning. Other key features of the system are the combination of autonomous and user-controlled behaviour and a strong emphasis on identity and expressiveness that can be dynamically adapted during play. A main contribution of this work is the lessons learned in applying a user-centred perspective in designing the robot: from user requirements to concept design, from the initial prototype evaluation to the redesign and the final testing.",

A two degree of freedom robotic interface allows coordinated motions of the forearm and the hand (pronation/supination and grasp/release, respectively). It is driven by two novel Electro-Rheological Fluid based hydraulic actuators. Tests were conducted to characterize these actuators, and feed-forward controllers were developed for their force/torque control.

The thermorheological properties of Pluronic\u00ae are used to implement flow routing for controlling the assembly process. This is the first use of thermorheological valving in three dimensions. A novel reversible module connection mechanism using a low melting point alloy which is soldered in a fluid environment is presented.

        "abstract": "As robots and humans move towards sharing the same environment, the need for safety in robotic systems is of growing importance. Towards this goal of human-friendly robotics, a robust, low-cost, low-noise capacitive force sensing array is presented with application as a whole body artificial skin covering. This highly scalable design provides excellent noise immunity, low-hysteresis, and has the potential to be made flexible and formable. Noise immunity is accomplished through the use of shielding and local sensor processing. A small and low-cost multivibrator circuit is replicated locally at each taxel, minimizing stray capacitance and noise coupling. Each circuit has a digital pulse train output, which allows robust signal transmission in noisy electrical environments. Wire count is minimized through serial or row-column addressing schemes, and the use of an open-drain output on each taxel allows hundreds of sensors to require only a single output wire. With a small set of interface wires, large arrays can be scanned hundreds of times per second and dynamic response remains flat over a broad frequency range. Sensor performance is evaluated on a bench-top version of a 4 \u00d7 4 taxel array in quasi-static and dynamic cases.",

The proposed model builds on the empirical observation that trails are usually conspicuous structures in natural environments. This hypothesis is confirmed by the experimental results, where a strong positive correlation between trail location and visual saliency has been observed. These results are due in part to the proposed extensions to a well known visual saliency computational model. This paper goes further and shows that, with a proper analysis of the saliency information alone, the ambiguity regarding both trail's position and approximate skeleton is reduced to three hypotheses in 98% of the tested natural images. This analysis is performed by a set of agents inhabiting the saliency and feature specific intermediate maps. These agents' behaviours exploit implicit, top-down knowledge about the object being sought in an active way. With the proposed model, computationally demanding accurate trail detectors are able to focus their activity in a fraction of the input image, thus promoting robustness and real-time performance.",

Previous work has shown that visual saliency and voting mechanisms are extremely effective in tackling these issues. This paper proposes a set of extensions to these mechanisms, to further improve the detector's speed-accuracy trade-off as well as its robustness. The observed enhancements are due in part to the adaptive way saliency is accounted for by the detector during the image scanning procedure. Additionally, detector's positive results are in turn used to boost the saliency map itself, thus reinforcing the analysis of relevant regions of the image. To enable detection in highly roughed terrain, the detector's invariance to the robot's posture is also enhanced. Experimental results show that, with the extended detector, denominated of ESalOD, higher levels of robustness, accuracy and computational efficiency are attained.",

        "abstract": "It is a great challenge to perform robust tracking for a mobile robot owing to dynamic environments. Also, fast motion or abrupt jerk of the robotic camera poses a severe threat for continuous tracking. To address these problems, a novel attention model is proposed motivated by human attention mechanism which consists of low level salient feature and high level scene semantics. The low level layer extracts color and motion feature to obtain combined feature probability map. In semantic level, the ADM(attention distribution map) is computed by applying an attenuation function on the combined feature map which is motivated by human's foveal vision. The object position is found using CAMSHIFT algorithm in ADM. And this layer also generates a region-based SSG(scene semantics graph). When robot moves abnormally, the model detects candidate regions in color saliency map and then attention shifts from one region to the next and check it by elastically matching SSG until the target is recovered. Experiments in several kinds of environments give promising results and show that this model is robust for mobile robotic tracking. When camera moves steadily, a little fast or even jerks very abruptly, it can keep continuous tracking.",

        "abstract": "Navigating through unknown outdoor environments requires a robot to be able to see and model the far field terrain. In recent years this problem of seeing beyond reliable stereo readings into the far field has gained attention. Many proposed solutions involve using near field obstacle and ground plane regions labeled using stereo, to learn models which classify far field image regions. In this work we offer an alternative which exploits coherent image regions as determined by image segmentation to propagate obstacle and ground labels from the near and mid field to the image far field. Rather than relying on local features to classify individual pixels we model and compare appearance across the whole segment. New labels are determined by proximity in both image space and appearance space. Since both traversable and non-traversable surfaces can vary in appearance across the image, our approach has the advantage that each labeled segment acts as a distinct appearance model, which allows us to label similar neighbours. We evaluate our system using a publicly available dataset and compare its performance to a typical learning-based near-to-far labeling scheme.",

        "abstract": "We describe a simple and intuitive policy gradient method for improving parametrized quadrocopter multi-flips by combining iterative experiments with information from a first-principles model. We start by formulating an N-flip maneuver as a five-step primitive with five adjustable parameters. Optimization using a low-order first-principles 2D vertical plane model of the quadrocopter yields an initial set of parameters and a corrective matrix. The maneuver is then repeatedly performed with the vehicle. At each iteration the state error at the end of the primitive is used to update the maneuver parameters via a gradient adjustment. The method is demonstrated at the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena testbed on quadrotor helicopters performing and improving on flips, double flips and triple flips.",

The proposed approach integrates sampling-based motion planning in continuous parametric spaces with discrete search over skill choices, selecting the search strategy according to the functional type of each skill being coordinated. As a result, the planner is able to sequence arbitrary motion skills (such as reaching, balance adjustment, stepping, etc) in order to achieve complex motions needed for solving humanoid reaching tasks in realistic environments. The proposed framework is applied to the HOAP-3 humanoid robot and several results are presented.",

This is denoted obstacle-aided locomotion and requires the snake robot to have two features: 1) a smooth exterior surface combined with 2) a contact force sensing system. These two features are characteristic of biological snakes, but have received limited attention in snake robot designs so far. This paper describes the development of a new snake robot aimed at meeting both these requirements. The paper details the design and implementation of the snake robot, presents experimental results that validate the function of the contact force measurement system, and demonstrates some of the motion capabilities of the robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many surveillance and reconnaissance tasks make use of multi-cameras in order to ensure that a particular mission is accomplished. These networks of cameras are useful as they can reduce the cost of human observers, are continuously observant (unlike humans who may fall asleep on the job), and can be implemented for a fairly low cost. However, in many scenarios, it does not make sense or may not be possible to have a fixed camera installation because the surveillance may only be needed for a short duration or it may take too long to do a proper install and observation is needed now. In terms of short terms and immediacy, mobile robots acting as a camera network provide an interesting middle ground. They can be deployed quickly to cover immediate needs, and they can be packed up and moved to another area if needs change. However, as the duration of the mission in which they are used increases, the robotic team will run out of power. This paper addresses some of the issues with keeping a surveillance team active while their batteries drain. Multiple task-reallocation methods are used in conjunction with an analysis of the effects of fixed vs mobile docking stations. Simulations were run requiring the team to provide camera coverage of a group of mobile \u201cpedestrians\u201d moving dynamically through a scene and the results are presented.",

The wearer of the wearable behavior navigation system will be able to conduct first aid treatment as an expert would. We have developed the wearable behavior navigation systems using Augmented Reality technology, mainly for the navigation of the first aid treatment and for escape from dangerous areas, such as a building on fire. The effectiveness of the wearable navigation systems has been evaluated by a number of experiments. In this paper, the basic mechanism to realize general human behavior navigation is presented, along with the concrete configuration of the prototype of the navigation systems, and the experimental evaluation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel switching controller is proposed for a networked visual servo control system with varying feedback delay due to image processing and data transmission. The varying image processing delay caused by the varying number of extracted features for pose estimation due to different view angles, illumination conditions and noise, is modeled by its occurrence probability. The time delay due to transmission over the communication network is also modeled as random process. By using a sampled-data system approach and an input-delay approach, the linearized visual servo control system is reformulated into a stochastic continuous-time system with time-varying delay. A novel stability condition and associated switching controller are derived based on the occurrence probabilities of delays. Experiments on a 1-DoF linear module equipped with a camera are conducted to validate the proposed approach. A non-switching controller approach is implemented for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement of the proposed control approach.",

        "abstract": "Insects rely on sensory cues-tactile, hygrometric, thermal, olfactory-gathered with a pair of head-mounted antennae to perform a wide variety of sensory guided tasks. Many questions regarding the potential impact of specific mechanical design features on antennal performance can be directly and thoroughly assessed using an artificial robotic model of an antenna. Here we describe a highly tunable, modular tactile robotic model antenna and experimentally test its tactile sensing performance using a custom testbed. Exploratory experiments demonstrate the importance mechanical \u201ctuning\u201d on tactile navigation performance. With this model robotic antenna, numerous mechanosensory manipulations are possible, providing a new experimental platform for future testing of specific biological hypotheses.",

        "abstract": "This is the first study of a real physical kneed bipedal robot that exhibits passive dynamic running (PDR). Passive dynamic walking (PDW), which has its roots in the pioneering research of McGeer, intrinsically offers not only nonlinear phenomena such as the pull-in effect and period-doubling bifurcation, but also offers an extremely interesting phenomenon that facilitates the engineering of a highly efficient walking robot. In recent years, a wide variety of verification experiments in PDW were performed using actual devices. In contrast, however, very few studies addressed PDR. In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional real physical passive dynamic running biped with knees. The device stands 400 mm tall and weights 4.8 kg. By carefully designing the properties of the elastic elements implemented into the hip joints and the stance legs in the present device, we achieved stable passive dynamic running of 36 steps. The device runs at about 0.83 m/s down a 0.22 rad slope. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first report of such a performance. This result is expected to prove useful not only for designing human-like natural and efficient bipedal robots, but also for understanding the principles underlying bipedal locomotion.",

The realization of this unit aims to facilitate the control of compliant robotic joints by providing physical variable damping on demand assisting on the regulation of the oscillations induced by the introduction of compliance. The mechatronics details and the dynamic model of the damper are introduced. The proposed variable damper mechanism is evaluated on a simple 1-DOF compliant joint linked to the ground through a torsion spring. This flexible connection emulates a compliant joint, generating oscillations when the link is perturbed. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of replicating simulated relative damping values with good fidelity.",

In this paper we describe a new method to reconstruct the vibration using sinusoidal regression. This change makes the overall scheme more efficient since it enables the estimation of the tip oscillation whatever its origin may be. Both an exact solution and a simplified method are proposed to solve the regression problem. To limit the trade-off between good tracking capability and quality of the vibration reconstruction, these regression algorithms are performed over a variable-length sliding window. Consequently this paper also describes the change detection scheme used to automatically adjust the window length. Experimental results validate the proposed method.",

The objective of the proposed control methodology is to provide a human operator the capability to move the vehicle without loosing the target from the vision system's field of view. On-line estimation of the vehicle states is achieved by fusing data from a Laser Vision System (LVS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) using an asynchronous Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). A controller designed at the kinematic level, is backstepped into the dynamics of the system, maintaining its analytical stability guarantees. It is shown that the under-actuated degree of freedom is input-to-state stable and an energy based shaping of the user input with stability guarantees is implemented. The resulting control scheme has analytically guaranteed stability and convergence properties, while its applicability and performance are experimentally verified using a small Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in a test tank.",

        "abstract": "This article presents advances in optimal experiment design, which are intended to improve the parameter identification of nonlinear state space models. Instead of using a sequence of samples from one or just a few coherent sequences, the idea of identifying nonlinear dynamic models at distinct points in the state space is considered. In this way, the placement of the experiment points is fully flexible with respect to the set of reachable points. Also, a method for model-based generation of prediction errors is proposed, which is used to compute an a-priori estimate of the sample covariance of the prediction error. This covariance matrix may be used to approximate the Fisher information matrix a-priori. The availability of the Fisher matrix a-priori is a prerequisite for experiment optimization with respect to covariance in the parameter estimates. This work is driven by the problem of parameter identification of hydraulic models. There are methods for hydraulic systems regarding the estimation of parameters from experimental data, but the choice of experiments has not been treated adequately yet. A hydraulic servo system actuating a stewart platform serves as an illustrative example to which the methods above are applied.",

Instead of explicitly controlling the relative positions between the robots and the environment, we construct a lower-dimensional abstraction of the group that establishes a boundary for the group. We then synthesize feedback controllers that allow the abstracted group to navigate a two-dimensional environment to a desired goal position, while automatically adapting the shape of the boundary as well as the position and orientation of the group to avoid collisions between the virtual boundary and the environment. In contrast to previous approaches, we address the planning and control problems concurrently and are naturally able to establish bounds on the positions of the robots through the abstraction. The complexity of the method is independent of the number of robots which promises scalability to large teams.",

        "abstract": "An estimation algorithm is developed for determining pitch and roll angles (tilt) of a rigid body fixed at a pivot point using multiple accelerometers. The estimate is independent of the rigid body dynamics; the method is applicable both in static conditions and for any dynamic motion of the body. No dynamic model is required for the estimator; only the mounting positions of the sensors need to be known. The proposed estimator is the optimal linear estimate in a least-squares sense if knowledge of the system dynamics is not used. The estimate may be used as a basis for further filtering and fusion techniques, such as sensor fusion with rate gyro data. The estimation algorithm is applied to the problem of state estimation for the Balancing Cube, a rigid structure that can actively balance on its corners. Experimental results are provided.",

This method dramatically increases the accuracy and repeatability of the readings compared with traditional methods. These improvements will allow the common use of piezoresistive sensors in robotic applications, where only expensive and sophisticated force sensors such as load cells are currently used. We also present a sketch of a haptic interface under development, consisting of a data glove in which these force sensors are integrated. This interface is intended to control an Intelligent Assist Device by measuring operator-applied forces to the load. The new method proposed for measuring forces in piezoresistive sensors consists of reading conductance and capacitance by applying DC and sinusoidal waveforms to the sensors, thereby allow us to determine a multivariable estimation of force, instead of using the traditional, purely resistive model that has been used up to now.",

It encompasses the implementation of an electroencephalograph (EEG), as well as the development of all computational methods and necessary techniques to identify mental activities. The developed brain computer interface (BCI) is applied to activate the movements of a 120lb mobile robot, associating four different mental activities to robot commands. The interface is based on EEG signal analyses, which extract features that can be classified as specific mental activities. First, a signal preprocessing is performed from the EEG data, filtering noise, using a spatial filter to increase the scalp signal resolution, and extracting relevant features. Then, different classifier models are proposed, evaluated and compared. At last, two implementations of the developed classifiers are proposed to improve the rate of successful commands to the mobile robot. In one of the implementations, a 91% average hit rate is obtained, with only 1.25% wrong commands after 400 attempts to control the mobile robot.",

By utilizing a four-element model for approximating the dynamic characteristics of object's deformation, we drive the deformation decomposition into the elastic response and the plastic one. For shaping the object, we then propose a two-phase strategy for controlling the resultant deformation; in the first phase the viscoelastic parameters are estimated with avoiding the over deformation, based on the elastic response; in the second phase the desired resultant deformation is generated by actively managing the integral force, based on the plastic response. This strategy has an advance that the handling time of the robot is given by a finite time, while the desired resultant deformation is theoretically completed in the infinite time. We finally show experimental results for confirming the validity of the proposed strategy.",

The setup consists of a tank filled with sand and water, plastic models of bivalve shells capable of expelling water and an external actuation mechanism simulating the rocking burrowing motion typically used by these animals. The realistic shell shapes have been realized using three-dimensional plotting techniques allowing testing influences of different shell shapes and surface structures (sculptures) on the burrowing efficiency. Based on the experimental setup, the burrowing process has been reproduced. The results show that this setup can be used to identify correlations in the burrowing process. Further experimental work will investigate the influence of factors such as shell shape and sculpture or the motion sequence on the burrowing performance.",

        "abstract": "We present adaptive admittance control of a robotic manipulator, with uncertain dynamic parameters, operating in a constrained task space. To provide compliance to external forces, we generate a differentiable reference trajectory that remains in the constrained task space. Then, adaptive backstepping control, based on a time-varying asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF), is designed to achieve tracking of the reference trajectory while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. The improved BLF-based control renders the entire constrained task space positively invariant. Despite transient perturbations by external forces and online parameter adaptation, practical tracking of the reference trajectory is achieved without transgression of the constrained task space. In the absence of interaction forces, asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Ignoring actuator dynamics in control of rigid manipulators can in practice result in performance degradation or loss of system stability. However, consideration of actuator dynamics usually requires measurement of robot joint torques. This paper addresses motion tracking control of an n-DOF rigid robot by taking into account its actuator dynamics. Joint torque measurement is avoided by using an adaptive observer. The backstepping technique is adopted to develop a dynamically smooth adaptive nonlinear controller dealing with uncertainties in manipulator and actuator dynamics. Semi-global convergence of motion tracking errors as well as torque estimation error are proven without any persistency of excitation condition. Simulation examples demonstrate low noise sensitivity of the proposed method in comparison with those using torque measurement.",

While doing so, it still maintains some desired average velocity. Our approach includes closed-loop estimation of the parameters of the fading, which may change when moving between rooms. We prove stability of the feedback system and illustrate its behavior through simulations. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to errors in the channel model.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot systems researchers have been investigating adaptive coordination methods for improving spatial coordination in teams. Such methods adapt the coordination method to the dynamic changes in density of the robots. Unfortunately, while their empirical success is evident, none of these methods has been understood in the context of existing formal work on multi-robot learning. This paper presents a reinforcement-learning approach to coordination algorithm selection, which is not only shown to work well in experiments, but is also analytically grounded. We present a reward function (Effectiveness Index, EI), that reduces time and resources spent coordinating, and maximizes the time between conflicts that require coordination. It does this by measuring the resource-spending velocity. We empirically show its success in simulations of multi-robot foraging. In addition, we analytically explore the reasons that EI works well. We show that under some assumptions, spatial coordination opportunities can be modeled as matrix games in which the payoffs are directly a function of EI estimates. The use of reinforcement learning leads to robots maximizing their EI rewards in equilibrium. This work is a step towards bridging the gap between the theoretical study of interactions, and their use in multi-robot coordination.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents analysis and results for a small and agile wall climbing robot's ability to regain lost adhesion due to degradation of dry fibrillar adhesives. To regain the lost adhesion, two feet are set to the surface and the robot performs a rocking motion on the side where the adhesion has dropped below a safety threshold. The rocking motion applies normal forces to preload the front and rear feet without letting the other foot detach from the surface by alternating the direction of the motor and only allowing small rotation of the leg. Experimental results show that the rocking motion is successful in regaining lost adhesion while using dry fibrillar adhesives on a smooth, vertical acrylic surface. The performance of the fibers over time limits the adhesion that can possibly be mechanically regained and as a result the fibers are over-designed, which gives rise to the need for a power efficient peeling mechanism. The peeling mechanism uses a conditionally locked ankle, implemented with magnets, and a slot to allow the axle to change a pulling force normal to the surface to be a pulling force perpendicular to the surface, which peels the fibers using the uneven loading. Experimental results illustrate that a passive peeling mechanism is successful in reducing the required power to peel. The presented advancements can be applied to other climbing robots using adhesives to allow for safer, more efficient climbing.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a prominent feature for autonomous robots operating in undefined environments. Applications areas such as consumer robotics appliances would clearly benefit from low-cost and compact SLAM implementations. The SLAM research community has developed several robust algorithms in the course of the last two decades. However, until now most SLAM demonstrators have relied on expensive sensors or large processing power, limiting their realms of application. Several works have explored optimizations into various directions; however none has presented a global optimization from the mechatronic to the algorithmic level. In this article, we present a solution to the SLAM problem based on the co-design of a slim rotating distance scanner, a lightweight SLAM software, and an optimization methodology. The scanner consists of a set of infrared distance sensors mounted on a contactless rotating platform. The SLAM algorithm is an adaptation of FastSLAM 2.0 that runs in real time on a miniature robot. The optimization methodology finds the parameters of the SLAM algorithm using an evolution strategy. This work demonstrates that an inexpensive sensor coupled with a low-speed processor are good enough to perform SLAM in simple environments in real time.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous man-portable robots have the potential to provide a wide range of new capabilities for both military and civilian applications. Previous research in autonomy for small robots has focused on vision, LIDAR, and sonar sensors. While vision and LIDAR work well in clear weather, they are seriously impaired by rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Sonar can penetrate adverse weather, but has limited range outdoors, and suffers from specular reflections indoors. For the Daredevil Project, we have investigated the use of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar to provide obstacle detection capabilities for man-portable robots. Our research shows that UWB radar can effectively penetrate adverse weather, including dense fog, and detect obstacles that would be undetectable by vision or LIDAR under the same conditions. We have developed filtering algorithms that process the raw radar returns to eliminate reflections from ground clutter and make obstacles easier to detect. We have tested this system on an iRobot PackBot equipped with both UWB radar and LIDAR, and we have demonstrated how UWB radar can be used for obstacle detection in obscured environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Path planning is an optimization process in which a path between two points is to be found that results in a user-defined optimum satisfaction of a given set of requirements. For small scale path planning, exact algorithms such as linear programming and dynamic programming are usually adopted which are able to give optimum solutions in short time. However, due to their memory intensive nature and computational complexity, exact algorithms are not applicable for medium to large scale path planning. Meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms can provide sub-optimum solution without the full understanding of the search space and are widely used in large-scaled path planning. However, extra precautions are needed to avoid meta-heuristic algorithms from being trapped in local optimum points. In this paper, a path planner combining genetic algorithms (GA) with dynamic programming (DP) is proposed to solve an autonomous under-water vehicles (AUVs) path planning problem. The proposed path planner inherits the speed of exact algorithms and the scalable nature of meta-heuristic algorithms. Simulation results show that when comparing with conventional GA-based path planners, the proposed path planner can greatly improve the convergence rate and solution quality.",

The hypothesis motivating this work is that closed loop feedback based on short range but non-contact measurements can improve the reliability of manipulation. This paper presents a grasping system that is guided at short range by Electric Field (EF) Pretouch. We describe two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments involves human-to-robot and robot-to-human handoff, including the use of EF Pretouch to detect whether or not a human is also touching an object that the robot is holding, which we call the \u201cco-manipulation state.\u201d In the second set of experiments, the robot picks up standalone objects. We describe a number of techniques that servo the arm and fingers in order to both collect relevant geometrical information, and to actually perform the manipulation task.",

        "abstract": "In many robotics applications, knowing the material properties around a robot is often critical for the robot's successful performance. For example, in mobility, knowledge about the ground surface may determine the success of a robot's gait. In manipulation, the physical properties of an object may dictate the results of a grasping strategy. Thus, a reliable surface identification system would be invaluable for these applications. This paper presents an Inertia-Based Surface Identification System (ISIS) based on accelerometer sensor data. Using this system, a robot actively \u201cknocks\u201d on a surface with an accelerometer-equipped device (e.g., hand or leg), collects the accelerometer data in real-time, and then analyzes and extracts three critical physical properties, the hardness, the elasticity, and the stiffness, of the surface. A lookup table and k-nearest neighbors techniques are used to classify the surface material based on a database of previously known materials. This technique is low-cost and efficient in computation. It has been implemented on the modular and self-reconfigurable SuperBot and has achieved high accuracy (95% and 85%) in several identification experiments with real-world material.",

To determine the statistical constraints a Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted to demonstration trajectories. These demonstrations are recorded through kinesthetic teaching of a redundant manipulator. The GMM models the likelihood of configurations given time. The planner is based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree search with the search tree kept within the statistical model. Collision avoidance is included by not allowing the tree to grow into obstacles. The system is designed to act as a backup for a faster reactive planner that may fall into a local minimum. To illustrate its performance an experiment is conducted where the system is taught to open a Pelican case using a Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM). During reproduction an obstacle is placed nearby the case to partially obstruct the manipulator. The planner successfully avoided this obstacle without drifting from the trend in the demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "Despite its appealing concept, a systematic way of designing autonomous decentralized control system is still lacking. In order to alleviate this, we have so far proposed a design scheme for local sensory feedback control leading to adaptive behaviors from the entire system, based on a so-called discrepancy function that extracts the discrepancies between body (i.e., mechanical system), brain (i.e., control system) and environments. This paper intensively investigates the validity of this design scheme under the real world constraints by taking a two-dimensional serpentine robot exhibiting undulatory slithering locomotion as a practical example. The experimental results show that the robot exhibits adaptive behavior against environmental changes as well as the robustness against malfunctions of body segments due to the local sensory feedback control. The results obtained are expected to shed a new light on methodology for autonomous decentralized control system.",

        "abstract": "During the past decade, Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and its variants are shown to be powerful sampling based single query path planning approaches for robots in high-dimensional configuration space. However, the performance of such tree-based planners that rely on uniform sampling strategy degrades significantly when narrow passages are contained in the configuration space. Given the assumption that computation resources should be allocated in proportion the geometric complexity of local region, we present a novel single-query Multi-RRTs path planning framework that employs an improved Bridge Test algorithm to identify global important roadmaps in narrow passages. Multiple trees can grown from these sampled roadmaps to explore sub-regions which are difficult to reach. The probability of selecting one particular tree for expansion and connection, which can dynamically updated by on-line learning algorithm based on the historic results of exploration, guides the tree through narrow passage rapidly. Experimental results show that the proposed approach gives substantial improvement in planning efficiency over a wide range of single-query path planning problems.",

However, in practice, the control performance of this framework is significantly degraded in the presence of model uncertainties and discretizing effects. Using the singular perturbation theory, this paper shows that the same model uncertainties can create different effects on the task space and joint space control performance. From the analysis, a multi-rate operational space control was proposed to minimize the effects of model uncertainties on the control performance and while maintaining the advantages of the original operational space framework.

Control of the center of buoyancy is accomplished using movable float blocks. The attitude control system is useful to control the pitch angle of UVMSs to enhance their performance and to improve their efficiency of underwater operations. A UVMS that has two 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulators was developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attitude control system. This paper presents a numerical study and some experimental results obtained using the UVMS with the attitude control system. We experimentally confirmed that the proposed system can change the pitch angle of the vehicle between -120 and +105 deg. In another experiment, attitude-maintenance control was conducted. Results show that the proposed system can maintain the vehicle's horizontal attitude during motion of the manipulators.",

The approach presented in the video is a complete automatic registration of all needed devices for robotic guided CO2 bone processing. The system consists of an optical tracking system, a lightweight robot and a scan head. While a standard point to point transformation for the transformation between optical tracking system and robot is inadequate, a special registration algorithm was developed and therefore is used. This allows an automatic registration by moving the robot to different positions and storing the position of a body attached to the robot TCP. The scan head is registered to the optical tracking system or to the robot using a camera that tracks the prototype laser. Only the patient must be registered manually. The result is that the robot moves to the target position on the bone defined inside the segmented 3D CT dataset. With the known registration between robot and tracking system the robot can also be controlled via visual servoing.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an autonomous self-replicating robot consisting of four low-complexity modules. The entire system is composed of a parent robot, four unassembled modules provided as resources, and an environment where the self-replication takes place. The parent robot grows itself by attaching the resource modules onto itself until it doubles its physical size, and then splits in the middle thereby returning the parent to its original state and producing a daughter robot. We call these processes expansion and separation, respectively. The environment plays a passive role as a catalyst that helps generating a spiral trajectory for the parent robot and does not hold any information about the resource modules. To assess the physical changes made by self-replication, structural and informational complexities associated with the robotic system and the self-replication process are quantified and compared to previous prototypes.",

        "abstract": "On-line, efficient perception based on sensing is essential for an autonomous robot to operate in an unknown and unpredictable environment. An efficient on-line algorithm is introduced to determine whether a robot at a future time t and a configuration q will be guaranteed collision-free, directly from real-world sensor data of the robot's environment at the current time \u03c4, using stereo vision sensor. Such a problem can be formulated [1] as checking the intersection between the so-called dynamic envelope, which relates to the robot at a configuration-time (CT) point (q; t) and the current sensing time \u03c4, and the atomic obstacles, which are obtained directly from low-level sensory data at \u03c4. The algorithm achieves real-time efficiency, as confirmed by the experimental results, by classifying the atomic obstacles possibly intersecting the dynamic envelope and by grouping relevant atomic obstacles on the fly. It is suitable to be used on-line by sensing-based motion planners.",

        "abstract": "An efficient planning algorithm for the hexagonal metamorphic self-reconfiguring system (SRS) is presented. Empirically, the algorithm achieves an time complexity of O(n) averaged over random problem instances. The planning algorithm is capable of solving approximately 97% of planning tasks in the general state space of configurations containing less than 20,000 units. The state space is divided into two classes according to planning efficiency. The configurations belonging to the first class permit an Euler tour to be wrapped around the robotic aggregate. The existence of the Euler tour implies units are free to move around the perimeter of the SRS. Planning between configurations in this class can be performed in O(n) using a specialized planning algorithm. The set of Euler tour configurations span a large volume of the general state space of the hexagonal SRS. A second specialized planning algorithm plans from a general configuration to a nearby Euler tour configuration. While planning in the general configuration state space is computationally harder, the distance required to plan is short. Thus, the combination of both algorithms allows us to efficiently plan for a large proportion of possible reconfiguration tasks for the hexagonal metamorphic robot.",

While these may offer high safety and high productivity, fully autonomous solutions are not always applicable or economically viable. Teleoperation is an attractive option, since it increases safety and comfort of the drivers. Unfortunately, the difficulty to operate the vehicle remotely often results in reduced productivity. In this paper, we show that techniques from the field of mobile robotics can be used to mitigate this problem. We extend a commercial teleoperation system for use in underground mines with a local autonomy functionality, with the main purpose to evaluate if the achieved productivity improvement motivates development of general algorithms and a fully commercial implementation. We then describe a user study performed in an underground mine with a 38 tonne articulated wheel loader, which proves that local autonomy gives a significant improvement in productivity of the teleoperation system, while retaining or even reducing the maintenance costs.",

In order to avoid numerous parameter studies in evaluating its performance, the prediction model plays an important role. As fish's swimming includes the kinematic of its own body and the hydrodynamic interaction with the surrounding fluid, it is difficult to formulate a precise mathematical model by purely analytical approaches. This paper offers a semi-empirical method to model the performance of a BCF (body and/or caudal fin) biomimetic fish robot. By using a dimensional statistical method, a semi-empirical model for predicting the thrust force generated by a BCF oscillation swimming mode is derived. This model shows good prediction capability. The predicted results are in good agreement with the experiment data. Therefore, the proposed modeling method can be used to solve the engineering problem concerned without a complex theory derivation.",

Indoor flying robots must operate within constrained and cluttered environments where even nature's most sophisticated flyers such as insects cannot avoid all obstacles and should thus be able to withstand collisions and recover from them autonomously. A prototype platform specifically designed to withstand collisions and recover without human intervention is presented. Its dimensions are optimized to fulfill the varying constraints of aerodynamics, robustness and self-recovery, and new construction techniques focusing on shock absorption are presented. Finally, the platform is tested both in-flight and during collisions to characterize its collision robustness and self-recovery capability.",

        "abstract": "Navigation in unknown dynamic environments still remains a major challenge in robotics. Whereas insects like the desert ant with very limited computing and memory capacities solve this task with great efficiency. Thus, the understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of insect navigation can inform us on how to build simpler yet robust autonomous robots. Based on recent developments in insect neuroethology and cognitive psychology, we propose a method for landmark navigation in dynamic environments. Our method enables the navigator to learn the reliability of landmarks using an expectation reinforcement method. For that end, we implemented a real-time neuronal model based on the Distributed Adaptive Control framework. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of learning the stability of landmarks by reinforcing its expectations. Also, the proposed mechanism allows the navigator to optimally restore its confidence when its expectations are violated. We also perform navigational experiments with real ants to compare with the results of our model. The behavior of the proposed autonomous navigator closely resembles real ant navigational behavior. Moreover, our model explains navigation in dynamic environments as a memory consolidation process, harnessing expectations and their violations.",

A probabilistic model that jointly reasons about scan-matching, moving object detection and their motion estimation is developed. Scan-matching and moving object detection are two important problems for full autonomy of robotic systems in complex dynamic environments. Popular techniques for solving these problems usually address each task in turn disregarding important dependencies. The model developed here jointly reasons about these tasks by performing inference in a probabilistic graphical model. It allows different but related problems to be expressed in a single framework. The experiments demonstrate that jointly reasoning results in better estimates for both tasks compared to solving the tasks individually.",

It is well known that this problem is NP-hard, and therefore we seek efficient, but not optimal, solutions by relaxing the problem and applying the tools of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Approaches using MILP and RHC are known to produce efficient algorithms in other path planning domains, such as obstacle avoidance. Here we show how the MILP formalism can be used in a pursuit evasion setting to capture the motion of the pursuers as well as the partitioning of the pursuit search region into a cleared and a contaminated part. RHC is furthermore a well known way of balancing performance and computation requirements by iteratively solving path planning problems over a receding planning horizon, and adapt the length of that horizon to the computational resources available.

Each robot in the swarm has a cooperative localization system which uses wireless network as a mean of measuring the distance from the other robots. In this method, at least three robots act as stationary measurement beacons while the other robots of the swarm navigate in the environment towards the odor source. In the next step, the roles of the robots will be switched and some other robots will act as beacons. The experimental tests report a good result in finding the odor source and also the accuracy of localization system1.",

Such problems arise in many situations, including the basis of this work, which involves planning for a team of first responders (both humans and robots) operating in an urban environment. The problem is framed as a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with constraints, and it is shown that even in a relatively simple planning problem, modeling constraints as large penalties does not lead to good solutions. The main contribution of the work is a new online algorithm that explicitly ensures constraint feasibility while remaining computationally tractable. Its performance is demonstrated on an example problem and it is demonstrated that our online algorithm generates policies comparable to an offline constrained POMDP algorithm.",

This approach relies on a hierarchy of fast, anytime algorithms to plan a set of footholds, along with the dynamic body motions required to execute them. Components within the planning framework coordinate to exchange plans, cost-to-go estimates, and \u201ccertificates\u201d that ensure the output of an abstract high-level planner can be realized by deeper layers of the hierarchy. The burden of careful engineering of cost functions to achieve desired performance is substantially mitigated by a simple inverse optimal control technique. Robustness is achieved by real-time re-planning of the full trajectory, augmented by reflexes and feedback control. We demonstrate the successful application of our approach in guiding the LittleDog quadruped robot over a variety of rough terrains.",

Using a kinematic simulation, ranges of velocity commands that result in stable gait coordination are determined for both cases, the undamaged robot and the robot experiencing the loss of a single leg. The results give insight how to adjust the motion commands after the loss of a leg. Further, a simplified dynamic simulation is used to analyze the effect of leg loss on the walking stability. Heuristic measures like curvature and length of the traveled path, roll and pitch angles are employed to evaluate the walking stability and performance. Some methods like shifting the COG or stiffening the variably compliant joints are proposed and discussed with respect to their ability to improve the walking performance in case of leg loss. In the end, the presented concepts are extended and for the first time applied to a simulated eight-legged robot.",

Several studies aimed at designing and building such robots have been carried out but little was done on analyzing the interactions between the robots and their flexible environment. In this study, we will analyze the interaction between earthworm robots and biological tissues where contact mechanics is the dominant factor. Specifically, the efficiency of locomotion of earthworm robots is derived as a function of the tangential flexibility, friction coefficients, number of cells in the robot and external forces.",

However, the determination of design parameters remains a challenge, as stiffness and electrical motor torque capacity simultaneously affect both the control performance and the safety of the manipulator. Using analytical models of the hybrid actuation system, we propose a methodology to achieve a combination of low impedance and high control bandwidth.

Humans unconsciously exploit the fact that our feet slip on the ground; such slip motion is necessary for humanoids so as to realize sophisticated human-like motions. In order to generate the slip motion, we need to predict the amount of slip. We propose the hypothesis that the turning motion is caused by the effect of minimizing the power generated by floor friction. A model of rotation by friction force is described on the basis of our hypothesis. The case that a robot applies the same force on both feet is discussed; then, we extend the discussion to the case of different force distribution. The hypothesis is verified through experiments with a humanoid robot HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "Turning is one of the most important maneuvers for biological and robotic fish. In our group's prior work, an analytical framework was proposed for modeling the steady turning of fish, given asymmetric, periodic body/tail movement or deformation. However, the approach was not illustrated with simulation or validated with experiments. The contributions of the current paper are three fold. First, an extension to the modeling framework is made with a more rigorous formulation of the force balance equation. Second, we have worked out two examples explicitly, one with an oscillating, rigid tail, and the other with a flexible tail having a uniform curvature, and compared their turning behaviors through numerical results. Third, for model validation purposes, a robotic fish prototype has been developed, with the tail shaft controlled precisely by a servo motor. For a rigid tail, experimental results have confirmed the model prediction that, for the tested range, the steady-state turning radius and turning period decrease with an increasing bias in the tail motion, and that the turning period drops with an increasing tail beat frequency. We have also found that, with a flexible fin attached to the tail shaft, the robot can achieve faster turning with a smaller radius than the case of a rigid fin, and modeling within the same framework is underway to understand this phenomenon.",

Some historical background is provided together with a brief review of kite applications, which have been numerous and diverse. Robotizing the kite is expected to enhance its capabilities and revive scientific kiting. Towards that direction a methodology for controlling the angular elevation (and the altitude) of a single-line kite by actively adjusting the length of its bridle strings is proposed together with the required implementation hardware. Preliminary simulations and proof-of-concept field testing using a box kite were carried out.",

        "abstract": "A method for implementing the ankle and hip balance control strategies, well known from studies on human balance control, is suggested. The moment of the acting disturbance force is evaluated continuously in real time via the difference between the ZMP and the ground projection of the center of mass. Compliant response to the continuous disturbance is ensured by attaching a virtual spring-damper in an appropriate way for each strategy. Further on, whenever the limit of the ankle strategy is reached, a smooth transition toward the hip strategy is initialized and compliance is ensured in a continuous way and in agreement with the disturbance. After the disturbance is removed, the humanoid switches first back to the ankle strategy, and then returns to the initial equilibrium (erect) posture. Experimental data taken with a small humanoid robot (HOAP-2) are presented to validate the method. See also the accompanying video clip.",

In this paper, the SLAM problem is considered as the problem of finding an optimal path through a tree resulting in minimum costs. For this purpose, we apply the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic, which belongs to the class of ant algorithms. It has been successfully employed to solve the well known Traveling Salesman Problem with several thousands of cities. We use a simple scan matching technique for generating a rough pre-solution to the SLAM problem. The (inconsistent) map is partitioned into fragments. A new fragment is initialized as soon as the robot has moved several meters. We draw samples from Gaussian distributions representing alignments of consecutive fragments. The resulting set of samples is interpreted as a tree-like data structure with weights assigned to the edges. We use our own variant of an ant algorithm for finding the optimal path through the tree. Real-world experimental results demonstrate the characteristics of our method.",

Starting from modeling and exact feedback linearization, a cascade control is designed. Improvements to control laws with respect to input-saturations are derived by using concepts of anti-windup compensation. A multiple-axis anti-windup-control is presented, guaranteeing tracking in case of input-saturation. Control schemes are implemented on a planar parallel manipulator for performance evaluation of high dynamic operation. Efficiency of control is highlighted with respect to trajectory tracking i. e. Cartesian distortion. All concepts are derived in a formal way guaranteeing manipulator-independent results and transferability.",

Almost all existing novelty detection techniques, however, suffer from diminished performance when the number of less relevant, redundant or noisy features increases, as often the case with high-dimensional feature spaces. Many of these algorithms are also not suited for online use, a trait that is highly desirable for many robotic applications. We present a novelty detection algorithm that is able to address this sensitivity to high feature dimensionality by utilizing prior class information within the training set. Additionally, our anytime algorithm is well suited for online use when a constantly adjusting environmental model is beneficial. We apply this algorithm to online detection of novel perception system input on an outdoor mobile robot and argue such abilities could be key in increasing the real-world applications and impact of mobile robotics1.",

Although sophisticated cooperative control is essential to avoid destructive internal force in general cooperative transfer task, we propose a geometrical caging strategy which can simplify a hand-over task. To solve a problem of capture region mismatch during caging state transition, the proposed strategy does not utilize additional actuators and sensors but a compliant mechanism whose displacement range can be changed automatically by its configuration. By experiments, it was confirmed that the caging strategy can make the hand-over task drastically easy and robust, and a winch type quasi-compliant mechanism is effective to the problem of capture region mismatch.",

This requires testing robot systems and the software that comprises them. But testing robot software has always been a difficult process for developers. Issues of repeatability, safety, access to hardware and the general complexity of robot software are encountered. In industrial robotics, these difficulties are mitigated somewhat by the relatively simple, repeatable tasks and the controlled environment. Robotics for real-world environments, on the other hand, face the full challenges of testing. In this paper, we discuss regression testing at a low level of individual software components, particularly those components that are designed to interface with robot hardware. We present a software system for regression testing these components in a fully repeatable fashion as a case study of performing such testing in robotics. The presented system provides an efficient and quick method to monitor changes in the behaviour of software components as they are developed. Developers of robot software can quickly discover undesired changes and correct them.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of apprenticeship learning when the expert's demonstration covers only a small part of a large state space. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient solution to this problem based on the assumption that the expert is optimally acting in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, past work on IRL requires an accurate estimate of the frequency of encountering each feature of the states when the robot follows the expert's policy. Given that the complete policy of the expert is unknown, the features frequencies can only be empirically estimated from the demonstrated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to use a transfer method, known as soft homomorphism, in order to generalize the expert's policy to unvisited regions of the state space. The generalized policy can be used either as the robot's final policy, or to calculate the features frequencies within an IRL algorithm. Empirical results show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.",

The result obtained is used on the robot HRP-2, and enables it to guess a step feasibility 40,000 times faster (in 9\u00b5s) than with the normal verification process. As a consequence some advance is made towards fast online motion (re)planning based on a continuous set of possible steps.",

ACM is a machine which is made of a series of bending joints and forms a cord, and it has potential to work in challenging environment due to its large degree of freedom. In prior research most of ACM were composed of straight links and joints, and a lot of successful control methods for them have been proposed. However, the control of the ACM that is composed of arc-shaped joints or double joints has not been studied sufficiently so far. In this research we propose the method of approximations to continuous curves for such kind of ACM and use it for the control. The proposed idea is verified by numerical calculations and experiments by a robot.",

This paper presents a solution in which a robot autonomously assembles and fixes the wheels. The approach uses a sensor-driven control strategy that compensates a possible temporal or spatial offset. Three types of sensors are proposed for adequate perception of the wheel hub. Their signals are fused by a Kalman filter that allows predictions in the time domain. Finally, a feed-forward controller is used, that is designed to consider the predictions in order to minimize dynamical delays. The control is driven by a special task description that extents usual robot programming methods.",

It has been observed that even stochastic search methods like Genetic Algorithms (GA) can benefit from advanced models of the assembly task. Models built from the results of random samplings of a parameter space have been used previously to predict the performances of parameter sequences not yet evaluated, but the question of what properties of the models actually benefit the optimization remained. A quantitative analysis algorithm is derived and tested on physical assemblies for validation. Results are provided that illustrate the efficacy of the analysis algorithm for prediction-based performance enhancement when such models are used.",

The motion language model works for association of words from motion symbols. The natural language model is one used for a morphological analysis, which has been developed in natural language community. The natural language model is optimized using a enormous amount of words. So this model is scalable architecture. The motion language model and the natural language model can be integrated since both models are represented graphically. The integration of the motion language model and the natural language model allows robots not only to interpret motion patterns as sentences but also to generate motions from sentences. This paper demonstrates the validity of our proposed framework even in the case that large-scale word corpus is needed processing through experiments of interpreting motion patterns as sentences and generating motion patterns from sentences.",

We show that any such set of asymptotically stable gait primitives may be composed in arbitrary order without causing the robot to fall, so any walking path that is a sequence of these gaits may be followed by the robot. This result enables motion planning for bipedal dynamic walkers, which are fast and energetically efficient, in a similar manner to what is already possible for biped locomotion based on Zero Moment Point (ZMP) equilibrium constraints.",

        "abstract": "Recent discovery of a cracked and leaking Reactor Pressure Vessel Head (RPVH) nozzles have raised concerns about the structural integrity of RPVH nozzles in the pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power plants. In order to remove crack abnormalities in the areas of nozzle J-Groove Weld on reactor pressure vessel head, we have developed an \u201cAutomated Robotic Grinding\u201d (ARG) system which removes the surface cracks of the J-Groove Weld nozzles. Cracks are removed by the means of grinding of the J-Groove Weld performed both automatically and remotely. A manipulator was designed to be attached to the nozzle of the reactor head and enable the grinder tool to move according to cylindrical coordinate system with three degrees of freedom. Control system allows a synchronized motion of the manipulator axes and remote operation of the ARG manipulator. The inputs for grinding are the surface area coordinates of the crack and the maximum depth of the crack. Due to the limited accessibility in the area around the CRDM nozzle, the system is designed to include combined sensor and actuator. The grinder tool is first used as a sensor in a procedure to automatically detect the surface topology in the given area of the J-Groove Weld and then as an actuator which grinds with predefined depth, leaving the surface smooth and free of sharp edges. In this paper we present main features of the ARG system as well as main features of the grinding procedure.",

        "abstract": "Microassembly is an enabling technology for micro manufacturing that offers well-known pathways to building heterogeneous microsystems with a higher degree of robustness and more complex designs than monolithic fabrication. The success of assembly in micro domain, however, is directly related to the level of precision automation employed. Control and planning are two defining factors for the microassembly yield and its cycle time. Assembly at the microscale harbors many difficult challenges due to scaling of physics, stringent tolerance budget, high precision requirements, limited work volumes, and so on. These difficulties warrant new control and planning algorithms, different than their macro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we use precision metrics to formalize a hybrid controller for automated MEMS assembly. In the past, we formulated the \u201chigh yield assembly condition (HYAC)\u201d, which gives a quantitative condition for the success and failure of compliant microassembly. Using this quatitative tool, we formalize a precision-adjusted hybrid controller switching between open, closed, and calibrated operation in the microassembly cell. Simulation and experimental results for the assembly of a microspectrometer are presented to indicate that the proposed hybrid controller lead to high yields at faster cycle times than traditional precision control methods.",

        "abstract": "A crucial component of an autonomous mine is the ability to infer rock types from mechanical measurements of a drill rig. The major difficulty lies in that there is not a clear one to one correspondence between the mechanical measurements and the rock type due to the mechanical noise as well as the variety of the rock geology. This paper proposes a novel wavelet feature space projection approach to robustly classify rock types from drilling data with Gaussian Process classification. Instead of applying Gaussian Process classifier directly to the given measurement pieces, a group of wavelet features are extracted from the neighboring region of a specific data point. Gaussian Process classification is then carried out on the new extracted wavelet features. By putting neighboring data points into consideration rather than dealing with each data point individually, the underlying pattern can be better captured and more robust to noise and data variations. Experimental results on synthetic data as well as varied real world drilling data have shown the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Sliding a probe over a textured surface generates a rich collection of vibrations that one can easily use to create a mental model of the surface. Haptic virtual environments attempt to mimic these real interactions, but common haptic rendering techniques typically fail to reproduce the sensations that are encountered during texture exploration. Past approaches have focused on building a representation of textures using a priori ideas about surface properties. Instead, this paper describes a process of synthesizing probe-surface interactions from data recorded from real interactions. We explain how to apply the mathematical principles of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to develop a discrete transfer function that represents the acceleration response under specific probe-surface interaction conditions. We then use this predictive transfer function to generate unique acceleration signals of arbitrary length. In order to move between transfer functions from different probe-surface interaction conditions, we develop a method for interpolating the variables involved in the texture synthesis process. Finally, we compare the results of this process with real recorded acceleration signals, and we show that the two correlate strongly in the frequency domain.",

Automating these recurrent tasks could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients and disburden the surgeon while he can focus on higher level challenges. This work tackles the problem of autonomous tissue piercing in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery with a circular needle and general purpose surgical instruments. To command the instruments to an incision point, the surgeon utilizes a laser pointer to indicate the stitching area. A precise positioning of the needle is obtained by means of a switching visual servoing approach and the subsequent stitch is performed in a circular motion.",

        "abstract": "Data collection using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is increasing in importance within the oceanographic research community. Contrary to traditional moored or static platforms, mobile sensors require intelligent planning strategies to maneuver through the ocean. However, the ability to navigate to high-value locations and collect data with specific scientific merit is worth the planning efforts. In this study, we examine the use of ocean model predictions to determine the locations to be visited by an AUV, and aid in planning the trajectory that the vehicle executes during the sampling mission. The objectives are: a) to provide near-real time, in situ measurements to a large-scale ocean model to increase the skill of future predictions, and b) to utilize ocean model predictions as a component in an end-to-end autonomous prediction and tasking system for aquatic, mobile sensor networks. We present an algorithm designed to generate paths for AUVs to track a dynamically evolving ocean feature utilizing ocean model predictions. This builds on previous work in this area by incorporating the predicted current velocities into the path planning to assist in solving the 3-D motion planning problem of steering an AUV between two selected locations. We present simulation results for tracking a fresh water plume by use of our algorithm. Additionally, we present experimental results from field trials that test the skill of the model used as well as the incorporation of the model predictions into an AUV trajectory planner. These results indicate a modest, but measurable, improvement in surfacing error when the model predictions are incorporated into the planner.",

More precisely, we present techniques for segmentation and modeling of objects held in the five-fingered robot hand. Multiple object views are generated by rotating the held objects in the robot's field of view. The acquired object representations are evaluated in the context of visual search and object recognition tasks in cluttered environments.

        "abstract": "A large focus of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) community has been shifted to addressing the requirements necessary for managing systems of UAVs. The ability to automate the process of tracking and responding to the health of UAVs contributes to the reliable and persistent operation of multiple UAV systems. In particular, the automation of managing UAVs and their resources removes a critical, frequent, and time consuming task from an operator's workload. We have developed a battery swapping mechanism capable of `refueling' UAVs autonomously. This paper presents an automated battery swapping system for multiple small-scale UAVs. The system includes a battery swapping mechanism and online algorithms to address resource management, vehicle health monitoring, and precision landing onto the battery swapping mechanism's landing platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a methodology regarding an autonomous cruise control (ACC) of circulating multi-robot which is directly effective for solving the congestion regardless of the presence of a bottleneck. For this purpose, we focus on an external interaction force between the robots. This force is generated with the use of a virtual damper. In this methodology, two control scenarios are presented: a damping force acts on a moving robot as the external interaction force, (I) only when its preceding robot(s) is/are stopping or being congested and (II) when a robot exists in front of the moving robot, in order not to become involved in the congestion. This paper deals with a circuit and a robotic manufacturing-transportation system for industrial automation. Through simulation experiments, it is shown that the proposed ACC successfully solves the congestion, and finally, improves the throughput. In addition, the superiority of the two control scenarios, ACCs (I) and (II), is discussed.",

        "abstract": "The ability to fly at low altitude while actively avoiding collisions with the terrain and other objects is a great challenge for small unmanned aircraft. This paper builds on top of a control strategy called optiPilot whereby a series of optic-flow detectors pointed at divergent viewing directions around the aircraft main axis are linearly combined into roll and pitch commands using two sets of weights. This control strategy already proved successful at controlling flight and avoiding collisions in reactive navigation experiments. This paper shows how optiPilot can be coupled with a GPS in order to provide goal-directed, nap-of-the-earth flight control in presence of static obstacles. Two fully autonomous flights of 25 minutes each are described where a 400-gram unmanned aircraft is flying at approx. 9 m above the terrain on a circular path including two copses of trees requiring efficient collision avoidance actions.",

A reverse turn planner is firstly investigated, based on primitives connected together to easily generate the reference motion. Then, both steering and speed control algorithms are presented to accurately guide the vehicle-trailer system. They are based on a kinematic model extended with additional sliding parameters and on model predictive control approaches. Real world experiments have been carried out on a low friction terrain with an experimental mobile robot pulling a trailer. At the end of each row, the reverse turn is automatically generated to connect the next reference track, and the maneuver is autonomously performed by the vehicle-trailer system. Reported experiments demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Although robot navigation in indoor environments has achieved great success, robots are unable to fully navigate these spaces without the ability to operate elevators, including those which the robot has not seen before. In this paper, we focus on the key challenge of autonomous interaction with an unknown elevator button panel. A number of factors, such as lack of useful 3D features, variety of elevator panel designs, variation in lighting conditions, and small size of elevator buttons, render this goal quite difficult. To address the task of detecting, localizing, and labeling the buttons, we use state-of-the-art vision algorithms along with machine learning techniques to take advantage of contextual features. To verify our approach, we collected a dataset of 150 pictures of elevator panels from more than 60 distinct elevators, and performed extensive offline testing. On this very diverse dataset, our algorithm succeeded in correctly localizing and labeling 86.2% of the buttons. Using a mobile robot platform, we then validate our algorithms in experiments where, using only its on-board sensors, the robot autonomously interprets the panel and presses the appropriate button in elevators never seen before by the robot. In a total of 14 trials performed on 3 different elevators, our robot succeeded in localizing the requested button in all 14 trials and in pressing it correctly in 13 of the 14 trials.",

We developed 4 table robots as multiple omni-directional mobile robots and constructed a position detecting system using LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) attached on the tables. A camera is fixed on the ceiling. We also developed a motion planning algorithm for the robots. Consequently, the table robots can move from an arbitrary arrangement to an arbitrary arrangement. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was confirmed.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an avoidance behavior from unknown external forces for a biped walking vehicle. To distinguish between external forces from passenger and those from environments, we use the data of a force sensor mounted on foot, and external forces are estimated from ZMP errors. To guarantee a walking stability, the waist position is adjusted to match the measured ZMP to the reference ZMP, and the position of landing foot is adjusted so that the waist trajectory does not diverge. By implementing the developed method on the human-carrying biped robot, the robot realized a stable walk under unknown external forces from environments. When pushing the robot stepping, the robot moved backward and moved away from the generation source of external forces about 400 mm. When pushing the robot walking forward, the robot stopped going forward and prevented from coming closer to the generation source of external forces. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed control through these experiments.",

        "abstract": "Treating \u201cresting\u201d contacts (i.e., contacts with zero normal relative velocity), using forces is problematic due to inconsistent configurations. For this reason, treating resting contacts with impulses instead of forces has become common, but this approach also suffers from a significant problem: applying impulses at the time-of-contact can keep the simulation from advancing. This scenario is analogous to one of the paradoxes devised by the philosopher Zeno, and has been referred to as a Zeno point in the simulation community. I describe how to avoid Zeno points without violating the theoretical dynamic behavior of the simulated bodies and without permitting interpenetration. Two experiments demonstrate that the method works as desired where alternative approaches that required accepting interpenetration or longer running times were previously required.",

Axel is a lightweight 2-wheeled vehicle that can access steep slopes and negotiate relatively large obstacles due to its actively managed tether and novel wheel design. This paper reviews the Axel system and focuses on its novel paddle wheel characteristics. We show that the paddle design has superior rock climbing ability. We also adapt basic terramechanics principles to estimate the sinkage of paddle wheels on loose sand. Experimental comparisons between the transport efficiency of mountain bike wheels and paddle wheels are summarized. Finally, we present an unfolding wheel prototype which allows Axel to be compacted for efficient transport.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the relation between B-splines and FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters is demonstrated and exploited to design a digital filter for trajectory planning, combining the very simple structure and computational efficiency of FIR filters with the flexibility of splines. In particular, the trajectory generator consists of two main elements. The former is devoted to the solution of an optimization problem that, given a set of points to be interpolated (or approximated), provides the control points defining the spline. The latter, a cascade of moving average filters, gives the trajectory profile at each sampling time on the basis of such points. The proposed method has been applied to several robotic and industrial applications, and in this paper two case studies are reported as examples: an industrial robot performing a welding operation and a mobile robot moving in an environment with obstacles. With respect to these tasks, the main features of the trajectory generator are shown: the possibility of planning trajectories with high degree of smoothness (continuity of the derivatives), the possibility of easily changing the duration of the trajectory (and therefore the velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. of the trajectory) maintaining the same geometric path, the possibility of locally modifying the pre-planned path.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based kinodynamic planners, such as the popular RRT algorithm, have been proposed as promising solutions to planning for systems with dynamics. Nevertheless, complex systems often raise significant challenges. In particular, the state-space exploration of sampling-based tree planners can be heavily biased towards a specific direction due to the presence of dynamics and underactuation. The premise of this paper is that it is possible to use statistical tools to learn quickly the effects of the constraints in the algorithm's state-space exploration during a training session. Then during the online operation of the algorithm, this information can be utilized so as to counter the undesirable bias due to the dynamics by appropriately adapting the control propagation step. The resulting method achieves a more balanced exploration of the state-space, resulting in faster solutions to planning challenges. The paper provides proof of concept experiments comparing against and improving upon the standard RRT using MATLAB simulations for (a) swinging up different versions of a 3-link Acrobot system with dynamics and (b) a second-order car-like system with significant drift.",

This task is nontrivial due to the discrete-continuous nature of the corresponding dynamics. The ball can be only controlled during ball-manipulator contact and moves freely otherwise. We propose a manipulator equipped with a spring that gets compressed when the ball bounces against it. Hence, we can have continuous-time control over this underactuated Ball-Spring-Manipulator system until the spring releases its accumulated energy back to the ball. This paper illustrates a systematic way of planning such a modified dribbling motion, computing an analytical transverse linearization and achieving orbital stabilization.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the context of minimally invasive cardiac surgery, robotic assistance has significantly helped surgeons to overcome difficulties related to the minimally invasive procedure. Recently, techniques have been proposed for active canceling the beating heart motion for improving the accuracy of the surgical gestures. In this scenario, computer vision techniques can be applied for estimating the heart motion based solely on natural structures on the heart surface. However, visual tracking is complicated by the particular lighting conditions and clutter (smoke, liquids, etc) during surgery. Another challenging problem are the occasional occlusions by surgical instruments. In order to overcome these problems, we exploit the quasi-periodicity of the beating heart motion for increasing the robustness of the visual tracking task. In this paper, a novel time-varying dual Fourier series for modeling the quasi-periodic beating heart motion is proposed. For estimating the series parameters, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used. The proposed method is applied in a visual tracking task for bridging tracking disturbances and automatically reestablish tracking in cases of occlusions. The efficiency of the prediction method and the sensible improvements in the visual tracking task are demonstrated through in vivo experiments.",

        "abstract": "Two methods for behavior recognition are presented and evaluated. Both methods are based on the dynamic temporal difference algorithm Predictive Sequence Learning (PSL) which has previously been proposed as a learning algorithm for robot control. One strength of the proposed recognition methods is that the model PSL builds to recognize behaviors is identical to that used for control, implying that the controller (inverse model) and the recognition algorithm (forward model) can be implemented as two aspects of the same model. The two proposed methods, PSLE-Comparison and PSLH-Comparison, are evaluated in a Learning from Demonstration setting, where each algorithm should recognize a known skill in a demonstration performed via teleoperation. PSLH-Comparison produced the smallest recognition error. The results indicate that PSLH-Comparison could be a suitable algorithm for integration in a hierarchical control system consistent with recent models of human perception and motor control.",

This paper examines a joint concept called the bidirectional antagonistic joint which is a extension of antagonistic joints. A new operating mode called the helping mode is introduced, which increases the joint load range. Although the joint can not be pretensioned in the helping mode, it is shown that a stiffness variation is possible, assuming a suitable torque-stiffness characteristic of the elastic elements. A methodology to design such characteristics is presented along with several example cases interpreted in a torque-stiffness plot. Furthermore, a stiffness adaptation control scheme which ensures mechanism safety is described. Finally, the design methodology and the control are evaluated on an implementation of a bidirectional antagonistic joint.",

In particular, we identify and classify bifurcations leading to chaos caused by gait asymmetries due to unequal leg masses. We present bifurcation diagrams showing step period versus the ratio of leg masses at various walking slopes. The cell mapping method is used to find stable limit cycles as the parameters are varied. It is found that a variety of bifurcation diagrams can be grouped into six stages that consist of three expanding and three contracting stages. The analysis of each stage shows that passive dynamic walking has multiple attractors depending on initial conditions, and marginally stable limit cycles exhibit not only period doubling, but also period remerging, disconnecting, and disappearing. We also show that the rate of convergence of period doubling sequences is in good agreement with the Feigenbaum constant.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the relatively rich and interesting bifurcation structure that is present in the nature of optimal solutions to a multi-robot formation control problem. The problem considered is a two point nonlinear boundary-value problem that can only be solved numerically. Since common numerical solution techniques such as the shooting method are local in nature and hence are difficult to use to find multiple solutions, an alternative formulation of the problem is presented that can be solved through homotopy methods for polynomial systems. These methods are guaranteed to find all solutions within the resolution of the system description's discretization. Specifically, this paper studies a group of unicycle-like autonomous mobile robots operating in a 2-dimensional obstacle-free environment. Each robot has a predefined initial state and final state and the problem is to find the optimal path between two states for every robot. The path is optimized with respect to the control effort and the deviation from a desired formation. The bifurcation parameter is the relative weight given to penalizing the deviation from the desired formation versus control effort. It is shown that as this number varies, bifurcations of solutions are obtained. Considering the common use of optimization methods in robotic navigation and coordination problems, understanding the existence and structure of bifurcating and multiple solutions is of great importance in robotics.",

        "abstract": "Interaction of a robot with dynamic environments would require continuous adaptation of force and impedance, which is generally not available in current robot systems. In contrast, humans learn novel task dynamics with appropriate force and impedance through the concurrent minimization of error and energy, and exhibit the ability to modify movement trajectory to comply with obstacles and minimize forces. This article develops a similar automatic motor behavior for a robot and reports experiments with a one degree-of-freedom system. In a postural control task, the robot automatically adapts torque to counter a slow disturbance and shifts to increasing its stiffness when the disturbance increases in frequency. In the presence of rigid obstacles, it refrains from increasing force excessively, and relaxes gradually to follow the obstacle, but comes back to the desired state when the obstacle is removed. A trajectory tracking task demonstrates that the robot is able to adapt to different loads during motion. On introduction of a new load, it increases its stiffness to adapt to the load quickly, and then relaxes once the adaptation is complete. Furthermore, in the presence of an obstacle, the robot adjusts its trajectory to go around it.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous landing on unknown extraterrestrial bodies requires fast, noise-resistant motion processing to elicit appropriate steering commands. Flying insects excellently master visual motion sensing techniques to cope with highly parallel data at a low energy cost, using dedicated motion processing circuits. Results obtained in neurophysiological, behavioural, and biorobotic studies on insect flight control were used to safely land a spacecraft on the Moon in a simulated environment. ESA's Advanced Concepts Team has identified autonomous lunar landing as a relevant situation for testing the potential applications of innovative bio-inspired visual guidance systems to space missions. Biomimetic optic flow-based strategies for controlling automatic landing were tested in a very realistic simulated Moon environment. Visual information was provided using the PANGU software program and used to regulate the optic flow generated during the landing of a two degrees of freedom spacecraft. The results of the simulation showed that a single elementary motion detector coupled to a regulator robustly controlled the autonomous descent and the approach of the simulated moonlander. \u201cLow gate\u201d located approximately 10 m above the ground was reached with acceptable vertical and horizontal speeds of 4 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively.

SU8 microstructures blotted with swarmer cells of Serratia Marcescens in a monolayer are propelled by the bacteria in the absence of any environmental stimulus. We call such microstructures with bacteria Micro Bio Robots (MBRs) and the uncontrolled motion in the absence of stimuli self actuation. Our paper has two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate the control of MBRs using self-actuation, DC electric fields and ultra-violet radiation, and develop experimentally validated mathematical model for the MBRs. This model allows us to use self-actuation and electrokinetic actuation to steer the MBR to any position and orientation in a planar micro channel. Second, we describe the development of biosensors for the MBRs. This is done by attaching genetically engineered Escherichia coli cells that are capable of sensing nonmetabolizable lactose analog methyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (TMG). We describe the fabrication process for MBRs and show experimental results demonstrating sensing, actuation and control.",

The algorithm takes advantage of the passive dynamics of walking, assisting only when necessary with an intermittent oscillator driving the hip joint. We analyze inherent reasons of falling for a biped system based on dynamic principles and assume that human walking relies more on instinct actions within the spinal cord rather than brain. Corresponding falling tendency function is proposed, based on which a reflex controller adjusting output of oscillator is designed. An auxiliary span angle controller is put forward to provide secondary actuations for compensation to improve landing performance. The proposed reflex system requires no prior knowledge of the terrain or tens of hundreds of experiments, which are necessary for machine learning methods. Results of simulations indicate that our reflex controllers are capable of ensuring stable passive blind walking on slope varying terrains without ankle torque.",

The robots use ant-like trail following to navigate between home and source. This paper studies the effect on global performance of changing the field of view of each robot's trail-following sensor. It is shown that, under certain conditions, a narrow field of view can improve system performance. We argue that the benefit is obtained by selectively degrading the individuals' trail-following ability so that more work space is exploited in parallel, thus decreasing mutual spatial interference. This \u201cworse-is-better\u201d idea may be applicable to other large-scale multi-robot systems.",

We propose a new method for detecting object boundaries using planar laser scanners (LIDARs) and, optionally, co-registered imagery. We formulate boundary detection as a classification problem, in which we estimate whether a boundary exists in the gap between two consecutive range measurements. Features derived from the LIDAR and imagery are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to label pairs of range measurements as boundary or non-boundary. We compare this approach to an existing boundary detection algorithm that uses dynamically adjusted thresholds. Experiments show that the new method performs better even when only LIDAR features are used, and additional improvement occurs when image-based features are included, too. The new algorithm performs better on difficult boundary cases, such as obliquely viewed objects.",

To achieve accurate cuts the laser has to be precisely sent to a desired pose with respect to the bone. In the proposed approach, a robot is used to position an end-effector with a scanhead, which deflects the cutting laser. The poses of the laser and of the bone are measured thanks to an optical tacking system which tracks the positions of optical markers placed on the bone and on the scanhead. The control of the robot is then performed thanks to a position-based visual servoing control scheme. In the case of bones affected by breathing motions, for instance the thorax bones, this control scheme is enhanced with a learning algorithm in order to compensate breathing motions. The main contribution of this paper is this control algorithm for motions compensation.",

        "abstract": "Three dimensional optic measurement system's accuracy is highly related with the field of inspection. Increasing of field inspection costs increasing camera / projector pixel area on the test surface. Small surface changes within one pixel area cannot be directly detected, which will lower the system accuracy. A pixel-to-pixel strategy is developed to solve this problem. Increasing field of inspection also costs a longer standoff distance. The random image noise from the environment, uncertainties functions by lens distortion and resolution variation are all amplified. Therefore, a more complicated calibration model for each pixel is proposed to calibrate the system. In traditional structured light vision systems, a single sensor usually detects around 10,000 - 50,000 mm2, and the 3D vision sensor in this paper needs to detect around 2,400,000 mm2. Larger detection range gives more challenge to finish the calibration tasks. This paper proposes a clear calibration procedure to a large field of inspection structured light system. Last the comparison with the CMM measured results is used to prove that the calibration tasks have been successfully achieved.",

In this paper, a novel camera parameters auto-adjusting technique based on image entropy is proposed. Firstly image entropy is defined and its relationship with camera parameters is verified by experiments. Then how to optimize the camera parameters based on image entropy is proposed to make robot vision adaptive to the different light conditions. The algorithm is tested by using the omnidirectional vision in indoor RoboCup Middle Size League environment and the perspective camera in outdoor ordinary environment, and the results show that the method is effective and color constancy to some extent can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Transapical aortic valve replacement under MRI guidance in a beating heart is a recent minimally invasive technique that could benefit from a surgical assistant system. We present a robotic surgical assistant system that can precisely and repeatably deliver aortic valve prostheses. The surgical system consists of an imaging system, an Innomotion robotic arm, a 3-DoF valve delivery module and user interfaces. Interactive control allows the physician to remain in the loop and adjust the orientation and position using real-time MR feedback. The 3-DoF valve delivery module is developed to deploy both balloon-expandable and self-expanding stented prostheses. We use a new compact fiducial that can be placed close to the volume of interest and requires a single image plane for image based robot registration. We evaluate the MRI compatible valve delivery module for both types of prostheses. The accuracy for prosthesis delivery is about 0.8 mm and 1.5 mm, for self-expanding and balloon-expandable prostheses, respectively. Preliminary results in ex-vivo experimentation suggest that the robotic system can be translated into animal and clinical models.",

        "abstract": "In this work we introduce a novel approach for detecting spatiotemporal object-action relations, leading to both, action recognition and object categorization. Semantic scene graphs are extracted from image sequences and used to find the characteristic main graphs of the action sequence via an exact graph-matching technique, thus providing an event table of the action scene, which allows extracting object-action relations. The method is applied to several artificial and real action scenes containing limited context. The central novelty of this approach is that it is model free and needs a priori representation neither for objects nor actions. Essentially actions are recognized without requiring prior object knowledge and objects are categorized solely based on their exhibited role within an action sequence. Thus, this approach is grounded in the affordance principle, which has recently attracted much attention in robotics and provides a way forward for trial and error learning of object-action relations through repeated experimentation. It may therefore be useful for recognition and categorization tasks for example in imitation learning in developmental and cognitive robotics.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for catadioptric line matching across multiple images. While most of previous works deals with vertical lines and planar motion, our approach is able to match any kind of lines between two views separated by a rigid transformation without any prior knowledge of the epipolar geometry. Catadioptric lines are represented by their normals in sphere space and we use only these normals and their relative positions in order to perform the matching. A geometric hashing approach allows in the first image to construct hashing tables based on bases defined by every possible couples of normals. In the second image, a voting scheme permits to select the best corresponding bases and subsequently to match catadioptric lines.We show that the proposed representation is invariant in the case of a pure rotation and quasi-invariant for a combination of rotation and translation. We also propose different experimental results obtained in real time on real outdoor sequences.",

This paper proposes a new design of homogeneous flexible and stretchable robot skin based on carbon-black-filled (CBF) silicone and conductive fabric that can sense multiple contact locations as well as applied pressure. CBF silicone has been already used in sensing technology but its piezoresistivity is still largely misunderstood. This particular behavior is investigated in this paper through a set of experiments conducted on isolated sensing cells. Using the results of these experiments, a model describing the variation of the resistivity in the CBF silicone as a function of the applied pressure is proposed. Based on this model, a simple way to accurately estimate the applied pressure in real time is demonstrated. Finally, using this improved knowledge of the behaviour of the CBF silicone, the fabrication of a fully functional sensor array is presented. The proposed design has the particularity of circumventing the well-known problem of cross-talk between sensing cells.",

Feed-forward has proven to be advantageous, using predictions of the desired trajectory which will be computed from sensor values. These predictions are improved by a model based classification of the sensor data to typical scenarios. In contrast to linear controllers this assures the fastest possible response to external disturbances, in spite of large dynamical delays. The method is demonstrated by assembling wheels to a car body that is moved by a conveyor, fusing sensor data using an extended Kalman filter.",

        "abstract": "To classify the five individual finger motions from an electromyogram (EMG) signal, a classification system that hybridizes EMG signals in both the transient and converged states of a motion is proposed. The classifications of finger motions are executed individually in each state by a well-established artificial neural network (ANN). Then, the outputs of the two classifiers are combined. The efficacy of the result is evaluated via a piano-tapping task, in which the subjects are instructed to tap a keyboard with each of their five fingers. We use this task to compare the proposed hybrid system and a conventional converged system that uses an EMG signal only in the converged state. For five of the six subjects, the accuracy ratio of finger motions was better in the proposed method: approximately 85% for each finger except the second. Further analysis suggests two remarkable advantages of the hybrid method: (1) the output of the ANN is more credible, and (2) finger motion in the transient state (i.e., the early phase) is more predictable.",

        "abstract": "Conducting polymer actuators such as polypyrrole can generate stresses over 10 times larger than skeletal muscle and have typical repeatable strains between 1% and 12%, making them potential candidates for lightweight, low-cost, robotic applications. Polypyrrole linear actuators under closed loop control have not been previously reported. Here we report the open and closed loop performance of polypyrrole linear contractile actuators evaluated at pre-loaded stresses of 1 MPa to 3 MPa. A standard PI control scheme driving a potentiostat was implemented in conjunction with positioning feedback from a DC/DC linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). A dynamic positioning range of 3400 is reported, with a positioning resolution of 125 nm (0.001% strain) and a maximum repeatable displacement of 427 microns (3.6% strain). The open loop frequency response of actuator strain shows characteristics of a first-order low pass filter with a log gain versus log frequency slope near -1 for frequencies tested between 0.05 Hz to 2 Hz. The closed loop frequency response of actuator strain when tracking a sinusoidal set-point signal of 0.5% strain shows characteristics of a first order system with one zero, with a corner frequency near 0.08 Hz and an operating bandwidth up to 1 Hz. Step responses at various controller output maximum voltages show a reduction in contractile response times by a factor of four, where higher voltages yield faster contractile responses.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in the context of folding a towel using a general-purpose two-armed mobile robotic platform without the use of specialized end-effectors or tools. The robot begins by picking up a randomly dropped towel from a table, goes through a sequence of vision-based re-grasps and manipulations-partially in the air, partially on the table-and finally stacks the folded towel in a target location. The reliability and robustness of our algorithm enables for the first time a robot with general purpose manipulators to reliably and fully-autonomously fold previously unseen towels, demonstrating success on all 50 out of 50 single-towel trials as well as on a pile of 5 towels.",

We compute plans that move the arm as close as possible to the goal region using sampling-based planning and then switch to a trajectory optimization technique for the last few centimeters necessary to reach the goal region. This combination allows fast computation and safe execution of motion plans even when the goals are very close to objects in the environment. The system incorporates realtime sensory inputs and correctly deals with occlusions that can occur when robot body parts block the sensor view of the environment. The system is tested on a 7 degree-of-freedom robot arm with sensory input from a tilting laser scanner that provides 3D information about the environment.",

        "abstract": "Aerial robots are often required to remain within the communication range of a base station on the ground to exchange commands, sensor data or as a safety mechanism. For this purpose, we propose a minimal control strategy for steering flying robots using only communication hardware (e.g. WiFi module or radio modem) instead of GPS or cameras. To avoid being dependent on the specifics of the communication hardware or its driver, we propose to measure the number of messages the robot receives from the base as a control input. Leashing is then performed by having the robot react to low message rates by moving towards the base in order to improve the communication. Results show both in theory and reality that this strategy can leash the robot to the base in scenarios with limited wind or base mobility.",

We demonstrate the feasibility of both approaches by implementing them on a real swarm of Alice robots. Using Webots, a realistic simulator for mobile robotics, and macroscopic models based on the Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) framework, we investigate the limitations of the deterministic controller and demonstrate the existence of optimal parameters for the probabilistic controller where exploration and exploitation are well balanced, thus favoring the formation of larger chains.",

However, these actuators exhibit some rate-dependent hysteresis effects which affect the accuracy of these micro-positioning systems and may even lead to system instability. In this paper, the rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is employed to characterize the rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezo micro-positioning stage. The analytical inverse of the rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is then formulated using the initial loading curve concept. This inverse is utilized as a feedforward compensator to compensate for the hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezo micro-positioning stage under excitation in the 1-50 Hz frequency range.",

        "abstract": "We present a control algorithm for autonomous underwater robots with modular thruster configuration. The algorithm can handle arbitrary thruster configurations. It maintains the robot's desired attitude while solving for translational motion. The attitude can be arbitrarily chosen from the special orthogonal group SO3 allowing the robot all possible orientations. The desired translational velocities can be chosen from R3 allowing the robot to follow arbitrary trajectories underwater. If the robot is not fully holonomic then the controller chooses the closest possible solution using least squares and outputs the error vector. We verify the controller with experiments using our autonomous underwater robot AMOUR. We achieve roll errors of 1.0 degree (2.1 degrees standard deviation) and pitch errors of 1.5 degrees (1.8 degrees standard deviation). We also demonstrate experimentally that the controller can handle both nonholonomic and fully holonomic thruster configurations of the robot. In the later case we show how depth can be maintained while performing 360 degree rolls. Further, we demonstrate an input device that allows a user to control the robot's attitude while moving along a desired trajectory.",

Placement of the patch clamp electrodes using micromanipulators is a time consuming and complicated task due to the lack of depth perception of microscope optics and the constrained physical environment. In order to simplify this process, a software platform has been created that permits the user to easily perform not only single electrode recordings but multiple ones. The software platform provides capabilities for automatic positioning of micropipettes in specified locations on the image plane, autofocusing on selected objects, detecting visible micropipettes using image processing techniques, haptic-enabled master slave control of micromanipulators for accurate positioning of electrodes while generating virtual forces to prevent collision between micropipettes, as well as several other novel features which help the user to perform patch clamping more efficiently. The system does not require any changes in the hardware, and uses a fully software-based approach.",

The first algorithm assumes that the robot must maintain contact with the object at all times, and produces a shortest path. There are also situations, however, where the robot has no choice but to let go of the object occasionally. Our second algorithm handles such cases, but no longer guarantees that the produced path is the shortest possible.",

Unlike other approaches in literature, this paper first examines the extent of lane parameters required for continuous control of any vehicle manually or autonomously. The accumulator-based algorithm is designed using this fundamental control knowledge to vote for the required lane parameters (position of lanes and steering angle required) in the image plane. The novel accumulator voting scheme is called \"Parametric Transform for Multi-lane Detection\". This paper not only adapts predictive control in the image plane, but also detects multiple lanes in the scene concurrently in the form of multiple peaks in the accumulator. This method is robust to shadows and invariant to color, texture, and width of the road. Finally, the method is designed for dashed/continuous lines.",

These parametrizations are homogeneous points (HP), inverse-distance points (IDP, better known as inverse-depth), and the new anchored homogeneous points (AHP). The discourse used for describing them is chosen to highlight their differences and similarities, showing that they are just incremental variations of ones with respect to the others. We show for the first time a complete comparison of HP against IDP, two methods that are getting popular, and introduce also for the first time AHP, whose description falls precisely between the other two. The benchmarking is done by running all algorithms on the same data and by using the well-established NEES consistency analysis. Our conclusion is that the new AHP parametrization is the most interesting one for monocular EKF-SLAM (followed by IDP and then HP) because it greatly postpones the apparition of EKF inconsistency.",

It works on a self-excited oscillator of COM (center of mass) developed by the author, in which the stabilizability is maximized through a nonlinear feedback to the ZMP (zero-moment point) manipulation. Different from the conventional artificial CPGs (central pattern generators), its dynamics seamlessly morphs from/to that of a standing controller and enables an easy tuning of controller parameters for the desired oscillation amplitude and period. Based on a novel motion index defined by a complex number, the phase and spatial information about the COM-ZMP movement is abstracted. By a successive estimation of the foot-liftable phase, the up-down of feet is controlled so that it automatically synchronizes to the COM-ZMP oscillation with the unilaterality constraint on the reaction forces explicitly taken into account.",

        "abstract": "In the past, there has been a tremendous advance in the area of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there are relatively few approaches for incorporating prior information or knowledge about structural similarities into the mapping process. Consider, for example, office buildings in which most of the offices have an identical geometric layout. The same typically holds for the individual stories of buildings. In this paper, we propose an approach for generating alignment constraints between different floors of the same building in the context of graph-based SLAM. This is done under the assumption that the individual floors of a building share at least some structural properties. To identify such areas, we apply a particle filter-based localization approach using maps and observations from different floors. We evaluate our system using several real datasets as well as in simulation. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly align multiple floors and allows the robot to generate consistent models of multi-story buildings.",

The proposed strategy utilizes gradients of collision and joint limit potential functions to arrive at an appropriate weighting matrix to penalize and dampen motion approaching constraint surfaces. The method is particularly suitable for self collision avoidance of highly articulated systems which may have multiple collision points among several segment pairs. In that respect, the proposed method has a distinct advantage over existing gradient projection based methods which rely on numerically unstable null-space projections when there are multiple intermittent constraints. We also show how this approach can be augmented with a previously reported method based on redirection of constraints along virtual surface manifolds. The hybrid strategy is effective, robust, and does not require parameter tuning. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for a self collision avoidance problem where the reference motion is obtained from human observations. We show simulation and experimental results on the humanoid robot ASIMO.",

These priorities profoundly constrain the choice of gait regulation methods. We propose a gait regulation and analysis method that varies foot detachment timing, effectively modifying stride length and frequency in order to maintain gait phasing, subject to kinematic and stability constraints. The method results in linear equations, leading to straightforward tests for local and global convergence when, for example, disturbances such as foot slippage cause departures from the nominal phasing. We illustrate the procedure with an example involving a bounding gait and compare it with empirical results obtained on the RiSE climbing robot.",

        "abstract": "Planning collision-free paths for multiple robots traversing a shared space is a problem that grows combinatorially with the number of robots. The naive centralised approach soon becomes intractable for even a moderate number of robots. Decentralised approaches, such as prioritised planning, are much faster but lack completeness. Previous work has demonstrated that the search can be significantly reduced by adding a level of abstraction. We first partition the map into subgraphs of particular known structure, such as cliques and halls, and then build abstract plans which describe the transitions of robots between the subgraphs. These plans are constrained by the structural properties of the subgraphs used. When an abstract plan is found, it can easily be resolved into a complete concrete plan without further search. In this paper, we show how this method of planning can be implemented as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Constraint propagation and intelligent search ordering further reduce the size of the search problem, allowing us to solve large problems significantly more quickly. Empirical evaluation on a realistic planning problem shows the clear superiority of the constraint-based approach, but the value of abstraction is mixed: it allows us to solve more problems at the cost of a time-overhead on simple problems. This implementation also opens up opportunities for the application of a number of other search reduction and optimisation techniques, as we will discuss.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of an inverted pendulum platform inherently reveals information about its interaction with the environment. The closed loop controller puts the unstable plant into dynamic equilibrium, where very small external forces result in persistent excitation of the system. Our previous work has shown that we are able to detect and estimate external forces on an inverted pendulum base using only dynamic state information from the controller. The Yale Inverted Pendulum Door Opening Robot (YIPDOR) has gained a simple 4 degree of freedom (DOF) arm with the goal of opening and traversing doorways with both heavy and sprung doors. We have explicitly omitted dedicated force sensors. Estimation methods using only the Jacobian and joint torques do not provide adequate estimates of external forces on this system. While improved force estimation continues to be a goal for the project, we propose that traversal of sprung doors may be accomplished with low-level, dynamic postures and detection of changes in dynamics rather than explicit force estimation and control. Changes in the equations of motion and dynamic constraints (contact, unlatching, door movement) are detected by using filtered derivatives of relevant parameters. This feature extraction research increases the safety and performance of the balancing and manipulation system without any additional dedicated sensors.",

This paper builds on a recently proposed application of the Gaussian process (GP) to occupancy mapping. An extension of GPs is employed which incorporates uncertain inputs into the covariance function. In turn, this allows statistically consistent, multi-resolution maps to be constructed which exploit the spatial inference properties of GPs while correctly accounting for sensor and localisation errors. Experiments are described, with both synthetic and real data, which show the benefits of complete uncertainty modeling and how contextual occupancy maps may be constructed by fusing data from different sensors on different robots in a common probabilistic representation.",

Given the initial and final configurations of a deformable model, our algorithm computes linear deformation by interpolating the vertices from the initial to the final configurations with a straight line path and checks for collision along that path. Our approach is applicable to polygon-soup models with arbitrary topology, handles self-collisions and makes no assumption about the underlying non-rigid motion. We accelerate the algorithm by computing motion bounds on the primitives and their bounding volumes. These bounds are combined with hierarchical culling techniques and used for fast collision checking. In practice, we have observed up to four times improvement in running time because of local advancement.",

The cable length is controlled in relation to the direction of the cable so that the inspection end-effecter hanging at the tip of the cable can follow the path dynamically despite the lack of full degrees of freedom. We analyze the tracing dynamics, address under what conditions a given geometric path can be traced (traceability conditions), and prove under what conditions the tracing motion is repetitive. A controller utilizing partial feedback linearization is proposed, and simulations are used to validate the explored traceability criteria and to confirm the controller's performance improvement.",

This noise is a function of the type of controller employed on the vehicle and the characteristics of the terrain and can cause the robot to deviate from a planned trajectory and collide with obstacles. Our motion planning algorithm finds trajectories that balance the trade-off between conventional performance measures such as time and energy versus safety. The key is a characterization of the vehicle's ability to follow planned paths, which allows the algorithm to explicitly calculate probabilities of successful traversal for different trajectory segments. We illustrate the method with a six-legged Rhex-like robot by experimentally characterizing different gaits (controllers) on different terrains and demonstrating the hexapod navigating a multi-terrain environment.",

We then detail the control algorithms we have developed for both transparency and torque output modes. The prescribed transparency controller is typical in design, but the torque output algorithm is novel to this type of haptic device. It makes use of a series of position-p-at-time-t commands, which we call packets. Five packet designs were considered in this research, but we have included only the most important three in this paper. While this research deals with torque feedback, it ultimately presents a method for working with devices that are limited by the need for continuous reset to a home position before subsequent outputs.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper is focussed on the modelling and control of a hydraulically-driven biologically-inspired robotic leg. The study is part of a larger project aiming at the development of an autonomous quadruped robot (hyQ) for outdoor operations. The leg has two hydraulically-actuated degrees of freedom (DOF), the hip and knee joints. The actuation system is composed of proportional valves and asymmetric cylinders. After a brief description of the prototype leg, the paper shows the development of a comprehensive model of the leg where critical parameters have been experimentally identified. Subsequently the leg control design is presented. The core of this work is the experimental assessment of the pros and cons of single-input single-output (SISO) vs. multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and linear vs. nonlinear control algorithms in this application (the leg is a coupled multivariable system driven by nonlinear actuators). The control schemes developed are a conventional PID (linear SISO), a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller (linear MIMO) and a Feedback Linearisation (FL) controller (nonlinear MIMO). LQR performs well at low frequency but its behaviour worsens at higher frequencies. FL produces the fastest response in simulation, but when implemented is sensitive to parameters uncertainty and needs to be properly modified to achieve equally good performance also in the practical implementation.",

The control strategy is based on the \u201csynchronization structure\u201d with the angular momentum of the pivot point. The synchronization not only follows the simplified joint angle dynamics of human running but also generates the uniform running speed from wide range of initial speed, which claims that the controller is robust for the error of initial speed. Moreover, it successfully verifies the acceleration of running speed from 0.1[m/s], which is almost zero speed, to a uniform running speed \u201cwithout\u201d switching controllers. Finally, the controller is applied for the running on an uneven terrain, and it successfully achieves running with the maximum slope angle 6[deg], which is highly steep terrain in the real situation.",

        "abstract": "Cable conduit actuation provides a simple yet dexterous mode of power transmission for remote actuation. However, they are not preferred because of the nonlinearities arising from friction and cable compliance which lead to backlash type of behavior. Unlike most of the current research in backlash control which generally assumes no knowledge of one of the intermediate states, the controller design in this case can be significantly simplified if output feedback of the system is available. This paper uses a simple feedforward control law for backlash compensation. A novel smooth backlash inverse is proposed, which takes the physical limitations of the actuator in consideration, unlike other designs, and thus makes it more intuitive to use. Implementation of this inverse on physical systems can also improve the system performance over the theoretical exact inverse, as well as other existing smooth inverse designs. Improvement in the performance is shown through experiments on a robot arm of Laprotek surgical system as well as on an experimental setup using polymeric cables for actuation.",

        "abstract": "Time-varying input/output delays in a control system can significantly degrade the stability and performance of the closed loop system. Recently, passivity based control has emerged as a promising candidate to guarantee delay independent stability of passive systems with delays in the input-output channel. In this paper we study set point control of rigid robots with time-varying sensing/control delays. We first show that the classical PD controller can be modified to regulate the robotic manipulator, provided scattering transformation along with additional gains are used in the communication path. While this results in a stable system, asymptotic regulation cannot be guaranteed. Hence, a (delay dependent) gain margin for a proportional position feedback controller is provided to guarantee stability and asymptotic convergence of the regulation error to the origin. To improve closed loop performance, scattering transformation based design of a damping injection scheme is also discussed. The proposed algorithms are numerically verified on a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Pronking (aka. stotting) is a gait in which all legs are used in synchrony, resulting in long flight phases and large jumping heights that may potentially be useful for mobile robots on rough terrain. Robotic instantiations of this gait suffer from severe pitch instability either due to underactuation, or the lack of sufficient feedback. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of this gait suggests that the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum Model (SLIP), a very successful predictive model for both natural and robotic runners, would be a good basis for more robust and maneuverable robotic pronking. In this paper, we describe how \u201ctemplate-based control\u201d, a controller structure based on the embedding of a simple dynamical \u201ctemplate\u201d within a more complex \u201canchor\u201d system, can be used to achieve stable and controllable pronking for a planar, underactuated hexapod model. In this context, high-level control of the gait is regulated through speed and height commands to the SLIP template, while the embedding controller based on approximate inverse-dynamics and carefully designed passive dynamics ensures the stability of the remaining degrees of freedom. We show through extensive simulation experiments that unlike existing open-loop alternatives, the resulting control structure provides stability, explicit maneuverability and significant robustness against sensor and actuator noise.",

The design of the control algorithms is based on the analysis of the rehabilitation protocol taking into account the dynamics of the system and the dynamics of the interaction between the human and the robot. Electromyographic (EMG) signals are used to evaluate patient's effort during training/exercising. The results indicate the great potential of the rehabilitation device as a tool to fasten and improve the ankle therapies outcome.",

The study provides controllability results for the five most common types of robot vehicles: Dubins, Reeds-Shepp, differential drive, car-like and convexified Reeds-Shepp. The challenge of achieving controllability of such systems is that their admissible control domains depend on configuration variables. A theorem of controllability specifical for such systems has been obtained based on known controllability theorems. As a result, we show that pairs of the latter three types are completely controllable, i.e. can be steered between any two arbitrary configurations. The same does not hold for pairs of Dubins or Reeds-Shepp vehicles, and a description of the reachable sets in these cases is provided. Finally, as direct extension of controllability results of pairs of identical vehicles, the controllability results for two kinds of formation of n identical vehicles are presented.",

        "abstract": "We developed a 1 DOF power assist robot for lifting objects. We hypothesized that human's perception of weight due to inertial force might be different from the perceived weight due to gravitational force for lifting an object with a power assist robot. We established psychophysical relationships between the actual weights and the power-assisted weights for the objects lifted with the robot, and also determined the excess in load forces that the subjects applied for three independent lifting schemes or grasp configurations: (i) unimanual lift, (ii) bimanual lift, and (iii) cooperative lift. We also compared the weight perceptual and load force features for the unimanual lifts to that for the bimanual and cooperative lifts. We then modified the power-assist control using a novel control strategy based on the weight perceptual and load force features. The control modification reduced the excessive load forces applied by the subjects in each lifting scheme and thus enhanced maneuverability, naturalness, ease of use, stability, safety etc. of the robot system significantly. Finally, we proposed using the findings to design human-friendly power assist robots for carrying heavy objects in various industries.",

In particular, we consider the problem of using two robotic boats (under-actuated autonomous surface vessels) connected with a floating rope, to \u2018capture\u2019 a floating object from a known location on the water's surface and 'shepherd' it to a designated position. This paper focuses on the cooperative control strategy of the two vessels. Each vessel's behavior is governed by a supervisor software module that handles the communication with the other vessel and controls all elementary tasks that compose the overall mission. The elementary tasks, specifically developed for under-actuated vessels, are arranged by priority, and merged using a behavior-based approach, namely the Null-Space based Behavioral control. The proposed technique is validated by field experiments with two autonomous robotic boats on the surface of a lake.",

        "abstract": "A moving-target-enclosing problem is investigated in the paper, where the velocity of the target is unknown and the neighbor topologies may change over time. Each robot only uses the relative position information of the target and its neighbors that may dynamically change over time. An adaptive scheme is proposed to estimate the velocity of the target. Then a distributed control law for each robot is presented, which consists of two parts: One amounts to ensuring the convergence of the distance between the robots and the target to the desired one and the other is used to achieve the uniform distribution when enclosing the target in motion. Lyapunov-based techniques and graph theory are brought together for rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties. Our control strategy is practically implementable with only onboard sensors. Simulations are provided to illustrate our results.",

This is achieved by exploiting an omnidirectional camera and a PTZ camera, assembled together on a single mount. The two cameras form a single vision sensor, since data obtained processing the two images are used in a cooperative way. This system solves the problem affecting systems based on PTZ cameras only, since it does not exist a tracking system working reliably on PTZ images: the problem is solved here by performing the tracking in the omnidirectional image. This vision sensor is used in a surveillance application, that detects moving objects, and records all the faces of the people walking close to the sensor. It could be used to navigate or instruct a security or a service mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "While there has been substantial progress for multi-robot exploration of an unknown area, little attention has been given to communication, especially bandwidth constraints in time-sensitive and bandwidth-consuming tasks such as search and surveillance. In such tasks, video/audio streams of a newly explored area should be sent back to the base station in a timely manner. To address this issue, we propose Connectivity and Bandwidth Aware eXploration (CBAX), which is an efficient iteration based real-time exploration. CBAX divides the problem into frontier node placement, relay node placement with routing path selection, and the match of each robot with its target position. Moreover, we model bandwidth-constrained relay node placement into a new variant of the Steiner Minimum Tree problem and present our solution. While reducing the exploration time, CBAX maintains the network's connectivity and ensures the aggregated data flows are under the link capacity in transmission. Simulation shows that CBAX outperforms two recent exploration schemes qualitatively by demonstrating major improvement in terms of non-overflow transmission time and fully-connected transmission time. With enhanced communication quality, CBAX still reduces the exploration time, on average, by 40% and 15% respectively. In moderately dense scenarios, CBAX even decreases time by 50% and 25%.",

However, designing locomotion strategies for each configuration is often tedious and has generally relied on a priori known connection geometry. Here we present a framework for 2D modular robots made of square modules assembled with arbitrary geometry, which achieve collective and directed locomotion with no centralized controller. Individual modules communicate locally and provably achieve consensus in coordinating movement in a common travel direction. In experiments with simulations and hardware prototypes, we show that robots achieve effective locomotion, irrespective of the number of modules and their connectivity which can be highly asymmetric.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot navigation in unstructured outdoor environments is a challenging and largely unsolved area of active research. The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths that allow the robot to progress towards a goal while avoiding obstacles. Machine learning techniques are well adapted to this task, accomplishing near-to-far learning by training appearance-based models using near-field stereo readings in order to predict safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. However, these methods are subject to degraded performance when training data sets exhibit class imbalance, or skew, where data instances of one class outnumber those in another. In such scenarios, classifiers can be overwhelmed by the majority class, and will tend to ignore the minority class. In this paper, we show that typical outdoor terrain scenarios are associated with training data imbalance, and examine the impact of using undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and biased penalties techniques to correct for imbalance in stereo-derived training data. We conduct a statistically significant, repeated measures empirical evaluation and demonstrate improved far-field terrain prediction performance when using such methods for handling class imbalance versus taking no corrective action at all.",

We have implemented such a system around the Hadoop cluster with ROS (Robotic Operating system) as the messaging framework for our robotic ecosystem. We explore the possibilities of parallelizing some of the robotics algorithms as Map/Reduce tasks in Hadoop. We implemented the FastSLAM algorithm in Map/Reduce and show how significant performance gains in execution times to build a map of a large area can be achieved with even a very small eight-node Hadoop cluster. The global map can later be shared with other robots introduced in the environment via a Software as a Service (SaaS) Model. This reduces the burden of exploration and map building for the new robot and minimizes it's need for additional sensors. Our primary goal is to develop a cloud computing environment which provides a compute cluster built with commodity hardware exposing a suite of robotic algorithms as a SaaS and share data co-operatively across the robotic ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates a novel mechanism, called DSAC for Dynamic, Single Actuated Climber, which propels itself upwards by oscillating its leg in a symmetric fashion using a single actuator. This mechanism achieves dynamic, vertical motion while retaining simplicity in design and control. We explore the local orbital stability of the DSAC mechanism. We use the Poincar\u00e9 map method with a well chosen Poincar\u00e9 section to simplify the problem by reducing the dimension of the Poincar\u00e9 map to 3-dimensions. We find the stable regions while varying the controls input and some of the mechanism's parameters. Moreover, in response to a continuous change in a parameter of the mechanism, the symmetric and steady stable gait of the mechanism gradually evolves through a regime of period doubling bifurcations.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a DSP integration of sound source localization (SSL) and multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF). To develop a robot audition system, we integrated SSL module and MWF module into a DSP system. SSL is a module to perceive the direction of a human user's call. It measures time delay of arrival among microphones and estimates the direction of sound source. Also, it post-processes the resulted estimations of direction by histogram to perceive the direction robustly under noisy environment. MWF is a module to reduce background noises from raw voice signal to enhance the performance of robot's speech recognition. It gathers information of background noises during noise-period and then reduces noises during voice-period. This SSL-MWF combination system will be a cheap, high-performing and convenient solution for robot audition.",

        "abstract": "Passively adaptive and underactuated robotic hands have shown the potential to achieve reliable grasping in unstructured environments without expensive mechanisms or sensors. Instead of complex run-time algorithms, such hands use design-time analysis to improve performance for a wide range of tasks. Along these directions, we present an optimization framework for underactuated compliant hands. Our approach uses a pre-defined set of grasps in a quasistatic equilibrium formulation to compute the actuation mechanism design parameters that provide optimal performance. We apply our method to a class of tendon-actuated hands; for the simplified design of a two-fingered gripper, we show how a global optimum for the design optimization problem can be computed. We have implemented the results of this analysis in the construction of a gripper prototype, capable of a wide range of grasping tasks over a variety of objects.",

In our previous work, we have introduced a formation abstraction by means of a virtual rectangular grid. The grid was used to ensure collision-free transitions between formations, coordinated by a centralized controller. This paper is an extension of that work, proposing control laws that are computed in a distributed way while still ensuring collision-free formation reconfigurations. Furthermore, we consider an extension of the group rendezvous problem. The agents are required to meet at the rendezvous point and establish consensus on formation state. Again, the grid abstraction is used to describe the formation state. Nonholonomic constraints of agent motion are taken into account explicitly. As our approach is communication-based, we also examine the effects of temporary communication loss.",

This paper develops a method for fast, physically plausible deformations using a sampling-based planner in a reduced dimensionality configuration space containing position, orientation, and a reduced deformation space produced using principal component analysis. A key element of the presented approach is the use of energy constraints in the configuration space designed to remove implausible deformations that may be produced by the principal component analysis dimension reduction process. This approach is tested on several deforming robot planning tasks, such as a sphere fitting through slots, a bendable bar in a maze, and a deforming plate in tunnels, with collision free paths using plausible deformations found in a few minutes.",

Several sensors are integrated into the decision process: The endoscope camera, a stereo camera system, a force/torque sensor, a biomechanical model based on CT data and statistical knowledge, a position and velocity sensor for the manipulator, and interface devices like a foot switch. The executed manipulation primitive is handled by a hybrid controller allowing to switch the control mode (e.g. trajectory following or force control) for each degree of freedom of the task frame individually.",

One challenge in developing a soft robotic system is to drive multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF) with few actuators, thereby reducing system size and weight. This paper presents the analysis and design of an inchworm-like mobile robot that consists of multiple, independent thermally activated joints but is driven by a single actuator. To realize control of this under-actuated system, a solder-based locking mechanism has been developed to selectively activate individual joints without requiring additional actuators. The design and performance analysis of a prototype mobile robot that is capable of inchworm-like translational and steering motion is described. The design of novel \u201cfeet\u201d with anisotropic friction properties is also described.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on casting manipulation and presents an innovative mechanism that allows objects placed in a three-dimensional space to be reached with a relatively small robot. Casting manipulation is a technique by which a robotic end-effector is thrown and its ballistic flight is controlled through a tether cable so as to reach a target object. Previous work presented a solution that is viable only when the position of the target object is perfectly known or aligned with the throwing plane. Our work extends the technique by use of a novel mechanical design of the arm, and a suitable control scheme for the flight of the end-effector, which makes it applicable for objects placed at generic positions in a three-dimensional environment. Effectiveness of the casting robot was shown during the first ESA Lunar Robotics Challenge, where our team came in the second place.",

        "abstract": "Robotic cardiac catheters have the potential to revolutionize heart surgery by extending minimally invasive techniques to complex surgical repairs inside the heart. However, catheter technologies are currently unable to track fast tissue motion, which is required to perform delicate procedures inside a beating heart. This paper proposes an actuated catheter tool that compensates for the motion of heart structures like the mitral valve apparatus by servoing a catheter guidewire inside a flexible sheath. We examine design and operation parameters that affect performance and establish that friction and backlash limit the tracking performance of the catheter system. Based on the results of these experiments and a model of the backlash behavior, we propose and implement compensation methods to improve trajectory tracking performance. The catheter system is evaluated with 3D ultrasound guidance in simulate in vivo conditions. The results demonstrate that with mechanical and control system design improvements, a robotic catheter system can accurately track the fast motion of the human mitral valve.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been gaining popularity over standard imaging modalities like ultrasound and CT because of its ability to provide excellent soft-tissue contrast. However, due to the working principle of MRI, a number of conventional force sensors are not compatible. One popular solution is to develop a fiber-optic force sensor. However, the measurements along the principal axes of a number of these force sensors are highly cross-coupled. One of the objectives of this paper is to minimize this coupling effect. In addition, this paper describes the design of an elastic frame structure that is obtained systematically by an algorithm and not purely based on design intuition. We used a topology optimization technique, which has two major advantages: 1) aids engineers in design when given a constrained boundary, and 2) optimize the displacement amplification, which will in turn increase stiffness, bandwidth, and improve sensing resolution. To ensure that the frames are linked from the input to output, a solution for topology optimization is proposed. The sensor is then fabricated using plastic material (ABS) as it is one of the ideal material for MRI environment. However, the hysteresis effect seen in the displacement-load graph of plastic materials is known to affect the accuracy. Hence, this paper also proposes modeling and addressing this hysteretic effect using Prandtl-Ishlinskii play operators. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the sensor's performance, as well as its compatibility in MRI under continuous imaging.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In search of underwater locomotion methods as alternatives to propellers, systems relying on the propagation of waves along a fin have already been designed and evaluated by several scientists. Considerable effort has been undertaken to optimise their efficiency both by fluid dynamic analysis and experiments on physical prototypes. One drawback of the systems hitherto has been their electro-mechanical complexity in that they required many actuators and refined control strategies to generate the desired fin undulation. Our approach has been to translate the result of these optimisations into a simpler, purely mechanical model relying on the principle of camshafts to achieve a similar undulatory fin motion. The goal was to evaluate whether this type of propulsion system is feasible and whether it was a viable alternative to propellers in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The prototype built during the project, CUTTLEFIN, reached comparable speeds to other undulating robot solutions. Force measurements also showed that the thrust produced is in qualitative accordance to a simplified fluid dynamics model. This makes the camshaft approach a promising option for generating an undulating wave in a membrane-based fin propulsion system, if one is willing to pay the price of lower flexibility compared to current dexterously actuated solutions.",

In the proposed design the UqH has been modeled by a set of Piecewise Affine (PWA) linear equations while the wind gusts effects are embedded in the system model description as the affine terms. In this approach the switching among the PWA model descriptions are ruled by the rate of the rotation angles. In the design of the stabilizing CFTO-controller both the magnitude of external disturbances (worst case applied wind gust), and the mechanical constraints of the UqH such as maximum thrust in the rotors and UqH's angles rate are taken under consideration in order to design an off-line controller that could rapidly be applied to a UqH in a form of a look-up table. The proposed control scheme is applied in experimental studies and multiple test-cases are presented that prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the design of a Redundant Drive Joint with Double Actuation (RDJ-DA) to produce controlled compliant motions over a higher bandwidth. First, our strategies on mechanical and controller designs to produce compliant motions are described, and the basic structure and impedance control of the RDJ-DA with internal serial structure explained. The standard form of the basic structure is introduced using a set of parameters which can be used to express the inertia property of RDJ-DA. Second, a problem statement for the design of RDJ-DAs is described after pointing out that required torques of the second actuator of the RDJ-DA could be large. Then, a basic idea of introducing springs into the second actuator in parallel is proposed as a part of the structural design of RDJ-DA to reduce the large torques. Simulations are conducted to find out a set of the design parameters of RDJ-DA which obtains a higher natural frequency of the output joint admittance satisfying both the desired output joint admittance and the limitations of two identical motors on their performance. Finally, a prototype design of RDJ-DA using the obtained set of the design parameters is presented.",

The multi-disc brake provides resistive torque through a stack of friction discs which are compressed by a dc-motor-driven ball screw. Unlike nearly all other proportional brakes, which operate in a normally unlocked mode, the brake presented here is designed such that it may be configured in either a normally unlocked or normally locked mode. The latter enables lower electrical energy consumption and added safety in the event of electrical power failure in certain applications. Following the device description, experimental data is presented to characterize the performance of the brake. The performance characteristics are subsequently compared to those of a commercially available magnetic particle brake of comparable size.",

An active mechanical docking mechanism provides inter-module connection, along with optical and electrical interface. The docking mechanisms function additionally as driven wheels. Internal slip rings provide unlimited rotary motion to the wheels, allowing the modules to move independently by driving on flat surfaces, or in assemblies negotiating more complex terrain. Modules in the system are mechanically homogeneous, with three identical docking mechanisms within a module. Each mechanical dock is driven by a high torque actuator to enable movement of large segments within a multi-module structure, as well as low-speed driving. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate locomotion, mechanical docking, and lifting of a single module.",

        "abstract": "Small ground robots remain limited in their locomotion capabilities, often prevented from accessing areas restricted by tall obstacles or rough terrain. This paper presents the improved design of a hybrid-locomotion robot made to address this issue. It uses wheels for ground travel and rotary-wing flight for scaling obstacles and flying over rough terrain. The robot's initial design suffered from a number of issues that prevented it from functioning fully, such as overheating motors, inadequate control electronics, and insufficient landing gear. Several improvements have been made to the robot's design to correct these problems. These obstacles, and the solutions implemented in the improved design, have enabled several design principles to be formulated for miniature hybrid-locomotion robots. It is found that hybrid-locomotion vehicles utilizing rotary-wing flight are most useful when the design is optimized for ground mode performance. Collapsibility is necessary in such vehicles to reduce the impact of the helicopter rotor on the size of the ground mode. Finally, since a large number of actions are necessary to propel and transform the robot, integrating multiple functions into each mechanism can reduce the mass of the robot.",

        "abstract": "Jet-boats perform remarkably well at high-speed but lack low speed maneuverability for tight maneuvers such as ducking. This paper presents a low speed omnidirectional propulsion system controlled with a joystick for jet-boats. Two concepts are presented and evaluated. The first concept uses all original parts. The second concept uses a set of fix jet nozzles disposed around the hull. The position and angles of the nozzles are optimized with an index of omnidirectionality quality based on the projection of a set of force solutions on a shell with the shape of the desired force space. A 3D simulator backed by experimental results serves for the evaluation by potential customers of each design. The first concept exhibited poor maneuverability, as it offers ten times less force in sway than in surge. The optimized force space of the second concept is much more uniform, and was unanimously appreciated for its quality of low speed maneuverability. Both designs have been validated experimentally. The present work offers an omnidirectional propulsion system that is easy to enhance with advanced control laws. Velocity feedback control is given as example, and shows important improvement of maneuverability and robustness to miscalibration.",

        "abstract": "For many applications, the control of a complex nonlinear system can be made easier by modeling the system as a collection of simplified hybrid modes, each representing a particular operating regime. An example of this is the decomposition of complex aerobatic flights into sequences of discrete maneuvers, an approach that has proven very successful for both human piloted and autonomously controlled aircraft. However, a critical step when designing such control systems is to ensure the safety and feasibility of transitions between these maneuvers. This work presents a hybrid dynamics framework for the design of guaranteed safe switching regions and is applied to a quadrotor helicopter performing an autonomous backflip. The regions are constructed using reachable sets calculated via a Hamilton-Jacobi differential game formulation, and experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor platform.",

        "abstract": "There have been two major streams for the motion control of mobile robots. The first is the model-based deliberate control and the second is the sensor-based reactive control. Since two schemes have complementary advantages and disadvantages, one cannot completely replace the other. There are a variety of environmental conditions which affect the navigation performances. The main idea of this paper is to design discrete navigation behaviors and to integrate behaviors by an appropriate selection framework. In this paper, we propose a behavior selection framework using the GSPN (Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets). We have designed two navigation behaviors which show completely different performances. In order to define behavior selection criteria, two kinds of navigation statuses are defined to monitor navigation performances of the robot. The proposed navigation strategy is simulated using the open source simulator Player/Stage to investigate the performances in a variety of conditions. Through the simulations, it was made clear that different behaviors show remarkably different performances. Moreover, the average navigation time of the proposed behavior selection framework is significantly decreased than that of any single navigation scheme DWA or tracking.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the modeling activities related to the development of an innovative tendon-driven robotic finger, designed as the fundamental element of a new biologically-inspired artificial hand. The finger is realized in plastic material by means of 3D-printing, a production process that allows a remarkable simplification of the mechanical design. Through 3D-printing, we were able to easily implement solutions that could be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain with conventional manufacturing. A detailed simulation model of the robotic finger has been developed with the aim not only of designing and testing suitable control strategies for the finger, but also of investigating the benefits and the flaws of particular design solutions. As a matter of fact, this approach to design and realization of robotic fingers, that fulfills the requirements in terms of compactness, integration and simplified assembly, has a significant drawback in frictional phenomena on both tendons and joints. For this reason, an adapted LuGre friction model is proposed in order to simulate and study the finger behavior.",

        "abstract": "Suction cups have long been used as a means to grasp and manipulate objects. They enable active control of grasp, enhance grasp stability, and handle some objects such as large flat plates more easily than standard graspers. However, the application of suction cups to object manipulation has been confined to a relatively small, well-defined problem set. Their potential for grasping a large range of unknown objects remains relatively unexplored. This seems in part due to the complexity involved with the design and fabrication of various materials comprising the grasper as well as actuators used to enable grasping. This paper introduces the design of a suction cup that is \u201cself-selecting.\u201d In other words, the suction cups comprising the grasper do not exert any suction force when the cup(s) are not in contact with the object, but instead exert a suction force only when they are in physical contact with the object. Since grasping is achieved purely by passive means, the cost and weight associated with individual sensors, valves, and/or actuators are essentially eliminated. Furthermore, the design permits the use of a central vacuum pump, thereby maximizing the suction force on an object and enabling some suction on surfaces that may prohibit tight seals. This paper presents the design, analysis, fabrication, and experimental results of such a \u201cself-selecting\u201d suction cup array.",

This design provides a compact deployable mechanical architecture that may be inserted through a single \u00d815 mm access port. Dexterous surgical intervention and stereo vision are achieved via the use of two snake-like continuum robots and two controllable CCD cameras. Simulations and dexterity evaluation of our proposed design are compared to several design alternatives with different kinematic arrangements. Results of these simulations show that dexterity is improved by using an independent revolute joint at the tip of a continuum robot instead of achieving distal rotation by transmission of rotation about the backbone of the continuum robot. Further, it is shown that designs with two robotic continuum robots as surgical arms have diminished dexterity if the bases of these arms are close to each other. This result justifies our design and points to ways of improving the performance of existing designs that use continuum robots as surgical arms.",

To the purpose, the use of a surface, GPS-equipped, vehicle and one or several underwater vehicles may be envisaged. The latters can communicate among them by acoustic modems; those devices can also be used as ranging measurement units thus providing an additional information that, together with the common sensor equipment for marine vehicles, might be used for relative localization. This paper investigates how the vehicles' movements can be commanded in order to help the relative localization by a proper analysis of the system observability and a corresponding proper definition of the vehicles movements; critical situations for the relative observability, that corresponds to common movements, are then avoided. Numerical simulations on the mathematical model of the F\u00f2laga hybrid underwater vehicle confirm the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated behavioral approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new desktop orthogonal-type robot, which has abilities of compliant motion and stick-slip motion, is first presented for lapping small metallic molds with curved surface. The robot consists of three single-axis devices with a high position resolution of 1 \u03bcm. A thin wood stick tool is attached to the tip of the z-axis. The tool tip has a small ball-end shape. The control system is composed of a force feedback loop, position feedback loop and position feedforward loop. The force feedback loop controls the polishing force consisting of tool contact force and kinetic friction forces. The position feedback loop controls the position in pick feed direction, e.g., z-direction. The position feedforward loop leads the tool tip along a desired trajectory called cutter location data (CL data). The CL data are generated from the main-processor of a CAM system. The proposed robot realizes a compliant motion required for the surface following control along a spiral path. In order to improve the lapping performance, a small stick-slip motion control strategy is further added to the control system. The small stick-slip motion is orthogonally generated to the direction of the tool moving direction. Generally, the stick-slip motion is an undesirable phenomenon and should be eliminated in precision machineries. However, the proposed robot employs a small stick-slip motion to improve the lapping quality. The effectiveness of the robot is examined through an actual lapping test of an LED lens mold with a diameter of 4 mm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The use of unmanned autonomous vehicles is becoming more and more significant in recent years. The fact that the vehicles are unmanned (whether autonomous or not), can lead to greater difficulties in identifying failure and anomalous states, since the operator cannot rely on its own body perceptions to identify failures. Moreover, as the autonomy of unmanned vehicles increases, it becomes more difficult for operators to monitor them closely, and this further exacerbates the difficulty of identifying anomalous states, in a timely manner. Model-based diagnosis and fault-detection systems have been proposed to recognize failures. However, these rely on the capabilities of the underlying model, which necessarily abstracts away from the physical reality of the robot. In this paper we propose a novel, model-free, approach for detecting anomalies in unmanned autonomous vehicles, based on their sensor readings (internal and external). Experiments conducted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) demonstrate the efficacy of the approach by detecting the vehicles deviations from nominal behavior.",

        "abstract": "A team of robots cooperating to quickly produce a map needs to share landmark information between members so that the local maps can be accurately merged. However, the appearance of landmarks as seen by members of the team can change dramatically due to the phenomenon of occlusion. We have previously presented an approach to landmark representation using Terrain Spatiograms an extension to image spatiograms in which the spatial information relates to the scene rather than the image. Because this representation preserves depth structure, it is possible to identify and filter potential occlusions. We present an approach to identifying and filtering occlusions using terrain spatiograms, and report experimental results on 20 landmark datasets for varying states of occlusion. We show that occlusion can be detected and filtered, resulting in improved landmark matching scores.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Over the past few years, the virtual metrology (VM) technology has been proposed and developed and several VM related papers have been published. These proposed VM architectures are mainly applied for conjecturing single-stage or direct processing quality. However, the processing quality of some of manufacturing processes cannot be measured directly. Those single-stage VM architectures may not be applied to handle this indirect VM problem accurately. To properly handle this indirect VM problem, the paper proposes a dual-stage indirect VM architecture (DIVMA), which involves two process tools, to handle the indirect VM problem. In Stage I, the direct VM model of the fore-tool is established as usual, and then the indirect VM model of the rear-tool is built in Stage II that involves the Stage-I VM output. The concept of virtual cassette is also proposed in the paper. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process of a fifth generation TFT-LCD fab in Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation (CMO), Taiwan is adopted to test and compare the conjecture accuracy without and with the virtual cassette and the proposed DIVMA. Experimental results demonstrate that the virtual-cassette concept is valid for improving VM conjecturing accuracy; also this DIVMA is adequate for handling the indirect VM problem that has a coupling effect between those two subsequent tools.",

The robot employs an actuated needle guide with the goal of reducing interventional procedure times and increasing needle placement accuracy. The design of the robot, employing piezo-ceramic-motor actuated needle guide positioning and manual needle insertion, is reported. Results of a MRI compatibility study show no reduction of MRI image signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) with the motors disabled and a 40% to 60% reduction in SNR with the motors enabled. The addition of radio-frequency (RF) shielding is shown to significantly reduce image SNR degradation due to the presence of the robotic device.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 2-DOF controlled softness display and its application to a tactile tele-presentation system. It has been reported that softness feelings can be displayed by reproducing contact area, or contact width, on a fingertip. Several softness displays based on the contact area control have been reported in past studies, but all of them had only one degree-of-freedom (DOF) for their contact area control. Resultantly, the reproduced contact area was symmetric, which could only produce uniform surface feelings. In some practical deformable surfaces, however, the contact conditions are not uniform over fingertip surfaces; for example, if there is a small lump beneath a soft deformable surface, resultant contact area can become asymmetric. To reproduce such asymmetric contact conditions, a softness display should have more controlled DOFs. This paper reports our trial to realize a multi-DOF controlled softness display. As a first step, this particular paper describes a 2-DOF controlled display. The display has two DC motors which independently control both sides of the contact area. Resultant asymmetric contact area can facilitate, e.g., discrimination of lump location in soft deformable surfaces. The display was integrated into a tactile tele-presentation system together with a contact width sensor, which measures asymmetric contact condition. Using the tele-presentation system, discriminations of lump location are demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents our recently developed humanoid neck system that can effectively mimic motion of human neck with very low motion noises. The feature of low motion noises allows our system to work like a real human head/neck. Thus the level of acoustic noises from wearable equipments, such as donning respirators or chemical-resistant jackets, induced by human head motion can be simulated and investigated using such a system. The objective of this investigation is to facilitate using head-worn communication devices for the person who wears the protective equipment/uniform that usually produces communication-noise when the head/neck moves. Our low motion-noise humanoid neck system is based on the spring structure, which can generate 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) jaw movement and 3DOF neck movement. To guarantee the low-noise feature, no noise-makers like gear and electro-driven parts are embedded in the head/neck structure. Instead, the motions are driven by seven cables, and the actuators pulling the cables are sealed in a sound insulation box. Furthermore, statics analysis of the system has been processed completely. Experimental results validate the analysis, and clearly show that the head/neck system can greatly mimic the motions of human head with an A-weighted noise level of 30 dB or below.",

For the accurate needle positioning, a number of robotic assistants have been developed. However, problems exist due to the strong magnetic field and limited workspace. Pneumatically actuated robots have shown the minimum distraction in the environment but the confined workspace limits optimal robot design and thus controllability is often poor. To overcome the problem, a simple external damping mechanism using timing belts was sought and a 1-DOF mechanism test result indicated sufficient positioning accuracy. Based on the damping mechanism and modular system design approach, a new workspace-optimized 4-DOF parallel robot was developed for the MRI-guided prostate biopsy and brachytherapy. A preliminary evaluation of the robot was conducted using previously developed pneumatic controller and satisfying results were obtained.",

Tactile information is evaluated by measuring the expansion process. In this paper, we developed a sensor system using syringe. It is a compact system and can ensure enough safety for human body tissues in safe contact, using no electric power, and sterilization. Pressure changes and volume changes of the balloon can be measured together in the balloon expansion. First, overview of the developed sensor system is presented. Next, composition of the sensor system and the sensing process are presented. Then, experiments using the developed sensor are conducted on samples with different stiffness and surface conditions. Features extracted from sensor outputs indicate that the sensor can know the difference both the stiffness and surface condition. The results show the validity of the proposed sensor system.",

This paper discusses this exact topic, and proposes a three-wheeled configuration which stabilizes the horizontal posture of the vehicle's driver in rough terrain. The merits of such a machine are examined; in addition, a mechanism here called sliding-rod-end is introduced, and the reasons for its use instead of regular rod ends are explained. A full-scale prototype of the machine was built and is briefly presented.",

This hand has large holding capacity and shape adaptability to grasp objects. The experiments show that maximum holding force of the hand is 5000N. It can hold three types of different shaped objects; cylindrical objects of \u03c6 267mm and \u03c6 165mm in diameter and a square cross section of width 200mm in side.

We have developed an intelligently controllable AFO (i-AFO) in which the ankle torque is controlled by a compact magnetorheological fluid brake. Gait-control tests with the i-AFO were performed for a patient with flaccid paralysis of the ankles, who has difficulty in voluntary movement of the peripheral part of the inferior limb, and physical limitations on his ankles. By using the i-AFO, his gait control was improved by prevention of drop foot in the swing phase and by forward promotion in the stance phase.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses how mobile manipulators with an under-actuated vertical arm can be designed to be differentially flat. The property of differential flatness is achieved by appropriate inertia redistribution of the vertical arm and a wide range of under-actuation becomes possible. As a result of having the flatness property, the under-actuated mobile manipulators are capable of executing point-to-point maneuvers as mobile manipulators with a fully actuated arm would do. In addition, the trajectory planning and feedback controller design for point-to-point motions in state space is considerably simplified despite the under-actuation of the arm and nonholonomic constraints (from no-slip assumption) of the mobile base, which make the system more difficult to plan and control. These ideas are demonstrated through an illustrative example of a mobile manipulator consisting of an under-actuated vertical three-link arm and a two-wheeled differentially driven mobile base using differential flatness.",

In this work, we contribute an approach for learning precise reaching trajectories for robotic manipulators. We use dimensionality reduction to smooth the example trajectories and transform their representation to a space more amenable to planning. Key to this approach is the careful selection of neighboring points within and between trajectories. This algorithm is capable of creating efficient, collision-free plans even under typical real-world training conditions such as incomplete sensor coverage and lack of an environment model, without imposing additional requirements upon the user such as constraining the types of example trajectories provided. Experimental results are presented to validate this approach.",

A new class of N-dimensional vector fields, the dipole-like vector fields is proposed, inspired by the form of the flow lines of the electric point dipole. A general connection between the dipole-like field and the Pfaffian constraints of catastatic nonholonomic systems is exploited, to establish systematic guidelines on the design of stabilizing control laws. The methodology is applied to the stabilization of the unicycle and of the nonholonomic double integrator. Based on these guidelines, switching control laws are constructed. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated through simulation results.",

        "abstract": "The main aspect in multi-robot exploration is the efficient coordination of a group of robots. Inspired by previous results on the coverage problem, we propose a novel, frontier-based approach for multi-robot exploration. This approach merges the step of choosing appropriate target points with the step of planning a collision-free path. This is achieved by optimizing an objective function consisting of distance and orientation costs as well as an estimated information gain. The optimization yields motion control laws directly solving the exploration task. Using a Voronoi partition of the environment ensures, that each robot autonomously creates and optimizes the objective function to obtain a collision-free path in a distributed fashion. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

We begin with the observation that for any workspace which is topologically connected (i.e. does not contain free flying islands) there exists a single surface that covers the entirety of the workspace. We call this surface the covering surface. We assume that while this surface is complex and self intersecting every point on it can be imaged from a suitable camera pose and furthermore that it is locally smooth at some finite scale - it is a manifold. We show how by representing the covering surface as a non-planar graph of observed pixels we are able to plan new views and importantly fuse disparity maps from multiple views. The resulting graph can be lifted to 3D to yield a full scene reconstruction.",

The driving force of the passive mobile robot is an actual force applied by the human and the servo brakes attached to the wheels control its motion. Different from the active-type robot with servo motors, the passive robot has the control limitation based on the brake constraint. In this paper, we consider a feasible region for the brake control of the robot and propose a distributed motion control algorithm of the multiple passive mobile robots for handling a large object along the desired path, in which each robot compensates the control input required by other robots which do not generate it because of the brake constraint. We apply the proposed algorithm to two passive mobile robots called PRP experimentally and they realize an object handling along the desired path accurately.",

        "abstract": "Distributed linear estimation theory has received increased attention in recent years due to several promising industrial applications. Distributed nonlinear estimation, however is still a relatively unexplored field despite the need in numerous practical situations for techniques that can handle nonlinearities. This paper presents a unified way of describing distributed implementations of three commonly used nonlinear estimators: the Extended Kalman Filter, the Unscented Kalman Filter and the Particle Filter. Leveraging on the presented framework, we propose new distributed versions of these methods, in which the nonlinearities are locally managed by the various sensors whereas the different estimates are merged based on a weighted average consensus process. The proposed versions are shown to outperform the few published ones in two robot localization test cases.",

We present a distributed algorithm built around guaranteeing complete coverage of the frontier between cleared and contaminated areas while expanding the cleared area. Our frontier-based algorithm can guarantee detection of evaders in unknown, multiply-connected planar environments which may be non-polygonal. We also detail a method for storing and updating the global frontier between cleared and contaminated areas without building a global map or requiring global localization, which enables our algorithm to be truly distributed.

We consider the case where each sensor node is equipped with sophisticated sensors capable of giving a map for its sensing region. We propose a distributed sampling based planning framework (Distributed PRM), where every sensor node creates a local roadmap in its locally-sensed environment; these local roadmaps are \u201cstitched\u201d together by passing messages among nodes and form a larger implicit roadmap without having a global representation. Based on the implicit roadmap, a feasible path is computed in a distributed manner, and the robot moves along the path by interacting with sensor nodes, each of which gives a portion of the path within the local environment of the node. Preliminary simulations show the proposed framework is able to solve path planning problem with low communication overhead.",

The system extracts essential knowledge about the foreground, like moving persons, and the background, which consists of all visible static scene parts. In contrast to other 3D reconstruction approaches, we suggest to additionally distinguish between static parts, like walls, and movable objects like chairs or doors. The discrimination supports the reconstruction process and additionally, delivers important information about interaction objects. Here, the movable object detection is realized object independent by analyzing changes in the scenery. Furthermore, in the proposed system the background scene is feedbacked to the tracking part yielding a much better tracking and detection result which improves again the 3D reconstruction. We show in our experiments that we are able to provide a sound background model and to extract simultaneously persons and object regions representing chairs, doors, and even smaller movable objects.",

Simultaneously, the robots communicate and build a global map of the environment. The communication between the robots is limited, and, at every time instant, each robot can only exchange data with its neighboring robots. We provide a distributed solution to the problem which does not rely on any particular communication topology and is robust to changes in the topology. Each robot computes and tracks the global map based on local interactions with its neighbors. Our contribution is the extension of distributed sensor fusion ideas to the problem of dynamic map merging. Under mild connectivity conditions on the communication graph, this algorithm asymptotically converges to the global map. The real experiments have been carried out with visual information, which is of special interest in robotics.",

The main contributions are: (i) a view- and texture independent scheme that exploits facial action parameters estimated by an appearance-based 3D face tracker; (ii) the complexity of the non-linear facial expression space is modelled through a manifold, whose structure is learned using Laplacian Eigenmaps. The projected facial expressions are afterwards recognized based on Nearest Neighbor classifier; (iii) with the proposed approach, we developed an application for an AIBO robot, in which it mirrors the perceived facial expression.",

        "abstract": "A new approach for adaptive torque distribution of 4-Powered Caster Vehicle (4-PCV) is presented on complex terrain without any additional sensor. The objective is that torques applied to wheels are dynamically redistributed based on the real time conditions of the whole wheel-ground interactions in order to track the desired trajectory. A novel approach based on the redundant actuated wheels is proposed to identify the status of the vehicle and the wheel slip ratio by only observing the velocity feedback from motors encoders. A dynamic model considering the wheel-ground interaction is described. Based on the slip ratio of the wheel joints and the null space of the operational space, control strategies are employed to redistribute the torques applied to the wheel joints so that each wheel can be self-adapted to meet a complex wheel-ground condition to eliminate slippage with high rate. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed estimation approach and the performance of the torque distribution schemes.",

In our previous works, a dynamic object grasping method without use of any external sensing, called \u201cthe Blind Grasping\u201d, has been proposed. Although stable grasping in a dynamic sense has been realized by the method, a simultaneous object position and attitude control has not yet been treated, so far. In this paper, instead of using any information of the real object position and attitude, virtual data of object position and attitude are introduced by defining a virtual frame. By using the virtual information, a control signal to regulate the virtual object position and attitude without use of any external sensing is designed. The usefulness of our proposed control method even under the existence of nonholonomic rolling constraints is illustrated through a numerical simulation result.",

For a given database of object models, we consider the problem of identifying an object known to belong to the database and where to move next should the object not be easily identifiable from the initial viewpoint. No constraints on the motion of the object nor the robot itself are assumed, which is an improvement on previous methods. Sensor planning is based on the selection of the control action that optimizes a cost metric based on information gain. Experimental results from the implementation of the method on a two-wheeled nonholonomic robot are presented to illustrate and validate the method.",

Specifically, a network of robotic vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, location and on-site service are stochastic; moreover, once a demand arrives, it remains active for a stochastic amount of time, and then expires. An active demand is successfully serviced when one of the vehicles visits its location before its deadline and provide the required on-site service. The aim is to find the minimum number of vehicles needed to ensure that the steady-state probability that a demand is successfully serviced is larger than a desired value, and to determine the policy the vehicles should execute to ensure that such objective is attained. First, we carefully formulate the problem, and we show its well-posedness by providing some novel ergodic results. Second, we provide a lower bound on the optimal number of vehicles; finally, we analyze two service policies, and we show that one of them is optimal in light load. Simulation results are presented and discussed.",

In this paper, the validation of the developed signal processing algorithm to recognize the rollover was focused. Firstly, the ElectroMechanicalDelay of the internal oblique muscle was measured as the about 65 (msec). Secondly, it was confirmed that the rollover movement was recognized about 65 (msec) before the movement started. Therefore, the developed Micro Macro Neural Network (MMNN) recognized the rollover movement using the EMG signal as quick as possible. Finally, the robustness of the developed MMNN was discussed by conducting the experiment to discriminate between the rollover and turning out. We proposed and developed the original algorithm in which the logical XOR operation was added to the MMNN, because the MMNN which learned the characteristics of the only rollover recognized the turning out movement as the rollover movement perfectly. When the proposed algorithm that combined the MMNN and XOR operator was used, the rollover and turning out movements were discriminated 83%.",

Several teleoperation control strategies (impedance, hybrid control, 3-channel) have been tested and compared in order to evaluate their performances. The last has shown the best behavior in term of haptic feedback. Finally, a focus is made on the application, and how various manipulation and operation tasks can be performed to assess the system's performances (contact wall, objects manipulation, screwing). Users who tested the system were very impressed by the easiness of operation with the exoskeleton and felt the advantages of a force feedback information.",

        "abstract": "Human motion coordination is a long-standing research issue in biomechanics, and it should also have some implications for humanoid robot control.We have built a whole-body somatosensory reflex model based on our neuromusculoskeletal model and identified its parameters through non-invasive measurements and statistical analysis. Such models are crucial for analyzing and estimating signals in the nervous system. In this paper, we focus on signal transmission delay of the somatosensory reflex loop and investigate its relationship with the generalization capability of the reflex model. We obtain some sets of model parameters assuming different time delays using the data obtained from a stepping motion, and perform cross validations against stepping motions with different cycles as well as entirely different behaviors such as squat and jump. Interestingly, time delays close to the value expected from physiological properties show better cross-validation results than others. This result suggests that relatively simple reflex control can be generalized to multiple behaviors if the parameters are appropriate, and that robust control is possible even with large feedback delay.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a new approach to shared control to assist wheelchair driving. Rather than swapping control from human to robot either by request or on a need basis, the system estimates how much help is needed in a reactive fashion and continuously produces an emergent motory command in combination with human input. To provide time stability and integration, instant commands are modulated by a factor depending on human efficiency in a shifting time window. Thus, the better the person drives, the more control he/she is awarded with. The approach has been tested at Fondazione Santa Lucia (FSL) in Rome with volunteers presenting different disabilities. All volunteers managed to finish a mildly complicated trajectory with door crossing and major turns and the proposed system increased efficiency in all cases.",

In this paper we carefully analyze this new approach and apply dimensionality reduction techniques to decrease the number of features that need to be computed in order to classify whether a given pixel in an image is associated with a good or bad grasping point. Exploiting the ideas behind principal component analysis, we formulate two hypotheses about possible ways to eliminate certain features from training and classification. We then experimentally verify that the feature reduction significantly improves speed while retaining classification accuracy. Overall, the combination of the two hypotheses leads to a speedup factor of almost ten. The hypotheses are validated on third party synthetic data and also demonstrated on a seven degrees-of-freedom manipulator.",

Our approach builds upon a state of the art single-view algorithm which recognizes and registers learned metric 3D models using local descriptors. We extend to multiple views using a novel multi-step optimization that processes each view individually and feeds consistent hypotheses back to the algorithm for global refinement. We demonstrate that our method produces results comparable to the theoretical optimum, a full multi-view generalized camera approach, while avoiding its combinatorial time complexity. We provide experimental results demonstrating pose accuracy, speed, and robustness to model error using a three-camera rig, as well as a physical implementation of the pose output being used by an autonomous robot executing grasps in highly cluttered scenes.",

The agent has partial information of each target's pose, and must reason about its uncertainty of the targets' poses when planning subsequent actions. We present an online, forward-search algorithm for planning under uncertainty by representing the agent's belief of each target's pose as a multi-modal Gaussian belief. We exploit this parametric belief representation to directly compute the distribution of posterior beliefs after actions are taken. This analytic computation not only enables us to plan in problems with continuous observation spaces, but also allows the agent to search deeper by considering policies composed of multi-step action sequences; deeper searches better enable the agent to keep the targets well-localized. We present experimental results in simulation, as well as demonstrate the algorithm on an actual quadrotor helicopter tracking multiple vehicles on a road network constructed indoors.",

The proposed abstraction architecture is demonstrated for hardware independence and failure detection on two different manipulator platforms.",

        "abstract": "Cable robots have seen considerable recent interest ensuing from their ability to combine a large workspace with significant payload capacity. However, the cables can apply forces to the end-effector only when they are in tension, and thus form a subclass of control problems requiring unilateral control inputs. Furthermore, actuation redundancy occurs when surplus cables are introduced within the system. On one hand, such redundancy needs to be carefully resolved for accurate tracking of the task. On the other hand, it allows the redistribution of the actuation forces to satisfy some secondary criteria. In this paper, we apply such redundancy for enhanced trajectory tracking by actively controlling the task stiffness of the end-effector. The scheme allow us to specify a lower bound of the task stiffness, which is intended to provide improved trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection performance. Finally, we illustrate the improved control performance within a virtual prototype cosimulation framework.",

        "abstract": "The safety problem in multi-vehicle systems seeks to establish collision-free and live vehicle motion, and it is a prominent problem for many configurations of these environments. Past work studying this problem in the context of free-range vehicular systems through abstractions based on Resource Allocation System (RAS) theory, has implicitly assumed that its resolution through maximally permissive supervision is NP-hard, and therefore, it has typically pursued suboptimal (i.e., more restrictive) solutions. The work presented in this paper offers formal proof to this implicit assumption, closing the apparent gap in the existing literature.",

We use a multi-scale probabilistic model in order to characterize the channel and develop an estimator based on this model. We show that our model-based approach can estimate the channel well for several scenarios, with only a small number of gathered measurements. We furthermore consider a sparsity-based channel estimation approach, in which we utilize the compressibility of the channel in the frequency domain. Our results show that this approach can also be effective in several scenarios. We then discuss the underlying tradeoffs between the two approaches. For the model-based approach, we show the impact of the error in the underlying model as well as the error in the estimation of the parameters of the model on the overall performance. For the sparsity-based approach, we show the impact of channel compressibility on the performance. Overall, the proposed framework can be utilized for communication-aware motion planning in robotic networks, where a prediction of the link qualities is needed.",

        "abstract": "Pathological tremor constitutes the most common movement disorder, and is increasing its prevalence with ageing. Treatment forms range from drugs to surgery in those patients refractory to drugs, however, tremor is not effectively managed in about 25% of patients. According to this, new management techniques such as wearable robots that take advantage of selective biomechanical loading seem an interesting alternative. Our objective is to design robotic exoskeletons which suppress tremor, letting the user perform a voluntary movement, by means of intelligent control approaches that include accurate tremor models. In this context, we propose a two-stage algorithm for real-time estimation of time varying tremor amplitude and frequency. It is based on the assumption that tremor alters voluntary motion in an additive manner, and happens in a higher frequency band. The two-stage algorithm first generates an estimation of voluntary movement based on its inherent slower dynamics, and then removes it from the total motion, directly providing an estimate of tremor. This tremor estimation is then fed into an adaptive filter, which provides instantaneous tremor characteristics. Accurate and robust tremor amplitude and frequency estimates are obtained.",

When such a needle is inserted into soft tissue, it bends due to the asymmetric geometry of the bevel tip. This insertion with bending is not completely repeatable. We characterize the deviations in needle tip pose (position and orientation) by performing repeated needle insertions into artificial tissue. The base of the needle is pushed at a constant speed without rotating, and the covariance of the distribution of the needle tip pose is computed from experimental data. We develop the closed-form equations to describe how the covariance varies with different model parameters. We estimate the model parameters by matching the closed-form covariance and the experimentally obtained covariance. In this work, we use a needle model modified from a previously developed model with two noise parameters. The modified needle model uses three noise parameters to better capture the stochastic behavior of the needle insertion. The modified needle model provides an improvement of the covariance error from 26.1% to 6.55%.",

        "abstract": "This paper is aimed at implementing Eulerian ZMP Resolution method to bipedal walking pattern generation. The main strategy in this method is to ensure the dynamic balance by generating feasible ZMP-based CoM trajectories. For this purpose, we employ ZMP equations in spherical coordinates, so that the intrinsic angular momentum rate change about center of mass is included explicitly in a natural way. This fact results in two merits: 1) Undesired torso angle fluctuation and body twists are expected to be more restrainable comparing to other methods in which intrinsic angular momentum information is ignored or zero-referenced. 2) The interference between motions in sagittal and lateral planes can be extracted. In this article, we mainly investigate the first merit and briefly discuss about the second merit. Applying the aforementioned technique, Eulerian ZMP Resolution, we simulated bipedal walking on a 3-D dynamic simulator. Secondarily, we conducted bipedal walking experiments on the actual bipedal robot. In conclusion, we obtained dynamically equilibrated bipedal walking cycles, which satisfactorily verify the efficiency of Eulerian ZMP Resolution technique over conventional methods.",

This problem, a variant of pursuit-evasion, has been largely studied, following a systematic treatment by increasingly relaxing a number of restrictions. In, we considered a scenario where the pursuer and the evader move at bound speed, traveling around a known, 2D environment, which contains obstacles. Then, considering that, in an attempt to escape, the evader travels the shortest path to reach a potential escape region, we provided a decision procedure that determines whether or not the pursuer is up to maintain visibility of the evader and obtained complexity measures of this surveillance task. In this paper, we prove that there are cases for which an evader may escape only if it does not travel the shortest path to an escapable region. We introduce planning strategies for the movement of the pursuer that keeps track of the evader, even if the evader chooses not to travel the shortest path to an escape region. We also present a sufficient condition for the evader to escape that does not depend on the initial positions of the players. It can be verified only using the environment. All our algorithms have been implemented and we show simulation results.",

The approach is systematically evaluated by using automatically generated trajectories sharing similarities with human gestures. The proposed approach is contrasted with four state-of-the-art methods previously proposed in robotics to learn and reproduce new skills by imitation. An experiment with a 7 DOFs robotic arm learning and reproducing the motion of hitting a ball with a table tennis racket is then presented to illustrate the approach.",

        "abstract": "Insertion velocity, tip asymmetry, and shaft diameter may influence steerable needle insertion paths in soft tissue. In this paper we examine the effects of these variables on needle paths in ex vivo goat liver, and demonstrate practical applications of robotic needle steering for ablation, biopsy, and brachytherapy. All experiments were performed using a new portable needle steering robot that steers asymmetric-tip needles under fluoroscopic imaging. For bevel-tip needles, we found that larger diameter needles resulted in less curvature, i.e. less steerability, confirming previous experiments in artificial tissue. The needles steered with radii of curvature ranging from 3.4 cm (for the most steerable pre-bent needle) to 2.97 m (for the least steerable bevel needle). Pre-bend angle significantly affected needle curvature, but bevel angle did not. We hypothesize that biological tissue characteristics such as inhomogeneity and viscoelasticity significantly increase path variability. These results underscore the need for closed-loop image guidance for needle steering in biological tissues with complex internal structure.",

        "abstract": "Water, recognized as one of the most important and endangered resources to mankind, is very difficult to monitor in real time using conventional methods. Thanks to recent advancements in technology, the use of robots, able to fulfill missions such as sampling from aquatic environments, becomes feasible and can increase dramatically the quality of water monitoring. Due to the complications for the robot's movement in some aquatic scenarios, for instance, shallow waters or dry banks of rivers and lakes, amphibian locomotion appears to be necessary to guarantee a satisfying coverage of the monitoring activities in such areas. In this paper, we focus on developing a practical amphibian solution by introducing a pair of screw rotors, which rotate in opposite directions to generate locomotion on the ground. The primitive idea of this novel design is to enhance the versatility of a marine robot with a terrestrial locomotion without undermining its performance during the movements in the water. In particular, we elaborate the principle of this novel design and present some test results of a prototype on selected terrain types, which are similar to the target aquatic environment. We conclude the paper with some preliminary conclusions based on the analysis of the test results about effectiveness and efficiency issues.",

In many cases, specially involving legged robots, like the Robocup soccer competition, it relies on predefined landmarks at known locations. However, when several objects are in motion, vision occlusions due to agents in the field of view make this kind of localization unfeasible for mild time periods. This also happens if landmarks are not within the field of view. This paper presents a technique to let a robot estimate its position with respect to objects or robots by sharing whatever visual data it has with its teammates. Shared data is used to estimate the relative positions of robots watching the same object via stereoscopy. The rest of the robots can be localized via triangulation and acquire information on the position of hidden or unknown objects that other members of the team can see. The system has been tested with two Aibo ERS 7 robots from Sony and an Aiball.",

        "abstract": "We propose a planning algorithm that allows user-supplied domain knowledge to be exploited in the synthesis of information feedback policies for systems modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). POMDP models, which are increasingly popular in the robotics literature, permit a planner to consider future uncertainty in both the application of actions and sensing of observations. With our approach, domain experts can inject specialized knowledge into the planning process by providing a set of local policies that are used as primitives by the planner. If the local policies are chosen appropriately, the planner can evaluate further into the future, even for large problems, which can lead to better overall policies at decreased computational cost. We use a structured approach to encode the provided domain knowledge into the value function approximation. We demonstrate our approach on a multi-robot fire fighting problem, in which a team of robots cooperates to extinguish a spreading fire, modeled as a stochastic process. The state space for this problem is significantly larger than is typical in the POMDP literature, and the geometry of the problem allows for the application of an intuitive set of local policies, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel object manipulation method by using a dual soft-fingered robotic hand system, in which each fingertip has a torsional joint. By using the torsional motion of the fingertips, a novel 3-dimensional dynamic object manipulation without use of any external sensing can be achieved even though the hand system has only two fingers. Firstly, our proposed system, which includes contact models between each fingertip and surfaces of an object, is modeled. A rolling contact between each fingertip and the object surfaces can be allowed because our proposed system has soft and deformable hemispheric fingertips. Moreover, a torsional contact model between each fingertip and the object surfaces is newly proposed. It is based on an assumption that the torsional motion induces an elastic strain potential. Secondly, a dynamic object manipulation control method is designed. The control signal is composed of four parts, the one is for grasping the object stably, the second one is for controlling a position of the object, the third one is for controlling an attitude of the object, and the last one is for the torsional fingertip motion. A numerical simulation based on our model is performed, and a manipulation experiment by using our developed setup is performed. The usefulness of our proposed method is demonstrated through these results.",

Existing detectors tend to exploit characteristics of specific environments: corners and lines from indoor (rectilinear) environments, and trees from outdoor environments. While these detectors work well in their intended environments, their performance in different environments can be very poor. We describe a general purpose feature detector for LIDAR data that is applicable to virtually any environment. Our methods adapt classic feature detection methods from the image processing literature, specifically the multi-scale Kanade-Tomasi corner detector. Our resulting method is capable of identifying stable features at a variety of spatial scales and produces uncertainty estimates for use in a state estimation algorithm. We present results on standard datasets, including Victoria Park and Intel Research Center (both 2D), and the MIT DARPA Urban Challenge dataset (3D).",

The algebraic least-squares fit usually considered in the literature is biased, although it is fast to compute. We extend our previous work in planar patch extraction using a detailed sensor noise model to the extraction of quadrics. First, the fast least-squares method is modified to detect degeneracy automatically and it is used to aid segmentation. The final segmented quadric patch is then refined using a numerical maximum likelihood approach which employs the sensor range error model. Experimental results for artificial data and two different 3D sensors are provided to show the feasibility of our approach.",

The problem is exacerbated in the outdoors where continuous change in sun angle can drastically affect the appearance of a scene. We confront this challenge by fusing the probabilistic local feature based data association method of FAB-MAP with the pose cell filtering and experience mapping of RatSLAM. We evaluate the effectiveness of our amalgamation of methods using five datasets captured throughout the day from a single camera driven through a network of suburban streets. We show further results when the streets are re-visited three weeks later, and draw conclusions on the value of the system for lifelong mapping.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a probabilistic framework for appearance based navigation and mapping using spatial and visual appearance data. Like much recent work on appearance based navigation we adopt a bag-of-words approach in which positive or negative observations of visual words in a scene are used to discriminate between already visited and new places. In this paper we add an important extra dimension to the approach. We explicitly model the spatial distribution of visual words as a random graph in which nodes are visual words and edges are distributions over distances. Care is taken to ensure that the spatial model is able to capture the multi-modal distributions of inter-word spacing and account for sensor errors both in word detection and distances. Crucially, these inter-word distances are viewpoint invariant and collectively constitute strong place signatures and hence the impact of using both spatial and visual appearance is marked. We provide results illustrating a tremendous increase in precision-recall area compared to a state-of-the-art visual appearance only systems.",

        "abstract": "Local image features are used for a wide range of applications in computer vision and range imaging. While there is a great variety of detector-descriptor combinations for image data and 3D point clouds, there is no general method readily available for 2D range data. For this reason, the paper first proposes a set of benchmark experiments on detector repeatability and descriptor matching performance using known indoor and outdoor data sets for robot navigation. Secondly, the paper introduces FLIRT that stands for Fast Laser Interest Region Transform, a multi-scale interest region operator for 2D range data. FLIRT combines the best detector with the best descriptor, experimentally found in a comprehensive analysis of alternative detector and descriptor approaches. The analysis yields repeatability and matching performance results similar to the values found for features in the computer vision literature, encouraging a wide range of applications of FLIRT on 2D range data. We finally show how FLIRT can be used in conjunction with RANSAC to address the loop closing/global localization problem in SLAM in indoor as well as outdoor environments. The results demonstrate that FLIRT features have a great potential for robot navigation in terms of precision-recall performance, efficiency and generality.",

        "abstract": "FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) devices have emerged as a new type of reconfigurable high-performance computing hardware. Despite their successful applications in a variety of areas, FPGA devices are just about to find their way into the control systems. In this paper, a FPGA-based adaptive friction compensation scheme with a FPGA-based velocity estimator is reported for the first time. The FPGA device allows the LuGre friction model to be effectively implemented and updated at a clock rate. A parameter adaptation mechanism automatically accommodates the parameter uncertainties. To avert the need of having a division computation, which is extremely difficult if not impossible for a FPGA device to perform, a specially designed accumulator is used to create the velocity signal necessarily required for high-precision position tracking control. The developed technology is experimentally tested on a harmonic drive coupled with a brushless motor. The ratio of the maximum position tracking error to the maximum velocity reaches 0.00034 (s) - an unprecedented number in the precision control of harmonic drives.",

Furthermore, robot built structures can be constructed in environments such as surface of Mars or in micro-gravity, which would otherwise be too time consuming or dangerous for humans. In this paper we discuss some of the mechanical design challenges of developing a passive robotically-reconfigurable truss system, and present the concept of the factory floor, which can construct truss-like structures without climbing on them. In the proposed system, each level is constructed on a ground plane using a truss and node configuration and is elevated to make room for the next level. This process is repeated to create 3D truss structures or reversed to decompose the structure for the next task.",

This issue is especially important for humanoid robots carrying out demanding movements such as walking in irregular surfaces, running or practicing a given sport (e.g. soccer). In a former contribution we have addressed the design of low-damage fall sequences, which can be activated/triggered by the robot in case of a detected unintentional fall or an intentional fall (common situation in robot soccer). In this article we tackle the detection of instability and the avoidance of falls in biped humanoids, as well as the integration of all components in a single framework. In this framework a fall can be avoided or a falling sequence can be triggered depending on the detected instability's degree. The proposed fall detection and fall avoidance subsystems are validated in real world-experiments with biped humanoid robots.",

        "abstract": "Classically, the inverse kinematics is performed by computing the singular value decomposition of the matrix to invert. This enables a very simple writing of the algorithm. However, the computation cost is high, especially when applied to complex robots and complex sets of constraints (typically around 5ms for 50 degrees of freedom - DOF). In this paper, we propose a dedicated adaptation of quadratic programming that enables fast computations of the hierarchical inverse kinematics (around 0.1ms for 50 DOF). We then extend this algorithm to deal with unilateral constraints, obtaining sufficiently high performances for reactive control.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers a shortcutting heuristic to smooth jerky trajectories for many-DOF robot manipulators subject to collision constraints, velocity bounds, and acceleration bounds. The heuristic repeatedly picks two points on the trajectory and attempts to replace the intermediate trajectory with a shorter, collision-free segment. Here, we construct segments that interpolate between endpoints with specified velocity in a time-optimal fashion, while respecting velocity and acceleration bounds. These trajectory segments consist of parabolic and straight-line curves, and can be computed in closed form. Experiments on reaching tasks in cluttered human environments demonstrate that the technique can generate smooth, collision-free, and natural-looking motion in seconds for a PUMA manipulator and the Honda ASIMO robot.",

We approach the problem by decomposing it into many sub-systems, in which we apply state-of-the-art learning, planning, optimization and control techniques to achieve robust, fast locomotion. Unique features of our control strategy include: (1) a system that learns optimal foothold choices from expert demonstration using terrain templates, (2) a body trajectory optimizer based on the Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) stability criterion, and (3) a floating-base inverse dynamics controller that, in conjunction with force control, allows for robust, compliant locomotion over unperceived obstacles. We evaluate the performance of our controller by testing it on the LittleDog quadruped robot, over a wide variety of rough terrain of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate the generalization ability of this controller by presenting test results from an independent external test team on terrains that have never been shown to us.",

        "abstract": "Image keypoints are broadly used in robotics for different purposes, ranging from recognition to 3D reconstruction, passing by SLAM and visual servoing. Robust keypoint matching across different views is problematic because of the relative motion between camera and scene that causes significant changes in feature appearance. The problem can be partially overcome by using state-of-the-art methods for keypoint detection and matching, that are resilient to common affine transformations such as changes in scale and rotation. Unfortunately, these approaches are not invariant to the radial distortion present in images acquired by cameras with wide field-of-view. This article proposes modifications to the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), that improve the repeatability of detection and effectiveness of matching in the presence of distortion, while preserving the characteristics of invariance to scale and rotation. These modifications require an approximate modeling of the image distortion, and consist in using adaptative gaussian filtering for detection and implicit gradient correction for description. Extensive experiments, with both synthetic and real images, show that our method outperforms explicit distortion correction using image rectification.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the problem of discrimination of gases with mobile robots. Previously, it has been shown that the conditions in which data is collected heavily influence the characteristics of the signal to be identified. As a result, the already difficult task of selecting features which characterize a gas is made more challenging by the absence of a steady state response. This is often due to the movement of the robot, and/or the physical properties of the environment, e.g., turbulent airflow creating patches and eddies in the plume. In this work we compare two approaches for feature selection which are able to consider explicitly the information on the experimental setup and optimize the subset of features used in the recognition process. The approaches are tested on a large data set collected with a mobile robot moving in different environments (outdoors and indoors). The results show that the classification performance is improved resulting in a higher average accuracy and lower variance in the accuracy across the different experimental setups.",

The paper presents modified kinematics for constrained continuum robots and introduces the concept of Fixed Centrode Deviation (FCD) for continuum robots. It is shown that the change in fixed centrode locus may be used for detection of contact and for contact location estimation. An alternative method for contact detection using Joint Force Deviation (JFD) is investigated and a lower bound for contact detectability is derived while considering uncertainties in joint forces. An estimation framework for the location of contact is presented based on FCD and the constrained kinematics Jacobian of the continuum robot. These methods are validated by simulation and experiments. This framework may be used for enhancing the safety of robotic surgical slaves and for exploration of unknown environments such as in scenarios of search and rescue.",

The proposed actuator is applicable to not only the straight path but the spiral and the curved one as well. Moreover, the design method to drive stably and the analysis of the output force are discussed in this paper.

Component interfaces are fixed at design time and form a contract with other components, guaranteeing functionality. Known interfaces are typically important to reusability. However, in certain cases fixed interfaces can limit the reusability of components. Utility components provide general functionality that is reused a large number of times both within a single software system and between systems. They need to be adapted to the interfaces for each specific use case. This paper presents a set of utility components that can adapt their interfaces to the user's needs without any code changes. Dynamic programming language techniques are used to provide the adaptability. The components are a great benefit to the reusability of common utility components, removing a common cause of reinvention.",

        "abstract": "Birds, bees, and fish often flock together in groups to find the source of food (target) based on local information. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, a flocking control algorithm is designed to coordinate the activities of multiple agents in noisy environments. Based on this algorithm, all agents can form a network and maintain connectivity. This is of great advantage for agents to exchange information. In addition, collision avoidance among agents is guaranteed in the whole process of target tracking. We show that even with noisy measurements the flocks can achieve cohesion and follow the moving target. We also investigate the stability and scalability of our algorithm. The numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "One of the grand challenges of self-reconfiguring modular robotics is the assembly of a functional system from thousands of components. However, to date, only systems comprised of small numbers of modules have been demonstrated. One approach to scaling to large numbers of modules is to simplify module design by relieving the modules of the typical power, control, and actuation requirements necessary for locomotion. Assembly is accomplished by taking advantage of stochastic environmental motions to move the modules into place. Here we present an experimental system in which we assemble 3D target structures stochastically from simple, 15 mm-scaled components by manipulating the fluid flow in a 1.3 L tank. We also demonstrate fundamental assembly and repair operations experimentally, and discuss initial assembly statistics.",

The dynamic motion of the cell with consideration of both the trapping and the viscous forces is analyzed, based on which the motion profile of the motorized stage is designed to ensure both safety and efficiency of the cell delivery.

This mechanism can display fringes or characters that correspond to the magnitude of a force between the surgical instruments and internal organs without the use of electronic elements, such as amplifiers and strain gauges. As this mechanism is simply attached to the surgical instruments, there is no need for additional devices in the operating room or wires to connect these devices. The structure is simple, and its fabrication is inexpensive. An example is shown with the mechanism mounted on a 10-mm forceps. We experimentally verified in vivo, using a pig, that it can display characters corresponding to the magnitude of the force, thus visually displaying the force even in endoscopic image.",

In order to have a better understanding of the system behavior, a specific setup able to measure tension forces in different points along the tendon's path has been built. Experimental data collected by measuring the tendon tension forces during both the pulling and the release phase are presented, and theoretical models reproducing the tendon behavior with increasing fidelity are proposed. In particular, the friction arising from the interaction between the tendon pathway and the tendon itself is characterized by means of a LuGre-like dynamic friction model. The introduction of a dynamic friction model allows to reproduce in simulation some effects arising during experimental activities that cannot be reproduced employing an equivalent static friction model. Moreover, the adoption of tendons made by polymeric fibers introduces hysteresis in the tendon transmission characteristic due to the plasticity and creep phenomena typical of these materials. With the aim of reproducing this behavior, a visco-elastic model is used for modeling the tendon compliance.",

With this approach various compliant and stable motions have been created in a constructive manner.

        "abstract": "To build autonomous robots capable to plan and control tasks in human environments, we need a description of trajectories that allows the robot to reason on his moves. In this paper we propose to use series of cubic polynomial curves to define the trajectories with bounded jerk, acceleration and velocity. This solution is well adapted to plan safe and acceptable moves of the robot in the vicinity of humans. It is also a simple solution to approximate any trajectory and synchronize different robots or element of the robots. These curves have a simple representation, can be computed quickly and when used in a fitting algorithm can build controller.",

The estimation is based only on odometry and RFID measurements. The technique requires no prior observation model and makes no assumptions on the RFID setup. In particular, it is adaptive to the power level, the way the RFID antennas are mounted on the robot, and environmental characteristics, which have major impact on long-range RFID measurements. Tag positions need not be known in advance, and only the arbitrary, given infrastructure of RFID tags in the environment is utilized. By a series of experiments with a mobile robot, we show that trajectory estimation is achieved accurately and robustly.",

This paper presents a promising tracking system to deal with these problems. The novelty of this system is that laser and vision, tracking and learning are integrated and can complement each other in one framework: when the targets do not interact with each other, the laser-based independent trackers are employed and the visual information is extracted simultaneously to train some classifiers for the \u201cpossible interacting targets\u201d. When the targets are in close proximity, the learned classifiers and visual information are used to assist in tracking. Therefore, this mode of co-operation between them not only deals with various tough problems encountered in the tracking, but also ensures that the entire process can be completely on-line and automatic. Experimental results demonstrated that laser and vision fully display their respective advantages in our system, and it is easy for us to obtain a perfect trade-off between tracking accuracy and time-cost.",

The model is a 3-DOF impulsive mechanical system, and the aim is to induce stable limit-cycle walking in level ground. To solve the problem, the ideas of the virtual holonomic constraints approach are explored, used and extended. The contribution is a novel systematic motion planning procedure for solving the problem of gait synthesis, which is challenging for non-feedback linearizable mechanical systems with two or more passive degrees of freedom. For a preplanned gait we compute an impulsive linear system that approximates dynamics transversal to the periodic solution. This linear system is used for the design of a stabilizing feedback controller. Results of numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of the closed loop system.",

When the end-effector describes a closed trajectory, the joint angles may not return to their initial values and final configuration in the joint space may depend on the trajectory followed by the end-effector. In this paper, a complete parameterization of holonomic local control strategies that avoid these problems is proposed. Only a basis of the null-space of the Jacobian matrix is required in order to design all the possible holonomic control strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on a simple case study and on a real industrial manipulator.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Bilateral Control by States Convergence is a novel and little exploited control strategy that has been successfully applied to the teleoperation of robotic manipulators using SISO control. Based on the state space representation, the main philosophy of this control strategy consists in achieving convergence of states between the master and the slave, by setting the dynamical behavior of the master-slave error as a states-independent autonomous system. This paper presents a generalization of this strategy to MIMO systems, with time delay in the master-slave communication channels. It is demonstrated how the feedback gains required by the state convergence control schema can be found by solving a set of ((m \u00d7 n) + (m \u00d7 m) + n ) nonlinear equations for a system with m inputs, n states and m outputs. Unlike previous research, which has been applied only to manipulators considering 1-DOF for the states-convergence control loop, the extension to the general MIMO case has allowed to apply the technique to the teleoperation of a 2-DOF helicopter. A decoupling network and states-feedback are used for local control, while the states-convergence control manages the bilateral issues. Simulation results are presented, showing a satisfactory performance of the control strategy.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots are expected to share human environments in the future and it is important to ensure safety of their operation. A serious threat to safety is the fall of a humanoid robot, which can seriously damage both the robot and objects in its surrounding. This paper proposes a strategy for planning and control of fall. The controller's objective is to prevent the robot from hitting surrounding objects during a fall by modifying its default fall direction. We have earlier presented such a direction-changing fall controller in [1]. However, the controller was applicable only when the robot's surrounding contained a single object. In this paper we introduce a generalized approach to humanoid fall-direction control among multiple objects. This new framework algorithmically establishes a desired fall direction through assigned scores, considers a number of control options, and selects and executes the best strategy. The fall planner is also able to select \u201cNo Action\u201d as the best strategy, if appropriate. The controller is interactive and is applicable for fall occurring during upright standing or walking. The fall performance is continuously tracked and can be improved in real-time. The planning and control algorithms are demonstrated in simulation on an ASIMO-like humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have long been promising methods for enabling an autonomous robot to improve its behavior on sequential decision-making tasks. The obvious enticement is that the robot should be able to improve its own behavior without the need for detailed step-by-step programming. However, for RL to reach its full potential, the algorithms must be sample efficient: they must learn competent behavior from very few real-world trials. From this perspective, model-based methods, which use experiential data more efficiently than model-free approaches, are appealing. But they often require exhaustive exploration to learn an accurate model of the domain. In this paper, we present an algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Decision Trees (RL-DT), that uses decision trees to learn the model by generalizing the relative effect of actions across states. The agent explores the environment until it believes it has a reasonable policy. The combination of the learning approach with the targeted exploration policy enables fast learning of the model.

        "abstract": "In this research, a Universal map, which can be converted to individual maps for heterogeneous mobile robots, is proposed. A Universal map can be generated using our developed measurement robot, and it is composed of a textured 3D environment model. Therefore, every robot can use a Universal map as a common map, and it is utilized for various localization technologies such as view-based and LRF-based methods. In LRF-based localization, accurate localization is achieved using a specific map, which is generated from Universal map. In a view-based approach, localization and navigation are achieved using rendered images. The use of a Universal map enables generation of these maps automatically. The effectiveness of this approach is confirmed through experiments.",

        "abstract": "The topic of reusable software in robotics is now largely addressed. Components based architectures, where components are independent units that can be reused accross applications, have become more popular. As a consequence, a long list of middlewares and integration tools is available in the community, often in the form of open-source projects. However, these projects are generally self contained with little reuse between them. This paper presents a software engineering approach that intends to grant middleware independance to robotic software components so that a clear separation of concerns is achieved between highly reusable algorithmic parts and integration frameworks. Such a decoupling let middle-wares be used interchangeably, while fully benefitting from their specific, individual features. This work has been integrated into a new version of the open-source GenoM component generator tool: GenoM3",

We introduce a vision based geo-referencing system that uses pre-existing maps to reduce the long term drift. The system classifies an image according to its environmental content and thereafter matches it to an environmentally classified map over the operational area. This map matching provides a measurement of the absolute location of the UAV, that can easily be incorporated into a sensor fusion framework. Experiments show that the geo-referencing system reduces the long term drift in UAV navigation, enhancing the ability of the UAV to navigate accurately over large areas without the use of GPS.",

However, these potential benefits may only be realized if the corresponding motion synthesis procedure is suitably flexible. This paper presents a flexible trajectory generation algorithm that utilizes a geometric representation of humanoid skills (e.g., walking) - in the form of skill manifolds. These manifolds are learnt from demonstration data that may be obtained from off-line optimization algorithms (or a human expert).We demonstrate that this model may be used to produce approximately optimal motion plans as geodesics over the manifold and that this allows us to effectively generalize from a limited training set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated 3-link planar arm, and then the more challenging example of a physical 19-DoF humanoid robot. We show that our algorithm produces a close approximation of the much more computationally intensive optimization procedure used to generate the data. This allows us to present experimental results for fast motion planning on a realistic - variable step length, width and height - walking task on a humanoid robot.",

We consider a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model for the horizontal motion of each AUV that has control inputs over surge force and yaw moment. By using the Jacobi transform, the horizontal dynamics of AUVs are expressed as dynamics for formation shape, formation motion and vehicle orientation. The system decouples when additional symmetries in vehicle design are presented. Hence formation shape controllers, formation motion controllers, and vehicle orientation controllers can be designed separately. This approach reduces the complexity of formation controllers. We use the model for ODIN as an example to demonstrate the controller design process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the controllers.",

In previous our research, it was possible to compensate the pose error (xe, ye, qe) of a mobile robot correctly on the surface of structured environment with magnetic landmarks. In this work, we propose a methodology of arranging magnetic landmarks on the map such that properly arranged magnetic patterns ease the global localization of a mobile agent. Among total six patterns of magnetic-bar in square arrangement, five unique landmarks are obtained. Therefore, a heuristic pattern search method is applied to build the virtual map using five landmarks. In order to obtain the global pose information, the robot identifies the pattern of magnets, and obtains the current global pose information by comparing the measured neighboring patterns with the map information that is saved in advance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the magnetic-pattern landmarks for the global localization and local pose control of a mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "Aerial vehicles are appealing systems for possible future exploration of planets and moons such as Venus and Titan, because they combine extensive coverage with high-resolution data collection and in-situ science capabilities. Recent studies have proposed the use of a montgolfiere balloon, which controls its altitude by changing the heating rate or venting gas from the balloon, but has no actuation capability in the horizontal plane. A montgolfiere can use the variation in wind with altitude to guide itself to a desired location. This paper considers the problems of determining the altitude profile that the montgolfiere should follow in order to reach its target most quickly. We provide a new method that solves this path planning problem for all possible target locations, thereby providing a reachability analysis for the entire globe. The key idea is to perform a principled simplification and decoupling of the dynamics of the montgolfiere. We then discretize the search space, converting the planning problem into a graph search problem, and use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the minimum-time path from the start location to every possible location in the graph. We demonstrate the approach on a possible Titan mission scenario.",

        "abstract": "Current rover localization techniques such as visual odometry have proven to be very effective on short to medium-length traverses (e.g., up to a few kilometres). This paper deals with the problem of long-range rover localization (e.g., 10km and up). An autonomous method to globally localize a rover is proposed by matching features detected from a 3D orbital elevation map and rover-based 3D lidar scans. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm is enhanced with visual odometry, and inclinometer/sun-sensor orientation measurements. The methodology was tested with real data, including 37 lidar scans of terrain from a Mars-Moon analogue site on Devon Island, Nunavut. When a scan contained a sufficient number of good topographic features, localization produced position errors of no more than 100m, and as low as a few metres in many cases. On a 10km traverse, the developed algorithm's localization estimates were shown to significantly outperform visual odometry estimates. It is believed that this architecture could be used to accurately and autonomously localize a rover on long-range traverses.",

The robot dynamically transforms from a .5 m static to a 1.5 m dynamic configuration. Our robot development has led to two advances in the design of platforms for mobility and manipulation: (1) A 2-DOF robot base that autonomously stands from horizontal rest; (2) A 4-DOF humanoid torso that adds a waist roll joint to replicate human torso folding and a yaw joint for spine rotation. The mobile torso also achieves autonomous standing in a constrained space while lifting a 40 kg payload. Golem validates our assertions by consistently achieving static-dynamic transformations. This paper describes the design of our mobile torso. It considers a number of factors including its suitability for human environments, mechanical simplicity and the ability to store potential and kinetic energy for handling heavy human and even super-human tasks.",

Mass matrix factorization, inversion, diagonalization, linearization are among the several techniques developed using operators. These techniques have been shown to apply broadly to systems ranging from serial, tree, to closed topology systems, as well as to systems with rigid and flexible links/joints. This paper uses concepts from graph theory to obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of spatial operators. We show that spatial kernel operators are instances of block weighted adjacency matrices for the underlying multibody topology graphs, and that spatial propagation operators are 1-resolvents of these matrices. We explore at an abstract level the properties of such 1-resolvents in order to understand the precise requirements on and the range of applicability of spatial operators to the broad class of dynamics problems.",

In addition to introducing this novel programming paradigm, we also describe the associated system architecture developed on-board our amphibious robot. We then present a user interaction study that illustrates the benefits in usability of our graphical interface, compared to conventionally established programming techniques.",

This paper presents a novel two-stage approach for identifying ground points from 3-D point clouds sensed using LIDAR. The first stage, a local height-based filter, discards most of the non-ground points. The second stage, based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, operates on a set of geometrically defined features to identify which of the remaining points belong to the ground. Experimental results from two forested environments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

We demonstrate a vision-based approach to navigation that does not depend on traditional camera calibration, and present an algorithm for guiding a robot through a previously traversed environment using a set of uncalibrated cameras mounted on the robot. On the first excursion through an environment, the system builds a topological representation of the robot's exploration path, encoded as a place graph. On subsequent navigation missions, the method localizes the robot within the graph and provides robust guidance to a specified destination. We combine this method with reactive collision avoidance to obtain a system able to navigate the robot safely and reliably through the environment. We validate our approach with ground-truth experiments and demonstrate the method on a small ground rover navigating through several dynamic environments.",

In this paper we combine a new minimally invasive surface scanning technique based on conoscopic holography with a steerable active cannula robot. We experimentally demonstrate cannula tip placement to multiple physical points inside phantom tissue, which correspond to points specified in preoperative images - the input an eventual clinical system would obtain from the physician. While the image-guided steerable system we propose is broadly applicable to many kinds of surgery, one particular application of interest is in ablating large liver tumors, where it is beneficial for the ablator to be repositioned to multiple locations without being withdrawn from the organ.",

        "abstract": "Yoyo playing may seem easy for a human, but it is a challenging problem for a humanoid robot. This paper presents an approach to generate yoyo motions for the humanoid robot, HRP-2, based on motion recorded from human yoyo playing, dynamical models and numerical optimal control techniques. We recorded vertical yoyo playing of 4 subjects measuring yoyo height and rotation angle as well as the corresponding hand motions. A detailed multi-phase yoyo model with impact collisions and control patterns of human yoyo playing were identified from these measurements. Based on this knowledge, reliable yoyo motions within the feasibility ranges of HRP-2 were generated using optimal control. The resulting motions have been implemented on the robot using open-loop and event-based quasi open-loop control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Experiments showed that Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planners are suitable to find solutions for nontrivial tasks in complex scenarios. Mobile service robots are able to execute actions which may constitute the basic building blocks to achieve high-level goals. However, only few experiments demonstrate the application of a general purpose deliberative planner in the domain of mobile service robots. One challenging problem arises from the fact that adaptive AI-based planners presume the closed-world assumption (CWA) and are therefore unable to deal with incomplete information. Unknown objects which are not represented in the planning domain, for example, cannot be integrated into the planning process. Since mobile service robots act in a real dynamic environment and construct or adapt their world model autonomously based on sensory data, they are inevitably confronted with uncertain and incomplete information about the world. This conflict between simplified assumptions for planning on the one hand and the complexity of the real world on the other constitutes a major problem of modern robotics. This paper describes two approaches to dealing with incomplete world knowledge in the context of HTN robot planning. Several experiments demonstrate that the approaches can successfully be applied in a dynamic and unstructured environment.",

Despite the fact that most robotics applications of human hand tracking involve grasping and manipulation of objects, the majority of methods in the literature assume a free hand, isolated from the surrounding environment. Our hand tracking method is non-parametric, performing a nearest neighbor search in a large database (100000 entries) of hand poses with and without grasped objects. The system operates in real time, it is robust to self occlusions, object occlusions and segmentation errors, and provides full hand pose reconstruction from markerless video. Temporal consistency in hand pose is taken into account, without explicitly tracking the hand in the high dimensional pose space.",

This allows the planar tactile sensor patches to optimally adjust themselves to the object's surface and to acquire additional sensor information for shape reconstruction. Secondly, this paper presents an approach to classify an object directly from the haptic sensor data acquired by a palpation sequence with the robot hand - without building a 3d-model of the object. Therefore, a finite set of essential finger positions and tactile contact patterns are identified which can be used to describe a single palpation step. A palpation sequence can then be merged into a simple statistical description of the object and finally be classified. The proposed approach for haptic object recognition and the new tactile sensor system are evaluated with an anthropomorphic robot hand.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of incorporating haptics-enabled teleoperation in minimally invasive tumor localization. Since the stiffness of a tumor is higher than that of the surrounding tissue, it can be identified as a hard nodule when palpated. Using a Tactile Sensing Instrument (TSI) developed at CSTAR, the distributed pressure profiles along the contacting surface can be measured during remote tissue palpation. The tumor can be detected by using a visualization software that creates a color contour map based on the magnitude of the pressure over the palpated area. The accuracy of this method depends on the uniformity of the force applied to the tissue. A haptics-enabled teleoperation system provides the surgeon with the opportunity to feel the interaction force between the instrument and tissue during Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). The objective of this research was to assess the feasibility of combining force feedback with tactile feedback in order to increase the overall performance of tumor localization. The teleoperation system used in this work consists of a Mitsubishi PA10 robot as the slave that is remotely controlled (over a dedicated network) through a 7 Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) haptic interface. A two-channel architecture, along with hybrid impedance control was utilized to form a bilateral teleoperation system in which the master is under force control and the slave is under position control. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of using force feedback in robot-assisted tactile sensing for tumor detection.",

It addresses the problem of data fusion in the context of large scale terrain modeling for a mobile robot. Building a model of large scale and complex terrain that can adequately handle uncertainty and incompleteness in a statistically sound manner is a very challenging problem. To obtain a comprehensive model of such terrain, typically, multiple sensory modalities as well as multiple data sets are required. This work uses Gaussian processes to model large scale terrain. The model naturally provides a multi-resolution representation of space, incorporates and handles uncertainties appropriately and copes with incompleteness of sensory information. Gaussian process regression techniques are applied to estimate and interpolate (to fill gaps in unknown areas) elevation information across the field. In this work, the GP modeling approach is extended to fuse multiple, multi-modal data sets to obtain a best estimate of the elevation given the individual data sets. The individual data sets are treated as different noisy samples of the same underlying terrain. Experiments performed on sparse GPS based survey data and dense laser scanner data taken at mine-sites are reported.",

During online mapping, the approach corrects only the coarse structure of the scene and not the overall map. In this way, only updates for the parts of the map that need to be considered for making data associations are carried out. The hierarchical approach provides accurate non-linear map estimates while being highly efficient. Our error minimization approach exploits the manifold structure of the underlying space. In this way, it avoids singularities in the state space parameterization. The overall approach is accurate, efficient, designed for online operation, overcomes singularities, provides a hierarchical representation, and outperforms a series of state-of-the-art methods.",

The main idea is a two-level hierarchy combining a global planner which provides rough guidance to a local planner. We place a premium on fast response, so the global planner achieves speed by using a very rough approximation of the robot kinematics, and the local planner begins execution of the next action even without considering subsequent actions in detail, instead relying on the guidance of the global planner. The system exhibits few planning delays, and yet is surprisingly effective at planning collision free motions. The system is deployed on HERB, combining a Segway mobile platform, a WAM arm, and a Barrett hand. The navigation and manipulation components have been tested on the real robot, and the task of simultaneously approaching and grasping a bottle on a countertop was demonstrated in simulation.",

The navigation is to be carried out continuously at speed and may be subject to drift that is not predictable a priori. The problem raises the challenge of adaptively maintaining a smooth robust path of low computational cost. The algorithm is complete in providing feasible paths connecting to the goal in cluttered environments without global maps or positioning while also optimising the path curvature in free space. The approach is a generic gradient-based methodology set in dynamic potential fields that are not subject to fixed local minima or other misdirecting surface features of static fields. Multiple planning and execution cycles are interleaved to allow frequent updates for dealing with unanticipated obstacles and drift. We present our methodology and demonstrate experimental results for simulated robots. The results show that low curvature paths are found that robustly connect to the goal under perturbation through a sequence of fast adaptive replanning.",

The method is based on novel representation of the scene geometry called a latent map, which consists of a set of piecewise linear functions defined over a spatial grid covering the scene. The latent map representation is designed to handle the noise, outliers and limited spatial resolution of laser scan data in a principled manner. The main idea of our algorithm is to iterate between optimizing the latent map, and optimizing the alignment between the latent map and the input scans. In order to handle large datasets containing tens of thousands of scans, we introduce a multi-resolution pose estimation procedure, which applies our scan alignment algorithm at multiple resolutions and combines the results. We demonstrate our novel scan matching technique on several challenging data sets, where we obtain state of the art pose and map reconstructions that are markedly superior to what pairwise scan matching methods can achieve.",

However, using this sensor, it was difficult to distinguish between object slip and a change in the normal force. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated a method for identifying object slip by analyzing the frequency components of the output signal from the sensor. As a result, we found that high-frequency components of 1 kHz or more are included in the complex voltage signal generated by object slip. Therefore, by using this high-frequency component, we developed a simple sensor that distinguished between both contact and initial slip with high sensitivity.",

These algorithms however, typically do not scale well to high-dimensional planning problems such as motion planning for robotic arms, computing motion trajectories for non-holonomic robotic vehicles and motion synthesis for humanoid characters. A recently developed randomized version of A* search, called R* search, scales to higher-dimensional planning problems by trading off deterministic optimality guarantees of A* for probabilistic sub-optimality guarantees. In this paper, we show that in addition to its scalability, R* lends itself well to a parallel implementation. In particular, we demonstrate how R* can be implemented on the GPU. On the theoretical side, the GPU version of R*, called R*GPU, preserves all the theoretical properties of R* including its probabilistic bounds on sub-optimality. On the experimental side, we show that R*GPU consistently produces lower cost solutions, scales better in terms of memory, and runs faster than R*. These results hold for both motion planning for a 6DOF robot arm planar as well as 2D path finding.",

This method can be applied to partial models with any size in any posture. Although it is becoming easy to obtain textured 3D models by a 3D scanner, there are few methods for 3D object recognition which take into account both shape and textures of objects. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve high-speed processing of large 3D data. Our 3D features consider the co-occurrence of shape and colors of an object's surface. The additive property of these features makes it possible to calculate the similarity between a query part and the subspace of each object in a database without division, and therefore the time for recognition is quite short. In the experiments, we compare our method with conventional methods using Spin-Images and Textured Spin-Images. We show that our method is appropriate for 3D object recognition.",

The developed lens uses a liquid-liquid interface as a variable refractive surface. The interface shape is controlled by the volume of a liquid chamber using a high-speed piezostack actuator. A developed prototype demonstrated both millisecond-order response speed and practical optical performance. A high-speed focusing vision system that can adaptively control its focal length in based on visual feedback by using the DML prototype coupled with a high-speed imager is also proposed. High-speed autofocusing within 15.8 ms and focus tracking of a moving object were demonstrated using the developed system. The DML prototype was also applied to high-speed focus scanning of a camera lens at 500 Hz. An image sequence was captured at 8000 fps through the lens so that every eight images were captured with a different focus, and a 1000 fps video with extended depth of field was successfully synthesized.",

The modular design and enhanced clamping mechanism with simple mechanical components are designed to provide reliable linear motion using a piezo motor with a stroke of 3 mm. To be specific, a closed loop control system, based on the position feedback from a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor, was implemented to overcome the non-linear characteristics of the piezo motor and to locate electrodes precisely at the targeted position with the accuracy of 1 \u03bcm, even under load. The weight of the micromanipulator is only 0.84 g when it is fully assembled with the MR sensor, PCBs, and connectors. In addition, a protective cover is employed to prevent breakage during semi-chronic recording. The positioning performance of the micromanipulator was tested at various loading conditions using various control methods. Finally, the activities of a single unit were isolated successfully using small step adjustments, such as 1 to 5 \u03bcm, in freely-moving mice.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a homography-based approach for determining the ground plane using image pairs is presented. Our approach is unique in that it uses a Modified Expectation Maximization algorithm to cluster pixels on images as belonging to one of two possible classes: ground and non-ground pixels. This classification is very useful in mobile robot navigation because, by segmenting out the ground plane, we are left with all possible objects in the scene, which can then be used to implement many mobile robot navigation algorithms such as obstacle avoidance, path planning, target following, landmark detection, etc. Specifically, we demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our approach by applying it to a target following algorithm. As the results section shows, the proposed algorithm for ground plane detection achieves an almost perfect detection rate (over 99%) despite the relatively higher number of errors in pixel correspondence from the feature matching algorithm used: SIFT.",

With a trajectory defined in the image space by a sequence of equidistant key images along the glidepath, an interpolation in the homography space is also proposed in order to reduce the database size and ensure the required smoothness of the control task. In addition, a pan-tilt control was taken into account to respect the dynamics of the aircraft during manoeuvres and in the presence of wind perturbations. An optimal control design based on the linearized model of the aircraft dynamics is then consider to cancel the visual error function. To demonstrate the proposed concept, simulation results under realistic atmospheric disturbances are presented.",

Since ducted fans are powerful and effective in providing lift, they are suitable for thrusters of UAVs, but modeling their aerodynamic effects such as ram drag is very difficult. The VTAV has one ducted fan fixed to its body and two ducted fans that can be tilted in order to make rotational moments, which makes the system dynamics even more complicated. This paper focuses on giving a precise dynamical model that includes aerodynamic effects of ducted fans. Then it presents a hovering controller based on the dynamical model developed. Since the horizontal dynamics are under actuated, a switching control approach is introduced to realize a stabilizing controller. Numerical simulations prove the validity of the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to interactive object categorization that couples exploratory behaviors and their resulting acoustic signatures to form object categories. The framework was tested with an upper-torso humanoid robot on a container/non-container categorization task. The robot used six exploratory behaviors (drop block, grasp, move, shake, flip, and drop object) and applied them to twenty objects. The results from this large-scale experimental study show that the robot was able to learn meaningful object categories using only acoustic information. The results also show that the quality of the categorization depends on the exploratory behavior used to derive it as some behaviors elicit more salient acoustic signatures than others.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm for human presence detection and tracking using an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) impulse-based mono-static radar. UWB radar can complement other human tracking technologies, as it works well in poor visibility conditions. UWB electromagnetic wave scattering from moving humans forms a complex returned signal structure which can be approximated to a specular multi-path scattering model (SMPM). The key technical challenge is to simultaneously track multiple humans (and non-humans) using the complex scattered waveform observations. We develop a multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) framework that solves the complicated data association and tracking problem for an SMPM of moving objects/targets. Human presence detection utilizes SMPM signal features, which are tested in a classical likelihood ratio (LR) detector framework. The process of human detection and tracking is a combination of the MHT method and the LR human detector. We present experimental results in which a mono-static UWB radar tracks human and non-human targets, and detects human presence by discerning human from moving non-human objects.",

        "abstract": "Physical constraints that underly the formation of periodic motions can be effectively used to accurately reconstruct the periodic motion from even single camera views. As shown in our earlier work, this reduces to a problem of geometric inference. In this paper, we focus on periodic motions exhibited by humans, which are generally not perfectly periodic, and explore the suitability of the reconstruction techniques in these scenarios. We examine the degree of periodicity of human gait empirically, including the applicability of our motion model. Importantly, we illustrate the usefulness of these techniques by applying them to the task of clinical gait analysis. A computational tool to analyze periodic human motion can prove to be invaluable in medical applications either in terms of assessing deviations from normal patterns or evaluating changes resulting from therapy or other clinical procedures.",

        "abstract": "Humans are adept at grasping different objects robustly for different tasks. Robotic grasping has made significant progress, but still has not reached the level of robustness or versatility shown by human grasping. It would be useful to understand what parameters (called grasp measures) humans optimize as they grasp objects, how these grasp measures are varied for different tasks, and whether they can be applied to physical robots to improve their robustness and versatility. This paper demonstrates a new way to gather human-guided grasp measures from a human interacting haptically with a robotic arm and hand. The results revealed that a human-guided strategy provided grasps with higher robustness on a physical robot even under a vigorous shaking test (91%) when compared with a state-of-the-art automated grasp synthesis algorithm (77%). Furthermore, orthogonality of wrist orientation was identified as a key human-guided grasp measure, and using it along with an automated grasp synthesis algorithm improved the automated algorithm's results dramatically (77% to 93%).",

The variable stiffness approach has been used to address this problem. We propose a hybrid dual actuator unit (HDAU) which is a novel variable stiffness unit design. The HDAU is composed of a hybrid control module based on an adjustable moment arm mechanism and a drive module with two motors. By controlling the relative motion of gears in the hybrid control module, position and stiffness can be simultaneously controlled for the same joint. The HDAU provides a wide range of joint stiffness due to nonlinearity obtained from the adjustable moment arm. The joint stiffness can be kept constant independent of the passive deflection angle of the output shaft. Furthermore, stable interaction can also be achieved because the joint stiffness is indirectly adjusted by position control of the hybrid control module. The characteristics of the HDAU are analyzed in this study. We show by experiment that the HDAU can provide a wide range of stiffness variation and rapid response for stiffness change.",

        "abstract": "Image-based scene representations enable a mobile robot to make a realistic prediction of its environment. Hence, it is able to rapidly detect changes in its surroundings by comparing a virtual image generated from previously acquired reference images and its current observation. This facilitates attentional control to novel events. However, illumination effects can impair attentional control if the robot does not take them into account. To address this issue, we present in this paper an approach for the acquisition of illumination-invariant scene representations. Using multiple spatial image sequences which are captured under varying illumination conditions the robot computes an illumination-invariant image-based environment model. With this representation and statistical models about the illumination behavior, the robot is able to robustly detect texture changes in its environment under different lighting. Experimental results show high-quality images which are free of illumination effects as well as more robust novelty detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The immobilization of non-rigid objects is a relatively unexplored area in grasp mechanics. This paper considers the immobilization of 2D serial chains of n hinged polygons at a given placement using frictionless point fingers. The paper sets the problem in the context of classical grasping theory by showing that chain immobilization can only be achieved with equilibrium grasps. In earlier work we described an immobilization procedure for serial chains of n\u22603 polygons using n+2 frictionless point fingers. However, the immobilization of three-link chains remained an open problem. This paper establishes that three-link chains can usually be immobilized with five point fingers, but certain three-link chains can only be immobilized with six point fingers. The paper then considers the robust immobilization of serial chains under small contact placement errors. We describe a procedure for robust immobilization of n-link chains that requires only one extra contact for the entire chain, using a total of n+3 frictionless point fingers. The immobilization procedures and the exceptional three-link chains are illustrated with example.",

However, not many useful practical applications using low-mobility parallel mechanisms having 4-DOF and 5-DOF have been developed. In this paper, we propose a 4-DOF parallel mechanism for needle insertion application in which proper orientation and needle insertion process are required. The mechanism has four outer chains and one passive middle chain through which a needle insertion motion occurs. The kinematic modeling and kinematic analysis are performed to understand the characteristics of this mechanism. Through the singularity analysis, a singularity-free design for the desired workspace is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of this device as a needle insertion device is shown through experimental work.",

        "abstract": "Contact dynamics are commonly formulated as a linear complementarity problem. While this approach is superior to earlier spring-damper models, it can be inaccurate due to pyramid approximations to the friction cone, and inefficient due to lack of convexity coupled with a large number of auxiliary variables. Here we propose a new approach: implicit complementarity. Instead of treating contact velocities and forces as independent variables subject to explicit complementarity constraints, we express them as functions of a minimal set of unconstrained variables, and design these functions so that the complementarity constraints are automatically satisfied. We then solve the equations of motion via a non-smooth Gauss-Newton method augmented with an original linesearch procedure which exploits the problem structure. This enables us to represent the friction cone exactly and to reduce the number of unknowns by about a factor of 3. Numerical tests suggest that, in usage scenarios typical for robotics, the solver takes only about 5 iterations even without warm starts. More extensive tests and side-by-side comparisons remain to be done, but nevertheless the potential of the new approach is clear.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot navigation in out-door scenarios gains increasing importance in various growing application areas. Whereas in non-urban domains such as deserts the problem of successful GPS-based navigation appears to be almost solved, navigation in urban domains particularly in the close vicinity of buildings is still a challenging problem. In such situations GPS accuracy significantly drops down due to multiple signal reflections with larger objects causing the so-called multipath error. In this paper we contribute a novel approach for incorporating multipath errors into the conventional GPS sensor model by analyzing environmental structures from online generated point clouds. The approach has been validated by experimental results conducted with an all-terrain robot operating in scenarios requiring close-to-building navigation. Presented results show that positioning accuracy can significantly be improved within urban domains.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in autonomous navigation for lightweight flying robots. With regard to self-localization flying robots have several limitations compared to ground vehicles. Due to their limited payload flying vehicles possess only limited computational resources and are restricted to a few and lightweight sensors. Additionally the kinematics of flying robots is rather complex, which requires sophisticated motion models that are typically hard to calibrate. However, as the sensors provide only a limited amount of information, the motion models need to be highly accurate to reduce the potential increase of uncertainty caused by the movements of the vehicle. In this paper, we present a novel approach to simultaneous localization and estimation of motion model parameters and their adaptation in the context of a particle filter. To deal with sudden changes of parameters, our approach utilizes random sampling augmented by additional damping to avoid oscillations caused by the delayed detection of the changes. As we demonstrate in experiments with a real blimp, our method can deal with very sparse and imprecise sensor information and outperforms a standard Monte Carlo localization approach.",

Two methods of adjusting these feature entropies are proposed, one decreasing entropy related to incorrect features in a uniform manner and the other proportional to the contribution of the said feature.

        "abstract": "This paper describes improvement of sound source separation for a simultaneous automatic speech recognition (ASR) system of a humanoid robot. A recognition error in the system is caused by a separation error and interferences of other sources. In separability, an original geometric source separation (GSS) is improved. Our GSS uses a measured robot's head related transfer function (HRTF) to estimate a separation matrix. As an original GSS uses a simulated HRTF calculated based on a distance between microphone and sound source, there is a large mismatch between the simulated and the measured transfer functions. The mismatch causes a severe degradation of recognition performance. Faster convergence speed of separation matrix reduces separation error. Our approach gives a nearer initial separation matrix based on a measured transfer function from an optimal separation matrix than a simulated one. As a result, we expect that our GSS improves the convergence speed. Our GSS is also able to handle an adaptive step-size parameter. These new features are added into open source robot audition software (OSS) called \"HARK\" which is newly updated as version 1.0.0. The HARK has been installed on a HRP-2 humanoid with an 8-element microphone array. The listening capability of HRP-2 is evaluated by recognizing a target speech signal which is separated from a simultaneous speech signal by three talkers. The word correct rate (WCR) of ASR improves by 5 points under normal acoustic environments and by 10 points under noisy environments. Experimental results show that HARK 1.0.0 improves the robustness against noises.",

        "abstract": "In a haptic teleoperation system, the incorporation of knowledge about the remote environment in the controller design can improve stability and performance. Model-mediated teleoperation adopts this idea by rendering an estimated model of the remote environment on local site instead of transmitting force/velocity flows. Thus, the user perceives locally generated forces corresponding to the estimated and transmitted model parameters and the control loop between master and slave is opened. Less conservative stability boundaries and the applicability to teleoperation systems with arbitrary time delay are the main advantages of this approach. In order to guarantee a high fidelity, the estimation has to fit well with the measurements. In this paper, we extend the approach of model-mediated teleoperation to a full 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) teleoperation system with negligible time delay. We furthermore propose a hybrid approach for the estimation of the remote environment by combining the classical Kelvin-Voigt model and the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model. Persistent excitation and device-dependent limitations of the estimation algorithm are discussed. Experimental results show stability and accuracy of the estimation technique as well as a superior fidelity of the proposed approach compared to a position-based admittance controller with fixed parameters even with negligible time delay.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the last decades, tremendous progress has been made in the field of autonomous indoor navigation for mobile robots. However, these approaches assume the structural part of the environment to be completely static. In practice, movable parts of scenes, e.g. doors, frequently violate this assumption which leads to poor performance. Also, mobile manipulation capabilities can only be utilized, if the robot knows about the movability of objects. In this paper, we address an important part of these problems by the explicit representation of doors as door leaves and joints. We propose to augment standard approaches to navigation like 2D occupancy grid mapping and Monte-Carlo-Localization. Our algorithm detects doors during mapping and represents their movability adequately in the map. During localization, the state of doors is estimated from measurements while it is simultaneously used to improve localization robustness and accuracy. In experimental results we demonstrate superior performance of our method compared to a state-of-the-art approach to localization.",

        "abstract": "In a previous paper, we proposed a new way to achieve visual servoing. Rather than minimizing the error between the position of two set of geometric features, we proposed to maximize the mutual information shared by the current and desired images. This leads to a new information theoretic approach to visual servoing. Mutual information is a well known alignment function. Thanks to its robustness toward illumination variations, occlusions and multi modality, it has been widely used in medical applications for alignment as well as in general tracking problems. Despite those previous works, no highlight has been given on the problem of Hessian computation that yields, in the case of common approximations, to divergence of the optimization process. In this paper we focus on the need of computing the second order derivative of the mutual information in visual servoing. Experiments on a 6 dof robot demonstrates the significance of this work on visual servoing tasks.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Digitally controlled systems are getting more and more popular mainly because of their flexibility and convenience but their stability is strongly affected by the time delay introduced by different factors. For common PID type digital controllers, zero-order holds (ZOHs) are commonly employed and the stability characteristics are investigated based on that concept. Mathematical investigations show that higher-order holds may improve the stability and performance of the system and can reduce the steady state errors significantly. This is because the controller tries to learn from the history of the behavior of the system and then predict the behavior for the time period between sampling instances and generate the best possible control force. Furthermore, a new concept of Modified Holds is introduced, which clearly improves the performance of a digital controller. For most control algorithms this does not prolong the processing time significantly (e.g. less than 1%) which can be neglected in the calculations. The varying control force would need an analogue circuitry to follow the proper curve, which might make the controller's electronic circuits more complex. This can be avoided considering that in almost all digital controllers the main core operates at several orders of magnitude higher frequency than that of the control loop itself. Hence, the control force can also be generated digitally at much higher frequencies. In this paper, after investigating the stability of a 1-DoF system equipped with discrete-time PD controller with first and second order holds, the concept of modified holds is introduced and then the results are validated by simulations. Furthermore, the concept is practically implemented on a self-balancing motor bike robot and the experimental results further support the claims of the paper.",

This is most likely a contributing reason why relatively few PKMs are used in industry today. The SCARA-Tau structure is a parallel robot concept designed with the explicit goal of overcoming this limitation and developing a PKM with a workspace similar to that of a serial type robot of the same size. This paper shows for the first time how a proposed variant of the SCARA-Tau PKM can improve the usability of this robot concept further by significantly reducing the dependence between tool platform position and orientation of the original concept. The inverse kinematics of the proposed variant is derived and a comparison is made between this structure and the original SCARA-Tau concept, both with respect to platform orientation changes and workspace.",

Our robotic wheelchair aims to assist users in driving safely, without undermining their capabilities or curtailing the natural development of their skills. An important research question is to determine the conditions under which shared control is most beneficial. In this paper, we describe an experiment, where a distracting secondary task caused the majority of participants to crash the wheelchair when driving without assistance. However, when they were assisted by our collaborative controller, not only did they drive safely, but they also increased their performance in the secondary task. We demonstrate that a degree of shared control is beneficial even to proficient drivers under certain circumstances, for instance when they are under a heightened workload.",

We believe that this can be explained by the high appearance variability of indoor environments. This stresses the need to include high-level semantic information in the recognition process. In this work we propose a new approach for indoor scene recognition based on a generative probabilistic hierarchical model that uses common objects as an intermediate semantic representation. Under this model, we use object classifiers to associate low-level visual features to objects, and at the same time, we use contextual relations to associate objects to scenes. As a further contribution, we improve the performance of current state-of-the-art category-level object classifiers by including geometrical information obtained from a 3D range sensor that facilitates the implementation of a focus of attention mechanism within a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We test our approach using real data, showing significant advantages with respect to previous state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "For its own safety, a robot system should never find itself in a state where there is no feasible trajectory to avoid collision with an obstacle. Such a state is an Inevitable Collision State (ICS). The ICS concept is particularly useful for navigation in dynamic environments because it takes into account the future behaviour of the moving objects. Accordingly it requires a model of the future evolution of the environment. In the real-world, the future trajectories of the obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation of the ICS concept which incorporates uncertainty in the model of the future trajectories of the obstacles. It also presents two novel probabilistic ICS-checking algorithms that are compared with their deterministic counterpart.",

        "abstract": "Robotic vehicles operating in outdoor environments, commonly referred to as unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), are confronted with unstructured/semi-structured environments that are variable in nature. The geographical location significantly influences the environment's appearance, there are longer term seasonal cycles, as well as immediate affects such as the weather and lighting conditions. This environmental diversity has long caused researchers considerable grief, as developing a generalized terrain classification algorithm has proven to be very difficult. Researchers have skirted this problem by relying upon ranging sensors and constructing 2\u00bdD or, more recently, 3D world representations. Although geometric representations have been used extensively orientation errors limit the lookahead distance. An important UGV capability is high speed traversal, hence extending the lookahead distance that in turn increases the maximum attainable vehicle speed is an active area of research. This focus on high speed traversal in variable environments has pushed researchers to investigate techniques that allow learning from experience, in a more human like manner. This paper presents Defence R&D Canada - Suffield's progress in extending a 2\u00bdD world representation using vision and learning to infer geometry.",

The method utilises the recently proposed CRF-Matching procedure which matches laser scans based on shape descriptors. Motion estimates are computed in a probabilistic framework by performing inference on a probabilistic graphical model. We propose an efficient sampling procedure for obtaining probable association hypothesis of the probabilistic graphical model. The hypothesis are used to generate estimates on the uncertainty of translational and rotational movements of the robot. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of the approach on simulated data sets and on laser scans from an urban environment. The approach is also combined with the well-established delayed-state information filter for a large-scale outdoor simultaneous localisation and mapping task.",

        "abstract": "Most large-scale public environments provide direction signs to facilitate the orientation for humans and to find their way to a goal location in the environment. Thus, for a robot operating in the same environment, it would be beneficial to interpret such signs correctly for a safe and efficient navigation. In this work, we propose a novel approach to infer the meaning of direction signs and to use that for navigation, i.e., to find a mapping of a detected sign to a motion direction. Our method uses a hierarchical extension of the Implicit Shape Model framework called HISM that does not require any hand-labeled training data to detect the signs. On the lower level of this two-stage hierarchy, ISM is applied to image descriptors as in the standard approach. On the higher level, ISM operates on subparts of signs called tokens, using weights learned from data. The interpretation of the signs is inferred by associating navigation data to direction instructions. We conducted experiments from image data acquired in an airport terminal, aiming towards the implementation of a robotic guide, with promising results.",

        "abstract": "Information Theory is concerned with the reliable transmission of information through noisy environments. This relates to communicating agents, as well as one agent communicating with the environment by taking measurements (e.g., robotic sensing). Typically information theory is formulated in the context of probability on either discrete spaces or continuous Euclidean spaces in which the operation of addition makes sense. Some have extended information theory techniques to differential geometric settings. However, only in the context of group theory can the concept of addition be replaced in a meaningful way with a group operation. This paper presents concepts of information theory on Lie groups developed by the author, and illustrates their application to mobile robotics problems. In particular, the concepts of Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound for pose data are developed, and some theorems about their properties are proved. It is also illustrated how these concepts might be integrated into pose estimation, localization, and odor-plume source detection.",

Using the instantaneous centre of rotation (ICR) of the chassis to describe this motion is a well established method. But the ICR is a mathematical concept which is hardly achieved on a real robot. This paper addresses the problem of ICR estimation of a non-holonomic omnidirectional mobile robot using conventional wheels. Instead of estimating the ICR in the working space, our approach estimates it in the actuators' space. The algorithm is presented in its general form and then adapted for a particular robot. The use of the algorithm with other omnidirectional robots is also discussed. Results from extensive testing done in simulation as well as with a real robot are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The proposed Grasp-RRT planner combines the three main tasks needed for grasping an object: finding a feasible grasp, solving the inverse kinematics and searching a collision-free trajectory that brings the hand to the grasping pose. Therefore, RRT-based algorithms are used to build a tree of reachable and collision-free configurations. During RRT-generation, potential grasping positions are generated and approach movements toward them are computed. The quality of reachable grasping poses is scored with an online grasp quality measurement module which is based on the computation of applied forces in order to diminish the net torque.We also present an extension to a dual arm planner which generates bimanual grasps together with corresponding dual arm grasping motions. The algorithms are evaluated with different setups in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.",

The goal in this approach is achieving accurate trajectory tracking while assuring positive tension in the cables. By the proposed controller, the inherent nonlinear behavior of the cable and the target tracking errors are simultaneously compensated. In this paper asymptotic stability analysis of the close loop system is studied in detail. Moreover, it is shown that the integrated control strategy reduces the tracking error by 80% compared to that of a single loop controller in the considered manipulator. The closed-loop performance of the control topology is analyzed by a simulation study that is performed on the manipulator. The simulation study verifies that the proposed controller is not only promising to be implemented on the KNTU CDRPM, but also being suitable for other cable driven manipulators.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to planning and goal-directed behavior has recently been proposed using probabilistic inference in a graphical model that represents states, actions, constraints and goals of the future to infer appropriate actions and controls. The approach has led to new algorithms on the control and trajectory optimization level as well as for high-level rule-based planning in relational domains. In this paper we integrate these methods to a coherent control, trajectory optimization, and action planning architecture, using the principle of planning by inference across all levels of abstractions. Our scenario is a real blocks world: using a 14DoF Schunk arm and hand with tactile sensors and a stereo camera, the goal is to manipulate a set of objects on the table in a goal-oriented way. For high-level reasoning, we learn relational rule-based models from experience in simulation.",

This paper presents an integrated motion planning and control system for tracked vehicles. Flexible path-end adjustments and adaptive look-ahead are introduced to a state lattice planning approach with waypoint control. For a given processing horizon, this increases search coverage and reduces planning error. This tramming approach has been successfully fielded on a 98-ton autonomous blast hole drill rig used in iron ore mining in Western Australia. The system has undergone extensive testing and is now integrated into a production environment. This work is a key element in a larger program aimed at developing a fully autonomous, remotely operated mine.",

Test structures have been used to characterize the Young's modulus of the resulting PDMS at 1.4 MPa along with adhesion to silicon structures. In addition, compliant flexures have been designed, fabricated and characterized for eventual use in microrobot legs. Test structures have been mechanically folded 180\u00b0 out of plane over 60 times without failure.",

A tracked mobile robot is associated with unavoidable slippage due to the fact that there are infinite number of contact points between the tracks and the terrain. Furthermore, the reconfiguration of the tracked mobile robot, motion of the onboard manipulator, as well as the centrifugal forces give rise to transfer of load distribution, complicating track-terrain interactions. For a tracked mobile manipulator negotiating slopes, posture optimization is essential for enhancing the traction performance, improving the efficiency of power consumption and avoiding tip-over instabilities. In this paper, track-terrain and vehicle-manipulator interactions are analyzed for a reconfigurable tracked mobile modular manipulator negotiating slopes, and a real-time posture optimization algorithm is developed by online reconfiguring the tracked mobile platform or adjusting motion of the onboard manipulator. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms has been verified by simulations and experiments.",

To limit the internal forces arising from the redundant driving, this paper proposes a joint torque control method, which is based on an assumption that there is only one active joint in the four-link mechanism driving the climbing gait. Except the active joint, the other three joints are all considered as passive joints, whose torques tend to be zero, although they are driven by motors in reality. According to the analyses of static forces in the closed chain state, the ideal torque of named active joint is calculated, and will be followed by the joint in real climbing locomotion. The experiments reveal the reasonability and feasibility of the proposed joint control method, as well as the limitations of current prototype and control algorithm.",

A new intrinsic repeatability index is proposed that can estimate the robot endpoint position variability satisfying the non-bias and convergence conditions. Computation of this index is performed using simulated straight and drifting trajectories. Influence of load on repeatability is studied using an experimental determination of an angular covariance matrix. Therefrom intrinsic repeatability can be computed in every workspace location using only this covariance matrix and the stochastic ellipsoid theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust and efficient method of generating manipulation motion skill for non-force-feedback high speed constrained compliant robot motion. Using a non-structured teaching environment, the inherent task in the captured demonstration force and position data is estimated and reconstructed from three sets of complimentary models, including analytical mathematical modelling, empirical modelling and human skill demonstration modelling. The approach addresses task specification accuracy deficiencies, and involves outward interface simplifications, with embedded rigorous analytical methodologies that enable users to realise complex and robust constrained compliant robot motion without dealing with the low level motion generation aspects. Function based task representation supports an intuitive approach to generate robust constrained motion by skill superimposition, as exemplified by peg-in-hole with crank turning.",

        "abstract": "Model-based control methods can be used to enable fast, dexterous, and compliant motion of robots without sacrificing control accuracy. However, implementing such techniques on floating base robots, e.g., humanoids and legged systems, is non-trivial due to under-actuation, dynamically changing constraints from the environment, and potentially closed loop kinematics. In this paper, we show how to compute the analytically correct inverse dynamics torques for model-based control of sufficiently constrained floating base rigid-body systems, such as humanoid robots with one or two feet in contact with the environment. While our previous inverse dynamics approach relied on an estimation of contact forces to compute an approximate inverse dynamics solution, here we present an analytically correct solution by using an orthogonal decomposition to project the robot dynamics onto a reduced dimensional space, independent of contact forces. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our approach on a simulated floating base bipedal humanoid robot and an actual robot dog locomoting over rough terrain.",

Subjects were able to balance the system, and results show that the load stiffness curves approximate those of normal human standing to within 20.1 \u00b1 9.7% (S.D.). Differences were within the range expected from control loop delay, reduced ankle motion, and approximations inherent to the inverted pendulum model.",

However, it is difficult to measure directly joint posture in the multi-dofs joint of such robots (e.g. a hip spherical joint) because of its complicated structure. This paper describes an estimation method for tendon-driven joint postures of these complicated multi-dofs joints, only based on information of muscles' length relative displacement data during joints movement. We regard this posture estimation problem as a pattern matching problem in the mapping space from joint posture to muscle lengths and solve this problem by using very simple searching algorithms. Furthermore, this paper describes a strategy for deciding muscles motor command to acquire its joint proprioception by the proposed joint posture estimation method only based on information of muscles' length relative displacement data. Finally, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed estimation method by applying this algorithm to the real tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid Kojiro.",

        "abstract": "We consider the kinematic control problem for nonholonomic mobile manipulators (NMMs) whose base contains steering wheels. For all typical tasks, the steering velocity inputs of such systems do not appear in the differential relationship between the first-order time derivative of the task output and the available NMM inputs. As a consequence, these inputs are not used by velocity-level control laws based on simple (pseudo)inversion of the task Jacobian, leading in general to the impossibility of completing the task. We propose two control solutions to this open problem based on the framework of input-output feedback linearization. First, a static feedback law is presented that defines the unspecified steering velocities via an optimization action in the null space of the task Jacobian. A dynamic feedback law is then proposed based on the input-output differential map obtained by considering the task acceleration. In this case, the velocity of the steering wheels becomes an active input for task execution, together with the manipulator joint accelerations and the driving accelerations of the base. The feasibility and performance of the two kinematic controllers are compared in simulation for a car-like base carrying a planar manipulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper outlines a method for applying a kinematic path following control of a mobile robot without any regard for surface structure. Background. A great deal of mobile robotics kinematics analysis is based on the movement of the robot on a two dimensional flat surface. Our application for precision surgery required a new approach to a system that would operate on a highly non-linear surface; this specific system was a surgical robot that would conduct craniotomies while moving over highly irregular and often deformed skulls. Methods. The approach used an abstract view of the operating environment that would totally ignore the surface, instead determining the control parameters based only on the robot and the desired cutting trajectory. The approach was then evaluated in a 3D environment using a series of predefined surfaces to determine bounding limits in the control theory. These limits were then tested in a second series of tests using real data from the CT preoperative imagery of previous patients and phantoms. The simulation results were then compared with the actual performance of the robot on phantoms and cadavers. Results. The approach has been successfully implemented on the first medical robot to position itself through spiked wheels on the surface of the skull. Testing has to date been successful in both a simulation environment, and on initial phantom and cadiever trials, with accuracies equal to that of the larger industrial modified surgical robots.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding sufficiently simple models of high-dimensional physical systems that are consistent with observed trajectories, and using these models to synthesize new trajectories. Our approach models physical trajectories as least-time trajectories realized by free particles moving along the geodesics of a curved manifold, reminiscent of the way light rays obey Fermat's principle of least time. Finding these trajectories, unfortunately, requires finding a minimum-cost path in a high-dimensional space, which is generally a computationally intractable problem. In this work we show that this high-dimensional planning problem can often be solved nearly optimally in practice via deterministic search, as long as we can find a certain low-dimensional structure in the Lagrangian that describes our observed trajectories. This low-dimensional structure additionally makes it feasible to learn an estimate of a Lagrangian that is consistent with the observed trajectories, thus allowing us to present a complete approach for learning from and predicting high-dimensional physical motion sequences. We finally show experimental results applying our method to human motion and robotic walking gaits. In doing so, we furthermore demonstrate efficient path planning in a 990-dimensional space.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for multi-class pattern classification - face detection and facial expression recognition, which is based on discriminative multi-scale and multi-position Local Binary Pattern (MspLBP) features selected by a boosting technique called the AdaBoost+LDA (Ada-LDA) method. From a large pool of MspLBP features within a face image, the most discriminative MspLBP features trained by two alternative LDA methods depending on the singularity of the within-class scatter matrix, are selected under the framework of AdaBoost. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we performed two extensive experiments on the famous face databases in terms of face detection and facial expression recognition. First, face detection, a typical example of two-class pattern classification, was carried out on the MIT-CBCL and MIT+CMU face test sets. Second, facial expression recognition, a typical problem of multi-class pattern classification, was performed on the JAFFE face database. Given the same number of features, the proposed face detector shows over 25% higher detection rate than the well-known Viola's detector at a given false positive rate of 10%. It can also provide real-time operation with over 10 frames per second rate. For facial expression recognition, our approach also shows a better performance over at least 21% recognition rates than other linear subspace-based methods such as PCA, DCV, and PCA+LDA. Our proposed approach provides a considerable performance improvement with only a small number of discriminative MspLBP features in the multi-class pattern classification problem.",

        "abstract": "The planning of grasping motions is demanding due to the complexity of modern robot systems. In Programming by Demonstration, the observation of a human teacher allows to draw additional information about grasping strategies. Rosell showed, that the motion planning problem can be simplified by globally restricting the set of valid configurations to a learned subspace. In this work, the transformation of a humanoid grasping strategy to an anthropomorphic robot system is described by a probabilistic model, called variation model, in order to account for modeling and transformation errors. The variation model resembles a soft preference for grasping motions similar to the demonstration and therefore induces a non-uniform sampling distribution on the configuration space. The sampling distribution is used in a standard probabilistic motion planner to plan grasping motions efficiently for new objects in new environments.",

We employ novel custom vision and robotic hardware designed specifically for this learning task. The game rules can be parametrically specified. Two independent computational agents alternate playing the two opponents with the shared vision and robotic hardware, using pre-specified rule sets. A third independent computational agent, sharing the same hardware, learns the game rules solely by observing the physical play, without access to the pre-specified rule set, using inductive logic programming with minimal background knowledge possessed by human children. The vision component of our integrated system reliably detects the position of the board in the image and reconstructs the game state after every move, from a single image. The robotic component reliably moves pieces both between board positions and to and from off-board positions as needed by an arbitrary parametrically-specified legal-move generator. Thus the rules of games learned solely by observing physical play can drive further physical play. We demonstrate our system learning to play six different games.",

        "abstract": "Reliable and efficient navigation with a humanoid robot is a difficult task. First, the motion commands are executed rather inaccurately due to backlash in the joints or foot slippage. Second, the observations are typically highly affected by noise due to the shaking behavior of the robot. Thus, the localization performance is typically reduced while the robot moves and the uncertainty about its pose increases. As a result, the reliable and efficient execution of a navigation task cannot be ensured anymore since the robot's pose estimate might not correspond to the true location. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning approach to select appropriate navigation actions for a humanoid robot equipped with a camera for localization. The robot learns to reach the destination reliably and as fast as possible, thereby choosing actions to account for motion drift and trading off velocity in terms of fast walking movements against accuracy in localization. We present extensive simulated and practical experiments with a humanoid robot and demonstrate that our learned policy significantly outperforms a hand-optimized navigation strategy.",

In this paper, we extend their method to accommodate grasps with multiple contacts. This approach works well for many human-made objects because it models the way we grasp objects. To further improve the grasping, we also use a method that learns the ranking between candidates. The experiments show that our method is highly effective compared to a state-of-the-art competitor.",

The key research question addressed in this paper is how to learn planners that generate human-like motion behavior. Our approach uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn human-like navigation behavior based on example paths. Since robots have only limited sensing, we extend existing IRL methods to the case of partially observable environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic crowd flow simulator in which we modeled multiple scenarios in crowded environments. We show that our planner learned to guide the robot along the flow of people when the environment is crowded, and along the shortest path if no people are around.",

        "abstract": "We aim to perform robust and fast vision-based localization using a pre-existing large map of the scene. A key step in localization is associating the features extracted from the image with the map elements at the current location. Although the problem of data association has greatly benefited from recent advances in appearance-based matching methods, less attention has been paid to the effective use of the geometric relations between the 3D map and the camera in the matching process. In this paper we propose to exploit the geometric relationship between the 3D map and the camera pose to determine the visibility of the features. In our approach, we model the visibility of every map feature with respect to the camera pose using a non-parametric distribution model. We learn these non-parametric distributions during the 3D reconstruction process, and develop efficient algorithms to predict the visibility of features during localization. With this approach, the matching process only uses those map features with the highest visibility score, yielding a much faster algorithm and superior localization results. We demonstrate an integrated system based on the proposed idea and highlight its potential benefits for the localization in large and cluttered environments",

To solve this problem, a novel method by which to estimate the gait cycle from pelvic movement and feed forward control for leg-dependent force control are proposed. Based on an experiment on gait cycle estimation, a method of estimating heel contact timing from pelvic rotation is proposed. In addition, based on an experiment on leg-dependent force control, the developed feed forward control method is evaluated based on the vertical floor reaction force.",

The general idea is to build a local map incrementally which is matched to a global map in each localization step. The matching algorithm is a very time and memory efficient enhancement of the common Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). It is executed a fixed number of iterations computing a set of hypotheses of the current robot pose. This paper describes how to handle the resulting hypotheses, i.e. a method is introduced deciding when the robot is localized reliably enough. The algorithm has been implemented and its characteristics are evaluated and discussed in an experimental section.",

We justify the origin of the anomalous behaviour of the filter in the time-correlated nature of the measurement noise sequence. A novel solution based on the measurement differencing technique is proposed to drive the solution of the EKF towards consistency.

The developed analysis gives insights on how the selection of a particular configuration reflects on the quality of the measurement signal, and it allows to compare the effectiveness of different configurations. The set of all the optimal configurations is parameterized into two constraints. The results are derived from the analysis of the singular values of a particular matrix obtained by solving the sensor kinematics problem. Moreover, given any mobile robot platform, an end-user procedure is provided to select the best location for N optical mouse sensors on such a platform.

If it were possible to propagate a traveling wave in several directions, an omni-directional mobile robot could be realized. Since the locomotion mechanism of the snail involves moving a larger area than in the case with other creatures, it is able to move not only on irregular ground such as swamps, but also on walls and ceilings. We have developed an omni-directional mobile robot that makes use of a traveling wave and have derived a kinematical model for locomotion strategy. In experiments, the robot showed good performance, as described in this paper.",

A single sensor pack, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), provides all the data required to feed the attitude filter. The design is sensor-driven and departs from traditional solutions as no explicit representations of the attitude, e.g., Euler angles, quaternions, or rotation matrices, are considered in the filter design. Moreover, the proposed solution includes the estimation of rate gyros biases, systematic tuning procedures, and also allows for the inclusion of frequency weights to model colored noise on the different sensor channels. Due to its inherent structure, the filter is complementary, allows for temporary loss of sensor measurements, and also copes well with slowly time-varying rate gyros biases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated with a low-cost IMU and resorting to a high precision calibration table, which provides ground truth signals for comparison with the resulting filter estimates.",

        "abstract": "The need for novel, high performance actuators felt in several fields of robotics, such as assistive or rehabilitative robotics, is not fully satisfied by current actuation means. This fosters an intense research on novel energy transduction methods. In particular, propellant-based chemical actuators, able to directly convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, appear very promising, although their potential in robotics has not yet been deeply investigated. This work focuses on H2O2, used as propellant for actuators. This chemical was first used in robotics, with excellent results, by Goldfarb and collaborators, in 2003. H2O2 dissociation is strongly exothermic, which generates important design issues when the actuated machine operates in close proximity to the human body. In this paper it is shown that: 1) is possible to operate the decomposition process at acceptable temperature, by means of basic solutions of hydrogen peroxide; 2) for basic pH solutions, tin becomes an effective catalyst for H2O2 dissociation. A kinetic model of H2O2 dissociation in basic solutions is provided, that is in good agreement with experimental data. We show how the model can be used to gather the necessary information for the dimensioning of H2O2-based actuators.",

In this paper, we present an approach for wall collision avoidance using a depth map based on optical flow from on board camera images. An omnidirectional fisheye camera is used as a primary sensor, while IMU data is needed for compensating rotational effects of the optical flow. The here presented approach is designed for safely maneuvering a helicopter through an indoor corridor. Results based on real images taken in a corridor with textured walls are shown at the end of this paper.",

We achieve this with both algorithmic and architecture improvements, with a novel feature matching algorithm, a hybrid GPU/CPU architecture that exploits parallelism at all levels, and an optimized resource scheduler. Using the same standard hardware, we achieve up to 30\u00d7 improvement on real-world scenes.",

The controller regulates the length of the tendons to achieve a desired orientation of the neck and at the same time it maintains the tension of the tendons within certain limits. The solution we propose does not use any model of the system, but it relies on online learning of the different Jacobian mappings required by the controller. Learning, data acquisition and control are simultaneous; thus learning is completely autonomous, and purely online. We show that after enough iterations the controller produces straight trajectories in the task space and is able to maintain the tension of the tendons within safe limits.",

For these reasons, they were proposed as nanoplasters for localized drug release or as a new solution for closing endoluminal surgical wounds. This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of free-standing nanosheets loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles, which can be manipulated in liquid environment by means of magnetic fields. A theoretical model of magnetic manipulation of the nanosheet is proposed and validated by dragging the film with a permanent magnet mounted on an industrial robotic arm. Controlling the magnetic sheet in liquid environment represents a first step towards the application of these nanostructures as free-standing carriers to be released and magnetically controlled in endoluminal surgery or as plasters with nanometric thickness to be delivered in situ on surgical incisions. Furthermore, these magnetic nanofilms can be adapted and used as micro and nanocomponents for the design of a novel generation of magnetic actuated polymeric microrobots.",

Robotic routers are especially appealing for applications in which there is a single mobile user whose connectivity to a base station must be maintained in an environment that is large compared to the wireless range. In this paper, we study the problem of computing motion strategies for robotic routers in such scenarios, as well as the minimum number of robotic routers necessary to enact our motion strategies. Assuming that the routers are as fast as the user, we present an optimal solution for cases where the environment is a simply-connected polygon, a constant factor approximation for cases where the environment has a single obstacle, and an O(h) approximation for cases where the environment has h circular obstacles. The O(h) approximation also holds for cases where the environment has h arbitrary polygonal obstacles, provided they satisfy certain geometric constraints - e.g. when the set of their minimum bounding circles is disjoint.",

        "abstract": "Micro/nano robots have been actively studied toward the realization. Now, the micro living organisms have been used as the driving forces for the micro objects. To achieve the fine manipulation of bio driven micro objects, the manipulation methods have to be established. Therefore, the local environmental control technique is desired to manipulate a single cell and to analyze the detailed properties. We have developed the local environmental control system with nano/micro dual pipettes, and achieved the quick-response and iterative rotational speed manipulation of Na+-driven flagellar motor, which is a rotary molecular machine, by switching the local spout between Na+-containing and Na+-free solutions with dual pipettes. In this paper, we upgrade our local environmental control system with nano/micro dual pipettes to achieve the quantitative and long-time-stable manipulation of the rotational speed of the Na+-driven flagellar motor. We demonstrate fine and long-time-stable rotational speed manipulation of Na+-driven flagellar motor by simultaneous local spouts of Na+-containing and Na+-free solutions using dual pipettes with controlling the spouting velocities independently. And, as the driving force, the rotational torque generated by the flagellar motor is estimated at the range from ~2.3\u00d7103 to ~2.8\u00d7103 pN\u00b7nm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive foothold planning method for a hexapod walking robot. A local terrain map acquired with an inexpensive structured light sensor is exploited as the information source for the planning algorithm, which uses a polynomial-based approximation method to create a decision surface. The robot learns from simulations, therefore no a priori knowledge is required. The results show that the method is general enough to work on various types of terrain. The planned footholds enable the robot to walk more stable, avoiding slippages and fall-downs.",

Our approach uses data recorded with a data suit which is equipped with several IMUs to detect movements of a person and door opening and closing events. In our approach we interpret the movements as motion constraints and door handling events as landmark detections in a graph-based SLAM framework. As we cannot distinguish between individual doors, we employ a multi-hypothesis approach on top of the SLAM system to deal with the high data-association uncertainty. As a result, our approach is able to accurately and robustly recover the trajectory of the person. We additionally take advantage of the fact that people traverse free space and that doors separate rooms to recover the geometric structure of the environment after the graph optimization. We evaluate our approach in several experiments carried out with different users and in environments of different types.",

Polystyrene microbeads were used as a material of the microtool. A solution including microparticles was dispersed onto the silicon substrate having microtool patterns fabricated by photolithography and etching. Dispersed particles were introduced to the pattern by gravity force. Microparticles in the pattern aggregate autonomously by surface tension through evaporation of the solution. Aggregated microparticles were fused by heating above the glass transition temperature (100 Celsius degrees). Fused microparticles were detached from the pattern by ultrasonic treatment and used as microtools. Produced microtool has spherical part since the microtool is made of microparticles. Spherical part is suitable for trapping point of optical tweezers. We demonstrated production of microtools using self-assembly and manipulation of the fabricated microtool on a chip. Position and attitude accuracy of the fabricated microtool controlled by TSS were evaluated by image processing. Finally, the transport speed of the fabricated microtool was compared with that of the photofabricated microtool. We confirmed the improvement of the transport speed and the effectiveness of our proposed microtool.",

Applications of such a system includes quality assurance and estimating surface friction during manipulation tasks. A naive Bayes classifier is used to distinguish textures sensed by a bio-inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensity of vibrations in the silicone. Textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger is pre-processed and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to learn a classifier for different textures. The performance of the classifier is evaluated against a naive time domain based learner. Preliminary results show that our classifier performs better.",

The scenario described here requires dealing with many difficult practical challenges such as the presence of multiple levels of container stacking and sequencing, variable container orientations, and vehicular dynamics that require finite acceleration and deceleration times. Furthermore, in contrast to the automatically guided vehicle planning problem in a manufacturing environment, the container carriers described here are free ranging. Although, the port structure imposes a set of \u201cvirtual\u201d roadways along which the vehicles are allowed to travel, path planning is essential in preventing contention and collisions. A performance metric which minimises total yard-vehicle usage, while producing robust traffic plans by encouraging both early starting and finishing of jobs is presented for different vehicle fleet sizes and job allocation scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Since 2007, the research on the anthropomorphic saxophonist robot at Waseda University aims in understanding the human motor control from an engineering point of view as well as an approach to enable the interaction with musical partners. As a result of our research, last year we have introduced the Wa\u0332seda S\u0332axophonist Robot No. 1\u0332 (WAS-1), composed of 15-DOFs that reproduced the lips (1-DOF), tonguing (1-DOF), oral cavity, lungs (2-DOF) and fingers (11-DOFs). However, even that the mouth mechanism of WAS-1 was useful in order to adjust the pitch of the saxophone sound, the range of sound pressure was too narrow. Thus, no dynamic effects of the sound can be reproduced (i.e. crescendo and decrescendo). Moreover, the finger mechanism was designed only to play from C3\u2013C#5. On the other hand, a cascade feedback control system has been implemented in the WAS-1; however, a considerable delay in the attack time to reach the desired air pressure was detected. Therefore, in this paper, the Wa\u0332seda S\u0332axophone Robot No. 2\u0332 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips. In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic enumeration and performance analysis of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs). VSAs are becoming more and more popular in robotics, and many different prototypes have been recently proposed and built in the research community. In comparison with conventional geared motors, actuators with variable stiffness introduce the need for new specifications, requirements, and performance criteria, concerning e.g. the range of achievable stiffness, and the response time to stiffness reference changes. On the other hand, the mechanical construction of VSAs is also more complex. To address the problem of harnessing the increased complexity of VSA design, we consider in this article the enumeration of all possible arrangements of two prime movers (elementary motors), two harmonic-drive gears, the output shaft, and the interconnections (either rigid or elastic) between these elements. We propose an automated algorithm to search the large combinatorics of such enumeration, and present a reduced number of feasible basic designs which accomplish the objectives of VS actuation. Furthermore, we propose a quasi-static model of VS actuators which can be used for an analysis of their performance and we conclude by presenting some preliminary characteristics of one of the selected designs.",

        "abstract": "Current top down manipulation systems used in micro and nanomanufacturing are many orders of magnitude larger than the parts being handled, leading to difficult tradeoffs between their precision, throughput and cost. This paper presents recent research progress in the manufacturing of millimeter sized robotic positioning technology that allows combining high precision with high throughput along with other application-specific requirements such as strength, dexterity, and work volume. The first robot type is the ARRIpede microcrawler, and we describe recent progress in microrobot packaging and backpack electronics leading to its untethered operation. Precision measurements describing the ARRIpede motion resolution and repeatability are reported. The second microrobot called the Articulated Four Axes Microrobot (AFAM) is a 3D dexterous micromanipulator robot, and we describe nanoindentation experiments using SPM tips mounted on the microrobot. By combining positioning data obtained using laser interferometers and SEM imaging of nanoindentation data, precision metrics such as accuracy, repeatability and resolution of the AFAM robot are determined. Using these two microrobots as basic positioning and manipulation units, we propose a concept for a nanoassembly module, or a so-called wafer-level factory.",

Hybrid Backstepping control and the Frenet-Serret theory is used for attitude stabilization, introducing a desired attitude angle acceleration function dependent on aircraft velocity. Finally, improvements on disturbance rejection and attitude tracking at moderate aircraft speeds are validated through various simulation scenarios (indoor navigation based on camera tracking), and flight experiments conducted on the DraganFlyer quadrotor.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and construction of a miniaturized triaxial force sensor which can be applied inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The sensing principle of the sensor is based on an optical intensity modulation mechanism that utilizes bent-tip optical fibers to measure the deflection of a compliant platform when exposed to a force. By measuring the deflection of the platform using this optical approach, the magnitude and direction of three orthogonal force components (Fx, Fy, and Fz) can be determined. The sensor prototype described in this paper demonstrates that it can perform force measurements in axial and radial directions with working ranges of +/-2 N. Since the sensor is small in size and entirely made of nonmetallic materials, it is compatible with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and safe to be deployed within magnetic resonance (MR) environments.",

        "abstract": "As an integral part of real-time vision system, there are two most important requirements for feature matching mechanisms: high computational efficiency for meeting the real-time demands, and high correct matching rate for ensuring the convergence and consistency of state estimation. Both of these are addressed and solved as an integrated whole by the efficient minimum-error active matching scheme proposed in this paper. Image processing is performed in a dynamically guided fashion by checking only parts of the image where positive matches are most probable. For achieving the global consensus matchings, rigorous analysis on how to minimize the matching errors in active matching by choosing an optimal search order is made. After that, practical feature matching algorithms are given, which have naturally absorbed the ideas of nearest neighbor (NN) and joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) approaches. Both statistical simulations and real-world experimental results have verified the proposed methods can perform better than the state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e. being able to obtain the best global consensus matchings with much lower computational cost.",

In this work, a systematic approach of obtaining the unknown physical parameters of FELA is presented. Subsequently, these parameters are used to design two model-based PID controllers that allow the FELA to perform high-precision positioning tasks and direct-force imprinting tasks respectively. As the imprinting tasks require the FELA to operate in both position and direct-force control modes, two types of control strategies are explored and their competency of enabling the FELA to perform such tasks are investigated. Lastly, the selected control strategy is implemented on the FELA to assist the hot-embossing imprinter in fabricating micro-channels on polymer substrates via a hot-embossing process.",

The present paper proposes a motion tracking system using distributed network cameras that are placed in a sizeable environment, such as a street or a town. Model-based motion tracking is adopted in this system, and an asynchronous process is invoked for updating motion estimation in each camera individually. A 2D distance map created by the Fast Marching Method is used to estimate human motion in real-time. Experiments demonstrate that human motion while walking among eight distributed cameras is tracked correctly by automatically selecting appropriate cameras.",

        "abstract": "We present a dynamic model of the wireless resonant magnetic microactuator (WRMMA), which is a key component of the MagMite family of microrobots. We analyze the interbody force and integrate the nonsmooth and nonlinear equations of motion using a time-stepping integration scheme. We investigate the influence of system parameters, such as friction, the frequency of the applied force, the magnitude of the applied field, the effect of a clamping force, and the effect on velocity when phase shifting the clamping signal with respect to the magnetic signal. Our results are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations, and explain several nonintuitive phenomena. We show that the robots are highly sensitive to the phase of the clamping force, that the velocity can switch directions with changing frequency, and that both erratic and controlled motion occur under specific conditions.",

        "abstract": "The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental surveillance applications motivates the use of robotic sensors to achieve sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. A common approach in machine learning to model spatial dynamics is to use the nonparametric Bayesian framework known as Gaussian Processes (GPs) (c.f., [1]) which are fully specified by a mean and a covariance function. However, defining suitable covariance functions that are able to appropriately model complex space-time dependencies in the environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for constructing several classes of covariance functions for spatio-temporal GP modeling. The GP models are then extended to perform efficient path planning in continuous space while maximizing the information gain. Extensive empirical evaluation for the different classes of covariance functions using real world sensing datasets is discussed, including experiments on a tethered robotic system - Networked Info Mechanical System (NIMS).",

        "abstract": "We explain when, and why, solder-based phase change materials (PCMs) are best-suited as a means to modify a robotic mechanism's kinematic and elastomechanic behavior. The preceding refers to mechanisms that possess joints which may be thermally locked and unlocked via a material phase change within the joint. Different combinations of locked and unlocked joints can yield several one-DOF mechanisms states. One actuator may be used to control motion allowed by a first state, then a new combination of locked/unlocked joints may be set and the actuator then controls motion allowed by the new state. Compared to other thermo-rheological fluids, solders yield joints with the (i) highest strength and stiffness, (ii) fastest lock/unlock speed, and (iii) lowest lock/unlock power. Herein, we cover physics-based design insights that provide understanding of how solder-based material properties and joint design dominate/limit joint performance characteristics. First order models are used to demonstrate selection of suitable PCMs and how to set initial joint geometry prior to fine tuning via detailed models/experiments. The insights and models are discussed in the context of a joint for a crawling robot that uses a single spooler motor and three solder-locking joints to crawl and steer.",

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is used to separate, manipulate and detect micro particles in several domains, such as in biological or Carbon Nano-Tubes (CNTs) manipulations. Current methods to simulate the trajectory of micro-particles under a DEP force field are based on Finite Elements Modeling (FEM) which requires new simulations when the electrodes potentials are changed, or on analytic equations which are limited to very simple geometries. In this paper, we propose an hybrid method between analytical and numerical calculations able to simulate complex geometries and to easily change the electrode voltages along the trajectory. In this method a few FEM simulations are used to create a database which enables online calculation of the object trajectory in function of the electrode potentials. In order to verify the simulation results, experiments are done and compared to the simulations.",

This orthosis can be used for rehabilitation, to help people having weak legs, or to help those suffering from a broken leg, to walk. It can also be used as an assistive device helping people carrying heavy loads. Its main characteristic is that a passive force balancer provides the force to sustain bodyweight. An actuator is also required, but is used only to shift that force the same side as the leg in stance. Consequently, MoonWalker requires very low energy to work on flat terrains. That motor can provide also a part of the energy to climb stairs or slopes. We believe that this approach can help improving energetic autonomy of lower limb exoskeletons.",

To that end, we introduce dynamic mapping, i.e. the accumulation of measurements for moving objects. We show experimentally that the approach is able to deliver a dense motion field which can then be used for object-class independent trajectory estimation.",

We hypothesise that performance on the task can be improved by incorporating an understanding of physically likely and feasible object dynamics. We test this hypothesis by incorporating a physical simulator into a least-squares estimation procedure. We initialise a full trajectory estimate using RANSAC followed by gradient descent refinement. We present results for 2D image sequences consisting of single ambiguous, visible or occluded balls, as well as results for 3D computer-generated sequences of objects in free-flight with added noise. Results suggest that restricting the estimation to allow only motions that are feasible according to the physics simulator can produce marked improvement when the observed object motion is within the limits of the physics simulator and its world model. Conversely, merely penalising deviations from feasible physical dynamics produces a consistent but incremental improvement over more common dynamics models.",

        "abstract": "Traditional robot controllers are not designed to produce human-like reactive motion\u2014movements lasting tens of sample periods and requiring large accelerations. One of the major obstacles to producing reactive motions with contemporary controllers is that they rely on kinematic commands. The performance of short duration motions requiring large accelerations is dominated by the motion's dynamics; kinematic commands without an accurate dynamic model of the robot and task will lead to poor performance. Conversely, this paper presents a biologically inspired \u201ctorque command\u201d that allows the dynamics of the motion to be communicated to the controller. The commands can be produced with only minor modifications to any existing control scheme that will not impact traditional operation. In addition, sensory input can be mapped directly to presented commands for latency sensitive tasks. The ability of the new commands to express a broad range of motions with a small number of parameters is shown experimentally. The experimental results also show that the presented torque commands can be used to learn a ball intercept task.",

        "abstract": "We present a computational framework for automatic deployment of a robot from a temporal logic specification over a set of properties of interest satisfied at the regions of a partitioned environment. We assume that, during the motion of the robot in the environment, the current region can be precisely determined, while due to sensor and actuation noise, the outcome of a control action can only be predicted probabilistically. Under these assumptions, the deployment problem translates to generating a control strategy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from a temporal logic formula.We propose an algorithm inspired from probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) model checking to find a control strategy that maximizes the probability of satisfying the specification. We illustrate our method with simulation and experimental results.",

Only the prismatic joint is actuated and the first revolute joint in the chain can be locked or released online. The introduction of these lockable joints allow the prismatic actuators to maneuver to approximate 6-DoF motions for the moving platform. An algorithm for generating these maneuvers is first described. Then, a motion planner, based on the generation of a Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) whose nodes are connected using the described maneuvers, is presented. The generated trajectories avoid singularities and possible collisions between legs. (See accompanying video)",

        "abstract": "Time-delay in sensor measurements can be a frequent cause of instability and performance degradation in a robotic system. In this paper, motion tracking of rigid manipulators in presence of constant and known delay in sensors is investigated. By using non-minimal model of a manipulator, a dynamically smooth controller based on the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach is proposed which guarantees asymptotic tracking of desired joint angles and velocities in presence of delayed measurements. For a given controller the maximum amount of delay that preserves system stability is computed by solving an LMI optimization and also by numerical simulations, and the results are compared. Finally, a simulation example is presented that illustrates the performance of the proposed controller in comparison with standard motion controllers.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Hitting and batting tasks, such as tennis forehands, ping-pong strokes, or baseball batting, depend on predictions where the ball can be intercepted and how it can properly be returned to the opponent. These predictions get more accurate over time, hence the behaviors need to be continuously modified. As a result, movement templates with a learned global shape need to be adapted during the execution so that the racket reaches a target position and velocity that will return the ball over to the other side of the net or court. It requires altering learned movements to hit a varying target with the necessary velocity at a specific instant in time. Such a task cannot be incorporated straightforwardly in most movement representations suitable for learning. For example, the standard formulation of the dynamical system based motor primitives (introduced by Ijspeert et al. [1]) does not satisfy this property despite their flexibility which has allowed learning tasks ranging from locomotion to kendama. In order to fulfill this requirement, we reformulate the Ijspeert framework to incorporate the possibility of specifying a desired hitting point and a desired hitting velocity while maintaining all advantages of the original formulation. We show that the proposed movement template formulation works well in two scenarios, i.e., for hitting a ball on a string with a table tennis racket at a specified velocity and for returning balls launched by a ball gun successfully over the net using forehand movements. All experiments were carried out on a Barrett WAM using a four camera vision system.",

The idea is that the patroller and the intruder play a game, whose outcome depends on the combination of their actions. From the analysis of this game, an optimal strategy for the patrolling robot can be derived. Although game theoretical approaches are promising, their applicability in real settings is still an open problem. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the practical applicability of the most general game theoretical approach for patrolling strategies, called BGA model. Experiments are conducted by using USARSim, with the goal of studying the behavior of the optimal patrolling strategy returned by the BGA model both in situations that violate its idealized assumptions and in comparison with other patrolling strategies that can be developed with much less computational effort.",

In the present work we extend DPC to the problem of multiple task execution. While this extended problem inherits all the objectives, complexities and constraints of the basic DPC algorithm, each robot is also given an unordered set of tasks that it has to execute before it reaches its goal. There is no specific order imposed on the tasks assigned to a particular robot. The algorithm decides the order of execution of the tasks such that an optimal solution is attained while the time-parametrized distance constraints are satisfied along with successful execution of the tasks. We solve this problem by designing a \u201cState-task Graph\u201d that represents a product of the state-space graph and the task graph. We then develop an efficient heuristic function for performing searches in this graph.",

        "abstract": "We propose a combined deploy and search strategy for multi-agent systems using Voronoi partition. Agents such as mobile robots (AGVs, UAVs, or USVs) search the space to acquire knowledge about the space. Lack of information about the search space is modeled as an uncertainty density distribution, which is known a priori to all the agents at the beginning of search. It is shown that when the agents are located at the centroid of Voronoi cells, computed with the perceived uncertainty density, reduction in uncertainty density is maximized. While moving toward this optimal configuration, the agents simultaneously perform search acquiring the information about the search space, thereby reducing the uncertainty density. The proposed search strategy is guaranteed to reduce the average uncertainty density to any arbitrary level. Simulation experiments are carried out to validate the proposed search strategy and compare its performance with sequential deploy and search strategy proposed in the literature. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy performs better than sequential deploy and search in terms of faster search, and smoother and shorter robot trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Robust object detection is a critical skill for robotic applications in complex environments like homes and offices. In this paper we propose a method for using multiple cameras to simultaneously view an object from multiple angles and at high resolutions. We show that our probabilistic method for combining the camera views, which can be used with many choices of single-image object detector, can significantly improve accuracy for detecting objects from many viewpoints. We also present our own single-image object detection method that uses large synthetic datasets for training. Using a distributed, parallel learning algorithm, we train from very large datasets (up to 100 million image patches). The resulting object detector achieves high performance on its own, but also benefits substantially from using multiple camera views. Our experimental results validate our system in realistic conditions and demonstrates significant performance gains over using standard single-image classifiers, raising accuracy from 0.86 area-under-curve to 0.97.",

        "abstract": "Accurate image classification is crucial in many robotics and surveillance applications - for example, a vision system on a robot needs to accurately recognize the objects seen by its camera. Object recognition systems typically need a large amount of training data for satisfactory performance. The problem is particularly acute when many object categories are present. In this paper we present a batch-mode active learning framework for multi-class image classification systems. In active learning, images are to be chosen for interactive labeling, instead of passively accepting training data. Our framework addresses two important issues: i) it handles redundancy between different images which is crucial when batch-mode selection is performed; and ii) we pose batch-selection as a submodular function optimization problem that makes an inherently intractable problem efficient to solve, while having approximation guarantees. We show results on image classification data in which our approach substantially reduces the amount of training required over the baseline.",

The framework for passive sampled Port-Hamiltonian systems allows multi-dimensional virtual environments exhibiting internal dynamic behavior to be computed on a discrete medium in a passive manner. It is shown that a causality analysis is required in the framework to detect if any of the model elements have, a time dependent change of energy function in the energy balance of the system. The Standard Linear Solid model, which is often used to simulate the visco-elastic interaction with soft biological tissue is used as an example. Simulated and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the benefit of the described framework. It is shown that using this approach a multi-dimensional model which is passive in the continuous domain remains passive in the discrete domain, whereas a standard discretization approach can become non-passive.",

Specifically, we examine the case in which a mobile network of robots must search, survey, or cover an environment while remaining connected. While many algorithms utilize continual connectivity for such tasks, we relax this requirement and introduce the idea of periodic connectivity, where the network must regain connectivity at a fixed interval. We show that, in some cases, this problem reduces to the well-studied NP-hard multi-robot informative path planning (MIPP) problem, and we propose an online algorithm that scales linearly in the number of robots and allows for arbitrary periodic connectivity constraints. We prove theoretical performance guarantees and validate our approach in the coordinated search domain in simulation and in real-world experiments. Our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a gradient method that requires continual connectivity and performs competitively with a market-based approach, but at a fraction of the computational cost.",

Each robot can only detect intruders and communicate with other robots within a limited range. No map of the environment is given, and none is built during the process. Robots are only capable of following walls and other robots that are nearby. The algorithm puts together elementary behaviors giving robots the means to coordinate their movement in order to cover lines between opposite walls with their sensors and discover nearby new walls. A line has leading robots at its endpoints that follow walls and hence move the line of robots forward. Multiple such lines move through the entire assigned area in order to detect all intruders. The movement of multiple lines is coordinated by using a graph representation of the environment that describes possible line movements and their associated costs in terms of robots. This coordination requires only local communication between the leaders of different robot lines when they meet. Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be implemented using elementary wall following and obstacle discovery behaviors.",

Most existing approaches, however, focus on scenarios where localization and mapping are the only tasks on the robot's agenda. In many real-world scenarios, a robot may be called on to perform other tasks simultaneously, in addition to localization and mapping. These can include target-following (or avoidance), search-and-rescue, point-to-point navigation, refueling, and so on. This paper proposes a framework that balances localization, mapping, and other planning objectives, thus allowing robots to solve sequential decision tasks under map and pose uncertainty. Our approach combines a SLAM algorithm with an online POMDP approach to solve diverse navigation tasks, without prior training, in an unknown environment.",

        "abstract": "Depth and presence sensors are used to prevent collisions in environments where human/robot coexistence is relevant. To address the problem of occluded areas, we extend in this paper a recently introduced efficient approach for preventing collisions using a single depth sensor to multiple depth and/or presence sensors. Their integration is systematically handled by resorting to the concept of image planes, where computations can be suitable carried out on 2D data without reconstructing obstacles in 3D. To maximize the on-line collision detection performance by multiple sensor integration, an off-line optimal sensor placement problem is formulated in a probabilistic framework, using a cell decomposition and characterizing the probability of cells being in the shadow of obstacles or unobserved. This approach allows to fit the optimal numerical solution to the most probable operating conditions of a human and a robot sharing the same working area. Three examples of optimal sensor placement are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new algorithm for cooperative and persistent simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using multiple robots. Recent pose graph representations have proven very successful for single robot mapping and localization. Among these methods, incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) gives an exact incremental solution to the SLAM problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel extension to iSAM to facilitate online multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose graphs. Our main contribution is a relative formulation of the relationship between multiple pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem and leads to an efficient solution when compared to a completely global formulation. The relative pose graphs are optimized together to provide a globally consistent multi-robot solution. Efficient access to covariances at any time for relative parameters is provided through iSAM, facilitating data association and loop closing. The performance of the technique is illustrated on various data sets including a publicly available multi-robot data set. Further evaluation is performed in a collaborative helicopter and ground robot experiment.",

Individual vehicle missions are defined by means of Petri nets and three constraints are added for coordination purposes: mutual exclusion, ordering and synchronisation. The proposed methodology generates a centralised net, checks if it is deadlock free and then obtains a decentralised Petri net for every vehicle minimising the communication between them. The resulting Petri nets implement the multi-vehicle mission control program that is responsible for coordinating in real-time the set of vehicles involved in the mission.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of task assignment and execution in multirobot systems, by proposing a procedure for bid estimation in auction protocols. Auctions are of interest to multirobot systems because they provide a flexible way to coordinate the assignment of tasks to robots. The main idea is to exploit task execution controllers that rely on the availability of value functions. These provide a natural way to obtain the bid values for a given task, compared to the heuristic and ad-hoc bid estimation procedures in common use. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework is used to compute policies for the execution of tasks by each agent, with the task bid values obtained directly from the respective value functions. Several simulation examples are presented for an urban surveillance environment, illustrating the applicability of our ideas.",

Our approach extends the model of a simple car to a simple-airplane, which has constraints on speed and steering angle and includes a configuration variable for the altitude. We use a locally optimal reciprocal collision avoidance scheme that computes the trajectory without any collisions or oscillations for each airplane independently. In addition, our algorithm explicitly considers the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a simple-airplane and uses the notion of variable reciprocity when choosing velocities to ensure that simple-airplanes that are less constrained take more responsibility for avoiding collisions. We test our approach in two simulations and compute collision-free and oscillation-free trajectories that satisfy the kinematic and dynamic constraints of each simple-airplane.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports an overview of the navigation and control system design for the new Nereus hybrid underwater robotic vehicle (HROV). Vehicle performance during its first sea trials in November 2007 near Hawaii, and in May and June 2009 in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench is reported. During the latter expedition, the vehicle successfully performed scientific observation and sampling operations at depths exceeding 10,903 m. The Nereus underwater vehicle is designed to perform scientific survey and sampling to the full depth of the ocean - significantly deeper than the depth capability of all other present-day operational vehicles. For comparison, the second deepest underwater vehicle currently operational worldwide can dive to 7,000 m maximum depth. Nereus operates in two different modes. For broad-area survey, the vehicle can operate untethered as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of exploring and mapping the sea floor with sonars and cameras. Nereus can be converted at sea to become a tethered remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to enable close-up imaging and sampling. The ROV configuration incorporates a lightweight fiber-optic tether (for high-bandwidth, real-time video and data telemetry to the surface), an electro-hydraulic manipulator arm, and sampling instruments. The Nereus vehicle is designed to render all parts of the Earth's seafloor accessible to oceanographic science.",

Each vehicle is treated as the agent of a network, which cooperates in order to cover a given area according to its own capabilities. A general framework is introduced, which aims at providing tools for solving a large class of coordination problems. The capabilities of each agent are modeled with Descriptor Functions; the sum of these functions constitutes the swarm's descriptor. The goal of the swarm is to match a desired descriptor, by minimizing an appropriate cost functional. A control law is proposed, which is capable of driving the agents towards the achievement of the goal. The existence of local minima and of a global minimum is discussed. Theoretical results on the existence of the global minimum are given. The Area Coverage problem is selected as a preliminary test for the algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to autonomous pursuit evasion by a wheeled mobile robot in the presence of wheel slip is presented. Classical pursuit evasion problem, such as the Homicidal Chauffeur problem, considers the kinematic model of the pursuer and does not consider slip in its trajectory, and thus cannot predict a realistic pursuit evasion scenario. In this work we present a new dynamics-based approach to pursuit evasion problem in the presence of wheel slip. We first show how a feedback linearization controller can achieve capture with wheel slip. We then improve the capture time by designing a new extremum seeking controller that maximizes lateral traction force to effect a sharper but stable turn. The simulation results show the efficacy of our proposed control approach.",

Needle insertion planning into deformable tissue for breast biopsy procedure is a challenging task because of the infinite possibilities of insertion points. In addition, the lesion moves from its original position when the radiologist introduces the biopsy needle. The proposed approach couples Rapidly-exploring Random Trees with Finite Element Simulation in order to find an optimal path taking breast deformations into account. Simulation results show that this method reduces the error (i.e. the distance between the needle tip and the lesion) by 80%.",

Since new actuator system consists of two motors (dual-motors), a movable pulley, and series spring connection for high speed/force operation characteristics, it is referred to as Dual-motor system using a Movable Pulley with a Series Elastic Actuator (DuMP-SEA) in this paper. Also, the proposed actuator system not only combines individual speed/force operation region of each motor, but also extends the combined operation region by using the energy stored in advance. Finally, we suggest the extended operation region (high speed and high force characteristics) obtained by using the DuMP-SEA through simulations and experiments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For years, the puzzling cross-coupled responses between the control axes on the hingeless helicopters have long been haunting researchers. Different from previous works that underestimated the gyroscopic moments as a minor off-axis cross-coupling and misinterpreted the precession phenomena on the rotors of the hingeless helicopters as a phase-lag which is physically meaningless, this paper proposes a new method to relate both on-axis and off-axis responses by the influential gyroscopic moments through the actuation mechanism of the hingeless helicopters. Therefore, by this new method the debatable cross-coupling due to actuation dynamics can be directly and analytically quantified. This method is based on the fact that when the angular momentum of the spinning rotor is disturbed by the incremental lift along the main blades due to the varying cyclic pitch angle controlled by the servo mechanisms, the off-axis moments are induced to counteract the changes of the angular momentum according to the principle of gyroscope, and hence these gyroscopic moments directly exhibit the on-axis responses. This new method yields a parametric framework to examine the previously unexplained cross-coupled responses on the hingeless helicopters, and it shows that in hingeless helicopters except the aerodynamics the intricate nonlinearities are also attributed to their unintuitive actuation mechanisms. Finally, simulations as well as experiments have been carried out to validate the proposed modeling method.",

        "abstract": "The artificial bacterial flagellum (ABF), a helical swimming microrobot, has the potential to be used for biomedical applications such as cellular and intracellular manipulation. The velocity and the propulsive force of the ABF can be controlled by the input frequency of the rotating magnetic field. In this paper the swimming behavior of the ABF near a solid surface is reported. Three regions have been observed for the frequency-dependent swimming behavior of the ABF, i.e. the step-out, the linear and the drift-dominated region. At low frequencies it has been found that the desired screw-type motion is replaced by a wobbling swimming movement with a frequency-dependent precession angle. Moreover, the experimental results show that the wobbling motion of the ABF enhances the undesired sidewise drift due to wall effects. Additionally, the cause of the precession motion has been investigated by a hydrodynamic model. Our results imply that the linear range of the input magnetic frequency and the output ABF velocity is not only limited by the applicable torque at high frequencies but also by the wobbling of helical swimming at low frequencies.",

In particular, we show that the displacement and the relative orientation of each follower with respect to the leader's reference frame are fixed if and only if the robots either move along circular paths or parallel straight lines. These equilibrium configurations always exist if the trajectory of the leader is a circle of sufficiently small curvature or a straight line.",

A caster-drive mechanism using normal tires has been developed to realize a holonomic omnidiredctional robot, but some problems has remain. Here we describe effective systems to control the caster-drive wheels of an omnidirectional mobile robot. We propose a Differential-Drive Steering System (DDSS) using differential gearing to improve the operation ratio of motors. The DDSS generates driving and steering torque effectively from two motors.

For this purpose, test patterns of SWCNT bundles having different diameters are grown on a silicon substrate by chemical vapor deposition. A new design of microstructured four-point-probes is proposed and fabricated allowing for direct contacting of vertically aligned bundles of SWCNTs. A nanorobotic setup is upgraded into a dual endeffector system to achieve good electrical contact between four-point-probe and SWCNT bundle and to perform electrical measurements.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the prototype design and development of a miniature MR-compatible fiber optic force sensor suitable for the detection of force during MR-guided cardiac catheterization. The working principle is based on light intensity modulation where a fiber optic cable interrogates a reflective surface at a predefined distance inside a catheter shaft. When a force is applied to the tip of the catheter, a force sensitive structure varies the distance and the orientation of the reflective surface with reference to the optical fiber. The visual feedback from the MRI scanner can be used to determine whether or not the catheter tip is normal or tangential to the tissue surface. In both cases the light is modulated accordingly and the axial or lateral force can be estimated. The sensor exhibits adequate linear response, having a good working range, very good resolution and good sensitivity in both axial and lateral force directions. In addition, the use of low-cost and MR-compatible materials for its development makes the sensor safe for use inside MRI environments.",

        "abstract": "There are several applications for which it is important to both detect and communicate changes in data models. For instance, in some mobile robotics applications (e.g. surveillance) a robot needs to detect significant changes in the environment (e.g. a layout change) which it may achieve by comparing current data provided by its sensors with previously acquired data (e.g. map) of the environment. This often constitutes an extremely challenging task due to the large amounts of data that must be compared in real-time. This paper proposes a framework to detect, and represent changes through a compact model. The main steps of the procedure are: multi-scale sampling to reduce the computation burden; change detection based on Gaussian mixture models; fitting superquadrics to detected changes; and refinement and optimization using the split and merge paradigm. Experimental results in various real and simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's feasibility and robustness with large datasets.",

        "abstract": "One of the ultimate challenges in robotics is to manipulate an arbitrary object without knowing its exact shape beforehand. The shape is rather acquired on the spot via using a laser range scanner, structure from multiple views; therefore, maybe only partially observed and corrupted by a certain degree of noise. We propose an algorithm to identify available failsafe strategies capable of preventing an object from escaping from the fingers, i.e. caging, even if its shape is partially and/or inaccurately observed. This algorithm extends the previously proposed one that characterizes all caging sets via a maximal dispersion control but, instead of taking a single polytope P exactly representing the object as input, it takes two polytopes: P+ and P- containing P and contained in P, respectively. The algorithm characterizes all possible formations of fingers that guarantee to cage any polytope P such that P- \u2286 P \u2286 P+ as long as the dispersion (i.e. looseness) of the fingers' formation is kept under a critical value called the maximal dispersion. This allows us to gracefully handle uncertainty of acquired shapes and quickly identify robust solutions in case of simplified shapes.",

        "abstract": "Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras deliver 3D images at 25 fps, offering great potential for developing fast object modeling algorithms. Surprisingly, this potential has not been extensively exploited up to now. A reason for this is that, since the acquired depth images are noisy, most of the available registration algorithms are hardly applicable. A further difficulty is that the transformations between views are in general not accurately known, a circumstance that multi-view object modeling algorithms do not handle properly under noisy conditions. In this work, we take into account both uncertainty sources (in images and camera poses) to generate spatially consistent 3D object models fusing multiple views with a probabilistic approach. We propose a method to compute the covariance of the registration process, and apply an iterative state estimation method to build object models under noisy conditions.",

The same applies for measuring the position of a moving object based on images captured at one single time instant. However, if the cameras are not synchronized in time, or if a moving object is not visible in all images, one can not rely on using matching pictures for making accurate position estimates of dynamical objects. This paper presents a strategy to track an object with known dynamical model, using a series of images where no pair has to be captured simultaneously. It even allows tracking of a point object in 3D space using a single static camera.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) wireless magnetic control of a fully untethered microrobot with a magnetic steering system we call OctoMag. Although only occupying a single hemisphere, this system is capable of isotropically applying forces on the order of 1\u201340 \u00b5N with unrestricted control of the 2 orienting DOF. These capabilities are enabled through the use of soft-magnetic-cores which provide an increase of approximately 20\u00d7 that of air cores in magnetic-field strength, but comes at the cost of more complicated interactions between coils. We propose a modeling mechanism that assumes the field contributions of the individual currents superimpose linearly when using cores with large linear regions and negligible hysteresis. When designing the system, the locations and quantity of electromagnets were optimized with regards to the force generation in the worst-case direction predicted by the model. The resultant system is capable of both open and closed-loop operation over a workspace of 4 cm3. OctoMag was primarily designed for the control of intraocular microrobots for delicate retinal procedures, but also has potential uses in other medical applications or micromanipulation under an optical microscope.",

The robot, called Omegabot, is named after the omega (\u03a9) shape of the crawling motion of the inchworm. This type of inchworm can travel approximately its body length per stroke along rough surfaces, leaf edges, and boughs of trees. The robot is built with smart composite microstructures (SCM), a fabrication method that uses laser micromachining to cut composites and assemble them into micro structures. We suggest a special pattern design for SCM to generate a two-dimensional turning motion, crawling motion, and a proleg design for climbing a tree. The robot is actuated with a shape memory alloy coil actuator activated by a PWM (pulse-width modulation) signal control electric current. As a result, Omegabot can crawl, turn, and grip a tree bough. This robot can be used for search and rescue or gathering useful information in an area where only small-scale robots can penetrate.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for visual homing to be used on a robot moving on the ground plane. A relevant issue in vision-based navigation is the field-of-view constraints of conventional cameras. We overcome this problem by means of omnidirectional vision and we propose a vision-based homing control scheme that relies on the 1D trifocal tensor. The technique employs a reference set of images of the environment previously acquired at different locations and the images taken by the robot during its motion. In order to take advantage of the qualities of omnidirectional vision, we define a purely angle-based approach, without requiring any distance information. This approach, taking the planar motion constraint into account, motivates the use of the 1D trifocal tensor. In particular, the additional geometric constraints enforced by the tensor improve the robustness of the method in the presence of mismatches. The interest of our proposal is that the designed control scheme computes the robot velocities only from angular information, being this very precise information; in addition, we present a procedure that computes the angular relations between all the views even if they are not directly related by feature matches. The feasibility of the proposed approach is supported by the stability analysis and the results from simulations and experiments with real images.",

Our method allows the agents to agree on the relative location of the network centroid respect to themselves, on a common reference frame and therefore on a common heading. Using this information a global positioning system for the agents using only local measurements can be achieved. In the proposed scenario, an agent is able to sense the distance between itself and its neighbors and the direction in which it sees its neighbors with respect to its local reference frame. Furthermore only point-to-point asynchronous communications between neighboring agents are allowed thus achieving robustness against random communication failures. The proposed algorithms can be thought as general tools to locally retrieve global information usually not available to the agents.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sequential monocular SLAM systems perform drift free tracking of the pose of a camera relative to a jointly estimated map of landmarks. To allow real-time operation in moderately sized environments, the map is kept quite spare with usually only tens of landmarks visible in each frame. In contrast, visual odometry techniques track hundreds of visual features per frame. This leads to a very accurate estimate of the relative camera motion, but without a persistent map, the estimate tends to drift over time. We demonstrate a new monocular SLAM system which combines the benefits of these two techniques. In addition to maintaining a sparse map of landmarks in the world, our system finds as many inter-frame point matches as possible. These point matches provide additional constraints on the inter-frame motion of the camera leading to a more accurate pose estimate, and, since they are not maintained as full map landmarks, they do not cause a large increase in the computational cost. Our results in both a simulated environment and in real video demonstrate the improvement in estimation accuracy gained by the inclusion of visual odometry style observations. The constraints available from pairwise point matches are most naturally cast in the context of a camera-centric rather than world-centric frame. To that end we recast the usual world-centric EKF implementation of visual SLAM in a robo-centric frame. We show that this robo-centric visual SLAM, as expected, leads to the estimated uncertainty more closely matching the ideal uncertainty; i.e., that robo-centric visual SLAM yields a more consistent estimate than the traditional world-centric EKF algorithm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This work addresses the task of designing the optimal survey route that an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) should take in mine countermeasures (MCM) operations. It is assumed that the AUV is equipped with a side-looking sonar that is capable of generating high-resolution imagery of the underwater environment. The objective of the path-planning task is framed in terms of maximizing the success of detecting underwater mines in such imagery. Several commonly made - but inaccurate - assumptions about the problem are raised and refuted; it is demonstrated that mine detection performance depends on both range and seabed type. The issue of how to update detection probabilities when multiple views are obtained is also addressed. These various considerations are exploited in conjunction with synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) data to predict detection performance and efficiently design AUV routes that outperform standard ladder surveys. The proposed algorithm can be used to assess and quantify detection performance achieved in past, as well as future, missions. Because the entire route of the AUV can still be designed before deployment, no additional onboard processing or adaptive capabilities are required of the AUV. Therefore, the proposed approach can be immediately applied to systems conducting MCM operations at sea. The method is demonstrated on real SAS imagery collected by an AUV in the Baltic Sea.",

It establishes a formal proof that this problem is NP-complete, even if the configurations are acyclic. This result gives a compelling reason that a polynomial algorithm for optimal reconfiguration plan is unlikely to exist. To facilitate future evaluation of reconfiguration algorithms, the paper also provides the lower and the upper bounds for the minimum number of reconfiguration steps for any given reconfiguration problem.",

The presented method is an extension to the ideas suggested by Bicchi et al. on input lattices and is applicable to systems which can be brought into (2,n) chained form, such as kinematic models of unicycles, bicycles, differential-drive robots and car-like vehicles (pulling several trailers). We further show that a transformation from chained form to path coordinates allows the resulting lattice to be bent along any C1 continuous path. We exploit this fact by shaping it along the skeleton of arbitrary structured environments, such as the center of road lanes and corridors. In our experiments in both structured (i.e. on-road) and unstructured (i.e. parking lot) scenarios, we successfully demonstrate for the first time the applicability of lattice-based planning approaches to search queries in arbitrary environments.",

        "abstract": "Generally, the cables of a parallel cable-driven robot are considered to be massless and inextensible. These two characteristics cannot be neglected anymore for large dimension mechanisms in order to obtain good positioning accuracy. A well-known model which describes the profile of a cable under the action of its own weight allows us to take mass and elasticity into account. When designing a robot, and choosing actuator and cable characteristics, a calculation of maximal tension has to be done. However, because cable mass has a significant effect on cable tensions, a model including cable mass has to be included in the design step. This paper proposes two methods to determine the appropriate cable and hence the maximal tensions in the cables. Applied to a large dimension robot, taking cable mass into account is proved to be necessary in comparison with an equivalent method based on the massless cable modeling. In this paper, only moving platform static equilibria are considered (slow enough motions).",

We formulate this as a weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimation problem, and determine the exact global optimum by directly solving the multivariate polynomial system resulting from the first-order optimality conditions. Given the poor scalability of the original WLS problem, we propose an alternative formulation of the WLS problem in terms of squared distance measurements (squared distances WLS or SD-WLS). Using a hybrid algebraic-numeric technique, we are able to solve the corresponding first-order optimality conditions of the SD-WLS in 125 ms in Matlab. Both methods solve the minimal (3 distance measurements) as well as the overdetermined problem (more than 3 measurements) in a unified fashion. Simulation and experimental results show that the SD-WLS achieves performance virtually indistinguishable from the maximum likelihood estimator, and significantly outperforms current algebraic methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic manipulators on non-inertial platforms, such as ships, have to endure large inertial forces due to the non-inertial motion of the platform. When the non-inertial platform's motion is known, motion planning and control algorithms can eliminate these perturbations-in fact, in some situations the motion planning algorithms can even leverage the inertial forces to more cheaply move to a target point. However, for many non-inertial platforms, the motion is unknown. In this paper we investigate how prediction errors and the choice of the prediction horizon affect the motion planning and control of robots mounted on a non-inertial base with a particular focus on seaborne platforms. We study the following three aspects: (i) We study prediction of ship motion and how prediction errors affect the motion planning and control of the manipulator. (ii) We evaluate the relationship between prediction accuracy and control. In particular, we study what prediction horizon length is useful for motion planning and control. We also consider how uncertainties in the ship motion predictions map to uncertainties in the future state of the robot and how to include the variance in the cost function to increase the optimal horizon length. (iii) Finally, we study a receding horizon approach, which re-solves the optimal control problem on-line over a horizon as determined to be meaningful from (ii). Several simulations are presented and, to our knowledge, for the first time experiments of ship-manipulator systems based on real ship motion data are presented.",

In this paper, we present two approaches to address these limitations. First, we show that if identical robots are allowed to communicate for all times, then the computation is cheaper. Second, we develop an algorithm to test if a given global specification can be implemented by the robots without the move-only-when-communicate constraint.",

This paper reports a small dual cohort pilot study with traumatic spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects designed to investigate the utility of the UCF-MANUS for these subjects. Pick-and-place ADL tasks were de\u00f7ned and users trained and tested with the system for three weeks during which they controlled the robot either through a manual or an autonomous (supervised) mode of operation. Baseline characteristics (pre-study), quantitative performance metrics (during study) and psychometrics (post-study) were obtained and statistically analyzed to test a set of hypotheses related to performance and satisfaction with the two control modes. It was seen that manual interaction showed more variability and inef\u00f7ciency in performance metrics as compared to autonomous operation. Suprisingly the latter mode, however, did not lead to better measures for user satisfaction. A discussion is provided to explain the results. Based on qualitative feedback and quantitative results, possible directions for system design are presented in order to concurrently achieve better performance and satisfaction outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This paper formulates and investigates a novel problem called Mutual Localization with Anonymous Position Measures. This is an extension of Mutual Localization with Position Measures, with the additional assumption that the identities of the measured robots are not known. A necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the solution is presented, which requires O(n2= log n) to be verified and is based on the notion of rotational symmetry in R2. We also derive the relationship between the number of robots and the number of possible solutions, and classify the solutions in a number of equivalence classes which is linear in n. A control law is finally proposed that effectively breaks symmetric formations so as to guarantee unique solvability of the problem is also proposed; its performance is illustrated through simulations.",

        "abstract": "The problem of maximizing the transparency of specification automata for discrete event systems (DES's) is investigated. In a transparent specification automaton, events that are irrelevant to the specification but can occur in the system are `hidden' in self-loops. Different automata of the same specification on a DES can be associated with different sets of such irrelevant events; and any such automaton is said to be the most transparent if it has an irrelevant event set of maximal cardinality. The transparency maximization problem is theoretically formulated and a provably correct solution algorithm is obtained. The most transparent specification automaton essentially shows the precedence ordering among events from a minimal cardinality set that is relevant to the intended requirement, and should help towards resolving the long-standing problem in specification, namely: how do we know that a specification in automata does indeed capture the intended control requirement?",

The size range of the produced droplet was three times as large as the previous system by using novel hydraulic design of the chip, and also the dispersing the fluid was successfully prevented from leakage when it is chopped by using MMT.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the problem of extrinsic calibration of multiple LIDARs on a mobile vehicle platform. To achieve fully automated and on-line calibration, the original non-linear calibration model is reformulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP). This provides an advantage over more standard linearized approaches in that a priori information such as a default LIDAR calibration, calibration tolerances, etc., can be readily modeled. Furthermore, in contrast to general non-linear methods, the SOCP relaxation is convex, returns a global minimum, and can be solved very quickly using modern interior point methods (IPM). This enables the calibration to be estimated on-line for multiple LIDARs simultaneously. Experimental results are provided where the approach is used to successfully calibrate a pair of Sick LMS291-S14 LIDARs mounted on a mobile vehicle platform. These showed the SOCP formulation yielded a more accurate reconstruction and was 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the traditional non-linear least-squares approach.",

        "abstract": "The control system for a mobile robot typically assumes fixed kinematics according to the drive's geometry and functionality. Faults in the system, for example a blocked steering actuator, will then lead to an undesired behaviour, unless one takes care of specific single and/or multiple faults explicitly. We present a novel model-programmed procedure for on-line kinematics reasoning that allows a robot to deduce the (inverse)-kinematics of the drive and also its kinematic abilities for the specific modes of operation and some falt modes during operation. As a consequence, we can reconfigure a robot drive to compensate for some faults and also inform a higher level control system about changed mobility capabilities of a robot. Being fault tolerant is, however, only one advantage of our approach that derives the kinematics control strategy from a geometric and functional model of the drive. We can easily adapt the controller for various robot drives, handle drives that change their geometry and functionality during run-time and also provide the basis for a flexible control scheme for self-configuring multi-robot systems.",

We formulate this motor control problem in the framework of Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) by introducing a specific cost function that accounts for the physical constraints of the controlled plant. Using an approximative computational optimal control method we can optimally control a high-dimensional anthropomorphic robot without having to specify an explicit inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics or feedback control law. We highlight the benefits of this biologically plausible motor control strategy over traditional (open loop) optimal controllers: The presented approach proves to be significantly more energy efficient and compliant, while being accurate with respect to the task at hand. These properties are crucial for the control of mobile anthropomorphic robots, that are designed to interact safely in a human environment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first OFC implementation on a high-dimensional (redundant) manipulator.",

        "abstract": "A new approach for solving an optimal control problem of ball pitching with an underactuated human-like robot arm is proposed. The system dynamics is simplified to a planar two-link robot with actuation only at the shoulder joint and a passive spring at the elbow joint representing the stiffness of the arm. The objective is to accelerate the ball from an initial configuration at rest in such a way that the projection of its velocity along a certain elevation angle is maximal at a predefined release line. The suggested procedure makes use of a parameterization of the robot motion in terms of geometric relations among the generalized coordinates. We systematically formulate a necessary condition for an optimal motion resulting in a nonlinear differential equation that describes a synchronization of the joint angles. A suitable solution is found by numerically searching over a finite number of free initial conditions.",

Of particular interest is providing a solution that guarantees the complete coverage of the free space by traversing an optimal path, in terms of the distance travelled. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm based on the Boustrophedon cellular decomposition. The presented algorithm encodes the areas (cells) to be covered as edges of the Reeb graph. The optimal solution to the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is used to calculate an Euler tour, which guarantees complete coverage of the available free space while minimizing the path of the robot. In addition, we extend the classical solution of the CPP to account for the entry point of the robot for cell coverage by changing the weights of the Reeb graph edges. Proof of correctness is provided together with experimental results in different environments.",

        "abstract": "For robotic manipulation tasks in uncertain environments, good force control can provide significant benefits. The design of force or torque controlled actuators typically revolves around developing the best possible software control strategy. However, the passive dynamics of the mechanical system, including inertia, stiffness, damping and torque limits, often impose performance limitations that cannot be overcome with software control. Discussions about the passive dynamics are often imprecise, lacking comprehensive details about the physical limitations. In this paper, we develop relationships between an actuator's passive dynamics and the resulting performance, for the purpose of better understanding how to tune the passive dynamics for a force control task. We present two distinct scenarios for the actuator system and calculate the required input to produce a desired output. These exact solutions provide a basis for understanding how the parameters of the mechanical system affect the overall system's bandwidth limit. Our model does not include active control; we computed the optimal input to the system to produce the required torque at the load with zero error. This is important so that our results only reflect the physical system's performance.",

This approach is based on the concept of the maximal inscribed parallelepiped and uses technology-oriented constraints that are motivated by particular applications. This methodology is applied on two translational parallel robots with three degrees-of-freedom (DOF): the Y-STAR and the UraneSX. An analysis of the size of their workspace as a function of the design constraints is made. It is shown that, for identical workspaces with similar properties, the size of the legs of the UraneSX are greater than for the Y-STAR, thus leading to larger deformations. However, the footprint surface needed in order to install the Y-STAR is about two times bigger than for the UraneSX. Therefore, it may be interested to use the UraneSX in order to save some place on ground in manufacturing centres.",

They are based on two main approaches, a discrete optimization and a classical continuous optimization. Exemplarily, a planar, kinematically redundant 3RRR-based mechanism is introduced. The position of its redundant actuator, i.e. the robot geometry, is optimized according to an optimization criterion that is denoted as the gain of the maximal homogenized pose error. Several analysis examples demonstrate the effectiveness of kinematic redundancy with respect to the introduced optimization procedures. It is shown that in comparison to discrete approaches, classical continuousbased optimization strategies do not necessarily lead to more appropriate results in terms of performance improvement.",

        "abstract": "In recent years multiple simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been proposed, which address the challenges of 3D environments in combination with six degress of freedom in the robot position. Commonly, solutions based on scan-matching algorithms are applied. In contrast to these approaches, we propose to use a particle filter transferring the concept of the 2D Rao-Blackwellized particle filter SLAM to 3D. As filter input, 3D laser range data and odometry readings are obtained while the robot is in motion. The ground plane is estimated based on previously built map parts, thereby approaching the problem that not all degrees of freedom are covered by the odometry. To gain control of the high memory requirements for the particles' 3D map representations, we introduce a memory efficient search structure and adapt a technique to efficiently organize and share maps between particles. We evaluate our approach based on experimental results obtained by",

We propose a gradient-based control approach where agents' positions locally minimize a physically motivated cost function. The contributions of this paper are threefold. We formulate of a cost function that incorporates a continuous, physical model of signal quality, SIR. We develop a non-smooth gradient-based controller that positions aerial vehicles to acheive optimized signal quality amongst all vehicles in the system. This controller is provably convergent while allowing for non-differentiability due to agents moving in or out of communication with one another. Lastly, we guarantee that given certain initial conditions or certain values of the control parameters, aerial vehicles will never disconnect the connectivity graph. We demonstrate our controller on hardware experiments using AscTec Hummingbird quadrotors and provide aggregate results over 10 trials. We also provide hardware-in-the-loop and MATALB simulation results, which demonstrate positioning of the aerial vehicles to minimize the cost function H and improve signal-quality amongst all communication links in the ground/air robot team.",

In this paper, we present a method for finding the optimal coordinate choice for this purpose, based on a Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition of the system constraints, and demonstrate the efficacy of the Stokes's theorem approach over a wide variety of gaits when using the optimized coordinate choice.",

In this paper, an outer shell type 2 DOF bending manipulator using a spring-link mechanism is presented. The mechanism was developed for a surgical robot, which can implement various surgical treatment devices inside of the manipulator. The spring-link mechanism is a simple combination of a flat spring and a rigid link with a passive joint connection. The outer shell type 2 DOF bending manipulator is composed by four spring-link mechanisms. The most unique feature of the manipulator is that these four springs are interconnected in the kinematics. Therefore, it is possible to realize a robust and backlash-free motion by taking into account the interconnections of springs such as an internal stress of the structure. In addition, by locating four spring-link mechanisms around the manipulator, it is possible to place medical devices inside of the manipulator.",

The proportional term of the control input uses a transformed error (TP) which incorporates the desired performance function; given sufficiently high proportional and damping gains, the proposed TPID controller ensures the position error's prescribed performance irrespective of constant disturbances and choice of control gains. Control parameter selection is merely confined in achieving admissible input torques. Simulation results for a three dof spatial robot confirm the theoretical analysis and illustrate the robustness of the prescribed performance regulator in case of time-variant bounded disturbances.",

Although the grid-based method has been effectively used for autonomous search due to its ability to represent search space explicitly, heavy computational load has been a bottleneck for real-time application similarly to other non-Gaussian RBE techniques. The proposed RBE, which parallelizes grid-wise computations using GPU upon the analysis of mathematical operations, removes sequential processes and accelerates RBE significantly. Numerical examples have first demonstrated the validation of the proposed RBE and investigated its performance through parametric studies. The proposed RBE was then applied to the cooperative search by autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and its real-time capability has been demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, we applied the principles of passive dynamic walking onto the three dimensional motion of a simplified quadrupedal model. We extended the simulation framework of a planar system to include a rolling degree of freedom and searched for limit cycles that represent periodic gaits. Among the eight different gaits that we identified, were three kinds of trots and paces, as well as a lateral and diagonal single foot sequence. We could show that a distinct relation exists between the lateral spacing of the legs and the relative phase of the front and the back legs, and a certain trade-off between efficiency and dynamic stability. In agreement with established bipedal models, our results showed that the lateral rolling motion is invariably unstable.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots using a 360\u00b0 field of view LIDAR ranging sensor can generate enormous 3D point clouds. To reduce the quantity of data in memory a compression can lead to unstructured environment models such as irregular meshes. This kind of structure can contain deformed cells and the path planning can be cumbersome. This paper presents a path planning method based on fluid mechanics able to deal with unstructured terrain models. The algorithm uses the finite element method to compute a velocity potential function free from local minima. Then, several streamlines are computed as a road map and the optimal path is selected among the candidate paths. The approach is implemented on the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Mars Robotics Testbed (MRT) rover and tested at the CSA Mars Emulation Terrain (MET). To confirm the feasibility of the method, the path planner has been tested on 284 LIDAR scans collected in a realistic outdoor challenging terrain.",

The proposed architecture is distributed, in that each user simulates and interacts with its own local copy of the shared virtual environment. Spring connection among the local copies and local damping are used, which, together, under a certain condition, achieve configuration synchronization among the local copies while enforcing discrete-time passivity of the total peer-to-peer architecture, thereby, rendering the architecture portable/scalable for any (passive) users/devices and ensuring its interaction stability be user/device-invariant. The issue of optimizing communication network is also addressed with some relevant experimental results.",

        "abstract": "For many tasks in populated environments, robots need to keep track of current and future motion states of people. Most approaches to people tracking make weak assumptions on human motion such as constant velocity or acceleration. But even over a short period, human behavior is more complex and influenced by factors such as the intended goal, other people, objects in the environment, and social rules. This motivates the use of more sophisticated motion models for people tracking especially since humans frequently undergo lengthy occlusion events. In this paper, we consider computational models developed in the cognitive and social science communities that describe individual and collective pedestrian dynamics for tasks such as crowd behavior analysis. In particular, we integrate a model based on a social force concept into a multi-hypothesis target tracker. We show how the refined motion predictions translate into more informed probability distributions over hypotheses and finally into a more robust tracking behavior and better occlusion handling. In experiments in indoor and outdoor environments with data from a laser range finder, the social force model leads to more accurate tracking with up to two times fewer data association errors.",

        "abstract": "In teleoperation systems, operator performance is negatively affected by time-delayed visual feedback. Predictive display (PD) compensates for delays by providing synthesized visual feedback. While most existing PD methods rely on a priori models (e.g., from laser range finding or stereo vision), recent work on monocular SLAM and SFM makes it possible to acquire PD models in single camera applications. In this work, we evaluate operator performance of PD visual feedback based on a coarse 3D model. We report the experimental results of 12 human tele-operators each performing 96 visual alignment tasks with a 300ms delay. Four operating modes are considered: delayed video (no PD), video-based PD using a stabilizing plane (homography), 3D model-based PD, and no delay (ground truth). The results indicate that vision-based PD (both plane and 3D model-based) is significantly better than delayed video. It reduced task completion time 40% and is nearly as good as the no delay condition. PD based on a sparse a 3D model was somewhat better than the simpler plane based method.",

Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient when comparing with the qualitative ray-shooting algorithm. The proposed quantitative force-closure test offers a good quality metric without computing the convex hull of the primitive contact wrenches in R6, which efficiently reduces the amount of computation.

A numerical model for the mesh structure describes how peristaltic motion induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of locomotion speed. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impacts during locomotion. This approach can enable a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources.",

Sensors in the environment reliably detect their current positions, but it is difficult to identify people using these sensors. On the other hand, signals from wearable sensors can be used to identify people correctly, but precise position estimation remains problematic. In this paper, we describe a novel method of integrating laser range finders (LRFs) in the environment and wearable inertial sensors. Time sequences of angular velocities estimated from both LRFs and wearable sensors are matched to identify people. Examples of tracking individuals in the environment that confirm the effectiveness of this method are shown.",

Multiple PZT actuator units with high gain displacement amplification mechanisms are arranged in parallel with spatial phase differences. Having an inherent kinematic singularity, the buckling mechanism provides not only an extremely high gain of displacement amplification, but also varying stiffness and nonlinear force-displacement characteristics. The phased array PZT actuator exploits this nonlinearity for gaining a large output displacement as well as for combining multiple PZT stacks in parallel without conflicting with each other. Three specific designs of arrayed buckling actuators are presented. The aggregate output force-displacement relationship is analyzed and its profile is shaped with respect to spatial phase differences and nonlinear stiffness and force characteristics of individual PZT buckling actuator units.",

This feedback source has also applications in endovascular surgery simulation for human skills and medical tools evaluation. For that purpose we consider photoelastic effect, as birefringence produced by light retardation relates with the stress inside the photoelastic materials. In this research a polariscope was designed for urethane elastomer vasculature models, the photoelastic coefficient of urethane elastomer was measured, and the camera system was calibrated to quantify and reduce error of the measurement system. An average error of 3.6% was found for the pressure range of 70-189 mmHg inside the model of urethane elastomer, this enables to calculate accurately stress in vasculature models during Human Blood Pressure Simulation (HBPS). That way we will be able to compare in a closed loop stress produced by HBPS and by the catheter motion when manipulated by a robot.",

To this end we describe the acquisition and modeling of large urban spaces from data that reflects human sensory input. Over 181GB of image and inertial data are captured using head-mounted stereo cameras. This data is processed into a relative map covering 121 km of Southern England. We point out the numerous challenges we encounter, and highlight in particular the problem of undetected ego-motion, which occurs when the robot finds itself on-or-within a moving frame of reference. In contrast to global-frame representations, we find that the continuous relative representation naturally accommodates moving-reference-frames - without having to identify them first, and without inconsistency. Within a moving-reference-frame, and without drift-less global exteroceptive sensing, motion with respect to the global-frame is effectively unobservable. This underlying truth drives us towards relative topometric solutions like relative bundle adjustment (RBA), which has no problem representing distance and metric Euclidean structure, yet does not suffer inconsistency introduced by the attempt to solve in the global-frame.",

        "abstract": "Medical procedures such as lung biopsy and brachytherapy require maneuvering through tubular structures such as the trachea and bronchi to reach clinical targets. We introduce a new method to plan configurations for active cannulas, medical devices composed of thin, pre-curved, telescoping lumens that are capable of following controlled, curved paths through open or liquid-filled cavities. Planning optimal configurations for these devices is challenging due to their complex kinematics, which involve both beam mechanics and space curves. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based planning algorithm that computes active cannula configurations through tubular structures that reach specified targets. Given the target location, the start position and orientation, and a geometric representation of the physical environment extracted from pre-procedure medical images, the planner optimizes insertion length and orientation angle of each lumen of the active cannula. The planner models active cannula kinematics using a physically-based simulation that incorporates beam mechanics and minimizes energy. The algorithm typically computes plans in less than 2 minutes on a standard PC. We apply the method in simulation to anatomy extracted from a human CT scan and demonstrate configurations for a 5-lumen active cannula that maneuver it through the bronchi to targets in the lung.",

However, this is a challenging problem because of the difficulty of imposing the motion of the target point by a finite number actuation points located at the boundary of the deformable object. In this paper, an approach towards positioning operation of an internal target point of a deformable object to the desired location by a system of three actuators is presented. First, we design an optimization technique that minimizes the total force applied to the object to determine the location of actuation points to effect the desired motion. Then a position-based PI controller is developed to control the motion of the actuators. A passivity observer and a passivity controller are developed to guarantee the stability of the whole system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Computing a motion that enables a mobile manipulator to open a door is challenging because it requires tight coordination between the motions of the arm and the base. Hard-coding the motion, on the other hand, is infeasible since doors vary widely in their sizes and types, some doors are opened by pulling and others by pushing, and indoor spaces often contain obstacles that limit the freedom of the mobile manipulator and the degree to which the doors open up. In this paper, we show how to overcome the high-dimensionality of the planning problem by identifying a graph-based representation that is small enough for efficient planning yet rich enough to contain feasible motions that open doors. The use of graph search-based motion planning enables us to handle consistently the wide variance of conditions under which doors need to be open. We demonstrate our approach on the PR2 robot - a mobile manipulator with an omnidirectional base and a 7 degree of freedom arm. The robot was successful in opening a variety of doors both by pulling and pushing.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about planning paths from overhead imagery, the novelty of which is taking explicit account of uncertainty in terrain classification and spatial variation in terrain cost. The image is first classified using a multi-class Gaussian Process Classifier which provides probabilities of class membership at each location in the image. The probability of class membership at a particular grid location is then combined with a terrain cost evaluated at that location using a spatial Gaussian process. The resulting cost function is, in turn, passed to a planner. This allows both the uncertainty in terrain classification and spatial variations in terrain costs to be incorporated into the planned path. Because the cost of traversing a grid cell is now a probability density rather than a single scalar value, we can produce not only the most-likely shortest path between points on the map, but also sample from the cost map to produce a distribution of paths between the points. Results are shown in the form of planned paths over aerial maps, these paths are shown to vary in response to local variations in terrain cost.",

        "abstract": "Studies of human manipulation strategies suggest that pre-grasp object manipulation, such as rotation or sliding of the object to be grasped, can improve task performance by increasing both the task success rate and the quality of load-supporting postures. In previous demonstrations, pre-grasp object rotation by a robot manipulator was limited to manually-programmed actions. We present a method for automating the planning of pre-grasp rotation for object transport tasks. Our technique optimizes the grasp acquisition point by selecting a target object pose that can be grasped by high-payload manipulator configurations. Careful selection of the transition states leads to successful transport plans for tasks that are otherwise infeasible. In addition, optimization of the grasp acquisition posture also indirectly improves the transport plan quality, as measured by the safety margin of the manipulator payload limits.",

        "abstract": "A central problem of applications dealing with virtual environments is planning a collision-free path for a character. Since environments and their characters are growing more realistic, a character's path needs to be visually convincing, meaning that the path is smooth, short, has some clearance to the obstacles in the environment, and avoids other characters. Up to now, it has proved difficult to meet these criteria simultaneously and in real-time. We introduce a new data structure, i.e. the Explicit Corridor Map, which allows creating the shortest path, the path that has the largest amount of clearance, or any path in between. Besides being efficient, the corresponding algorithms are surprisingly simple. By integrating the data structure and algorithms into the Indicative Route Method, we show that visually convincing short paths can be obtained in real-time.",

These similarities can be exploited to enable inter-operability between heterogeneous systems. We have developed a network data specification, the Interoperable Telerobotics Protocol, that can be used for Internet based control of a wide range of teleoperators. In this work we test interoperable telerobotics on the global Internet, focusing on the telesurgery application domain. Fourteen globally dispersed telerobotic master and slave systems were connected in thirty trials in one twenty four hour period. Users performed common manipulation tasks to demonstrate effective master-slave operation. With twenty eight (93%) successful, unique connections the results show a high potential for standardizing telerobotic operation. Furthermore, new paradigms for telesurgical operation and training are presented, including a networked surgery trainer and upper-limb exoskeleton control of micro-manipulators.",

The robot consists of an end-effector with an actuated arm suspended on a cable wound on a reel. The robot can achieve full planar point-to-point motion (position and orientation) with zero-velocity landing by swinging itself as children do on playground swings. The equations of motion of the underactuated cable-driven robot are first developed. Then, the actuated joint trajectory design for swing-up as well as an optimization technique used to control the behaviour of the passive joint are proposed. Finally, a prototype of the robot and its real-time controller are presented with experimental results for point-to-point trajectories. The proposed mechanism constitutes a low-cost solution for applications requiring large workspaces by combining the advantages of cable-driven systems and underactuation and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work presenting the real-time control of such a mechanism.",

A brief literature survey reveals the need for minimal component designs and the benefits of impedance control schemes for interaction tasks such as grasping. The novel robotic finger concept supports these insights by combining three key features: minimal actuation, variable mechanical compliance and full manipulability. This combination of features allows for a minimal component design, while reducing control complexity and still providing required dexterity and grasping capabilities. The conceptual properties (such as variable compliance) are studied in a port-Hamiltonian framework. The framework proved to be suitable in analyzing and understanding the finger properties, which will be used for future controller design.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel solution to object detection, localization and pose estimation with applications in robot vision. The proposed method is especially applicable when the objects of interest may not be richly textured and are immersed in heavy clutter. We show that a multi-flash camera (MFC) provides accurate separation of depth edges and texture edges in such scenes. Then, we reformulate the problem, as one of finding matches between the depth edges obtained in one or more MFC images to the rendered depth edges that are computed offline using 3D CAD model of the objects. In order to facilitate accurate matching of these binary depth edge maps, we introduce a novel cost function that respects both the position and the local orientation of each edge pixel. This cost function is significantly superior to traditional Chamfer cost and leads to accurate matching even in heavily cluttered scenes where traditional methods are unreliable. We present a sub-linear time algorithm to compute the cost function using techniques from 3D distance transforms and integral images. Finally, we also propose a multi-view based pose-refinement algorithm to improve the estimated pose. We implemented the algorithm on an industrial robot arm and obtained location and angular estimation accuracy of the order of 1 mm and 2\u00b0 respectively for a variety of parts with minimal texture.",

        "abstract": "High motion performance, stiffness, and accuracy are crucial for industrial robot applications, but these requirements are in practice contradictory. Using a novel type of robot, the so called Gantry Tau, new combinations of stiffness and accuracy are in principle possible, except for the backlash in the drive-trains of each joint. Existing techniques for backlash reduction are either mechanically complex or limit the mechanical bandwidth. This paper presents an approach based on dual motors connected in parallel to the load, such that the entire robot structure can be made practically backlash free by means of software and feedback control. Different control strategies are presented and evaluated in experiments ranging from a lab servo process via a table-sized robot to a large industrial implementation with several meters of working range. Special emphasis was on a dual motor test rig with a linear high-resolution scale (not yet used for feedback) where the combined motor torque was fully utilized for high acceleration, while reducing backlash by over 96%.",

The new control strategy considers foreseeable dangerous events by predicting human motion using artificial neural networks, based on the previous pattern of the motion. This approach enables a robot to foresee an upcoming danger in order to take preventive actions before the danger is immanent. Experimental results for a CRS-F3 robot manipulator are presented in order to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of this method.",

        "abstract": "Allowing robots to communicate naturally with humans is an important goal for social robotics. Most approaches have focused on building high-level probabilistic cognitive models. However, research in cognitive science shows that people often build common ground for communication with each other by seeking and providing evidence of understanding through behaviors like mimicry. Predictive State Representations (PSRs) allow one to build explicit, low-level models of the expected outcomes of actions, and are therefore well-suited for tasks that require providing such evidence of understanding. Using human-robot shadow puppetry as a prototype interaction study, we show that PSRs can be used successfully to both model human interactions, and to allow a robot to learn on-line how to engage a human in an interesting interaction.",

        "abstract": "This paper outlines a framework for the preoperative planning of robotics-assisted minimally invasive cardiac surgery with application to coronary artery bypass grafting. The intent of the proposed framework is to improve surgical outcomes by considering the intraoperative requirements of the robotic manipulators and the anatomical geometry of the patient's chest. This includes target reachability, instrument dexterity for critical surgical tasks and collision avoidance. Given the patient's preoperative chest computed tomography images, the planning framework aims to determine the optimal location of the access ports on the ribcage, along with the optimal pose of the robotic arms relative to the patient's anatomy. The proposed multi-objective optimality criteria consist of a measure of clearance as well as a new collective kinematic measure. The minimum distances among the robot arms provides a measure for the likelihood of collisions. The proposed kinematic measure is composed of two modified manipulability indices that are dimensionally homogeneous and, in contrast to previously-used measures, are more likely to yield isotropic force and torque distributions when optimized for surgical interventions. The results of a case study illustrate the compatibility of the framework with general guidelines used by experienced surgeons for port selection. Furthermore, the framework surpasses those guidelines by ensuring the feasibility of the solutions in the sense of collision avoidance and surgical target reachability.",

        "abstract": "People perform daily activities in many different ways. When setting a table, they might use a tray, stack plates, stack cups on plates, leave the doors of a cupboard open when taking several items out of it. Similarly flexible behavior is desired when mobile robots perform household tasks. Moreover, they should perform actions in a way that they are accepted by the people, for example by showing human-like behavior. In this paper we propose to extend a transformational planning system with models characterizing the behavior produced by the different plans in the plan library. These models are used by the robot to select a plan that resembles human behavior. In addition to acting more human-like, this helps the robot choose good plans for a task by imitating humans instead of performing exhaustive search. We show the feasibility of this approach using a household robot application as an example and present empirical results on the classification accuracy in this domain.",

        "abstract": "For path planning algorithms of robots it is important that the robot does not reach a state of inevitable collision. In crowded environments with many humans or robots, the set of possible inevitable collision states (ICS) is often unacceptably high, such that the robot has to stop and wait in too many situations. For this reason, the concept of ICS is extended to probabilistic collision states (PCS), which estimates the collision probability for a given state. This allows to efficiently run planning algorithms through crowded environments when accepting a certain collision probability. A further novelty is that the obstacles possibly react to the robot in order to mitigate the risk of a collision. The results show a significant difference in interaction behavior. Thus, this approach is especially suited for active and non-deterministic moving obstacles in the robot workspace.",

        "abstract": "Generating accurate environment representations can significantly improve the autonomy of mobile robots. In this article we present a novel probabilistic technique for solving the full SLAM problem by jointly solving the data registration problem and the accurate reconstruction of the underlying geometry. The key idea of this paper is to incorporate spatial correlation models as prior knowledge on the map we seek to construct. We formulate the mapping problem as a maximum a-posteriori estimation comprising common probabilistic motion and sensor models as well as two spatial correlation models to guide the optimization. Instead of discarding data at an early stage, our algorithm makes use of all data available in the optimization process. When applied to SLAM, our method generates maps that closely resemble the real environment. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art algorithms, using both real and synthetic data sets.",

The goal of the algorithm is to determine what altitude\u2014and what horizontal actuation, if any is available on the vehicle\u2014to use to reach a goal location in the fastest expected time. The winds can vary greatly at different altitudes and are strong relative to any feasible horizontal actuation, so the incorporation of the winds is critical for guidance plans. This paper focuses on how to integrate the uncertainty of the wind field into the wind model and how to reach a goal location through the uncertain wind field, using a Markov decision process (MDP). The resulting probabilistic solutions enable more robust guidance plans and more thorough analysis of potential paths than existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Through their ability to rapidly acquire aerial imagery, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to aid target search tasks. Many of the core algorithms which are used to plan search tasks use occupancy grid-based representations and are often based on two main assumptions. Firstly, the altitude of the UAV is constant. Secondly, the onboard sensors can measure the entire state of an entire grid cell. Although these assumptions are sufficient for fixed-wing, high speed UAVs, we do not believe that they are appropriate for small, lightweight, low speed and agile UAVs such as quadrotors. These platforms have the ability to change altitude and their low speed means that multiple measurements may easily overlap multiple cells for substantial periods of time. In this paper we extend a framework for probabilistic search based on decision making to incorporate multiple observations of grid cells and changes in UAV altitude. We account for observation areas that completely and partially cover multiple grid cells. We show the resultant impact on a number of simulation examples.",

There are disparate goals to this control: the cameras are not only to react to objects moving about, arbitrating conflicting interests of target resolution and trajectory accuracy, they are also to anticipate the appearance of new targets. We base our control function on maximisation of expected mutual information gain, which to our knowledge is novel to the field of computer vision in the context of multiple pan-tilt-zoom camera control. This information theoretic measure yields a utility for each goal and parameter setting, making the use of physical or computational resources comparable. Weighting this utility allows to prioritise certain objectives or targets in the control. The resulting behaviours in typical situations for multi-camera systems, such as camera hand-off, acquisition of close-ups and scene exploration, are emergent but intuitive. We quantitatively show that without the need for hand crafted rules they address the given objectives.",

        "abstract": "This paper is motivated by the real world problem of search and rescue by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We consider the problem of tracking a static target from a bird's-eye view camera mounted to the underside of a quadrotor UAV. We begin by proposing a target detection algorithm, which we then execute on a collection of video frames acquired from four different experiments. We show how the efficacy of the target detection algorithm changes as a function of altitude. We summarise this efficacy into a table which we denote the observation model. We then run the target detection algorithm on a sequence of video frames and use parameters from the observation model to update a recursive Bayesian estimator. The estimator keeps track of the probability that a target is currently in view of the camera, which we refer to more simply as target presence. Between each target detection event the UAV changes position and so the sensing region changes. Under certain assumptions regarding the movement of the UAV, the proportion of new information may be approximated to a value, which we then use to weight the prior in each iteration of the estimator. Through a series of experiments we show how the value of the prior for unseen regions, the altitude of the UAV and the camera sampling rate affect the accuracy of the estimator. Our results indicate that there is no single optimal sampling rate for all tested scenarios. We also show how the prior may be used as a mechanism for tuning the estimator according to whether a high false positive or high false negative probability is preferable.",

Pose constraints can induce lower-dimensional constraint manifolds in the configuration space of the robot, making rejection sampling techniques infeasible. RRT-based algorithms can overcome this problem by using the sample-project method: sampling coupled with a projection operator to move configuration space samples onto the constraint manifold. Until now it was not known whether the sample-project method produces adequate coverage of the constraint manifold to guarantee probabilistic completeness. The proof presented in this paper guarantees probabilistic completeness for a class of RRT-based algorithms given an appropriate projection operator. This proof is valid for constraint manifolds of any fixed dimensionality.",

        "abstract": "Passive stereo vision is widely used as a range sensing technology in robots, but suffers from dropouts: areas of low texture where stereo matching fails. By supplementing a stereo system with a strong texture projector, dropouts can be eliminated or reduced. This paper develops a practical stereo projector system, first by finding good patterns to project in the ideal case, then by analyzing the effects of system blur and phase noise on these patterns, and finally by designing a compact projector that is capable of good performance out to 3m in indoor scenes. The system has been implemented and has excellent depth precision and resolution, especially in the range out to 1.5m.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on psychophysical evaluation of the control scheme developed to optimize the kinesthetic perception during the scaled teleoperation. The control problem is formulated as a multi-objective constrained optimization. The objective function is a metric which quantifies the detection and discrimination capacity of the human operator. The constraints are position tracking accuracy and absolute stability of the scaled teleoperation. Two popular control architectures, i.e., the position-position and the force-position control architectures are considered in this paper. The method of limits is employed in this paper to conduct the psychophysical experiments and evaluation. Results show that the developed control scheme is more effective in increasing the detection and discrimination capacity of human subjects as compared to the traditional transparency-optimized control laws.",

        "abstract": "A working six-legged robot which can switch three modes for locomotion and manipulation was already developed. In its vertical four-leg two-arm mode, lower four legs are used for locomotion and upper two legs for manipulation with its body vertical to the ground. In order to expend capabilities of this robot, a method of pushing a large object in this mode is proposed. The robot holds the object using its upper two legs and body. The robot leans against the object and applies pushing force. Then it walks by moving the outer and inner pairs of the lower four legs alternately. Because of this symmetric walking, the robot can push the object with keeping lateral balance. It can apply large force owing to the effect of its body weight. Because holding the object firmly, the robot can push the object stably without falling down. For comparison, two methods are also analyzed. First the robot simply walks by tripod gait with its body touching the object. Second the robot pushes the object using its upper two legs and walks using its lower four legs in vertical four-leg two-arm mode. Then the merits of the proposed method are clarified. Three methods are experimentally ascertained using the developed robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "There are two different motions of a trailer system that consists of a car and n passive off-hooked trailers. When a car \u201cpulls\u201d n passive trailers, a trailer system moves forward. A trailer system moves backward when a car \u201cpushes\u201d n passive trailers. Backing up a trailer system is difficult because it is an open loop unstable problem. In this paper, we investigate the backward motion control problem of a car with n passive trailers. We have shown that n passive trailers can be successfully controlled by an omni-directional mobile robot in our prior works. Unlike an omni-directional robot, a car-like mobile robot has nonholonomic constraints and limitations of the steering angle. For these reasons, the backward motion control problem of a car-like mobile robot with n passive trailers is not trivial. In spite of difficulties, backing up a trailer system is useful for parking control. In this study, we proposed a mechanical alteration which is connecting n passive trailers to the front bumper of a car to improve the backward motion control performance. By adopting the new design, a car pushes n passive trailers by its forward motion. A practical trailer-pushing control algorithm was also proposed. Stability analysis of the controller under kinematic modeling error was presented. Theoretical verification and experimental results proved that the control strategy of pushing n passive trailers by forward motion of a car can be successfully implemented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a Markov chain model to evaluate the quality performance in flexible manufacturing systems with batch productions. In such a model, the product quality is a function of the transition probabilities characterizing the changes among good and defective states (where good quality or defective parts are produced during a cycle, respectively). A transition that has the largest impact on quality, i.e., whose improvement will lead to the largest improvement in quality, is defined as the quality bottleneck transition (BN-t). Analytical expressions of sensitivity of quality with respect to transition probabilities are derived. Indicators to identify bottleneck transitions based on the data collected on the factory floor are developed. Numerical experiments show that such indicators have high accuracy in identifying the correct bottlenecks and can be used as an effective tool for quality improvement effort. Finally, a case study at an automotive paint shop to improve quality through quality bottleneck transition identification is introduced.",

A QKM realizes a motion task, typically characterized by a subgroup G of rigid transformation group SE(3), through coordinated motion of two mechanisms called modules. One is referred to as a subgroup module H and the other a complementary or quotient module G/H of H in G. Since QKM can retain both large workspace/rotation range of SKMs and speed/accuracy of PKMs by appropriate choice of modules, it is often implemented in high end machine design for semiconductor die/wire-bonding and 5-axis machining, etc. To promote QKM technology beyond occasional studies and applications, we use differential geometric techniques to develop a rigorous and precise treatment of QKMs, including: (i) modeling and analysis of QKMs; (ii) classification and synthesis of QKMs; (iii) PKM realization of quotient modules.",

While mapping and exploration solutions are now well-established for ground vehicles, air vehicles face unique challenges which have hindered the development of similar capabilities. Although there has been recent progress toward sensing, control, and navigation techniques for GPS-denied flight, there have been few demonstrations of stable, goal-directed flight in real-world environments. Our system leverages a multi-level sensing and control hierarchy that matches the computational complexity of the component algorithms with the real-time needs of a MAV to achieve autonomy in unconstrained environments.",

        "abstract": "The iterative closest points (ICP) algorithm is widely used for ego-motion estimation in robotics, but subject to bias in the presence of outliers. We propose a random sample consensus (RANSAC) based algorithm to simultaneously achieving robust and realtime ego-motion estimation, and multi-scale segmentation in environments with rapid changes. Instead of directly sampling on measurements, RANSAC matching investigates initial estimates at the object level of abstraction for systematic sampling and computational efficiency. A soft segmentation method using a multi-scale representation is exploited to eliminate segmentation errors. By explicitly taking into account the various noise sources degrading the effectiveness of geometric alignment: sensor noise, dynamic objects and data association uncertainty, the uncertainty of a relative pose estimate is calculated under a theoretical investigation of scoring in the RANSAC paradigm. The improved segmentation can also be used as the basis for higher level scene understanding. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively through extensive experiments using real data.",

In this paper, we present a localization and tethering approach that relies solely on wireless signal strength and robot odometry without requiring any known reference points in the domain. We introduce a data-driven, probabilistic model that maps received signal strength (RSS) values to real-world distance distributions and embed this model in a grid-based localization algorithm that successfully performs the LANdroids tethering task. We furthermore show, that it is possible to improve localization through the addition of a compass sensor and inter-robot information sharing.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a tractable solution to feature-based (FB) SLAM in the presence of data association uncertainty and uncertainty in the number of features. By modeling the feature map as a random finite set (RFS), a rigorous Bayesian formulation of the FB-SLAM problem that accounts for uncertainty in the number of features and data association is presented. As such, the joint posterior distribution of the set-valued map and vehicle trajectory is propagated forward in time as measurements arrive. A first order solution, coined the PHD-SLAM filter, is derived, which jointly propagates the posterior PHD or intensity function of the map and the posterior distribution of the trajectory of the vehicle. A Rao-Blackwellised implementation of the PHD-SLAM filter is proposed based on the Gaussian mixture PHD filter for the map and a particle filter for the vehicle trajectory. Simulated results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach, particularly in situations of high clutter and data association ambiguity.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework. As team coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and large scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the problem of single robot SLAM, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present paper we address the problem of multi robot SLAM in the case of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses. Starting from the well established single robot RBPF-SLAM, we propose a simple technique which jointly estimates SLAM posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended to different communication technologies (bluetooth, RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range. The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a probing-based method for probabilistic localization in automated robotic assembly. We consider peg-in-hole problems in which a needle-like peg has a single point of contact with the object that contains the hole, and in which the initial uncertainty in the relative pose (3D position and 3D angle) between the peg and the object is much greater than the required accuracy (assembly clearance). We solve this 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) localization problem using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, in which the probability distribution over the peg's pose is factorized into two components: The distribution over position (3-DOF) is represented by particles, while the distribution over angle (3-DOF) is approximated as a Gaussian distribution for each particle, updated using an extended Kalman filter. This factorization reduces the number of particles required for localization by orders of magnitude, enabling real-time online 6-DOF pose estimation. Each measurement is simply the contact position obtained by randomly repositioning the peg and moving towards the object until there is contact. To compute the likelihood of each measurement, we use as a map a mesh model of the object that is based on the CAD model but also explicitly models the uncertainty in the map. The mesh uncertainty model makes our system robust to cases in which the actual measurement is different from the expected one. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over previous methods using simulations as well as physical experiments with a robotic arm and a metal peg and object.",

The key feature of the rapid updating technique developed is the ability to increment and re-arrange the existing search tree reducing the amount of computation taken to find a new plan. The rapid updating techniques developed are combined into a receding horizon control and compared to full cold start method. The rapid updating technique demonstrated an average 62% solve time improvement over a cold start.

In this proof of principle study we investigate the feasibility of high-fidelity haptic interaction with human motion using remote sensing and actuation. A cable-spring mechanism transmits force to the thumb and index finger in an unconstrained manner, actuated over a stiff cable transmission. Characterization of the prototype with a transmission length of two meters revealed good dynamic performance including a 16 Hz open loop force bandwidth and a maximal output force of 28 N. Combined with a remote and shielded conventional electromagnetic actuator, this device could be used to investigate the neural correlates of precision grasping as well as the effect of different hand function therapies on the neural correlates of motor recovery after stroke.",

        "abstract": "It is interesting to observe from human visually guided tasks that visual feedback is not used for the entire movement, but only at end phases when our hand is near the target. We are able to move our hand from an initial position that is not within our field of view and transit smoothly and easily into visual feedback when the target is near. Inspired by this natural action, this paper presents a new task-space adaptive controller with dual feedback information. The proposed controller consists of a Cartesian-space region reaching controller at the initial stage and a vision based tracking controller that is only activated when the end effector enters an image region. A new potential energy function is proposed such that the image region can be fixed as the field of view of the camera and does not have to vary with the desired trajectory. The proposed task-space controller can transit smoothly from Cartesian-space reaching to vision-space tracking control. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed with consideration of the nonlinear dynamics. The proposed adaptive controller is implemented on an industrial robot and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "We propose a combined approach for 3D real-time object recognition and tracking, which is directly applicable to robotic manipulation. We use keypoints features for the initial pose estimation. This pose estimate serves as an initial estimate for edge-based tracking. The combination of these two complementary methods provides an efficient and robust tracking solution. The main contributions of this paper includes: 1) While most of the RAPiD style tracking methods have used simplified CAD models or at least manually well designed models, our system can handle any form of polygon mesh model. To achieve the generality of object shapes, salient edges are automatically identified during an offline stage. Dull edges usually invisible in images are maintained as well for the cases when they constitute the object boundaries. 2) Our system provides a fully automatic recognition and tracking solution, unlike most of the previous edge-based tracking that require a manual pose initialization scheme. Since the edge-based tracking sometimes drift because of edge ambiguity, the proposed system monitors the tracking results and occasionally re-initialize when the tracking results are inconsistent. Experimental results demonstrate our system's efficiency as well as robustness.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to propose a robust one shot structured light pattern for real time 3D shape inspection system. To reduce the influence of inspected part reflectance property and ambient light, the pattern is constructed by using monochromatic light. The corner of the chessboard is utilized as the primitive of the pattern since it can provide highly accurate position. Additionally, the orientation of the corner is used to encode the primitive of the pattern. Compared with ordinary two dimensional patterns, the pattern is developed in one dimension, along the epipolar line so that the search of the corresponding pixels between the projector and the camera is speeded up. Last, experiments were conducted to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the inspection system using the proposed pattern. The results demonstrate that the system has high accuracy performance.",

This study describes a novel HMI using Hill-based muscle model to control the isometric force of a robotic thumb that considers the importance of the thumb in hand function. In order to estimate force intension, SEMG from the skin surface was measured and converted to muscle activation information. The activations of deep muscles were inferred from the ratios of muscle activations from earlier studies. The muscle length of each contributed muscle was obtained by using a motion capture system and musculoskeletal modeling software packages. Once muscle forces were calculated, thumb-tip force was estimated based on a mapping model from the muscle force to thumb-tip force. The proposed method was evaluated in comparisons with a linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) under four different thumb configurations to investigate the potential for estimations under conditions in which the thumb configuration changes.",

Our solution involves a novel interest point detector for mesh and range data that is particularly well suited for analyzing human shape. The interest points, which are based on identifying geodesic extrema on the surface mesh, coincide with salient points of the body, which can be classified as, e.g., hand, foot or head using local shape descriptors. Our approach also provides a natural way of estimating a 3D orientation vector for a given interest point. This can be used to normalize the local shape descriptors to simplify the classification problem as well as to directly estimate the orientation of body parts in space. Experiments involving ground truth labels acquired via an active motion capture system show that our interest points in conjunction with a boosted patch classifier are significantly better in detecting body parts in depth images than state-of-the-art sliding-window based detectors.",

        "abstract": "While the most accurate solution to off-line structure from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.",

By rotating and extending the tubes with respect to each other, their curvatures interact elastically to position and orient the robot's tip, as well as to control the robot's shape along its length. Since these robots form slender curves, they are well suited for minimally invasive medical procedures. A substantial challenge to their practical use is the real-time solution of their kinematics that are described by differential equations with split boundary equations. This paper proposes a numerically efficient approach to real-time position control. It is shown that the forward kinematics are smooth functions that can be precomputed and accurately approximated using Fourier series. The inverse kinematics can be solved in real time using root finding applied to the functional approximation. Experimental demonstration of real-time position control using this approach is also described.",

We developed a real-time remote transmission system that can deliver multiple tactile properties using a master-slave robot system. First, we assessed what type of tactile properties should be transmitted and how to connect them in real time. Three tactile properties - roughness, friction, and softness - were transmitted on the basis of the real-time estimated physical properties of three main wavelengths, a kinetic friction coefficient, and spring constants, respectively. Tactile stimulations were generated in synchronization with hand exploration at the master side by using local tactile generation models to compensate for communication time delay. The transmission of multiple tactile properties was achieved by the integration and enhancement of our previously reported methods for vibrotactile displays and tactile sensors. A discrimination experiment using different materials showed the feasibility of the total system involving the three tactile properties.",

The approach contains three algorithms: a multiple homography alignment algorithm, which constructs homographies under unified epipolar geometry; a closed-form motion estimation algorithm; and a simple routine for surface slope estimation. This approach has three significant advantages: first, it works well for both a simple planar scene and more complex 3D world containing many smaller planar surfaces; second, it decomposes a very large optimization problem into much smaller sub-problems that are computationally less expensive. This computational advantage means that this approach can be exploited in real time robotic operations such as during time critical spacecraft landing. Finally, this approach is very reliable and accurate. The effectiveness of this approach is determined quantitatively through extensive simulations and qualitatively with actual images.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot tipover is a concern as it can create dangerous situations for operators and bystanders, cause collateral damage to the surrounding environment, and result in an aborted mission. Algorithms have been developed by others to assess the stability of the robot, and many of these algorithms have been demonstrated using simulated data. In order to verify that these algorithms accurately match real-world behavior, we have collected data of a mobile robot tipping over and then compared this data to the stability measures provided by three algorithms: Zero-Moment Point (ZMP), Force-Angle stability measure (FA), and Moment-Height Stability measure (MHS). A small mobile robot platform based on the iRobot PackBot drove a course including ramps and obstacles; an IMU and GPS provided inertial and positional data for the algorithms, and the actual tipover event is determined from video footage of the tests. The average normalized measure at tipover event initiation was found to be 0.665 for ZMP, -0.094 for FA, and 0.023 for MHS, where a value of 1 corresponds to resting stability. Standard deviations were 0.38, 0.84, and 0.67, respectively. The measures show a significant amount of noise, which is likely due to the vibrations caused by movement of the tracks and could be reduced by employing additional filtering during data collection. The preliminary real-world data validates these tipover algorithms as able to assess robot stability, and they can be used as part of a tipover avoidance system.",

The environment is modelled using linear segments that represent boundaries between the estimated traversable and non-traversable regions. The approach integrates Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The control problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and explicitly includes the obstacles and vehicle dynamics.We present the results of our experiments using Pioneer robots, as well as, simulation results which clearly demonstrated the impact of each component of the system.",

        "abstract": "The recognition and prediction of situations is an indispensable skill of future driver assistance systems. This study focuses on the recognition of situations involving two vehicles at intersections. For each vehicle, a set of possible future motion trajectories is estimated and rated based on a motion database for a time interval of 2-4 seconds ahead. Realistic situations are generated by a pairwise combination of these individual motion trajectories and classified according to nine categories with a polynomial classifier. In the proposed framework, situations are penalised for which the time to collision significantly exceeds the typical human reaction time. The correspondingly favoured situations are combined by a probabilistic framework, resulting in a more reliable situation recognition and collision detection than obtained based on independent motion hypotheses. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world differential GPS data set acquired during a test drive of 10 km, including three road intersections. Our method is typically able to recognise the situation correctly about 1-2 seconds before the distance to the intersection centre becomes minimal.",

        "abstract": "For a deployed mobile robotic network to function usefully, the robots should have the capability to adjust their positions, while maintaining the network connectivity. In this paper, we present algorithms that allows a robot to decide when it is feasible for it to move to a desired point by adjusting its own positions (and the positions of some other robots in the network), while maintaining all the network connectivity constraints. Under the assumption of a disc model of communication, we show that the problem can be formulated as a convex optimization (or feasibility) problem (actually a second order cone program). Thus, the problem can be solved in polynomial time by centralized interior point algorithms. However, this requires the robot to have knowledge of the position of all the nodes in the network. Our main contribution is the development of an incremental algorithm, that solves the feasibility problem (of whether the robot can move to its desired goal) by obtaining the information about the position of the robots and their immediate neighbors only if they are required to move. We present simulation results comparing the performance of the centralized algorithm with the incremental algorithm for randomly generated networks. From simulation results, we observe that the time required by the incremental algorithm to solve the feasibility problem is relatively independent of the size of the network.",

Instead of estimating the state of objects in the environment, the latter is separated into equidistant cells. Tracking the occupancy state of these grid-cells is sufficient for many applications in robotics and cell-measurements can be easily produced from almost any kind of sensor. In [6] a sophisticated occupancy filter named BOFUM (Bayesian Occupancy Tracking using prior Map Knowledge) is introduced, which is able to infer velocities solely from occupancy measurements. It also features an advanced process model with motion uncertainty, which can be specialized for different application needs. In this paper we present an approach for recursively applying importance sampling (IS) to approximate the BOFUM calculations. The approach is similar to well known particle filters, but for a discrete cell perspective. In our experiments we achieved a speedup of at least 40-times by using the IS, thus making the algorithm applicable in real-world applications. We evaluate the consequences of approximation in an urban traffic scenario and also show the drawbacks of sampling.",

The proposed approach is based on the concept of virtual mechanism, where the real head is enhanced with a virtual link that connects the eye with a point in 3-D space. We tested our implementation on a humanoid head with seven degrees of freedom and two rigidly connected cameras in each eye (wide-angle and telescopic). The experimental results show that the proposed control algorithm can be used to maintain the view of an observed object in the foveal (telescopic) image using information from the peripheral view. Unlike other methods proposed in the literature, our approach shows how to exploit the redundancy of the robot head. The proposed technique is systematic and can be easily implemented on different types of active humanoid heads. The results show good tracking performance regardless of the distance between the object and the head. Moreover, the uncertainties in the kinematic model of the head do not affect the performance of the system.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a method for learning object grasp affordance models in 3D from experience, and demonstrate its applicability through extensive testing and evaluation on a realistic and largely autonomous platform. Grasp affordance refers here to relative object-gripper configurations that yield stable grasps. These affordances are represented probabilistically with grasp densities, which correspond to continuous density functions defined on the space of 6D gripper poses. A grasp density characterizes an object's grasp affordance; densities are linked to visual stimuli through registration with a visual model of the object they characterize. We explore a batch-oriented, experience-based learning paradigm where grasps sampled randomly from a density are performed, and an importance-sampling algorithm learns a refined density from the outcomes of these experiences. The first such learning cycle is bootstrapped with a grasp density formed from visual cues. We show that the robot effectively applies its experience by downweighting poor grasp solutions, which results in increased success rates at subsequent learning cycles. We also present success rates in a practical scenario where a robot needs to repeatedly grasp an object lying in an arbitrary pose, where each pose imposes a specific reaching constraint, and thus forces the robot to make use of the entire grasp density to select the most promising achievable grasp.",

        "abstract": "Registration of 3D facial surfaces means establishing point-to-point correspondence between two 3D facial surfaces. Difficulties typical for the registration of 3D facial surfaces are varying illumination, pose or viewpoint changes, varying facial expressions, and different appearance of individuals. In this work we propose to use a covariance matrix as descriptor for the neighborhood of a salient point in a face. It encodes the variance of the channels, such as red, green, blue, depth, etc., their correlations with each other, and spatial layout, while filtering out the influence of the disturbing effects mentioned above. A pyramidal approach is applied where first the location of a corresponding point is computed roughly and then the position is gradually refined. The method does not require any training. Particle Swarm Optimization makes the search for corresponding points more efficient. Results with a challenging dataset confirm that the approach works greatly for a variety of disturbing effects.",

We propose an approach for computing sequences of finger repositioning that allow the hand to switch from one grasping configuration to another while maintaining force-closure during the entire process. The proposed approach is based on exploring a structure called switching graph. Complete sets of two-fingered force-closure grasps are computed in grasp space. Adjacent sets of force-closure grasps are merged into a connected set which allows finger repositioning by continuous movements of fingers on adjacent polygonal edges. We present an output sensitive algorithm to construct a switching graph from the obtained connected sets. A method for finding the optimal solution of a finger switching is also presented. The proposed approach has been implemented and some preliminary results are presented.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most general approaches to learning control. Its applicability to complex motor systems, however, has been largely impossible so far due to the computational difficulties that reinforcement learning encounters in high dimensional continuous state-action spaces. In this paper, we derive a novel approach to RL for parameterized control policies based on the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals. While solidly grounded in optimal control theory and estimation theory, the update equations for learning are surprisingly simple and have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a real-world scenario. We believe that our new algorithm, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2), offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL in robotics.",

        "abstract": "Skid-steered vehicles, by design, must skid in order to maneuver. The skidding causes the vehicle to behave discontinuously as well as introduces complications to the observation of the vehicle's state, both of which affect a controller's performance. This paper addresses estimation of contact state by applying switched system optimization to estimate skidding properties of the skid-steered vehicle. In order to treat the skid-steered vehicle as a switched system, the vehicle's ground interaction is modeled using Coulomb friction, thereby partitioning the system dynamics into four distinct modes, one for each combination of the forward and back wheel pairs sticking or skidding. Thus, as the vehicle maneuvers, the system propagates over some mode sequence, transitioning between modes over some set of switching times. This paper presents a technique for estimating a mode sequence by optimizing a relaxation of an infinite dimensional representation of switched systems. The switching times themselves may then be estimated using switching time optimization techniques.",

The approach is to construct an ordered symbolic language for smooth planar curves and to use these curves as desired paths for the aircraft. The underlying problem is then to design a communication protocol by which the pilot can, with vanishing error probability, specify a string in this language using a sequence of bits sent through a binary symmetric channel in the presence of noiseless feedback. Such a protocol is provided by the combination of arithmetic coding as a method of lossless data compression with posterior matching as a capacity-achieving channel code. Preliminary hardware experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to achieving high resolution, repeated benthic surveying using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A stereo based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) technique is used to estimate the trajectory of the vehicle during multiple overlapping grid based surveys. The vehicle begins each dive on the surface and uses GPS to navigate to a designated start location. Once it reaches the designated location on the surface, the vehicle dives and executes a pre-programmed grid survey, collecting co-registered high resolution stereo images, multibeam sonar and water chemistry data. A suite of navigation instruments are used while the vehicle is underway to estimate its pose relative to the local navigation frame. Following recovery of the vehicle, the SLAM technique is used to refine the estimated vehicle trajectory and to find loop closures both within each survey and between successive missions to co-register the dives. Results are presented from recent deployments of the AUV Sirius at a site in North Eastern Tasmania. The objective of the deployments described in this work were to document the behaviour of barrens-forming sea sea urchins which have recently become resident in the area. The sea urchins can overgraze luxuriant kelp beds that once dominated these areas, leaving only rocky barrens habitat. The high resolution stereo images and resulting three dimensional surface models allow the nocturnal behaviour of the animals, which emerge to feed predominantly at night, to be described. Co-registered images and resulting habitat models collected during the day and at night are being analysed to describe the behaviour of the sea urchins in more detail.",

        "abstract": "In Programming by Demonstration, a flexible representation of manipulation motions is necessary to learn and generalize from human demonstrations. In contrast to subsymbolic representations of trajectories, e.g. based on a Gaussian Mixture Model, a partially symbolic representation of manipulation strategies based on a temporal satisfaction problem with domain constraints is developed. By using constrained motion planning and a geometric constraint representation, generalization to different robot systems and new environments is achieved. In order to plan learned manipulation strategies the RRT-based algorithm by Stilman et al. is extended to consider, that multiple sets of constraints are possible during the extension of the search tree.",

This controller generates desired motions, which are specified in the task space, while adjusting stiffness of mechanical elastic elements installed in each joint of the robots. This controller also adjusts equilibrium angles of the elastic elements. These parameter adjustments minimize actuator torque. Advantages of the proposed controller are to work without using exact parameter values of the controlled systems nor huge numerical calculations. We mathematically discuss stability of the controlled systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

The retraction step is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and performs iterative refinement on the boundary of C-Obstacle space. We also combine the retraction algorithm with decomposition planners to handle very high DOF articulated models. The performance of our approach is analyzed using Voronoi diagrams and we show that our retraction algorithm provides a good approximation to the ideal RRT-extension in constrained environments. We have implemented our algorithm and tested its performance on robots with more than 40 DOFs in complex environments. In practice, we observe significant performance (2-80X) improvement over prior RRT planners on challenging scenarios with narrow passages.",

We demonstrate this system through numerical simulations, validation in a physics-based simulation environment, as well as on a novel two-wheeled platform. The results show that the generated control strategies are successful in mission planning for this challenging problem domain and offer significant advantages over hand-tuned alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied in robotics to learn how to solve tasks based on reward signals obtained during task execution. These reward signals are usually modeled by the programmer or provided by supervision. However, there are situations in which this reward is hard to encode, and so would require a supervised approach of reinforcement learning, where a user directly types the reward on each trial. This paper proposes to use brain activity recorded by an EEG-based BCI system as reward signals. The idea is to obtain the reward from the activity generated while observing the robot solving the task. This process does not require an explicit model of the reward signal. Moreover, it is possible to capture subjective aspects which are specific to each user. To achieve this, we designed a new protocol to use brain activity related to the correct or wrong execution of the task. We showed that it is possible to detect and classify different levels of error in single trials. We also showed that it is possible to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to learn new similar tasks using the rewards obtained from brain activity.",

The capability of the SARRP to deliver highly focused beams to multiple animal models provides new research opportunities that more realistically bridge laboratory research and clinical translation. This paper describes the design and operation of the SARRP for precise radiation delivery. Different delivery procedures are presented which enable the system to radiate through a series of points, representative of a complex shape. A particularly interesting case is shell dose irradiation, where the goal is to deliver a high dose of radiation to the shape surface, with minimal dose to the shape interior. The ability to deliver a dose shell allows mechanistic research of how a tumor interacts with its microenvironment to sustain its growth and lead to its resistance or recurrence.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a strategy for planning robot motions in dynamic, cluttered, and uncertain environments. Successful and efficient operation in such environments requires reasoning about the future system evolution and the uncertainty associated with obstacles and moving agents in the environment. This paper presents a novel procedure to account for future information gathering (and the quality of that information) in the planning process. After first presenting a formal Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation, we present a Partially Closed-loop Receding Horizon Control algorithm whose approximation to the DP solution integrates prediction, estimation, and planning while also accounting for chance constraints that arise from the uncertain location of the robot and other moving agents. Simulation results in simple static and dynamic scenarios illustrate the benefit of the algorithm over classical approaches.",

This paper examines viability of measuring psycho physiological responses to different robotic tasks. The heart rate, skin conductance, respiration and peripheral skin temperature were observed to verify if physical activity obstructs useful recordings and to verify responses in stroke population. 30 healthy subjects were checked with a control task, a purely mental task and task with physical load. 23 subacute stroke persons did a control task, pick and place task (+ inverted version) and Stroop test, same as 22 healthy control subjects. Psycho physiological measurements yielded results even in the presence of physical load and can thus potentially be useful for rehabilitation robotics. Similar responses as in healthy control group were found in the stroke group. Skin conductance response frequency, respiratory rate, skin conductance and skin temperature (all changes from baseline) were confirmed as parameters signaling changes in arousal and valence of both, stroke and control groups.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses robust estimation of the uncalibrated visual-motor Jacobian for an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) system. The proposed method does not require knowledge of model or system parameters and is robust to outliers caused by various visual tracking errors, such as occlusion or mis-tracking. Previous uncalibrated methods are not robust to outliers and assume that the visual-motor data belong to the underlying model. In unstructured environments, this assumption may not hold. Outliers to the visual-motor model may deteriorate the Jacobian, which can make the system unstable or drive the arm in the wrong direction. We propose to apply a statistically robust M-estimator to reject the outliers. We compare the quality of the robust Jacobian estimation with the least squares-based estimation. The effect of outliers on the estimation quality is studied through MATLAB simulations and eye-in-hand visual servoing experiments using a WAM arm. Experimental results show that the Jacobian estimated by robust M-estimation is robust when up to 40% of the visual-motor data are outliers.",

We propose an approach for sampling particles from multiple ancestor sets, not from just one prior set. This sampling method increases the robustness of SLAM algorithm, because some particles can be updated by only observations consistent with the map, even if observation at certain time step is corrupted by environmental changes. Corrupted observations are filtered out from recursive Bayesian update process by the proposed sampling method. We also present an intermediate path estimation method to use abandoned sensor information reflected from relocated objects for map update. The map can represent the changed configuration of non-static environment by the stored sensor information and the estimated path. Results of simulations and experiments in non-static environments show the robustness of proposed RBPF-SLAM algorithm using sonar sensors.",

The objective is to achieve and maintain desired formation tracking, and guarantee no collision between the marine vehicles. The control development relies on existing potential functions which fall at a minimum value when the vehicles reach the desired formation, and blow up to infinity when the vehicles approach collision. The combination of the potential functions, backstepping and variable structure based design technique allows us to handle time varying disturbances by ensuring a stable formation. Using the sliding-Backstepping technique and Lyapunov synthesis, a stable coordination tracking controller is designed. Uniform boundedness of the closed loop signals system is achieved.",

However, their performance is subject to the availability and accuracy of digital road maps. Most current digital maps are still inadequate for advanced applications in unstructured environments. Lack of detailed up-to-date information and insufficient accuracy and refinement of the road geometry are among the most important shortcomings. The massive use of inexpensive GPS receivers, combined with the rapidly increasing availability of wireless communication infrastructure, suggests that large volumes of data combining both modalities will be available in a near future. The approach presented here draws on machine learning techniques to process logs of position traces to consistently build a detailed and accurate representation of the road network and, more importantly, extract the actual paths followed by vehicles. Experimental results with data from large mining operations are presented to validate the algorithm.",

The estimation of the hand-eye transform between the camera frame and the opto-tracked body of the endoscope is an important issue of the calibration. This paper presents a new stable method for the hand-eye calibration problem. The most popular method estimates the transform directly in the special euclidean group SE(3) by computing separately the rotation and the translation. The second famous approach formulates the problem in the dual quaternion space and estimates jointly the rotation and the translation. In a first glance, the simultaneous estimation seems to be always advantageous. However, and according to the experiments, this is not the case for the rotation estimation that is affected by the noise in translation. Our approach takes advantage of the both methods and uses the dual quaternion to estimate separately the rotation and the translation. We show experimentally that our algorithm is more stable with minimal number and small amplitude of motions.",

        "abstract": "The problem of place recognition appears in different mobile robot navigation problems including localization, SLAM, or change detection in dynamic environments. Whereas this problem has been studied intensively in the context of robot vision, relatively few approaches are available for three-dimensional range data. In this paper, we present a novel and robust method for place recognition based on range images. Our algorithm matches a given 3D scan against a database using point features and scores potential transformations by comparing significant points in the scans. A further advantage of our approach is that the features allow for a computation of the relative transformations between scans which is relevant for registration processes. Our approach has been implemented and tested on different 3D data sets obtained outdoors. In several experiments we demonstrate the advantages of our approach also in comparison to existing techniques.",

We achieve execution robustness through exception handling capabilities that are seamlessly integrated throughout the planning system. Having these recovery mechanisms in place allows us to leverage their capabilities to compensate for problems introduced by approximations made during planning. Turning an apparent problem into an opportunity, we are able to plan complex assembly tasks and execute them robustly without the computational cost associated with more sophisticated planners and apply some of the savings toward recovering from unforeseen run-time errors. We show results where simple planning strategies paired with exception-handling are able to achieve the same outcomes (and in less time) as more elaborate methods would.",

To model the vehicle during the overall maneuver a hybrid automaton is used where each state corresponds to a different dynamic behavior exhibited by the UAV. The original takeoff and landing problems are then addressed as a problem of tracking suitable reference signals in order to achieve the desired transitions between different hybrid states of the automaton. Both reference trajectories and feedback control laws are derived to explicitly account for measurement noise and uncertainties, in both the environment and in the vehicle dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the estimation of 3D head poses and its identity authentication with a partial ellipsoid model. To cope with large out-of-plane rotations and translation in-depth, we extend conventional head tracking with a single camera to a stereo-based framework. To achieve more robust motion estimation even under time-varying lighting conditions, we incorporate illumination correction into the aforementioned framework. We approximate the face image variations due to illumination changes as a linear combination of illumination bases. Also, by computing the illumination bases online from the registered face images, after estimating the 3D head poses, user-specific illumination bases can be obtained, and therefore illumination-robust tracking without a prior learning process can be possible. Furthermore, our unified stereo-based tracking is approximated as a linear least-squares problem; a closed-form solution is then provided. After recovering the full-motions of the head, we can register face images with pose variations into stabilized-view images, which are suitable for pose-robust face recognition. To verify the feasibility and applicability of our approach, we performed extensive experiments with three sets of challenging image sequences.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in dynamic urban environments requires localization accuracy exceeding that available from GPS-based inertial guidance systems. We have shown previously that GPS, IMU, and LIDAR data can be used to generate a high-resolution infrared remittance ground map that can be subsequently used for localization. We now propose an extension to this approach that yields substantial improvements over previous work in vehicle localization, including higher precision, the ability to learn and improve maps over time, and increased robustness to environment changes and dynamic obstacles. Specifically, we model the environment, instead of as a spatial grid of fixed infrared remittance values, as a probabilistic grid whereby every cell is represented as its own gaussian distribution over remittance values. Subsequently, Bayesian inference is able to preferentially weight parts of the map most likely to be stationary and of consistent angular reflectivity, thereby reducing uncertainty and catastrophic errors. Furthermore, by using offline SLAM to align multiple passes of the same environment, possibly separated in time by days or even months, it is possible to build an increasingly robust understanding of the world that can be then exploited for localization. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using these algorithms to localize our vehicle against probabilistic maps in various dynamic environments, achieving RMS accuracy in the 10cm-range and thus outperforming previous work. Importantly, this approach has enabled us to autonomously drive our vehicle for hundreds of miles in dense traffic on narrow urban roads which were formerly unnavigable with previous localization methods.",

Our controller relies on pose updates from visual odometry, allowing us to achieve path following even when only a joystick drive interface to the base robot platform is available. We experimentally investigate two specific applications of our technology to autonomous navigation on ground vehicles - non line-of-sight leader-following (between heterogeneous platforms) and retro-traverse to home base.

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of ensuring that a multi-agent robot control system is both safe and effective in the presence of learning components. Safety, i.e., proving that a potentially dangerous configuration is never reached in the control system, usually competes with effectiveness, i.e., ensuring that tasks are performed at an acceptable level of quality. In particular, we focus on a robot playing the air hockey game against a human opponent, where the robot has to learn how to minimize opponent's goals (defense play). This setup is paradigmatic since the robot must see, decide and move fastly, but, at the same time, it must learn and guarantee that the control system is safe throughout the process. We attack this problem using automata-theoretic formalisms and associated verification tools, showing experimentally that our approach can yield safety without heavily compromising effectiveness.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent years, the potential for collision between humans and robots has drawn much attention since service robots are increasingly being used in the human environment. A safe robot arm can be achieved using either an active or passive compliance method. A passive compliance system composed of purely mechanical elements often provides faster and more reliable responses to dynamic collision than an active system involving sensors and actuators. Since positioning accuracy and collision safety of a robot arm are equally important, a robot arm should have very low stiffness when subjected to a collision force capable of causing human injury. Otherwise, it should maintain a very high stiffness. To implement these requirements, a novel safe joint mechanism (SJM-III) consisting of an inclined link, a slider with rollers, and linear springs is proposed. The SJM-III has the advantage of nonlinear stiffness, which can be achieved only with passive mechanical elements. Various analyses and experiments on static and dynamic collisions show high stiffness of the SJM-III against an external torque less than a predetermined threshold torque, with an abrupt drop in stiffness when the external torque exceeds this threshold. The safe joint mechanism enables a robot manipulator to guarantee positioning accuracy and collision safety, and which is simple to install between an actuator and a robot link without a significant change in the robot's design.",

The proposed approach, Sampling-based Motion and Symbolic Action Planner (SMAP), leverages from sampling-based motion planning the underlying idea of searching for a solution trajectory by selectively sampling and exploring the continuous space of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Drawing from AI, SMAP uses symbolic action planning to identify actions and regions of the continuous space that sampling-based motion planning can further explore to significantly advance the search. The planning layers interact with each-other through estimates on the utility of each action, which are computed based on information gathered during the search. Simulation experiments with dynamical models of vehicles carrying out tasks given by high-level STRIPS specifications provide promising initial validation, showing that SMAP efficiently solves challenging problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a geometry-based, multi-layered synergistic approach to solve motion planning problems for mobile robots involving temporal goals. The temporal goals are described over subsets of the workspace (called propositions) using temporal logic. A multi-layered synergistic framework has been proposed recently for solving planning problems involving significant discrete structure. In this framework, a high-level planner uses a discrete abstraction of the system and the exploration information to suggest feasible high-level plans. A low-level sampling-based planner uses the physical model of the system, and the suggested high-level plans, to explore the state-space for feasible solutions. In this paper, we advocate the use of geometry within the above framework to solve motion planning problems involving temporal goals. We present a technique to construct the discrete abstraction using the geometry of the obstacles and the propositions defined over the workspace. Furthermore, we show through experiments that the use of geometry results in significant computational speedups compared to previous work. Traces corresponding to trajectories of the system are defined employing the sampling interval used by the low-level algorithm. The applicability of the approach is shown for second-order nonlinear robot models in challenging workspace environments with obstacles, and for a variety of temporal logic specifications.",

Different extensions to this algorithm are used to incrementally construct point models of the robot's workspace. A simple heuristic allows for determining which points in a newly acquired range image are already contained in the point model and for adding only those points that provide new information. Furthermore, the means for dealing with environment dynamics are presented which allow for continuously conducting SLAM and updating the point model according to changes in a dynamic environment. The achievable results of the overall approach are compared to Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters as a state-of-the-art solution to the SLAM problem and evaluated using a recently published benchmark by Burgard et al.

A Markov random field models coupling between the labels of adjacent image regions. The MRF affinities are learned as linear functions of image features in a structured max-margin framework that admits a solution via convex optimization. In contrast to other known MRF/CRF-based approaches, our method classifies in real-time and has computational complexity that scales only logarithmically in the number of object classes. We accomplish this by applying a cascade of binary MRF-classifiers in a way similar to error-correcting output coding for general multiclass learning problems. Inference in this model is exact and can be performed very efficiently using graph cuts. Experimental results are shown that demonstrate a marked improvement in classification accuracy over purely local methods.",

The robot arm is actuated antagonistically by two actuators made up of 60 small SMA springs arranged in parallel, which are activated in an on/off fashion using Joule heating. The force and stiffness of each actuator is controlled by recruiting a desired number of springs to contract. The joint position is then controlled using equilibrium point servo control. The results presented in this paper show that the combination of equilibrium point control of the arm joint and recruitment-based control of each actuator's stiffness solve some of the major problems of scalability and response speed often associated with active material actuators.",

This research is motivated by the need of obtaining semantic knowledge of a large urban outdoor environment after the robot explores and generates a low-level sensing data set. An algorithm is developed with the data represented in a range image, while each pixel can be converted into a 3D coordinate. Using an existing segmentation method that models only geometric homogeneities, the data of a single object of complex geometry, such as people, cars, trees etc., is partitioned into different segments. Such a segmentation result will greatly restrict the capability of object recognition. This research proposes a framework of simultaneous segmentation and classification of range image, where the classification of each segment is conducted based on its geometric properties, and homogeneity of each segment is evaluated conditioned on each object class. Experiments are presented using the data of a large dynamic urban outdoor environment, and performance of the algorithm is evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous navigation into unknown terrain as well as autonomous science to interpret their observations to guide exploration. In this research we have created a robot able to select science features, direct instruments, collect observations, build maps, and interpret this information to plan actions. We report on field experiments in California's Amboy Crater lava field and demonstrate fundamental capabilities for adaptive exploration in geologic mapping tasks. We show feature detection and instrument visual servoing that enables automated science observation of dozens of targets. Gaussian process models are used to discover spatial and cross-sensor structure including correlations between different locations and sensing scales. The rover develops these relationships on the fly with only on-board computation, reinterpreting remote sensing data in light of the surface materials it observes. The rover learns spatial models of physical phenomena and guides its exploration into informative areas using Maximum Entropy Sampling to improve exploration efficiency. The Amboy Crater experiments show that science autonomy can play a useful role in facilitating geologic survey on kilometer scales.",

        "abstract": "Heuristic searches such as A* search are highly popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality and simplicity in the implementation. In planning for robotic manipulation however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high-dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based manipulation planner that does deal effectively with the high-dimensionality of the problem. The planner achieves the required efficiency due to the following three factors: (a) its use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics; (b) its use of basic (small) motion primitives as atomic actions; and (c) its use of ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality. Our experimental analysis on a real mobile manipulation platform with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator shows the ability of the planner to solve manipulation in cluttered spaces by generating consistent, low-cost motion trajectories while providing guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality.",

        "abstract": "We present exploration and mapping strategies for a mobile robot moving among a finite collection of convex obstacles in the plane. The obstacles are unknown to the robot, which does not have access to coordinates and cannot measure distances or angles. The robot has a unique sensor, called the gap sensor, that tracks the direction of the depth discontinuities in the robot's visibility region. Furthermore, the robot can only move towards depth discontinuities. As the robot moves, the depth discontinuities split and merge, and these changes are encoded in a Gap Navigation Tree. We present a strategy for this robot that is guaranteed to explore the whole environment, but that cannot decide whether the exploration has been completed. If in addition it is assumed that the robot has access to a pebble, which is an identifiable point that the robot can manipulate, then we prove that the robot can decide (in polynomial time in the number of obstacles) whether the environment has been completely explored. For this, the robot is able to distinguish every obstacle using only the gap sensor and a single pebble. These results are a continuation of our previous work on gap sensing for multiply connected environments, in which we reduce the sensing requirements for the robot by constraining the shape of the obstacles.",

We decompose the action selection problem during the search into two parts. First, we compute a belief over the location of the object and subsequently use the belief to select the next target location the robot should visit. For the inference part, we utilize a maximum entropy model which models the conditional distribution over possible locations of the target object given the observations made so far. The model is based on co-occurrences of objects and object attributes in different spatial contexts. The parameters are learned by maximizing the data likelihood using gradient ascent. We evaluate our approach by simulated search runs based on data obtained from different real-world environments. Our results show a significant improvement over a standard search technique which does not employ domain-specific background knowledge.",

Their ballistic trajectories require new optimization guidelines, in contrast to constant-speed or low-torque conventional motor design. A framework was derived in this study based on trajectories that incorporated the effect of velocity on torque and acceleration. This framework suggested that speed rate (or mechanical motor constant) was the best benchmark of robotic motor performance. Implications of this framework were evaluated using simulations of 37 optimized motor models. Simulation results confirmed the framework predictions, suggesting that speed rate was a better predictor of motor success than either motor constant or rated power. Optimum winding/gear ratio, supply voltage, and implications for design choices such as continuously variable transmissions are discussed in light of these findings.",

Further, the authors introduce a scheme for steering the robot by correctly selecting the proper bladders to inflate so that motive force is developed in a specified direction. The control scheme utilizes a passively rolling inner vehicle with a directional, remotely positioned light source that causes valves housed within the sphere to inflate the designated bladders through optical commutation.",

Using the internal calibration and two image points we are able to compute the catadioptric image lines analytically. We exploit the presence of parallel lines in man-made environments to compute the dominant vanishing points in the omnidirectional image. In order to obtain the intersection of two of these conics to compute vanishing points we analyze the self-polar triangle common to this pair. With the information contained in the vanishing points we are able to obtain the self-orientation of a hand-held catadioptric system. This system can be used in a vertical stabilization system required by autonomous navigation or to rectify images required in applications where the vertical orientation of the catadioptric system is assumed. We test our approach performing vertical and full rectifications in real sequences of images.",

        "abstract": "For a developmental robotic system to function successfully in the real world, it is important that it be able to form its own internal representations of affordance classes based on observable regularities in sensory data. Usually successful classifiers are built using labeled training data, but it is not always realistic to assume that labels are available in a developmental robotics setting. There does, however, exist an advantage in this setting that can help circumvent the absence of labels: co-occurrence of correlated data across separate sensory modalities over time. The main contribution of this paper is an online classifier training algorithm based on Kohonen's learning vector quantization (LVQ) that, by taking advantage of this co-occurrence information, does not require labels during training, either dynamically generated or otherwise. We evaluate the algorithm in experiments involving a robotic arm that interacts with various household objects on a table surface where camera systems extract features for two separate visual modalities. It is shown to improve its ability to classify the affordances of novel objects over time, coming close to the performance of equivalent fully-supervised algorithms.",

We refer to this class of networks as semi-autonomous. We introduce a control scheme for such semi-autonomous networks, involving excitation of the network by the external agents, with the objective of manipulating or steering the network. In this context, we consider the situation where the external agents deliver a constant mean control signal. We proceed to examine the resultant mean and covariance of the network output and relate these quantities to circuit-theoretic notions of the network, quantifying the network's amenability to external signals. Four protocols for tree graphs, to promote and deter convergence and to increase and reduce average variance within the network are then presented. These protocols involve decentralized local edge swaps that can be performed in parallel and asynchronously.",

A single sensor provides the distribution value at the current vehicle location. We present a new sliding mode control method for tracking environmental level sets: the controller drives the vehicle to the set where the distribution assumes a pre-specified value and ensures that the vehicle circulates along this set afterwards. The proposed control algorithm does not employ gradient estimation and is non-demanding with respect to both computation and motion. Its mathematically rigorous analysis and justification are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance law is confirmed by illustrative examples and computer simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a sensorless speed controller for linear induction motor (LIM) is developed based on a fuzzy observer. First, the LIM is represented by a T-S fuzzy model. Next, the fuzzy observer is constructed to estimate the immeasurable states including the mover speed and secondary flux, where the observer gains are obtained by computationally solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the fuzzy observer, the synthesis using the virtual desired variable concept is applied to design the control law. Then, the exponential convergence for both estimation error and tracking error is concluded. This indicates that the proposed sensorless speed control possesses the feature with fast transient response and high robustness. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical results and show satisfactory performance.",

The current paper focuses on collaboration in kinesthetic tasks. Herein, we investigate decision situations. This way, the need of communication between partners can be addressed. The current paper introduces for the first time an experimental paradigm which allows studying the effect of decision making in haptic collaboration. Because reciprocal haptic feedback is challenging to provide, we analyze its efficiency in human-human collaboration to understand when it is worth to invest in this additional modality. A one degree of tracking experiment with two human partners revealed that the additional physical effort accompanying reciprocal haptic feedback is directly transformed into higher performance (compared to a control condition without reciprocal haptic feedback). Thus, the presented results motivate further research on the nature of the haptic negotiation between human partners to achieve the same performance benefits in kinesthetic collaboration with robotic partners.",

        "abstract": "Sidewinding is an efficient translation gait used by snakes over flat ground. When implemented on snake robots, it retains its general effectiveness, but becomes unstable on sloped surfaces. Flattening the sidewinding motion along the surface to provide a more stable base corrects for this instability, but degrades other performance characteristics, such as efficiency and handling of rough terrain. In this paper, we identify stability conditions for a sidewinder on a slope and find a solution for the minimum aspect ratio of the sidewinding pattern needed to maintain stability. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on snake robots. In constructing our stability analysis, we present a new, tread-based model for sidewinding that is both consistent with previous models and provides new intuition regarding the kinematics of the gait. This new interpretation of sidewinding further admits a symmetry-based model reduction that simplifies its analysis. Additionally, an intermediate stage of the theoretical work contains a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of an ellipse in rolling contact with a sloped surface.",

The purpose of this study is to develop an easy test-bed for investigating the roles of double-support phase and swing-leg retraction in limit cycle walking. The crossed frame as a swing leg does not have inherent rotational dynamics, and it rotates only in the presence of viscous friction at the central axis. We first analyze the properties of this walker through mathematical modeling. Next, we numerically investigate the gait efficiency, and discuss the effect of inertia moment and mass distribution of the crossed frame. Finally, we briefly report our experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided nanorobotic systems that could perform diagnostic, curative and reconstructive treatments in the human body at the cellular and sub-cellular level in a controllable manner have recently been proposed. The concept of a MRI-guided nanorobotic system is based on the use of a MRI scanner to induce the required external driving forces to guide magnetic nanocapsules to a specific target. However, the maximum magnetic gradient specifications of existing clinical MRI systems are not capable of driving superparamagnetic nanocapsules against the blood flow and therefore these MRIs do not allow for navigation. The present paper proposes a way to overcome this critical drawback through the formation of micron size agglomerations where their size can be regulated by external magnetic stimuli. This approach is investigated through modeling of the physics that govern the self-assembly of the nanoparticles. Additionally a computational tool has been developed that incorporates the derived models and performs simulation, visualization and post-processing analysis. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate that external magnetic field causes aggregation of nanoparticles while they flow in the vessel. This is a promising result -in accordance with similar experimental results- and encourages further investigation on the nanoparticle based self-assembly structures for use in nanorobotic drug delivery.",

The generated tree serves as a lookup table control policy to get any reachable initial condition within that region to the goal. The approach combines motion planning with reasoning about the set of states around a trajectory for which the feedback policy of the trajectory is able to stabilize the system. The key idea is to use a random sample from the bounded region for both motion planning and approximation of the stabilizable sets by falsification; this keeps the number of samples and simulations needed to generate covering policies reasonably low. We simulate the nonlinear system to falsify the stabilizable sets, which allows enforcing input and state constraints. Compared to the algebraic verification using sums of squares optimization in our previous work, the simulation-based approximation of the stabilizable set is less exact, but considerably easier to implement and can be applied to a broader range of nonlinear systems. We show simulation results obtained with model systems and study the performance and robustness of the generated policies.",

In this paper the simultaneous estimation of the above mentioned quantities is achieved by a systematic and effective calibration procedure that does not require any iterative step. The calibration procedure needs only on-board measurements given by the wheels encoders, the camera and a number of properly taken camera snapshots of a set of known landmarks. Numerical simulations and experimental results with a mobile robot Khepera III equipped with a low-cost camera confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of simultaneous object class and pose estimation using nothing more than object class label measurements from a generic object classifier. We detail a method for designing a likelihood function over the robot configuration space. This function provides a likelihood measure of an object being of a certain class given that the robot (from some position) sees and recognizes an object as being of some (possibly different) class. Using this likelihood function in a recursive Bayesian framework allows us to achieve a kind of spatial averaging and determine the object pose (up to certain ambiguities to be made precise). We show how inter-class confusion from certain robot viewpoints can actually increase the ability to determine the object pose. Our approach is motivated by the idea of minimalistic sensing since we use only class label measurements albeit we attempt to estimate the object pose in addition to the class.",

Evaluation of computational models and resulting robotic architecture is usually carried out at the behavioral level by evaluating experimental tasks similar to those performed with rats. While multiple metrics are defined to evaluate behavioral performance in rats, metrics for robot task evaluation are very limited mostly to success/failure and time to complete task. In this paper we present a set of metrics taken from rat spatial memory and learning evaluation to further analyze performance in robots. The proposed set of metrics, learning latency and ability to navigate minimal distance to goal, should offer the robotics community additional tools to assess performance and validity of models in biologically-inspired robotic architectures at the task performance level. We also provide a comparative evaluation using these metrics between similar spatial tasks performed by rat and robot in comparable environments.",

Glider submersibles are highly sensitive to prevailing currents so mission planners must account for ocean tides and eddies.

Here we evaluate plan fragility using empirical tests on historical ocean forecasts for which followup data is available. We present methods for glider path planning and control in a time-varying current field. A case study scenario in the Southern California Bight uses current predictions drawn from the Regional Ocean Monitoring System (ROMS).",

This paper proposes a method for estimating an image when AC illumination components are eliminated. If the eliminated illumination component is the source of specular reflection, the image produced only contains the diffuse reflection components of other illuminations. Removal of the specular reflection enhances the adaptability of a robot vision system to real environments. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed method over using previous methods. The results also show that the method is applicable to moving objects while some errors are generated depending on the illumination frequency and the speed of the objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a formulation of image-based visual servoing (IBVS) for a spherical camera where coordinates are parameterized in terms of colatitude and longitude: IBVS-Sph. The image Jacobian is derived and simulation results are presented for canonical rotational, translational as well as general motion. Problems with large rotations that affect the planar perspective form of IBVS are not present on the sphere, whereas the desirable robustness properties of IBVS are shown to be retained. We also describe a structure from motion (SfM) system based on camera-centric spherical coordinates and show how a recursive estimator can be used to recover structure. The spherical formulations for IBVS and SfM are particularly suitable for platforms, such as aerial and underwater robots, that move in SE(3).",

        "abstract": "This paper explores systematic control strategies for the stabilization of running on compliant robots with nontrivial torso pitch dynamics. The Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) embedding controller is revisited and its pertinence to more general legged robot models is investigated. It is first deduced that - in the context of an asymmetric hopper - the existence of a SLIP embedding control law requires nominal running motions in which the torso is kept at a constant angle. To remove this overly restrictive condition, a new method is proposed here that retains the advantage of generating control inputs acting in concert with the compliant dynamics of the plant without explicit reliance on the SLIP. To illustrate the enhanced control authority afforded by the proposed method, a minimalist setting is considered, in which a three-degree-of-freedom asymmetric hopper is controlled by a single actuator located at the hip.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative spring assisted modular and reconfigurable robot (MRR) design and control framework, which is developed based on a synergetic integration of robot control with a brake and an embedded spring at each modular joint. By activating the brake, static balancing can be established, allowing reinforced delicate operation in the neighborhood of a balanced configuration such as door opening, as well as spring assisted lift of heavy payload. The developed spring assisted MRR can improve the payload to weight ratio of the conventional robot manipulators without introducing sophisticated mechanisms. A distributed control method has been proposed to facilitate control of the spring assisted MRR. The developed control algorithm does not rely on a prior dynamic models and can suppress uncertainties introduced by module reconfigurations as well as uncertainties due to sensor inaccuracies and noises. With the developed controller, control parameters need not to be adjusted when adding modules to or removing modules from an MRR, or changing its configurations. Prototype modules have been developed, and the experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and control.",

The core of this idea is based on an on-line trajectory generation algorithm that is able to generate continuous command variables from any arbitrary state of motion. We define a measurable criterion to on-line detect an instability or a potential instability of the plant, and right after this criterion is fulfilled, we switch to the on-line trajectory generator that acts as an open-loop pose control submodule in the switched-system. The on-line trajectory generation algorithm guides the system under consideration of kinematic motion constraints to a desired target state of motion that can be specified beforehand (e.g., zero-velocity in a pre-defined position). Systems with one and more degrees of freedom are regarded in this paper; finally, real-world experimental results achieved with a six-joint industrial manipulator are presented in order to demonstrate the potential and the high practical relevance of this concept.",

The fundamental model, describing human-like leg function in walking is the bipedal spring-mass model which was investigated in this study.

The aim of this study is the identification of a stiffness range which allows for stable walking with comparatively large robustness against perturbations. Walking with compliant legs was tested with the bipedal PogoWalker, demonstrating advantages of the underlying leg mechanics, i.e. walking without the necessity of precise leg adjustments, and acceptable impact forces.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we intend to show the basis of a general legged locomotion controller with the ability to integrate both posture and rhythmic motion controls and shift continuously from one control method to the other according to the walking speed. The rhythmic motion of each leg in the sagittal plane is generated by a single leg controller which controls the swing-to-stance and stance-to-swing phase transitions using respectively leg loading and unloading information. Since rolling motion induced by inverted pendulum motion during the two-legged stance phases results in the transfer of the load between the contralateral legs, leg loading/unloading involves posture information in the frontal plane. As a result of the phase modulations based on leg loading/unloading, rhythmic motion of each leg is achieved and leg coordination (resulting in a gait) emerges, even without explicit coordination among the leg controllers, allowing to realize dynamic walking in the low- to medium-speed range. But an additional ascending coordination mechanism between ipsilateral leg controllers helps to improve the stability. In this paper, we report the result of experiments using a newly constructed quadruped robot \u201cKotetsu\u201d in order to verify the results of simulations.

        "abstract": "Planetary surface exploration rovers must accurately and efficiently predict their mobility on natural, rough terrain. Most approaches to mobility prediction assume precise a priori knowledge of terrain physical parameters, however in practical scenarios knowledge of terrain parameters contains significant uncertainty. In this paper, a statistical method for mobility prediction that incorporates terrain uncertainty is presented. The proposed method consists of two techniques: a wheeled vehicle model for calculating vehicle dynamic motion and wheel-terrain interaction forces, and a stochastic response surface method (SRSM) for modeling of uncertainty. The proposed method generates a predicted motion path of the rover with confidence ellipses indicating the probable rover position due to uncertainty in terrain physical parameters. Rover orientations and wheel slippage are also predicted. The computational efficiency of SRSM as compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods is shown via numerical simulations. Experimental results of rover travel over sloped terrain in two different uncertain terrains are presented that confirms the utility of the proposed mobility prediction method.",

During a learning phase, the rover is piloted along a route, logging images. After post-processing, the rover is able to repeat the route in either direction any number of times. This paper describes and evaluates the localization algorithm at the core of a teach-and-repeat system that has been tested on over 32 kilometers of autonomous driving in an urban environment and at a planetary analog site in the High Arctic. We show how a stereo visual odometry pipeline can be extended to become a mapping and localization system, then evaluate the performance of the algorithm with respect to accuracy, robustness to path-tracking error, and the effects of lighting.",

Walking pattern generation operates with a cycle of 20 [ms], and the reference ZMP trajectory is adjusted according to the current actual motion status in order to maintain the current balance. Three different strategies are considered for adjusting the ZMP. The first strategy is to change the reference ZMP inside the sole area. The second strategy is to change the position of the next step, and the third strategy is to change the duration of the current step. The manner in which these changes affect the current balance and how to combine the three strategies are discussed. The proposed methods are implemented as part of an online walking control system with short cycle pattern generation and are evaluated using the HRP-2 full-sized humanoid robot.",

Previous work has shown a chain of edge connected right angle tetrahedrons can fold to arbitrary shapes. To form useful shapes such as tools, the chain should be folded to meet the functional requirements of the task such as mechanical strength. This paper also introduces the analysis of the strength of Programmable Matter systems. Module connections are defined by 6DOF stiffness matrices. The paper analyzes the strength of a heterogeneous system with some rigid and some soft connections.",

When a force was applied to this channel, its length and cross-sectional area deforms. By measuring the resistance change of the electro conductive liquid in the channel, its deformation can be measured. The proposed tactile sensor is composed of two parallel channel filled with electro conductive liquid, therefore, by comparing the resistance changes of each channel to the deformation, only the contacting force can be measured independently. Since a liquid is used for the sensing material, the proposed liquid tactile sensor can be easily attached to movable portions as the joints of robots. In the paper, we measured the sensing characteristics of the liquid tactile sensor to the stretch, bend, and contact force. Finally, the efficiency of the sensor was demonstrated by measuring the contact force from 0 to 3.0N by attaching the 20% stretched liquid tactile sensor to curved surfaces with 0.05mm-1 in curvature.",

The adverse financial and social conditions attributed to stroke have prompted researchers and entrepreneurs to explore the viability of rehabilitation robots. The Powered Ankle Foot Orthosis (PAFO) utilizes robotic tendon technology and supports motion with a single degree of freedom, ankle rotation in the Sagittal plane. Motion capture data, robot sensor data, and functional 6 minute walk data were collected on three stroke subjects. All subjects had some positive changes in their key gait variables while using the PAFO. These changes were more dramatic while harnessed and using a treadmill as opposed to walking over ground. Robot sensor data showed significant improvements on key variables for the three subjects. Motion capture data showed improvements in knee range of motion for subject 1, and the 6 minute walk data showed an increase in distance walked for subjects 1 and 3. Comfort, stability, and robustness proved to be critical design parameters for developing a gait therapy robot capable of collecting repeatable data with low variability.",

        "abstract": "In the future, robotic surgical assistants may assist surgeons by performing specific subtasks such as retraction and suturing to reduce surgeon tedium and reduce the duration of some operations. We propose an apprenticeship learning approach that has potential to allow robotic surgical assistants to autonomously execute specific trajectories with superhuman performance in terms of speed and smoothness. In the first step, we record a set of trajectories using human-guided backdriven motions of the robot. These are then analyzed to extract a smooth reference trajectory, which we execute at gradually increasing speeds using a variant of iterative learning control. We evaluate this approach on two representative tasks using the Berkeley Surgical Robots: a figure eight trajectory and a two handed knot-tie, a tedious suturing sub-task required in many surgical procedures. Results suggest that the approach enables (i) rapid learning of trajectories, (ii) smoother trajectories than the human-guided trajectories, and (iii) trajectories that are 7 to 10 times faster than the best human-guided trajectories.",

        "abstract": "In this work we propose a hierarchical architecture which constructs internal models of a robot environment for goal-oriented navigation by an imitation learning process. The proposed architecture is based on the Reservoir Computing paradigm for training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It is composed of two randomly generated RNNs (called reservoirs), one for modeling the localization capability and one for learning the navigation skill. The localization module is trained to detect the current and previously visited robot rooms based only on 8 noisy infra-red distance sensors. These predictions together with distance sensors and the desired goal location are used by the navigation network to actually steer the robot through the environment in a goal-oriented manner. The training of this architecture is performed in a supervised way (with examples of trajectories created by a supervisor) using linear regression on the reservoir states. So, the reservoir acts as a temporal kernel projecting the inputs to a rich feature space, whose states are linearly combined to generate the desired outputs. Experimental results on a simulated robot show that the trained system can localize itself within both simple and large unknown environments and navigate successfully to desired goals.",

The lift, drag and propulsion forces and the energy efficiency of this robot are modeled and experiments are conducted to verify these models. A maximum lift capacity of 53 grams is achieved with a total of 12 footpads, each 4.2 cm in diameter for a robot weighing 21.75 grams. For this robot, a propulsion efficiency of 22.3% is measured. Maximum forward and turning speeds of the robot are measured as 71.5 mm/sec and 0.21 rad/sec, respectively. These water strider robots could be used in water surface monitoring, cleaning, and analysis in lakes, dams, rivers and sea.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots should be able to stand and walk in the presence of external disturbances. This paper addresses the robustness of a humanoid robot to unknown disturbances. Applying the maximal CPI set, it becomes possible to consider the physical constraint explicitly in the COG-ZMP inverted pendulum model control. In our previous research, the convergence speed of COG was improved by applying the switching control based on the maximal CPI set to the stabilization control assuming the contact region is constant. This paper presents updating calculation method of the maximal CPI set when the contact region changes, and the authors propose a falling avoidance control as an application of it. Detecting the stepping necessity based on the maximal CPI set enables to unify the upright position stabilization and stepping motion for falling avoidance. The validity of the proposed method is verified with experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a quadrocopter flying in rhythm to music. The quadrocopter performs a periodic side-to-side motion in time to a musical beat. Underlying controllers are designed that stabilize the vehicle and produce a swinging motion. Synchronization is then achieved by using concepts from phase-locked loops. A phase comparator combined with a correction algorithm eliminate the phase error between the music reference and the actual quadrocopter motion. Experimental results show fast and effective synchronization that is robust to sudden changes in the reference amplitude and frequency. Changes in frequency and amplitude are tracked precisely when adding an additional feedforward component, based on an experimentally determined look-up table.",

In this work, we present a tactile perception strategy that allows any mobile robot with tactile sensors in its gripper to measure a set of generic tactile features while grasping an object. We propose a hybrid velocity-force controller, that grasps an object safely and reveals at the same time its deformation properties. As an application, we show that a robot can use these features to distinguish the open/closed and fill state of bottles and cans - purely from tactile sensing - from a small training set. To prove that this is a hard recognition problem, we also conducted a comperative study with 17 human test subjects. We found that the recognition rate of the human subjects were comparable to our robotic gripper.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The majority of soft pads for robotic limbs studied so far were made by visco-elastic polymeric solids whose behavior is significantly influenced by the rate of application of the external loads or displacements. In particular, contact interfaces which are intrinsically visco-elastic are found, for instance, in human fingers and feet or in various robotic devices covered by a compliant surface. An outstanding instance are anthropomorphic hands where time-dependent phenomena profoundly affects the stability and sustainability of the grasp. Alternatively to homogenous solid pads, this paper proposes the use of fluid filled soft structures with differentiated layer design that is the adoption of a single solid material, dividing the overall thickness of the pad into a continuous skin layer coupled with an internal layer having communicating voids. The voids are then hermetically sealed and, in case, filled with fluid. Given the allowable pad thickness, the purpose is to tailor the pad properties to the specific application by 1) selecting a skin material characterized by proper tribological features, 2) designing an inner layer geometry so as to obtain a specific static compliance, 3) filling the pad with a viscous fluid chosen so as to modify time-dependent phenomena and increase damping effects. The proposed concept is validated by designing artificial pads whose viscoelastic properties are either similar or more pronounced when compared to those of the human fingertip.",

        "abstract": "Animals exhibit astoundingly adaptive and supple locomotion under real world constraints. In order to endow robots with similar capabilities, we must implement large degrees of freedom, equivalent to animals, into the robots' bodies. For taming large degrees of freedom, the concept of autonomous decentralized control plays a pivotal role. However, a systematic way of designing such autonomous decentralized control system is still missing. Aiming at understanding the principles that underlie animals' locomotion, in our early studies, we focused on true slime mold, a primitive living organism, and extracted a decentralized control scheme. In order to validate this control scheme, this paper presents a soft-bodied amoeboid robot inspired by true slime mold. Significant features of this robot are twofold: (1) the robot has truly soft and deformable body stemming from real-time tunable springs and a balloon, the former is used for an outer skin of the body and the latter serves as protoplasm; and (2) a fully decentralized control using coupled oscillators with completely local sensory feedback mechanism is realized by exploiting the long-distance physical interaction between the body parts stemming from both the softness of the body and the law of conservation of protoplasmic mass. Experimental results show that this robot exhibits truly supple locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure. The results obtained are expected to shed new light on design scheme for autonomous decentralized control system.",

Using the position/orientation of the rover body and all the joint angles as generalized coordinates, the Jacobian matrices and recursive dynamic models are derived. Terramechanics models for calculating the forces and moments that act on the wheel\u2014as a result of the deformable soil\u2014are introduced in consideration of the effect of normal force. A rough terrain modeling method is developed for estimating the wheel-soil interaction area, wheel sinkage, and the terminal coordinate. A simulation program that includes the above techniques is developed using Matlab and SpaceDyn Toolbox. Experimental results from a 4-wheeled mobile robot moving on Toyoura soft sand are used to verify the fidelity of the simulation. A simulation example of a robot moving on a random rough terrain is also presented.",

        "abstract": "Over the last five years, a number of powerful robotics controllers have become available. Only a small percentage of these are suitable for general use in robotics. In particular, they trivially interface with a large variety of sensors and effectors, have a well constructed software IDE that works with a standard programming language, are self contained and are easy to use. The CBC2 is a new robot controller that meets these conditions. The CBC2 includes an ARM 7 based DAQ/Motor control system, an ARM 9-based CPU/Vision processor running LINUX, an integrated color display and touch screen. The CBC2 is both a USB host (allowing the use of standard cameras, mass storage and network interfaces) and a USB device for software downloads. This paper describes the CBC2, its capabilities and the KISS-C IDE and associated libraries which include functionality ranging from color tracking to PID motor control. The CBC/KISS-C system was adopted by the Botball Robotics Education program in 2009, and was used in about three hundred schools. Based on feedback from that experience, design improvements were made and the CBC2 is being used in the 2010 Botball program and is also being made available for other uses.",

The key contribution is the introduction of an adaptive selection matrix for sensor-based hybrid switched-system control. The overall control system consists of multiple sensors and open- and closed-loop controllers, in-between which the adaptive selection matrix can switch discretely in order to supply command variables for low-level controllers of robotic manipulators. How control signals are chosen, is specified by Manipulation Primitives, which constitute the interface to higher-level programming. This programming paradigm is briefly specified in order to be able to define and execute sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motion commands simultaneously. The resulting control system is freely adaptable depending on the sensor and control requirements of the desired system and/or application.",

        "abstract": "A robot's head is important both for directional sensors and, in human-directed robotics, as the single most visible interaction interface. However, designing a robot's head faces contradicting requirements when integrating powerful sensing with social expression. Furher, reactions of the general public show that current head designs often cause negative user reactions and distract from the functional capabilities. Therefore, this contribution presents a novel anthropomorphic robot head called \"Flobi\", which combines state-of-the-art sensing functionality with an exterior that elicits a sympathetic emotional response. It can display primary and secondary emotions in a human-like way, to enable intuitive human-robot-interaction. To facilitate further research on facial appearance, the exterior is fully modular and replaceable. While current state-of-the-art still requires trade-offs when integrating sensing and social expression, Flobi has been designed to enable service robotic applications, with high-resolution, wide-angle stereo vision, gyroscope motion compensation and stereo audio. For ease of integration, the head is self-contained, including 18 actuators, sensors and control boards, all in a human-head sized package.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the definition of a new type of dynamic singularity for robotic manipulators. It is applicable to all underactuated robotic systems that can be described by Lagrange's equations where the Lagrangian is the kinetic minus potential energy. The approach is to decompose the velocity at every point in the configuration space into velocity directions that can be directly controlled and those that are uncontrolled and orthogonal to the directly controlled directions. These uncontrolled directions are controlled only through the dynamic coupling with the controlled directions and the measure of a dynamic singularity is then a measure of this degree of coupling. When this coupling is zero, the mechanism is said to be at a dynamic singularity. The practical implication is that, at such points, the dynamics are decoupled and control over the uncontrolled directions is very weak in that the mechanism will have to move away from the singularity before the inputs can affect the uncontrolled velocity directions. An example that is realistically complicated is presented and simulations show the effect on control inputs when the system is operating near a dynamic singularity.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current applications of mobile robots in urban search and rescue (USAR) environments require a human operator in the loop to help guide the robot remotely. Although human operation can be effective, the unknown cluttered nature of the environments make robot navigation and victim identification highly challenging. Operators can become stressed and fatigued very quickly due to a loss of situational awareness, leading to the robots getting stuck and not being able to find victims in the scene during this time-sensitive operation. In addition, current autonomous robots are not capable of traversing these complex unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a balance between the level of autonomy of the robot and the amount of human control over the robot needs to be addressed. In this paper, we present a unique control architecture for semi-autonomous navigation of a robotic platform utilizing sensory information provided by a novel real-time 3D mapping sensor. The control system provides the robot with the ability to learn and make decisions regarding which rescue tasks should be carried out at a given time and whether an autonomous robot or a human controlled robot can perform these tasks more efficiently without compromising the safety of the victims, rescue workers and the rescue robot. Preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed collaborative control approach for a USAR robot in an unknown cluttered environment.",

A model of the robot thermal behavior has been built and implemented in the controller.

        "abstract": "Human-computer/machine interface research benefits from accurate human arm models for stability analysis, control, and system design. The current study developed models for human arm dynamics and variability specific to stylus-based kinesthetic haptic interfaces. Data from nine human subjects (5 male, 4 female, ages 20\u201330) were collected using a three degree-of-freedom haptic device in the X, Y, and Z axes along with a range of grip forces (1\u20133N) for parametric system identification of the human arm and hand. Variability models that accounted for subject and grip force variation were also identified. The arm and hand model structure consisted of a third-order linear parametric transfer function that was paired with a previously derived second-order model for the haptic robot. The variability was modeled as multiplicative unstructured uncertainty using transfer functions. All of the model parameters were identified in the frequency domain and have force as input and position as output.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a biomechatronic knee prosthesis for transfemoral amputees. This kind of prostheses are considered \u2018intelligent\u2019 because they are able to automatically adapt their response at the knee axis, as a natural knee does. This behavior is achieved by characterizing the amputee's gait through the signals captured with instrumentation of a prosthesis, which provides feedback about its current state along the gait cycle and therefore responds with the corresponding control action. In this case, unlike other commercially available intelligent knee prostheses, gait cycle characterization is based on accelerometers signals processed by an events detection algorithm. Two intelligent control strategies are presented: a bio-inspired approach, that consists of using a central pattern generator to generate a knee angle reference to be followed by the prosthesis during walking, and an adaptive scheme, that applies a control action proportional to the knee angle according to an auto-adaptive parameter dependant on gait speed. The mechanical design of the prosthesis is also presented, showing the knee joint mechanism and part of the manufacturing process. Results obtained from walking tests with both able body and amputees are shown, demonstrating the positive performance of the prosthesis in several aspects. Future works aimed at a finished product are also stated.",

(2004) in order to work for multi-degree of freedom (DoF) haptic systems with time delay. Its energy computation (named passivity observer) factors in the phase shift caused by time delay, and is improved by an energy estimation. Moreover, the variable damping of the passivity controller is generalized such that weighting by the mass matrix of the haptic device is possible. This transformation takes into account the direction-dependent inertia of multi-DoF haptic devices. Furthermore, a stability boundary for this damping is introduced for one as well as for several DoF allowing for high energy dissipation. Additionally, it is briefly shown that one single multi-DoF Cartesian passivity controller is advantageous compared to independent single-DoF passivity controllers in each joint of the haptic device. Finally, the generalized Time Domain Passivity Controller is experimentally verified using the DLR light weight robot arm as haptic device.",

Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), NASA's first space-based mission to directly observe planets outside our own solar system, will rely on FF to achieve the functionality and benefits of a large instrument using multiple lower cost smaller spacecraft. Many key network design problems for such FF missions can be formulated as optimization problems with local and global constraints. We develop a topology control algorithm that can be used for many network problems in the presence of local constraints, such as collision avoidance, and global constraints, such as network connectivity. The presence of contradictory objectives in topology control problems motivated a game-theoretic approach. We demonstrated that a game-theoretic technique could provide a framework for design and analysis of many topology control problems in dynamic networks. In particular, the problem of motion planning for formation reconfiguration in the presence of constraints on network connectivity and inter-spacecraft collisions is studied.",

        "abstract": "Tendon driven mechanisms have been considered in robotic design for several decades. They provide lightweight end effectors with high dynamics. Using remote actuators it is possible to free more space for mechanics or electronics. Nevertheless, lightweight mechanism are fragile and unfortunately their control software can not protect them during the very first instant of an impact. Compliant mechanisms address this issue, providing a mechanical low pass filter, increasing the time available before the controller reacts. Using adjustable stiffness elements and an antagonistic architecture, the joint stiffness can be adjusted by variation of the tendon pre-tension. In this paper, the fundamental equations of m antagonistic tendon driven mechanisms are reviewed. Due to limited tendon forces the maximum torque and the maximum acheivable stiffness are dependent. This implies, that not only the torque workspace, or the stiffness workspace must be considered but also their interactions. Since the results are of high dimensionality, quality measures are necessary to provide a synthetic view. Two quality measures, similar to those used in grasp planning, are presented. They both provide the designer with a more precise insight into the mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Robotic surgical assistants are enhancing physician performance, enabling physicians to perform more delicate and precise minimally invasive surgery. However, these devices are currently tele-operated and lack autonomy. In this paper, we present initial steps toward automating a commonly performed surgical task, tissue retraction, which involves grasping and lifting a thin layer of tissue to expose an underlying area. Given a model of tissues in the vicinity, our method computes a motion plan for a 6-DOF gripper that grasps a tissue flap at an optimal location and retracts it such that an underlying target is fully visible. The planner considers three optimization objectives relevant to medical applications: minimizing the maximum deformation energy, minimizing maximum stress, and minimizing the control effort in lifting the tissue flap. The planner can be used to locally improve physician specified retraction trajectories based on the optimization criteria or to compute a de novo plan. We use a physically-based simulation to compute equilibrium configurations of the tissue flap subject to manipulation constraints. These configurations are used with a sampling-based planner to explore the space of deformations and compute an optimal plan subject to discretization and modeling error. Our experimental results illustrate the ability of the method to compute retractions for heterogeneous tissues while avoiding obstacles and minimizing tissue damage.",

        "abstract": "Chemical properties of lake water can provide valuable insight into its ecology. Lakes that are permanently frozen over with ice are generally inaccessible to comprehensive exploration by humans. This paper describes the integration of several novel and existing technologies into an autonomous underwater robot, ENDURANCE, that was successfully used for gathering scientific data in West Lake Bonney in Taylor Valley, Antarctica, in December 2008. This paper focuses on three novel technological and algorithmic solutions. First, a robust position estimation system that uses an acoustic beacon to complement traditional dead-reckoning is described. Second, a novel vision-based docking algorithm for locating and ascending a vertical shaft by tracking a blinking light source is presented. Third, a novel profiling system for measuring water properties while causing minimal water disturbance is described. Finally, experimental results from the scientific missions in 2008 in West Lake Bonney are presented.",

These fields can be used to perform manipulation tasks such as sensorless positioning of one or several parts simultaneously. This paper examines the set of fields F generated by periodic plate motions M that combine a single in-plane component and a single out-of-plane component that have square wave accelerations with 50% duty cycles, identical periods, and an arbitrary phase between them. By deconstructing the full map \u03a0 : M \u2192 F into three simpler maps, we expose the structure of F and its relationship to M. To illustrate, we focus on particular plate motions in M that generate fields well approximated by polynomial functions of position with degree n \u2264 2. Numerical simulations suggest that fields generated from plate motions with more than a single inplane and a single out-of-plane component (all with the same period and square wave accelerations) are well approximated by linear combinations of fields in F.",

The results show that actuation redundancy allows to homogenize the dynamic capabilities throughout the workspace and to increase the traveling plate acceleration capability.

In order to accelerate the process, we propose a novel template-based approach for robot arm movement imitation. This algorithm selects a previously observed path demonstrated by a human and generates a path in a novel situation based on pairwise mapping of invariant feature locations present in both the demonstrated and the new scenes using a combination of minimum distortion and minimum energy strategies. This One-Shot Learning algorithm is capable of not only mapping simple point-to-point paths but also adapting to more complex tasks such as those involving forced waypoints. As compared to traditional methodologies, our work require neither extensive training for generalisation nor expensive run-time computation for accuracy. This algorithm has been statistically validated using cross-validation of grasping experiments as well as tested for practical implementation on the iCub humanoid robot for playing the tic-tac-toe game.",

The kinematics of five repeated segments joined by a flexible backbone of rigid links and flexures are described and simulated. The kinematic model was used to guide the design of an individual two degree of freedom segment, which was fabricated using the Smart Composite Microstructures process. Testing and analysis of a suspended segment displayed motion similar to that predicted by the model. Multiple segments can be joined to a flexible backbone to create a multi-segment structure capable of a variety of gaits. Due to its modular, multi-legged, and compact design, this robot has the potential to serve as a platform for swarm robotics applications, advance control techniques for ambulatory systems, and inspire batch fabrication of microrobots.",

This paper presents the results of an exploratory study to investigate gesture/speech interfaces for interaction with robots in a situated manner and the development of three iterations of a prototype command set. A command set was compiled from observing users interacting with a simulated interface in a virtual reality environment. We discovered that users find this type of interface intuitive and their commands tend to naturally group into both `High-Level' and `Low-Level' instructions. However, as the robots moved further away, the loss of depth perception and direct feedback was inimical to the interaction. In a second experiment we found that using simple heads up display elements could mitigate these issues.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for accurate robotic motion compensation of a freely moving target object. This approaches a typical problem in medical scenarios, where a robotic system needs to compensate physiological movements of a target region related to the patient. An optical tracking system measures the poses of the robot's end-effector and the moving target. The task is to track the target with the robot in a desired relative pose. Arbitrary motion in 6 DoF is covered. The position controller of the medical light-weight robot MIRO is enhanced by a Cartesian displacement observer. The proposed observer feedback preserves the dynamics of the robot, while achieving high accuracy in task space. The target object is equipped with an inertial measurement unit in addition to tracking markers. Target sensor data is fused by an extended Kalman filter in a tightly coupled approach. The robot control and the target tracking in the task space aim to combine accuracy, dynamic performance and robustness to marker occlusions. The algorithms are verified with the DLR MIRO, an experimental target platform, and a commercial tracking system. The experiments demonstrate rapid convergence to desired Cartesian poses and good dynamic tracking performance even at higher target motion speed.",

This problem has not received much attention in literature because of the lack of large-scale skin sensor systems. The proposed approach is based on a controlled compliance motion with respect to external objects whose pose is known, which allows a robot to determine the location of its own taxels. The major contribution of this work is the formulation of the skin calibration problem as a maximum-likelihood mapping problem in a 6D space, where both the position and the orientation of each taxel are recovered. An effective calibration process is envisaged that, given a compliance control law that assures prolonged contact maintenance between a given body part and an external object, returns a maximum-likelihood estimate of detected taxel poses. Simulations validate the approach.",

Main novelty of this paper lies in deriving a constrained Jacobian motion planning algorithm with the following features: inequality constraints are included into an extended kinematics model using a smooth approximation of the plus function, the model is then regularized against singularities, and the resulting imbalance in error equations is handled as a perturbation of an exponentially stable linear dynamic system. The operation of the constrained motion planning algorithm is illustrated by a motion planning problem of a mobile manipulator with bounds imposed on a platform variable. Performance of the algorithm is tested by computer simulations.",

We present a formulation of the dynamic team formation problem that is independent of ensemble size and develop a macroscopic analytical description of the ensemble dynamics. The macroscopic model is then used to determine the optimal teaming strategy for two different performance metrics. We present agent-based simulation results to support the validity of our macroscopic analysis.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an oceanographic toolchain that can be used to generate multi-vehicle robotic surveys for large-scale dynamic features in the coastal ocean. Our science application targets Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) which have significant societal impact to coastal communities yet are poorly understood ecologically. Bloom patches can be large spatially (in kms) and unpredictable in their extent. To understand their ecology, we need to be able to bring back water samples from the `right' places and times for lab analysis. In doing so, we target hotspots representative of intense biogeochemical activity for such sampling. Our approach uses remote sensing data to detect such hotspots using ocean color as a proxy, and advectively projects these patches spatio-temporally using surface current data from HF Radar stations. Experiments with satellite and Radar data sets are promising for large, coherent blooms. We show how these predictions can be used to select an appropriate sampling trajectory for an AUV.",

The work in this paper addresses the problem of optimizing this trade-off in a self-configured distributed robotic sensor network, with respect to a user-defined objective function. We investigate a quadtree network topology and implement a fully distributed threshold-based field estimation algorithm. Simulations with field data as well as real robot experiments are performed, validating our distributed control strategy and evaluating the threshold-based formula for real world scenarios. We propose a theoretical analysis that predicts the system's behavior in real world case studies. The experiments and this prediction show very good correspondence, enabling the accurate employment of the objective function, optimizing the trade-off based on user needs.",

A novel controller based on backstepping and Lyapunov stability is presented and its performance, stability and robustness are discussed. The performance of this system is compared to that of a standard using on-off thrusters only, and is shown to use less fuel.",

Central to our approach is the melding of recent advances in the application of computational homology (a sub-discipline of algebraic topology) to static sensor networks with relative metric information (i.e. relative pose). More precisely, we consider a greedy, hybrid (discrete-continuous) algorithm whereby a desired C\u011bch complex, the simplicial complex that captures the underlying topology of the sensing cover, is iteratively generated using local rules (between multi-hop neighbors) and agents are driven towards achieving this topology via a gradient-ascent simplicial control law. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is established as a function of the convergence of the underlying simplicial control law, and the relationship of the latter to the spectrum of the combinatorial Laplacian is considered. Simulation results for teams operating in \u211d2 are presented.",

Modules of the system are independently mobile and can be driven on flat surfaces in a similar fashion to the classic kinematic cart.

The constraint properly aligns the docking mechanism, allowing modules to connect with one another along wheel surfaces. This paper presents an initial method for generating trajectories and control inputs that allow module assembly. It also provides an iterative method for locally optimizing a nominal control function using weighted perturbation functions, while preserving the final pose and internal states.",

        "abstract": "Trajectory planning and optimization is a fundamental problem in articulated robotics. It is often viewed as a two phase problem of initial feasible path planning around obstacles and subsequent optimization of a trajectory satisfying dynamical constraints. There are many methods that can generate good movements when given enough time, but planning for high-dimensional robot configuration spaces in realistic environments with many objects in real time remains challenging. This work presents a novel way for faster movement planning in such environments by predicting good path initializations. We build on our previous work on trajectory prediction by adapting it to environments modeled with voxel grids and defining a frame invariant prototype trajectory space. The constructed representations can generalize to a wide range of situations, allowing to predict good movement trajectories and speed up convergence of robot motion planning. An empirical comparison of the effect on planning movements with a combination of different trajectory initializations and local planners is presented and tested on a Schunk arm manipulation platform with laser sensors in simulation and hardware.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss a coordinated haptic training architecture useful for transferring expertise in teleoperation-based manipulation between two human users. The objective is to construct a reality-based haptic interaction system for knowledge transfer by linking an expert's skill with robotic movement in real time. The benefits from this approach include 1) a representation of an expert's knowledge into a more compact and general form by learning from a minimized set of training samples, and 2) an increase in the capability of a novice user by coupling learned skills absorbed by a robotic system with haptic feedback. In order to evaluate our ideas and present the effectiveness of our paradigm, human handwriting is selected as our experiment of interest. For the learning algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) are utilized and their performances are compared. For the evaluation of the performance of the output of the learning modules, a modified Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) algorithm is implemented. Results show that one or two experts' samples are sufficient for the generation of haptic training knowledge, which can successfully recreate manipulation motion with a robotic system and transfer haptic forces to an untrained user with a haptic device. Also in the case of handwriting comparison, the similarity measures result in up to an 88% match even with a minimized set of training samples.",

Images captured by multiple central cameras such as perspective, central catadioptric and fisheye cameras are mapped to spherical images using the unified projection model. It is possible to recover the camera rotations using vanishing points of parallel line sets. We then estimate the translations from known rotations and line images on the spheres. The algorithm has been validated on simulated data and real images. This vision-based estimation approach can be applied in navigation of autonomous robots besides the conventional devices such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). It helps vision-based localization of a single robot or recovery of relative positions among multiple robots equipped with different types of cameras.",

Disaster City is a training facility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States. FEMA staff used our rescue robot Kenaf to conduct simulated emergency testing. Kenaf is a tele-operated tracked vehicle that has high mobility suitable for use in outside terrains and inside buildings. We equipped Kenaf with a 3-D laser scanner that can measure dense and wide angle 3-D shapes. We collected about 50 3-D mapping data sets during the tests. A part of these data sets can be accessed at our website. In this paper, we explain the Kenaf's tele-operation system, the 3-D mapping system, and the comments about the usability of the 3-D mapping from FEMA staff. In addition, we discuss about the limit of our mapping method on the basis of the trials at Disaster City. This information will be helpful for researchers in the robotics to improve their method of 3-D map construction and their tracked vehicles.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a field application of a high-level Reinforcement Learning (RL) control system for solving the action selection problem of an autonomous robot in a cable tracking task. The underwater vehicle ICTINEUAUV learns to perform a visual based cable tracking task in a two step learning process. First, a policy is computed by means of simulation where a hydrodynamic model of the vehicle simulates the cable following task. Once the simulated results are accurate enough, in a second step, the learned-in-simulation policy is transferred to the vehicle where the learning procedure continues in a real environment, improving the initial policy. The natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm has been selected to solve the problem in both steps. This algorithm aims to take advantage of policy gradient and value function techniques for fast convergence. Actor's policy gradient gives convergence guarantees under function approximation and partial observability while critic's value function reduces variance of the estimates update improving the convergence process.",

Hence, by making use of these characteristics, soft fingers can manipulate objects dexterously. While our previous work has focused on pairs of 1-DOF fingers with soft fingertips, we present here a control scheme by which a pair of 2-DOF soft fingers can control a grasped object's planar location. This new control scheme consists of a proportional controller of finger joint angles and an integral controller of object location. We subsequently describe our formulation of the equations of motion of manipulations performed by a pair of 2-DOF soft fingertips. We then apply this control scheme to an experimental situation and to a simulation based on a parallel distributed virtual spring model to control the planar location of a grasped object. These findings demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme. Finally, we show that extending the theory of the proposed controller can lead to the control of grasping forces.",

        "abstract": "This study describes a novel, vision-based system for guidance of UAVs. The system uses two coaxially aligned cameras, each associated with a specially-shaped reflective surface, to obtain stereo information on the height above ground and the distances to potential obstacles. The camera-mirror system has the advantage that it remaps the world onto a cylindrical co-ordinate system that simplifies and speeds up range computations, and defines a collision-free cylinder through which the aircraft can pass without encountering obstacles. We describe an approach, using this vision system, in which the attitude and altitude of an aircraft can be controlled directly, making the system particularly suited to terrain following, obstacle avoidance, and landing. The autonomous guidance of an aircraft performing a terrain following task using the system is demonstrated in field tests.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss a methodology to build a system for a robot playmate that extracts and sequences low-level play primitives during a robot-child interaction scenario. The motivation is to provide a robot with basic knowledge of how to manipulate toys in an equivalent manner as a human does - as a first step in engaging children in cooperative play. Our approach involves the extraction of play primitives based on observation of motion gradient vectors computed from the image sequence. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are then used to recognize 14 different play primitives during play. Experimental results from a data set of 100 play scenarios including child subjects demonstrate 86.88% accuracy recognizing and sequencing the play primitives.",

In this work, we propose a new approach to the problem of generating plans for such household robots. Instead composing them from atomic actions - the common approach in robot planning - we propose to transform task descriptions on web sites like ehow.com into executable robot plans. We present methods for automatically converting the instructions from natural language into a formal, logic-based representation, for resolving the word senses using the WordNet database and the Cyc ontology, and for exporting the generated plans into the mobile robot's plan language RPL. We discuss the problem of inferring information that is missing in these descriptions and the problem of grounding the abstract task descriptions in the perception and action system, and we propose techniques for solving them. The whole system works autonomously without human interaction. It has successfully been tested with a set of about 150 natural language directives, of which up to 80% could be correctly transformed.",

Our method assumes that objects are non-deformable and uses multiple occurrences of an object as the evidence for its existence. We segment input range data by superpixel segmentation and extract features for each segment. We search for a group of segments where each segment matches a segment in another group using a joint compatibility test. The discovered objects are then verified by the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to remove false matches. The presented method was tested on real data of complex objects. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of finding objects that occur multiple times in a scene and distinguish apart those objects of different types.",

Although the idea of using terrain classification algorithms to identify the terrain and then update the control modes is well-established, the problem of how to intelligently update the control modes based on classifications has been left relatively unaddressed. This paper presents a simplistic rule, called the update rule, which decides when to change control modes based on past and present terrain classifications and is tuned using empirical data. Using experimental data from the experimental Unmanned Vehicle (XUV) mobile robot, this update rule is shown here to be both robust to misclassiflcations as well as sensitive to terrain transitions. This paper also develops and implements a sliding horizon approach to reaction-based terrain classification for improved sensitivity to terrain transitions. The update rule structure presented here is applicable to reaction and vision based terrain classification of individual terrains.",

The goal is that the robot can automatically distinguish a target speech from its own speech and other sound sources in a reverberant environment. We focus on the multi-channel semi-blind ICA (MCSB-ICA), which is one of the sound source separation methods with a microphone array, to achieve such an audition system because it can separate sound source signals including reverberations with few assumptions on environments. The evaluation of MCSB-ICA has been limited to robot's speech separation and reverberation separation. In this paper, we evaluate MCSB-ICA extensively by applying it to multi-source separation problems under common reverberant environments. Experimental results prove that MCSB-ICA outperforms conventional ICA by 30 points in automatic speech recognition performance.",

        "abstract": "Telerobotics fundamentally aims to project human skills into a remote, unstructured environment. A key component of human skills is anticipatory modulation of limb impedances in accordance with task requirements and in expectation of events or disturbances. These adjustments occur continually in human interaction strategies, yet are mostly masked in telerobotics by limited bandwidth controllers and fixed impedance hardware. We propose a telerobotic architecture with user-controlled variable impedance and show a single degree of freedom experimental implementation. The master incorporates a grip force sensor as an additional impedance command channel. Since grip force correlates with the user's own impedance, this input provides an intuitive and natural extension to the regular interface. On the slave, a physically variable clutch actuator is used to adjust both low and high frequency impedance. The additional command channel allows the operator to utilize impedance variation strategies to control impact forces and accomplish varying tasks. These natural interaction strategies are simpler and more robust, leading to superior performance and a telerobot which more effectively represents the operator.",

        "abstract": "We propose a 3D obstacle avoidance method for mobile robots. Besides the robot's 2D laser range finder, a Time-of-Flight camera is used to perceive obstacles that are not in the scan plane of the laser range finder. Existing approaches that employ Time-of-Flight cameras suffer from the limited field-of-view of the sensor. To overcome this issue, we mount the camera on the head of our anthropomorphic robot Dynamaid. This allows to change the gaze direction through the robot's pan-tilt neck and its torso yaw joint. The proposed obstacle detection method is robust against kinematic inaccuracies and noise in the range measurements. The gaze controller takes motion blur effects into account and controls the gaze depending on the robot's motion and the obstacles in its vicinity. In experiments, we demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to avoid obstacles that the laser range finder can not perceive. We also compare our active gaze control strategy with a fixed gaze orientation.",

To prove the concept, magnetotaxis-based control has been used to coordinate a swarm made of thousands of these self-propelled natural microrobots to build in a collective effort, a miniature version of an ancient Egyptian pyramid.",

Moreover, the operating conditions for these components might be at odds with goals the robot might have adopted (e.g., through external commands or in the course of the execution of the current task). We argue that the best (if not the only) way to resolve any difficulties that arise from the different requirements at the agent, component and infrastructure levels is to use a common formal logical goal representation for all three layers. We discuss how these representations can be integrated into a complex robotic architecture and demonstrate in an experimental evaluation on a robot how the architecture can recover from a failure situation that it would not have been able to handle without explicit multi-level unified goal representations and their associated monitoring and reasoning processes.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, learning models from data has become an increasingly interesting tool for robotics, as it allows straightforward and accurate model approximation. However, in most robot learning approaches, the model is learned from scratch disregarding all prior knowledge about the system. For many complex robot systems, available prior knowledge from advanced physics-based modeling techniques can entail valuable information for model learning that may result in faster learning speed, higher accuracy and better generalization. In this paper, we investigate how parametric physical models (e.g., obtained from rigid body dynamics) can be used to improve the learning performance, and, especially, how semiparametric regression methods can be applied in this context. We present two possible semiparametric regression approaches, where the knowledge of the physical model can either become part of the mean function or of the kernel in a nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We compare the learning performance of these methods first on sampled data and, subsequently, apply the obtained inverse dynamics models in tracking control on a real Barrett WAM. The results show that the semiparametric models learned with rigid body dynamics as prior outperform the standard rigid body dynamics models on real data while generalizing better for unknown parts of the state space.",

On the other hand, there are also errors, which occur very rarely but with severe effects. These errors influence not only the local accuracy but the overall spatial layout of the map. Concrete examples include bump noise in the robot's pose or residual errors in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Brokenness is presented here to capture one form of structural errors in grid maps. Concretely, brokenness measures the degree with which a map can be partitioned into regions that are locally consistent with ground truth but \u201coff\u201d relative to each other. The concept of brokenness is presented in a formal way and it is shown how it can be computed in an efficient way using recursive spectral registrations. Experimental results show that the metric can indeed be used to automatically determine one structural quality aspect of a map in a quantitative way.",

One such setting is visual search in mobile robotics, where tasks such as finding a mug or stapler require robust recognition. The focus of this paper is on integrating stereo vision with appearance based recognition to increase accuracy and efficiency. We propose a model that utilizes a chamfer-type silhouette classifier which is weighted by a prior on scale, which is robust to missing stereo depth information. Our approach is validated on a set of challenging indoor scenes containing mugs and shoes, where we find that priors remove a significant number of false positives, improving the average precision by 0.2 on each dataset. We additionally experiment with an additional classifer by Felzenszwalb et al. to demonstrate the approach's robustness.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Levitation systems allow delicate objects to be handled without contact by actively controlling a levitation force that suspends the object. A drawback of levitation systems for thin objects is that the lateral force can not be controlled actively and is much weaker than the levitation force. This is a problem for non-contact manipulation systems as the object may loose its alignment with the levitator (and drop) because of the inertial forces coming from the lateral accelerations. In earlier work, a solution was proposed using Tilt Control in which lateral accelerations are compensated by the levitation force by tilting both the object and the levitator. This concept has been verified in an experimental setup that was capable of tilting around only one axis. In this paper, a new and unique design is presented of a tilting actuator that is capable of rotating around two axis, so that full 3D-space manipulation is possible. A key aspect of the Tilt Control strategy is that the center of rotation is at the center of mass of the levitated object and, for the tilting actuator, this means that it should have a remote center of rotation. A spherical cap or dome-shaped structure supported by three ball bearings, is used as the fundamental principle for the tilting actuator design as it has a natural remote center. The design and realization of this tilting actuator are described in this paper and a pilot experiment was carried out in which the tilting actuator, with a magnetic levitator installed, was attached to a linear motor. The results showed successful tilting action as relative lateral motion of the levitated object were significantly reduced on two axis.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a novel method to enhance a family of ICP(iterative closest point) algorithms by updating velocity. Even though ICP algorithms play a dominant role in a model based tracking, it is difficult to avoid an accumulated tracking error during a continuous motion. It is because that typical ICP algorithms assumes that each of the point in one scan are measured simultaneously while most of the available rangefinders measure each point sequentially. Hence conventional ICP algorithms are prone to be erroneous under a fast motion and an accumulated error during the motion cannot be ignored in many cases. In our approach, we estimate a velocity of a rangefinder numerically over ICP iterations. As a result, distortion of a scan due to the motion can be compensated using estimated velocity. In addition, outliers are effectively rejected during the iteration of velocity update, which means that more accurate and robust motion is trackable. Also we verify a performance and an accuracy of our method by demonstrating simulation and real-world experiment results.",

        "abstract": "Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a powerful mathematical framework for making optimal action choices in noisy and/or uncertain environments, in particular, allowing us to merge localization and decision-making for mobile robots. While advancements in POMDP techniques have allowed the use of much larger models, POMDPs for robot navigation are still limited by large state space requirements for even small maps. In this work, we propose a method to automatically generate a POMDP representation of an environment. By using variable resolution decomposition techniques, we can take advantage of characteristics of the environment to minimize the number of states required, while maintaining the level of detail required to find a robust and efficient policy. This is accomplished by automatically adjusting the level of detail required for planning at a given region, with few states representing large open areas, and many smaller states near objects. We validate this algorithm in POMDP simulations, a robot simulator as well as an autonomous robot.",

The hybrid likelihood function for mapping between continuous hidden states and categorical observations are specified via softmax models. Although softmax models avoid discretization of continuous states, they are challenging to implement for real-time data fusion since they are not analytically integrable. An approximation based on variational Bayesian (VB) methods is presented here to obtain fast closed-form Gaussian solutions to the desired posteriors in cases where the hidden continuous states have Gaussian pdfs. A joint human-robot target localization example illustrates the properties and utility of the VB hybrid fusion strategy, which also applies more generally to inference in hybrid Bayesian networks and mixture models.",

A crucial point is the localization of the vehicle, which is especially difficult in unknown, GPS-denied environments. This paper presents a novel vision based approach, where the vehicle is localized using a downward looking monocular camera. A state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera, while, simultaneously, building an incremental map of the surrounding region. Based on this pose estimation a LQG/LTR based controller stabilizes the vehicle at a desired setpoint, making simple maneuvers possible like take-off, hovering, setpoint following or landing. Experimental data show that this approach efficiently controls a helicopter while navigating through an unknown and unstructured environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing a micro aerial vehicle able to navigate through an unexplored environment (independently of any external aid like GPS or artificial beacons), which uses a single camera as only exteroceptive sensor.",

This however, requires, that the robots are able to perceive the articulation models of such objects. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting, tracking, and learning articulation models for cabinet doors and drawers without using artificial markers. Our approach uses a highly efficient and sampling-based approach to rectangle detection in depth images obtained from a self-developed active stereo system. The robot can use the generative models learned for the articulated objects to estimate their articulation type, their current configuration, and to make predictions about possible configurations not observed before. We present experiments carried out on real data obtained from our active stereo system. The results demonstrate that our technique is able to learn accurate articulation models. We furthermore provide a detailed error analysis based on ground truth data obtained in a motion capturing studio.",

        "abstract": "Reliable real-time localization is a key component of autonomous industrial vehicle systems. We consider the problem of using on-board vision to determine a vehicle's pose in a known, but non-static, environment. While feasible technologies exist for vehicle localization, many are not suited for industrial settings where the vehicle must operate dependably both indoors and outdoors and in a range of lighting conditions. We extend the capabilities of an existing vision-based localization system, in a continued effort to improve the robustness, reliability and utility of an automated industrial vehicle system. The vehicle pose is estimated by comparing an edge-filtered version of a video stream to an available 3D edge map of the site. We enhance the previous system by additionally filtering the camera input for straight lines using a Hough transform, observing that the 3D environment map contains only linear features. In addition, we present an automated approach for generating 3D edge maps from laser point clouds, removing the need for manual map surveying and also reducing the time for map generation down from days to minutes. We present extensive localization results in multiple lighting conditions comparing the system with and without the proposed enhancements.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based robotic applications such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), global localization, and autonomous navigation have suffered from problems related to dynamic environments involving moving objects and kidnapping. One of the possible solutions to these problems is to establish robust correspondences when obtaining images from static scenes. Therefore we propose an efficient technique for determining correspondences to recover the current camera pose; in the proposed method, the FAST corner detector and SIFT descriptors are combined because in many methods for vision-based robotic applications, corner features have been adopted since they enable fast computation and simplify the computation of the correspondences between consecutive images. However, to recover the pose of the camera after kidnapping or at an unknown initial position, a robust feature matching algorithm is required because the pose of a camera is unlikely to be the same as the poses in the database images. For this purpose, first, we determine some candidates for correspondences by combining corners with their multiple descriptors computed from previously defined scales, and then we select one of these candidates by optimizing the scale using a variant of the mean-shift algorithm. We apply the proposed matching algorithm to kidnapping and visual occlusion problems in autonomous navigation.",

In this work, we propose, a simple an elegant solution to the image formation model for omnidirectional cameras with parabolic mirrors. We propose the use of conformal geometric algebra (CGA), since the involved transformation operations in the model can be represented as an special group of multivectors. This representation is advantageous since the inversions are linearized, furthermore the transformation can be applied to all the geometric objects of the CGA. In consequence, the paracatadioptric image formation can be simplified, since the procedure is the same for points, point-pairs, lines, or circles. As an application example the control of a nonholonomic mobile robot using paracatadioptric line images and the proposed framework is described.",

The approach is based on the assumption that highly discriminative regions are easily redetectable in subsequent frames as well as in frames visited from different viewpoints. We investigate which feature detectors fit for this purpose and under which conditions the discriminability applies. The approach is tested in a topological localization scenario in which the best feature is tracked over several frames to build landmarks.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the main drawbacks of standard visual EKF-SLAM techniques is the assumption of a general camera motion model. Usually this motion model has been implemented in the literature as a constant linear and angular velocity model. Because of this, most approaches cannot deal with sudden camera movements, causing them to lose accurate camera pose and leading to a corrupted 3D scene map. In this work we propose increasing the robustness of EKF-SLAM techniques by replacing this general motion model with a visual odometry prior, which provides a real-time relative pose prior by tracking many hundreds of features from frame to frame. We perform fast pose estimation using the two-stage RANSAC-based approach from [1]: a two-point algorithm for rotation followed by a one-point algorithm for translation. Then we integrate the estimated relative pose into the prediction step of the EKF. In the measurement update step, we only incorporate a much smaller number of landmarks into the 3D map to maintain real-time operation. Incorporating the visual odometry prior in the EKF process yields better and more robust localization and mapping results when compared to the constant linear and angular velocity model case. Our experimental results, using a handheld stereo camera as the only sensor, clearly show the benets of our method against the standard constant velocity model.",

During a learning phase, the rover is piloted along a route capturing stereo images. The images are processed into a manifold map of topologically-connected submaps that may be used for localization during an autonomous repeat traverse. Path following in non-planar terrain is handled by moving from localization in three dimensions, to path following in two dimensions using a local ground plane associated with each submap. The use of small submaps decouples the computational complexity of route repeating from the length of the path. We validate the algorithm by demonstrating its performance on a difficult three-dimensional route. Using this technique, a rover may autonomously traverse a multi-kilometer route in unstructured, three-dimensional terrain, without an accurate global reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of mobile robot localization using a novel compact representation of visual landmarks. With recent progress in lifelong map-learning as well as in information sharing networks, compact representation of a large-size landmark database has become crucial. In this paper, we propose a compact binary code (e.g. 32bit code) landmark representation by employing the semantic hashing technique from web-scale image retrieval. We show how well such a binary representation achieves compactness of a landmark database while maintaining efficiency of the localization system. In our contribution, we investigate the cost-performance, the semantic gap, the saliency evaluation using the presented techniques as well as challenge to further reduce the resources (#bits) per landmark. Experiments using a high-speed car-like robot show promising results.",

        "abstract": "Shape control of continuum robots requires a means of sensing the the curved shape of the robot. Since continuum robots are deformable, they take on shapes that are general curves in space, which are not fully defined by actuator positions. Vision-based shape-estimation provides a promising avenue for shape-sensing. While this is often facilitated by fiducial markers, sometimes fiducials are not feasible due to either the robot's application or its size. To address this, we present a robust and efficient stereo-vision-based, shape-sensing algorithm for continuum robots that does not rely on fiducials or assume orthogonal camera placement. The algorithm employs self-organizing maps to triangulate three-dimensional backbone curves. Experiments with an object with a known shape demonstrate an average accuracy of 1.53 mm on a 239 mm arc length curve.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with visual servoing from three points. Using the geometric properties of the spherical projection of points, a new decoupled set of six visual features is proposed. The main originality lies in the use of the distances between spherical projection of points to define three features that are invariant to camera rotations. The three other features present a linear link with respect to camera rotations. In comparison with the classical perspective coordinates of points, the new decoupled set does not present more singularities. In addition, using the new set in its non-singular domain, a classical control law is proven to be ideal for rotational motions. These theoretical results as well as the robustness to errors of the new decoupled control scheme are illustrated through simulation results.",

We propose a tracking and segmentation algorithm in which tracking and segmentation are performed consecutively. We separate input images into disjoint patches using an efficient oversegmentation algorithm. Objects and their background are described by bags of patches. We classify the patches in a new frame by searching k nearest neighbors. K-d trees are constructed using these patches to reduce computational complexity. Target location is estimated coarsely by running the mean-shift algorithm. Based on the estimated locations, we classify the patches again using appearance and spatial information. This strategy out-performs direct segmentation of patches based on appearance information only. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides good performance on difficult sequences with clutter.",

        "abstract": "Particle filters have been used for visual tracking during long periods because they enable effective estimation for non-linear and non-Gaussian distributions. However, particle filter-based tracking approaches suffer from occlusion and deformation of the target objects, which result in the large difference between the current observations and the target model. Thus, we present a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)-based tracking algorithm that effectively estimates the joint distribution for the target state and the target model; in the proposed method, the target object is tracked by using the particle filter while the target model is simultaneously updated on the basis of the on-line approximation of a mixture of Gaussians. To ensure the robustness to occlusion, we represent the target model by 16 orientation histograms that are spatially divided, and individually update each histogram through a video sequence. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method under occlusion and deformation of the target objects.",

The 3D coordinates and orientation of the vein that the algorithm detects would eventually be fed to a robot for insertion of the IV needle. The goal of the algorithm is to identify venous bifurcations and determine an insertion point and approach angle for the needle in between their branches. The algorithm uses an annular tracking window that tracks along the veins and searches for bifurcations. We describe methods for centering the initial bifurcation estimates, error-checking, and positioning the needle exactly in between the bifurcation branches. We conclude with an experimental study of 50 subjects that shows a 32.4% success rate at detecting all bifurcations and a 82.6% success rate at finding at least one bifurcation in each image that contains bifurcations.",

        "abstract": "Robust feature extraction within 3D environments is a crucial requirement for many autonomous robotic and tracking applications. 3D Laser range finders and cameras provide extremely rich data about an environment. However, the algorithms which attempt to compress the vast data sets produced by these sensors into features, tend to be fragile in the presence of sensor noise, or computationally expensive. This paper presents a 3D feature extraction technique which greatly compresses 3D range data based on principal component analysis (PCA). PCA can provide a greatly compressed vector set, representing the dominant directions of data points, thus grouping them into planes or lines. It is shown however, that the naive application of PCA to full, 3D, point cloud data sets, results in a poor representation of the dominant data directions. Therefore, a combination of a panoramic camera and 3D laser range finder is used to extract robust planes from 3D range data. The panoramic camera image is first filtered with the Mean Shift algorithm to smooth segments within it, whilst preserving the integrity of the segment edges. These segments are then used to guide the PCA, through an approximate image to range space calibration, to act on the corresponding individual segments of range data. The application of PCA to segmented subsets of 3D point cloud data sets, will be shown to be robust for the detection of planes in both indoor and urban, outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a solution to decentralized Voronoi coverage in non-convex polygonal environments. We show that complications arise when existing approaches to Voronoi coverage are applied for deploying a group of robots in non-convex environments. We present an algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. Our algorithm combines classical Voronoi coverage with the Lloyd algorithm and the local path planning algorithm TangentBug to compute the motion of the robots around obstacles and corners. We present the algorithm and prove convergence and optimality. We also discuss experimental results from an implementation with five robots.",

        "abstract": "We studied the feasibility of estimating walking speed using two shank-mounted accelerometers. Our approach took advantage of the inverted pendulum-like behavior of the stance leg during walking to identify a new method for dividing up walking into individual stride cycles and estimating the initial conditions for the direct integration of the accelerometer signals. To test its accuracy, we compared speed to known values during treadmill walking. The speed estimation method worked well across treadmill speeds yielding a root mean square speed estimation error of only 8%. This accuracy is comparable to that achieved from shank-mounted inertial measurement unit, providing a robust and low-cost alternative in using accelerometer for walking speed estimation. Shank-mounted accelerometer may be of great benefit for estimating speed in walking for the embedded control of knee-mounted devices such as prostheses and energy harvesters.",

Activity recognition is treated as a classification problem and the multi-class classifier is often used. Though the multi-class classifier can obtain high classification accuracy, it can not detect the noise activities and unknown activities, and the system has no extendable recognition capability. In this paper, we proposed a recognition system which can recognize known activities and detect unknown activities simultaneously. For each known activity, one one-class classification model is built up and the combined one-class classification models are used to judge whether a test sample belongs to known activities. For the known samples, the multi-class classifier is used to recognize their types. For the continuous unknown samples, based on segmentation algorithm, training samples of new activities are extracted and added into the recognition system to extend the system's recognition capability.",

Joint forces and moments experienced by a human user during motion must be minimized to ensure safety. Trajectory planning and control of cable-driven exoskeletons is challenging due to the unique property that cables can transmit forces only in tension. This paper introduces the design of a 4-DOF cable-driven upper arm exoskeleton and schemes for trajectory planning and control. Simulations show that in most cases a feasible point-to-point trajectory can be generated while minimizing reaction joint forces and moments.",

Second-order conic friction constraints are not linearized, as in many previous works. The force distributions are smooth and rapidly computable, and they enable flexibility in selecting between firm, stable grasps or looser, more efficient grasps. Furthermore, fingers can be disengaged and re-engaged in a smooth manner, which is a critical capability for a large number of manipulation tasks. We present efficient solution methods that do not incur the increased computational complexity associated with solving the Semi-Definite Programming formulations presented in previous works. We present results from static and dynamic simulations which demonstrate the flexibility and computational efficiency associated with WBF force distributions.",

The framework comprises two components: 1) Generalized Inverse Dynamics (GID) that determines joint forces satisfying multiple objectives considering task priorities and various constraints and 2) the Idealized Joint Unit (IJU) that generates accurate torque with assigned apparent inertia and viscosity. GID treats the robot as a single manipulator with multiple branches using a joint model with 2-DOF motion subspace equivalent to two opposing wheels. A 21-DOF mobile robot equipped with IJUs is set up and GID is applied to it. The result shows that GID works well in the examples of physical human-robot interaction and object manipulation where motion objectives are attained coordinating the whole body while keeping passivity due to the redundancy and the assigned impedance property.",

The dynamic filter is applicable for general upper-body motions when standing in place. It is characterized by modification of the commanded torso acceleration based on a geometric solution to produce a ZMP which is inside the support. The resulting feasible modified motion is synchronized to the reference motion when the computed ZMP for the reference motion again falls within the support. Contact forces at each foot are controlled through a dedicated force distribution module which optimizes the ankle roll and pitch torques. The proposed approach uses time-local information and is therefore targeted for online control. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by means of simulated experiments on a model of the Honda humanoid robot ASIMO using a highly dynamic upper-body reference motion.",

We model the world as a WiFi signature map with geometric constraints and introduce a continuous perceptual model of the environment generated from the discrete graph-based WiFi signal strength sampling. We contribute our WiFi localization algorithm which continuously uses the perceptual model to update the robot location in conjunction with its odometry data. We then briefly introduce a navigation approach that robustly uses the WiFi location estimates. We present the results of our exhaustive tests of the WiFi localization independently and in conjunction with the navigation of our custom-built mobile robot in extensive long autonomous runs.",

        "abstract": "We discuss disciplinary barriers which have traditionally prevented robotics from significantly impacting the built (architectural) environment we inhabit. Specifically, we describe the implementation of, and lessons learned from, a multidisciplinary graduate-level course in Architectural Robotics. The results from class interactions and projects provide insight into novel ways in which robotics expertise can be effectively leveraged in architecture. Conversely, our outcomes suggest ways in which the knowledge and perspective of architects could stimulate significant innovations in robotics.",
