        "abstract": "This paper presents a system of 3-D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using monocular vision-based on the structure-from-motion scheme. An crucial issue in applying structure-from-motion to SLAM is that accuracy depends heavily on the baseline distance. We address this problem by selecting an appropriate baseline based on criteria for the tradeoff between the baseline distance and the number of feature points visible in the images. Experimental results show that full 3-D sparse maps with camera trajectory were built from images captured with a handy camera.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional (3-D) measurement method of objects in aquatic environments whose refractive indices or boundary shape of the refraction are unknown with a laser range finder. When applying vision sensors to measuring objects in liquid, we meet the problem of an image distortion. It is caused by the refraction of the light on the boundary between the air and the liquid, and the distorted image brings errors in a triangulation for the range measurement. Therefore, 3-D measurement of objects in liquid requires a geometrical analysis that takes refraction effects into account. In the analysis, it is indispensable to know the boundary shapes that have discontinuity of refractive indices, and refractive index of liquid. Our proposed method takes refraction effects into account and estimates these unknown parameters to measure accurate 3-D shapes of objects in liquid. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The execution of positioning tasks by using image-based visual servoing can be easier if a trajectory planning mechanism exists. This paper deals with the problem of generating image plane trajectories (a trajectory is made of a path plus a time law) for tracked points in an eye-in-hand system which has to be positioned with respect to a fixed object. The generated image plane paths must be feasible i.e. they must be compliant with rigid body motion of the camera with respect to the object so as to avoid image jacobian singularities and local minima problems. In addition, the image plane trajectories must generate camera velocity screws which are smooth and within the allowed bounds of the robot. We show that a scaled 3D motion planning algorithm can be devised in order to generate feasible image plane trajectories.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Typical robot development requires that hardware be mostly functional before significant software development begins. Utilizing virtual prototype of hardware and its environment can reduce development time and manufacturing cost. Virtual prototyping is, however, a highly challenging task requiring in-depth knowledge in many disciplines. Few of simulation tools developed to alleviate this difficulty fully manage the complexity caused by the fact that developer must design and manage form (physical shape), function, and behavior altogether incrementally. Also, such simulation tools often do not support co-development of the target software and its test environment from requirements analysis to implementation. In this paper, we present our experience of developing a virtual prototype of Samsung Home Robot (SHR) with Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) using ASADAL/OBJ. Virtual prototyping in ASADAL/OBJ enables incremental co-development of both target system and its test environment in an object-oriented way. Furthermore ASADAL/OBJ facilitates concurrent development of form, behavior, and function. These features increase productivity as well as confidence through incremental refinement and validation. We give a brief background on the ASADAL/OBJ framework, then illuminate our experience of developing a virtual prototype of SHR.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a new approach to 3D shape acquisition. This implementation enables a robot arm to move the scan unit over the object without the scan unit being tracked. The chosen structured light approach uses an initially unknown white noise pattern that can easily be projected with any fixed pattern projection system. Object points are acquired on the basis of finding correspondences in the pattern in the camera image of the current scene. This is achieved by using a fast SSD correlation algorithm. In the current test setup we are using a standard video beamer and a standard digital camera, but we have also set up a scan head for fixation on a robots\u2019 wrist. The special requirements of this miniaturized system will be explained as well as our implementation. Our approach reduces hardware complexity to a minimum using only one calibrated camera and one calibrated fixed pattern projector. In this paper we present the whole system also including the calibration procedure. The focus will be on the hardware setup, but we also give an introduction to the software methods used.",

        "abstract": "There has shown a significant interest in a high performance of, at the same time, a compact size and low cost of, 3D sensor, in reflection of a growing need of 3D environmental sensing for service robotics. One of the important requirements associated with such a 3D sensor is that sensing does not irritate or disturb human in any way while working in close and continuous contact with human. Furthermore, such a 3D sensor should be reliable and robust to the change of environmental illumination as service robots are required to work day and night. This paper presents a 3D IR camera with variable structured light that is human friendly and robust enough for application to home service robots. Infrared is chosen as the sensing medium in order to meet the requirement of human friendliness and robustness to illumination change. A Digital Mirror Device (DMD) is employed to generate and project variable patterns at a high speed for real-time operation. In implementation, we emphasize the integration of modular components to support real-time sensing and compactness in size. A number of real-world experimentations are conducted, including a human face, a statue, and a plastic model. The experimental results have demonstrated that the implemented 3D IR Camera is robust to illumination change, in addition to its advantage of human friendliness.",

Using this basis, some features can be easily added like aerial mapping, object recognition, homing strategies or takeoff and landing. Here we present a biologically based control layer for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that provides course stabilization, altitude and drift control, and collision avoidance.

        "abstract": "Balance maintenance and upright posture recovery under unexpected environmental forces are key requirements for safe and successful co-existence of humanoid robots in normal human environments. In this paper we present a two-phase control strategy for robust balance maintenance under a force disturbance. The first phase, called the reflex phase, is designed to withstand the immediate effect of the force. The second phase is the recovery phase where the system is steered back to a statically stable \u201chome\u201d posture. The reflex control law employs angular momentum and is characterized by its counter-intuitive quality of \u201cyielding\u201d to the disturbance. The recovery control employs a general scheme of seeking to maximize the potential energy and is robust to local ground surface feature. Biomechanics literature indicates a similar strategy in play during human balance maintenance.",

Design aspects covered here include the freely rotating hip joint with angle bisecting mechanism; freely rotating knee joints with latches; direct actuation of the ankles with a spring, release mechanism, and reset motor; wide feet that are shaped to aid lateral stability; and the simple control algorithm. The biomechanics context of this robot is discussed in more detail in [1], and movies of the robot walking are available at Science Online and http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~ruina/powerwalk.html. This robot adds evidence to the idea that passive-dynamic approaches might help design walking robots that are simpler, more efficient and easier to control.",

        "abstract": "The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of the stitching task in laparoscopic surgery using a circular needle and a conventional 4 DOFs needle-holder. This task is particularly difficult for the surgeons because of the kinematics constraints introduced by the trocar. So as to assist the surgeons, we propose to compute possible pathes for the needle through the tissues, which limits as much as possible tissues deformations while driving the needle towards the desired target. The article proposes a kinematic analysis and a geometric modeling of the stitching task. Based on this, some simple but useful information can be obtained to help the surgeon. The description of the task with well-chosen state variables allows to simply express the path planning problem. Conditions for the existence of acceptable pathes are given and a method to compute possible pathes is presented. Resulting pathes are shown to be satisfactory even under awkward configurations.",

A computational neural network model based on the structure of the LGMD and its afferent inputs is also able to detect approaching objects. In order for the LGMD network to be used as a robust collision detector for robotic applications, we proposed a new mechanism to enhance the feature of colliding objects before the excitations are gathered by LGMD cell. The new model favours grouped excitation but tends to ignore isolated excitation with selective passing coefficients. Experiments with a Khepera robot showed the proposed collision detector worked in real time in an arena surrounded with blocks.",

        "abstract": "The present work deals with manipulator arms characterized by the presence of an internal, totally distributed, embedded control system. More specifically, every single joint is assumed to be equipped with a simple local processing unit devoted to properly drive its motion, thus allowing to consider each pair constituted by a single joint and the associated link as a defective \u201c1-dof-only\u201d, separately controlled, atomic manipulator. In this perspective, the paper proposes an effective, computationally distributed, control technique that, based on a repeated data exchange among the processing units, establishes a global self-organizing behaviour among the joints which allows to control the motion of the end-effector of the overall arm in the operational space, by solely exploiting the control capabilities of every local processing unit, while not requiring any centralized global knowledge about the overall arm geometry and kinematics.",

The core of the project described in this paper is the fabrication of a compliant under-actuated prosthetic hand: the structure of the hand (both palm and fingers) is moulded as a soft polymeric single part with compliant joints and embedded tendon driven underactuated mechanism for providing adaptive grasp. In order to make user trials, the hand is equipped with simple but functional EMG-based control of the single motor incorporated in the hand, and is integrated with a prosthesis socket. The paper presents the biomechatronics design, the fabrication process, the integration of the prosthetic device and first experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the multi-robot boundary coverage problem, wherein a group of k robots must inspect every point on the boundary of a 2-dimensional test environment. Using a simplified sensor model, this inspection problem is converted to an equivalent graph representation. In this representation, the coverage problem can be posed as the k-Rural Postman Problem (kRPP). We present a constructive heuristic which finds a solution to the kRPP, then use that solution to plan the robots\u2019 inspection routes. These routes provide complete coverage of the boundary and also balance the inspection load across the k robots. Simulations illustrate the algorithm\u2019s performance and characteristics.",

A passivity study of this problem is presented, which relates the maximum achievable wall stiffness to the system discretization and sampling delays, to the quantization of the encoder, to the inertia of the haptic device, as well as to both the natural viscous and Coulomb damping present in the haptic device. The resulting stability criterion generalizes previously known results. Its analytic derivation is verified in both simulation and experiments on a one degree of freedom testbed.",

        "abstract": "Deformable object tracking is used in many robotics applications including biomanipulation, vision-based force sensing, and the control of deformable structures. A tracking algorithm that is robust to occlusions and to spurious edges is essential since these situations can arise unexpectedly in the unstructured environments in which robots must operate. This paper presents a deformable object tracking algorithm that is robust to occlusion and to spurious edges. Robust statistical methods are used to handle occlusion and a modification of the Canny edge detector is presented to handle spurious edges. The modification of the Canny edge operator makes use of information about the object being tracked in order to eliminate spurious edges. The deformable object tracking algorithm's performance is evaluated visually and quantitively by tracking a four degree-of-freedom compliant gripper.",

Based on an approximate dynamical biped model whose mass is concentrated to COG, general solution of the equation of motion is analytically obtained. Dynamical constraint on the external reaction force due to the underactuation is resolved by boundary condition relaxation, namely, by admitting some error between the desired and actually reached state. It potentially creates responsive motion which requires strong instantaneous acceleration by accepting discontinuity of ZMP trajectory, which is designed as an exponential function. A semi-automatic continuous gait planning is also presented. It generates physically feasible referential trajectory of the whole-body only from the next desired foot placement. The validity of proposed is ensured through both simulations and experiments with a small anthropomorphic robot.",

Such angular momentum can easily cause the humanoid to fall down onto the ground. We use an Angular Momentum inducing inverted Pendulum Model (AMPM), which is an enhanced version of the 3D linear inverted pendulum model to model the robot dynamics. Because the AMPM allows us to explicitly calculate the angular momentum generated by the ground reaction force, it is possible to calculate a counteracting motion that compensates for the angular momentum generated by external perturbations in real-time.",

Consequently, a flexible infrastructure for controlling module operation and data exchange between modules is proposed, taking into account insights from software system integration. This is achieved by combining a three-layer control architec ture containing a flexible control component with a powerful communication framework. The use of XML throughout the whole infrastructure facilitates ongoing evolutionary develop ment of the robot companion's capabilities.",

        "abstract": "With the development of biped robots, systems became able to navigate in a 3 dimensional world, walking up and down stairs, or climbing over small obstacles. We present a method for obtaining a labeled 2.5D grid map of the robot's surroundings. Each cell is marked either as floor or obstacle and contains a value telling the height of the floor or obstacle. Such height maps are useful for path planning and collision avoidance. The method uses a novel combination of a 3D occupancy grid for robust sensor data interpretation and a 2.5D height map for fine resolution floor values. We evaluate our approach using stereo vision on the humanoid robot QRIO and show the advantages over previous methods. Experimental results from navigation runs on an obstacle course demonstrate the ability of the method to generate detailed maps for autonomous navigation.",

Until now, this characteristic was observed on some underactuated fingers for some very specific configurations only (mainly when the phalanxes were lined up). With the proposed finger, this characteristic remains true whatever the configuration of the phalanxes is.",

First, we review the basic properties of the Special Euclidean group SE(3), Lie subgroups and submanifolds of SE(3). With low dimensional subgroups and submanifolds providing models for the so called primitive generators, the high dimensional subgroups and regular submanifolds provide models for the set of desired end-effector motions. Two important classes of regular submanifolds of SE(3) are studied in detail. Then, starting from a given list of primitive generators, we give a rigorous definition of the synthesis problem for a serial manipulator subchain, and develop a general procedure for solving the synthesis problem when the set of desired end-effector motions is a Lie subgroup or a regular submanifold.",

Dialogue may be beneficial to the robot to increase the flexibility and facility of the interaction. Traditional robots have merely dealt with simple queries like commands, but in conversation people often omit some words because of the background knowledge or the context of the conversation. Since environments contain various uncertainties, managing the context of a dialogue or the uncertainties should be necessary to support smarter service robots. In order to establish a natural communication between people and robots, we have been investigating the use of mixed-initiative interaction that prompts for missing concepts and clarifies for spurious concepts. Hierarchically designed Bayesian networks are presented for the mixed-initiative interaction. A simulation and a real robot are constructed for the demonstration of the proposed method, and experiments also show the usefulness.",

The task of tracking multiple objects in a sensor network is challenging due to constraints on a sensor node such as short communication and sensing ranges, a limited amount of memory and limited computational power. In addition, since a sensor network surveillance system needs to operate autonomously without human operators, it requires an autonomous tracking algorithm which can track an unknown number of targets. In this paper, we develop a scalable hierarchical multiple-target tracking algorithm that is autonomous and robust against transmission failures, communication delays and sensor localization error.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the application of high control authority piezoelectric stack actuators, in short piezostack actuators, for active vibration control of long-reach robotic manipulators is studied. The idea is to include piezostack actuators in the base structure in order to strengthen its stiffness characteristics. A mechanism is designed for converting the force produced by a piezostack actuator to a bending moment. A flexible link actuated with a piezostack actuator is built and mathematically modeled. The solution of the governing partial differential equation with non-homogenous boundary conditions is obtained. A comparison between experimental frequency response of the system and its model is given. A control law using the Popov criterion is obtained and experimental results for closed-loop system are given.",

Without knowing the mass and the position of the center of gravity of the object, the humanoid robot carries a heavy object stably by using the force sensor information attached at the wrists and the ankles. We first show how to generate the motion of a humamoid robot by taking the force sensor information into consideration. We also show the method for generating the gait pattern by taking the dynamics of the carried object. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments.",

Typical research and commercial platforms have limited autonomy within these environments and generally require tethers and significant external infrastructure. This paper outlines the development of a new robotic vehicle for underwater monitoring and surveying in highly unstructured environments and presents experimental results illustrating the vehicle\u2019s performance. The hybrid AUV design developed by the CSIRO robotic reef monitoring team realises a compromise between endurance, manoeuvrability and functionality. The vehicle represents a new era in AUV design specifically focused at providing a truly low-cost research capability that will progress environmental monitoring through unaided navigation, cooperative robotics, sensor network distribution and data harvesting.",

Joint-to-joint mapping, pose mapping and point-to-point mapping are three commonly used methods for telemanipulation. However, these methods might not produce satisfactory performance if the robot hand is non-anthropomorphic. This paper introduces a method for mapping based on the relative positions between fingertips. An algorithm particularly for a three-fingered non-anthropomorphic robot hand is presented. The principle of the method is to find suitable parameters in the hand frame, to transform them to the robot frame, and then to compute the robot fingertip positions according to the transformed parameters. The mapping results and the comparisons with the traditional methods validate the advantages of the proposed method.",

Especially large scale environments, where the robot trajectory loops back on itself, are a challenge. In this paper we introduce a new solution to this problem of closing the loop. Our algorithm is EM-based, but differs from previous work. The key is a probability distribution over partitions of feature tracks that is determined in the E-step, based on the current estimate of the motion. This virtual structure is then used in the M-step to obtain a better estimate for the motion. We demonstrate the success of our algorithm in experiments on real laser data.",

Unfortunately these guidelines may conflict with other design objectives (reflected mass, balancing, dexterity) as well as with specifications given by users and applications. For haptic interfaces based on tendon driven actuation it is highly important to achieve an accurate model of friction losses in the transmission system, in order to be able to compensate for them through an active control. In this paper it is reported a method for modeling and control complex tendon transmissions used for driving haptic devices and robots. The presented approach can operate in realtime with very low complexity; it is applicable to all kinds of serial manipulators and provides enough flexibility to allow identification of parameters and modeling of distributed friction phenomena all along the transmission. The approach has been implemented and tested on a 4 DOF exoskeleton system, the PERCRO L-EXOS.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Soft robots inspired from natural systems are one of the main research topics in the robotic field since the last decade. Accordingly, artificial muscles were widely investigated due to their potentials in soft machines or soft robots. Many types of artificial muscles have been developed, including pneumatic actuators, ion-exchange polymer composite actuators, polymer gels, shape memory alloys, and so on. However, these artificial muscles are not used as practical actuators. In this study, the authors propose a new type of micro artificial muscle actuator (< 1 cm3) utilizing an electro-conjugate fluid (ECF) which generates a powerful jet flow when subjected to a high voltage (~ kV). The actuator basically consists of a fiber-reinforced silicone rubber tube and a micro pressure source using the ECF. The inner pressure of the silicone rubber tube is increased by the jet flow generated at the pressure source. The silicone rubber tube contracts along the actuator axis with the increasing pressure. The driving characteristics of the micro artificial muscle actuator were experimentally investigated. The experimental results show that this new actuation technology yields great potentials for driving soft robots.",

        "abstract": "In swarm robotics research, instead of using large size robots, it is often desirable to have multiple small size robots for saving valuable work space and making the maintainance of the robots easier. Also, the implementation costs of a miniature robot is lower because of simpler mechanical design. In this paper, we present a novel modular miniature mobile robot designed for swarm robotics research. The sensor set of the robot includes a color stereo camera system with two CMOS cameras and DSP, allowing each robot to do sophisticated stereo image processing on-board. The modular design permits the addition of new modules into the system. The modules communicate using three serial buses (SPI, I2C, and UART), which enable flexible, adaptive, and fast inter-module data exchange. The robot is developed for swarm robotics research with the aim to provide a low-cost and low-power miniature mobile robot with capabilities typically found only in large size robots.",

This paper introduces a model-based measurement framework for improving calibration procedures of machine tools. The goal is to precisely estimate the mechanical deficiencies based on a minimal number of measurements. For that purpose, the mechanical deficiencies of linear and rotary joints are modeled using splines. Uncertainties of the deficiency model are formulated stochastically, which allows incorporation of imprecise measurement data and prediction of optimal measurement parameters. We derive a method for optimally estimating a set of splines, i.e., joint errors, based on a set of measurements and for predicting the optimal joint configuration for new measurements.",

Usually, exploration strategies work greedily by evaluating a number of candidate observation positions on the basis of a utility function and selecting the best one. The utility functions are defined in an ad hoc manner as the compositionof values measuring different features of a candidate observation position, such as the travelling cost and the estimated information gain. In this paper, we propose a more general way to define an exploration strategy through multi-objective optimization. In our approach, the values of the features are kept separated without combining them in a particular utility function. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

The main contributions of this paper include: 1) A novel approach to how we use the two extremities of straight-lines as features. By taking into account the measurement uncertainties associated with the locations of the extracted extremities of the straight-line, our approach can compare correctly two straight-lines of different lengths. 2) Our use of a test of mean criterion for initiating backtracking and our use of a variable threshold on the output of this criterion that makes nil-matching more effective. We have tested our tracking algorithm with image sequences containing highly cluttered backgrounds. The system successfully tracks objects even when they are highly occluded.",

In case of human-robot interaction, its vision system has to manage such difficult problems as pose variations, illumination changes, and complex backgrounds, which is caused by the mobility of robot. In this paper, in order to overcome such difficult problems, we suggest a facial feature detection method based on local image area and direct pixel-intensity distributions, in which we propose two novel concepts; the directional template for evaluating intensity distributions and the edge-like blob map with multiple strength intensity. Using this proposed blob map, we show that the locations of major facial features \u2013 two eyes and a mouth \u2013 can be successfully estimated. Without the information of facial area boundary, final candidate face region is determined by both obtained locations of facial features and weighted correlations with stored facial templates. Our approach is also a flexible algorithm that can be applicable to both color and gray image. In case of color image, faster detection of both facial features and face is feasible by using the chromatic property of facial color. Experimental results from many color images and well-known gray level face database images prove the usefulness of proposed algorithm in human\u2013 robot interaction applications.",

This formalism is based upon a particular representation of the stratification of the configuration space of the articulated object by means of oriented matroid theory. A stratification is a decomposition of a set into a collection of manifolds which in our case correspond to the different contact states between the articulated object and the environment. In the representation of the stratification of the configuration space using oriented matroid theory the topological properties of the different strata are represented at a purely combinatorial level. An algorithm to enumerate the existing strata and to find the adjacency relationships among them is proposed. It will be shown that the symbolic computation based on oriented matroids simplifies and in some cases even replaces the computation with coordinates.",

        "abstract": "This paper newly proposes the four-fingered robot hand with dual turning mechanism where two and two other fingers can independently rotate inner and outer circles with the common center, respectively. Due to this mechanical configuration, it has the particular rotating axis where the manipulation around the axis can be completely decomposed into the velocity control around the axis and the internal force control in the contact plane. We achieved a manipulation task around the axis with the time of 0.8[sec] for one rotation, while it is relatively slow for another axis.",

The potential energy stored in an elastic body as a result of a deformation caused by an external force is propagated among mass points by the principle of heat conduction. An improved heat conduction model is developed for propagating the energy generated by the external force in a natural manner. A method is presented to derive the internal forces from the potential energy distribution. This methodology not only deals with large-range deformation, but also accommodates both isotropic and anisotropic materials by simply changing thermal conductivity constants. Examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.",

Inspired by pheromone from ants algorithm, a new pheromone as Inter-stimulus between robots in the model is introduced to the algorithm.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new algorithm for the efficient mass-matrix inversion of serial manipulators. Whereas several well-known O(n) algorithms already exist, our presentation is an alternative and completely different formulation that builds on Fixman\u2019s theorem from the polymer physics literature. The main contributions here are therefore adding a new perspective to the manipulator dynamics literature and providing an alternative to existing algorithms. The essence of this theory is to consider explicitly the band-diagonal structure of the inverted mass matrix of a manipulator with no constraints on link length, offsets or twist angles, and then build in constraints by appropriate partitioning of the inverse of the unconstrained mass matrix. We present the theory of the partitioned mass matrix and inverse of the mass matrix for serial revolute manipulators. The planar N-link manipulator with revolute joints is used to illustrate the procedure. Numerical results verify the O(n) complexity of the algorithm. Exposure of the robotics community to this approach may lead to new ways of thinking about manipulator dynamics and control.",

In addition, the robotic device can be reconfigured from a range of motion (ROM)/strengthening exercise device to a balance/proprioception exercise device by simply incorporating additional plate. Further, the action of the device is two folded in the sense that while a patient\u2019s foot is fastened firmly to the ROM/strengthening device for task specific training, s/he can also stand on the balance/proproception device. The suggested ankle rehabilitation robot is expected to substitute not only the traditional therapy in various exercise modes but also supply the advanced functional exercises.",

First, a liveness characterization is introduced, establishing how deadlocks can be studied in terms of circular waits. Second, we show how a circular wait situation corresponds to a particular marking related to a siphon of the Petri net model. Finally, this last characterization is used to obtain an iterative method that successively forbids deadlock related states, synthesizing the control necessary to ensure a final live behavior. The method can be implemented by means of the solutions of a set of integer linear programming problems.",

The algorithm is an extension of a previous algorithm developed for 3-DOF joints. While 3-DOF joints result in a very straightforward potential minimization algorithm, 2-DOF joints are obviously more practical for active operations. The proposed approach computes repulsive force and torque between charged objects by using generalized potential model. A collision-free path can be obtained by locally adjusting the robot configuration to search for minimum potential config urations using these force and torque. The optimization of path safeness, through the innovative potential minimization algorithm, makes the proposed approach unique. In order to speedup the computation, a sequential planning strategy is adopted.

        "abstract": "For the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem several efficient algorithms have been proposed that make use of a sparse information matrix representation (e.g. SEIF, TJTF, treemap). Since the exact SLAM information matrix is dense, these algorithm have to approximate it (sparsification). It has been empirically observed that this approximation is adequate because entries in the matrix corresponding to distant landmarks are extremely small. This paper provides a theoretical proof for this observation, specifically showing that the off-diagonal entries corresponding to two landmarks decay exponentially with the distance traveled between observation of first and second landmark.",

This system was used to investigate how different methods of performance error feedback can lead to faster and more complete motor learning in individuals asked to compensate for a novel visuo-motor transformation (a 30 degree rotation). Four groups of human subjects were asked to reach with their unseen arm to visual targets surrounding a central starting location. A cursor tracking hand motion was provided during each reach. For one group of subjects, deviations from the \u201cideal\u201d compensatory hand movement (i.e. trajectory errors) were amplified with a gain of 2 whereas another group was provided visual feedback with a gain of 3.1. Yet another group was provided cursor feedback wherein the cursor was rotated by an additional (constant) offset angle. We compared the rates at which the hand paths converged to the steady-state trajectories. Our results demonstrate that error-augmentation can improve the rate and extent of motor learning of visuomotor rotations in healthy subjects. Furthermore, our results suggest that both error amplification and offset-augmentation may facilitate neuro-rehabilitation strategies that restore function in brain injuries such as stroke.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to automatic segmentation of the foreground objects from the sequence of images by integrating techniques of background subtraction and motion-based segmentation. At first, a background model is built to represent information of both color and motion of the background scene. Based on temporal and spatial information, an initial partition of each image is obtained. Next, we formulate the classification problem as a graph labeling over a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on Markov random fields (MRFs) statistical framework. The Bhattacharyya distance for estimating the similarity between color and motion distributions of the background model and the currently obtained regions are used to model the likelihood energies. The object tracking strategy for finding the correspondence between region at different time instant is used to maintain the temporal coherence of the segmentation. For spatial coherence, the length of the common boundaries of two regions is taken into consideration for classification. Both spatial and temporal coherence are incorporated into the prior energy to maintain the continuity of the segmentation. Finally, a labeling is obtained by maximizing a posterior probability of the MRFs. Under such formulation, we integrate two different kinds of framework in an elegant way to make the foreground detection become more accurate. Experimental results for two image sequences including the hall monitoring and our e-home demo site are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the application of a neural approach in the control of a 7-DOF robotic head. The inverse kinematics problem is addressed, for the control of the gaze fixation point of two cameras mounted on the robotic head. The proposed approach is based on a biologically-inspired model, which replicates the human brain capability of creating associations between motor and sensory data, by learning. The model is implemented here by self organizing neural maps. During learning, the system creates relations between the motor data associated to endogenous movements performed by the robotic head and the sensory consequences of such motor actions, i.e. the final position of the gaze fixation point. The learnt relations are stored in the neural map structure and are then used, after learning, for generating motor commands aimed at reaching a given fixation point. The approach proposed here allows to solve the inverse kinematics and joint redundancy problems for the ARTS robotic head, with good accuracy and robustness. Experimental trials confirmed the system capability to control the gaze direction and fixation point and also to manage the redundancy of the robotic head in reaching the target fixation point even with additional constraints, such as a clamped joint or two symmetric joint angles (e.g. eye joints).",

The robot uses prescribed running pattern calculated by resolved momentum control, and a running controller stabilizes the system against disturbances. The running controller consists of posture stabilization, inverted pendulum stabilization, contact torque control, impact absorbing control, foot vertical force control and torque distribution control. Applying the proposed controller, HRP-2LR could successfully run with average speed of 0.16(m/s) repeating flight phase of 0.06 (s) and support phase of 0.3 (s).",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of generating a motion strategy to find an object in a known 3-D environment as quickly as possible on average. We use a sampling scheme that generates an initial set of sensing locations for the robot and then we propose a convex cover algorithm based on this sampling. Our algorithm tries to reduce the cardinality of the resulting set and has the main advantage of scaling well with the dimensionality of the environment. We then use the resulting convex covering to generate a graph that captures the connectivity of the workspace. Finally, we search this graph to generate trajectories that try to minimize the expected value of the time to find the object.",

By adopting probabilistic approach, our framework helps the robot to select the most desirable navigation primitive in run time through the performance estimation according to environmental conditions. Moreover, after a mission, the robot evaluates prior navigation performance from accumulated data, and uses the results for the improvement of future operations. Modeling, analysis, and performance evaluation are conducted on firm mathematical foundation. Also, GSPN\u2019s have several advantages over classic automata or direct use of Markov Process. We conducted simulations of the model derived from our experience of practical installations. The results showed that the framework is useful for primitive selection and performance analysis.",

        "abstract": "The paper contributes to presenting both an accurate and robust shape tracking algorithm and a novel visual servoing method. Two steps are involved in the tracking algorithm. Firstly the object shape is assumed to vary under an affine model, and the edge detection is performed along the normal lines to the contour. As a result it is possible to use a Kalman filter to perform efficient tracking. The second step concerns image matching based on perspective model, which is achieved iteratively by searching locally along the normal lines also. As to visual servoing we propose to control the translations of the robot with the normalized zeroth and first order image moments, and to control the orientation with rotation axis and angle extracted from a Homography matrix. Two experiments demonstrate that the tracking algorithm is accurate and robust enough to be used in visual servoing, and the novel visual servoing method is superior to traditional ones.",

Main reasons of the noisy behavior are investigated through a simulation with a one-DOF haptic interface model. It is shown that the PO/PC is ineffective in dissipating the produced energy when the sign of the velocity, which is numerically calculated from the measured position, is suddenly changed, and when this velocity is zero. These cases happen during the period of low velocity due to the limited resolution of the position sensor. New methods, ignoring the produced energy from the velocity sign change, and holding the control force while the velocity is zero, are proposed for removing the noisy behavior. The feasibility of the developed methods is proved with both a simulation and a real experiment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new biphasic electrofluidic rotary actuator relying on electrochemical mechanisms. Gas (H2and O2) is generated at two platinum (Pt) electrodes, immersed in an electrolytic solution, when a low voltage, V, is applied to them. The generated gas pressurizes a closed elastomeric chamber, that deforms under the action of the applied pressure. The chamber is shaped so that no structural failure occurs and the desired output motion is produced, without any need for additional mechanical means such as motion converters. Simple thermodynamic considerations allow estimating the electromechanical coupling factors for the most common external loads.",

A two stage supply chain is analyzed and a pull JIT/Kanban methodology is used to synchronize the successive completion of the products. The simulation of the stochastic complex token PN modeling the supply chain evaluates the system performance under different values of Kanbans and transporters.",

The system provides interactive 3-D graphical interfaces that display, under user control, the quantitative spatial and temporal sensor data presently available to pilots and users only as two-dimensional plots and numerical dis plays. The system can presently display real-time bathymetric renderings of the sea-floor based upon vehicle navigation and sonar sensor data; vehicle trajectory data; a variety of scalar valued sensor data; and geo-referenced targets and waypoints. We report the accuracy of the real-time navigation and bathymetric sonar data processing by comparing the real-time sonar bathymetry of our test tank floor to a high-resolution laser scan of the same tank floor. The real-time sonar bathymetry is shown to compare favorably to the laser scan data",

However, no systematic approach on using the edge data for the data association has been reported. This paper proposes a systematic way of utilizing the edge data for data association. First, we explain a Local Generalized Voronoi Angle(LGA) to represent the edge data in 1-dimension. Second, we suggest a key factor extraction procedure from the LGA to reduce the number by 27-28 times for computational efficiency using the wavelet transformation. Finally we propose a way of data association using the key factors of the LGA. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed data association algorithm yields higher probability for similar edges in computationally efficient manner.",

It proposes the translation algorithm as a specification interface to well-established automata-theoretic control synthesis methods for discrete-event systems (DES\u2019s). This allows control requirements to be more easily described and understood in an expressive and readable language that temporal logic is widely recognized as. Adding such a translation interface effectively combines specifiability and readability in temporal logic with prescriptiveness and computability in automata. The former temporal logic features support specification while the latter automata features support the prescription of DES dynamics and algorithmic computations. A practical implementation of the interface has been developed, providing an enabling technology for writing more readable control specifications in PTL that it translates for finitary control synthesis in automata. A simple example illustrates the use of the proposed temporal logic interface. Practical implications of the complexity of the translation algorithm are discussed.",

In the context of our research efforts, we need to augment a view of the real world with virtual elements which first requires to determine position and orientation of the point of view and then compute a virtual view according to this location. Augmented reality uses a lot of different sensors in order to estimate camera or operator\u2019s point of view. These sensors could provide samples faster than the mixing of virtual and real informations could be displayed. We expose here a way to take into account samples that are generated during the mixing process by combining augmented reality and virtual reality techniques. This method is using a post-rendering technique involving a texture carried out by a software graphics pipeline to perform this task mainly devoted to optical see-through augmented reality systems. This algorithm can lead to deformations on the final rendered image. We will compute the theoretical errors introduced by this method and confront these results to those obtained with a simulation test-bench which is implementing our proposal.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a methodology for automat ically synthesizing task solutions for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. In contrast to prior approaches that require a manual pre definition of how the robot team will accomplish its task (while perhaps automating who performs which task), our approach automates both the how and the who to generate task solution approaches that were not explicitly defined by the designer a priori. The advantages of this new approach are that it: (1) enables the robot team to synthesize new task solutions that use fundamentally different combinations of robot behaviors for different team compositions, and (2) provides a general mechanism for sharing sensory information across networked robots, so that more capable robots can assist less capable robots in accomplishing their objectives. Our approach, which we call ASyMTRe (Automated Synthesis of Multi-robot Task solutions through software Reconfiguration, pronounced \u201cAsymmetry\u201d), is based on mapping environmental, perceptual, and motor control schemas to the required flow of information through the multi-robot system, automatically reconfiguring the connections of schemas within and across robots to synthesize valid and efficient multi-robot behaviors for accomplishing the team objectives. We validate this approach by presenting the results of applying our methodology to two different teaming scenarios: altruistic cooperation involving multi-robot transportation, and coalescent cooperation involving multi-robot box pushing.",

The method do not need stereo correspondence but, nevertheless, can determine absolute scale factor, which is an important factor for long term navigation and SLAM. The method use only motion correspondence basically, which is easier to solve than stereo correspondence because the SFM algorithm can use a sequence of images taken at short time intervals. However, we infer the stereo correspondence inversely from the absolute estimates of structure and motion parameters and utilize this information to improve the performance of our method. Consequently, the method maintain the robustness to the stereo correspondence ambiguity and can avoid the degenerate configuration reported in the former paper. We also propose a simple initialization technique for the proposed method based on extended Kalman filter, which is critical issue for the methods using bearing-only measurements. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The thruster is the crucial factor of an underwater vehicle system, because it is the lowest layer in the control loop of the system. However, an accurate and practical thruster model has not been utilized yet. In this paper, we propose an accurate and practical thrust modeling for underwater vehicles which considers the effects of ambient flow velocity. In this model, the axial flow velocity of the thruster, which is non-measurable, is represented by ambient flow velocity and propeller shaft velocity. Hence, contrary to previous models, the proposed model is practical since it uses only measurable states. Next, the whole thrust map is divided into three states according to the state of ambient flow and propeller shaft velocity, and one of the borders of the states is defined as Critical Advance Ratio (CAR). This classification explains the physical phenomenon of conventional experimental thrust maps. The proposed model is evaluated by comparing experimental data with numerical model simulation data, and it accurately covers overall flow conditions within \u00b1 2N force error. The comparison results show that the new model\u2019s matching performance is significantly better than conventional models\u2019.",

Given the desired contact transition (i.e., the current contact state and the next desired contact state) and the current moving object configuration, we want to generate the compliant motion parameters for the robot system to guide the work piece to the next desired contact state. In this work, optimization method is used to derive the compliant motion parameters. Four motion control conditions are defined to provide constraints; a cost function representing the moving distance is also defined. Minimizing the cost function, the compliant motion parameters can be generated. The method is demonstrated by both translation and rotation examples.",

Experiments using an accelerometer, an impact hammer, and PZT transducers are performed to accomplish Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA), which has not been thoroughly investigated on flexible mechanisms. Through EMA, vibration characteristics of flexible linkages, when the platform is stationary and in motion, are modeled, with configuration-dependent vibration observed. Based on assumptions made in EMA, a modal control strategy using constant mode shapes is designed to control configuration-dependent linkage vibration. Active vibration control experimental results, showing a 40%-50% reduction of vibration amplitudes, validate the effectiveness of the control strategy. This control strategy will be generalized to achieve configuration-dependent vibration control, hence realizing a true smart parallel platform.",

As speed increases the amount of sensor information about the terrain decreases. We address the problem of sensor control in the context of this speed-coverage trade off. The algorithm and testing methodologies are described with results comparing our active sensing method to a passive sensing method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an active line-of-sight-sensing (LOS) methodology is proposed for the docking of autonomous vehicles/robotic end-effectors. The novelty of the overall system is its applicability to cases that do not allow for the direct proximity measurement of the vehicle's pose (position and orientation). In such instances, a guidance-based technique must be employed to move the vehicle to its desired pose using corrective actions at the final stages of its motion. The objective of the proposed guidance method is, thus, to successfully minimize the systematic errors of the vehicle, accumulated after a long-range motion, while allowing it to converge within the random noise limits via a three-step procedure: active LOS realignment, determination of the new (actual) location of the vehicle, and implementation of a corrective action. The proposed system was successfully tested via simulation for a three degree-of-freedom (dof) planar robotic platform and via experiments.",

The controller is based on structural knowledge of the dynamic equations of the robot and measurements of joint positions only. The gravity torque which may include payload variation and disturbances etc represent system uncertainty, which is estimated by a single layer Chebyshev neural network (CNN). The adaptive controller represents an amalgamation of a filtering technique to eliminate velocity measurements and the theory of function approximation using CNN to estimate the gravity torque. The proposed controller ensures the local asymptotic stability and the convergence of the position error to zero. The proposed controller is robust not only to structured uncertainty such as payload parameter variation but also to unstructured one such as disturbances. The validity of the control scheme is shown by simulation studies on a two link robot manipulator.",

An adaptive controller is derived to control actuator force with unknown valve flow coefficients and fluid parameters. This is subsequently cascaded into a position controller which uses RBF networks to compensate for the effects of friction in the system. In contrast to conventional adaptive controllers, the controller is augmented with a further layer that adaptively determines the optimal architecture for the RBF networks using the Minimum Message Length costing criterion. This provides an automated method of determining when it is no longer advantageous to increase the network size. Stability results are presented, and simulation demonstrates the ability of the MML criterion to determine when a suitable fit has been achieved.",

        "abstract": "The application of joint-torque sensory feedback (JTF) in robot control has been proposed in the past as a substitute for the computed torque method. A controller based on JTF does not require computation of link dynamics. However, the traditional JTF assumes precise measurement of joint torque. This paper presents an adaptive JTF control algorithm that does not rely on this assumption. First, the robot dynamics with JTF is presented in a standard form, where the inertia matrix appears symmetric and positive definite. Subsequently, properties of the dynamics is inves tigated and a condition on the number of parallel joint axes for dynamic decoupling is derived. This can lead to further simplification of control structure for a class of robots. Secondly, an adaptive control law is developed incorporating uncalibrated joint torque signals, i.e., the gains and offsets of multiple sensors are unknown, into the control system. No dynamic model of a robot link is required, and all physical parameters of the joints including inertia of the rotors, link twist angles, and friction parameters are assumed unknown to the controller. Stability analysis together with a condition for bounded control input are presented. The control algorithm is experimentally applied to a robotic arm and experimental results illustrate high tracking performance, albeit neither was the torque sensor calibrated nor the parameters were known.",

The problem addressed is the identification of a rigid-body rotation map from input-output data. General least-square and adaptive identification techniques are commonly employed to identify general linear maps from input-output data, but do not guarantee that the resulting identified map is a rigid body rotation. At present, a least-square singular value decomposition approach is the standard method for identification constrained to the group of rigid body rotations. This paper reports the first exact adaptive identifier on the group of rigid body rotations, together with a proof of stability. The performance of this adaptive identifier is evaluated on actual experimental data and found to compare favorably with results obtained via previously reported least-squares techniques. The methodology reported herein is of broader interest because of its applicability to general problems in the identification, dynamics, and control on the group of rigid body motions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new and novel controller for dynamic image-based trajectory tracking of a robot manipulator in uncalibrated environments. The controller is designed to cope with the case when the homogenous transformation matrix between the root and the vision system is unknown. A new adaptive algorithm, different from the Slotine and Li\u2019s method, has been developed to estimate a set of parameters corresponding to the unknown transformation matrix. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot manipulator, we employed the Lyapunov method to prove the convergence of the image errors of the trajectory to zero and the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale. Simulations and experiments have been conducted to demonstrate good convergence of the trajectory errors of the robot and the estimated parameters under the control of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Most research so far on trajectory tracking control of robot has assumed that the kinematics of the robot is known exactly. This paper extends our recent work on adaptive Jacobian tracking control by deriving a new algorithm for trajectory tracking of robots with uncertain kinematics and dynamics. The algorithm requires only to measure the end-effector position in visual space, besides the robot\u2019s joint angles and joint velocities. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controllers. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the robot\u2019s shadow can be used to control the robot.",

The self-stabilization property of the mechanical system is the inspirational source for our idea. We propose an original Delayed Feedback Control (DFC) approach based on measurements of the stance phase period obtained from contact sensors. Here, the DFC approach will not only stabilize running locomotion around the fixed point, but also result in transition from the stand state to the steady bounding running. Finally, we show several simulation results on different terrain (e.g., flat and step) to characterize the performance of the proposed controller.

The selection of the set of locations where chemical concentration measurements should be recorded, is performed in real-time with the objective of maximizing the accuracy of the parameter estimates and reducing the time to convergence of this estimation problem.

The main goal is to ease the development of cooperative tasks among teams of robots. The proposed architecture must have not only the capacity to allow the team of robots to accomplish such tasks, but also it must have tools and features that allow programmers to develop complex applications in a reasonable time. Agent-based development platforms are used for this purpose, integrating the necessary capabilities for developing distributed applications, and managing the communications among all the components. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework, two real applications, remote vision and robot following, are presented. Both of them consist of a set of agents, and run actually in real robot systems, demonstrating that distributed systems do not add significant overhead to real-time tasks.",

To alleviate some of the financial burden of this process, we have constructed a system consisting of four winches each attached to a central pod (the simulated air vehicle) via cables \u2014 a cable-array robot. The system is capable of precisely controlling the three dimensional position of the pod allowing effective testing of sensing and control strategies before experimentation on a free-flying vehicle.

Two of the rovers, designated \u201cAnchor-bots\u201d, assist the motion of a third rappelling \u201cCliff-bot\u201d down and along a cliff face using tethers. A decentralized control technique is used to control the motion of the three rovers. The objective of this study is to develop several control algorithms that will create a robust and reliable Cliff-bot system. Control is accomplished by combining and prioritizing several different control algorithms into a hybrid deliberative-reactive control structure. Many different algorithms have been successfully developed and tested to provide the Cliff-bot system with stable and robust navigation of terrain slopes of at least 70 degrees.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot teams have many useful applications such as search and rescue, exploration and hazard detection and analysis. Communication between the robots of a team as well as between the robots and a human operator or controller are useful for many applications. Many applications of mobile robots involve scenarios in which no communication infrastructure such as base stations exist (e.g. demining in battlefields) or the existing infrastructure is damaged (e.g. search and rescue after an earthquake). In such scenarios, it is necessary for mobile robots to form an ad hoc network to enable communication by forwarding each other\u2019s packets. In many applications, group communication can be used for flexible control, organization, and management of the mobile robots. Multicast provides a bandwidth efficient communication method between a source and a group of robots. In this paper, we propose an efficient multicast protocol MRMM (Mobile Robot Mesh Multicast) for deployment in mobile robot networks. MRMM exploits the fact that mobile robots know what velocity they are instructed to move at and for what distance in building a long lifetime sparse mesh for group communication that is more efficient. Our results show that MRMM provides an efficient group communication mechanism that can potentially be used in many mobile robot application scenarios.",

Analysis performed on the data demonstrates the ability to detect slippage and measure sideslip angle. Preliminary classification of human control inputs using pattern recognition techniques shows the ability to match steering inputs with vehicle trajectories that can be used to develop motion primitives for vehicle control. These tools and techniques will be used for the development of high speed autonomous off-road driving.",

A key step in the derivation consists in de fining a local diffeomorphism between the endogenous configuration space and the suitably augmented (extended) taskspace of the mobile manipulator. This has been achieved by decomposing the Fourier series representation of control functions driving the mobile manipulator into a finite dimensional part isomorphic to the taskspace, and a complementary in finite dimensional part augmenting the taskspace. By definition, our algorithm has the property of repeatability. Theoretical considerations are illustrated with computer simulations accomplished for a 3 d.o.f. planar nonholonomic manipulator mounted on a kinematic car-type platform.",

        "abstract": "A new hybrid motion planning technique based on Harmonic Functions (HF) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) is presented. The proposed approach consists of incrementally building a Probabilistic Roadmap using information obtained about the workspace topology through the Fluid Dynamic (FD) paradigm based on HFs. The crux of our approach is to identify narrow passages using FD paradigm and pass the information obtained over to a PRM method to build a roadmap to capture the connectivity of free configuration space (C-space) especially in narrow regions. As an extension to our recent works on using Harmonic Function-based Probabilistic Roadmaps (HFPRM) for robotic navigation [1], we propose an Incremental HFPRM (IHFPRM) technique which is more general and can be applied to virtually any type of robot. Simulation results presented in this paper show that the combination of the HF and the PRM works better than each individual in terms of finding a collision free path in environments where narrow passages exist. This technique can be extended to the sensor-based motion planning of robots (mobile and/or articulated) which is the long-term objective in carrying out this research.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, navigation and control of autonomous mobile unicycle robots in a complex and partially known obstacle-ridden environment is considered. The unicycle dynamic model used has two differentially-driven wheels, with the two wheel motor torques as the system input. Two novel controllers are derived which stabilize the robot within a surrounding disk-shaped area (henceforth called a bubble) of arbitrary size for any initial velocities. The first controller takes the unicycle to the center of its bubble while the second corrects its orientation. The torque-levels can be controlled by adjusting gains. The control laws are independent of inertial parameters. An existing global planner is used by each robot to create a string of bubbles connecting its start point to its goal point, with each bubble\u2019s size indicative of the radial obstacle-clearance available from its center. Each robot then uses its local bubble-controllers to follow its global planned path. This method is then extended to an experimental setup of multiple robots, each equipped with proximity sensors. The same algorithm is run on each robot in a distributed manner with no information sharing. Results are presented to illustrate the robustness of the system.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to design a controller based on a nonlinear hover-mode model for a helicopter, which can be seamlessly integrated in an existing spatial path-planning approach. Unlike traditional approaches, this novel two-level hierarchical controller takes \u2018 small-body forces\u2019 explicitly into consideration. A higher level controller (HLC), with slower time-scale, controls the translational motion. This controller chooses the main rotor thrust, and a reference signal for the fuselage rotation matrix. This reference rotation matrix is then tracked by a lower level controller (LLC) at a faster time-scale, to select the two flapping angles of the tip path plane (TPP) and the tail rotor thrust. The reference rotation matrix is chosen by the HLC so as to meet the objective of local translation, specified by a local potential function. The local potential field is represented as an obstacle-free spherical region, a \u2018 bubble\u2019, in which the helicopter is constrained to fly. A string of such bubbles is generated by an existing spatial path-planning algorithm. The helicopter switches its controlling bubbles in a sequence to produce gross motion. The system is demonstrated by computer simulation, using a scaled model.",

E* results in more appropriate paths during gradient descent. Dynamic replanning means that changes in the environment model can be repaired to avoid the expenses of complete replanning.

Such source of light provides a way to facilitate the image-analysis process required to characterize the surface where the task is going to be performed.

        "abstract": "Semiconductor wafer defect inspection is an important process before die packaging. The defective regions are usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Dozens of people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions. By this means, potential misjudgment may be introduced due to human fatigue. In addition, the process can incur significant personnel costs. Prior work has proposed automated post-sawing wafer defect inspection that is based on supervised neural networks. Since it requires learned patterns specific to each application, its disadvantage is the lack of product flexibility. Self-Organizing Neural Networks (SONNs) have been proven to have the capabilities of unsupervised auto-clustering. In this paper, automated wafer inspection based on a self-organizing neural network is proposed. Based on real-world data, experimental results show that the proposed method successfully identifies the defective regions on wafers with good performances.",

A vibration unit is fixed on the movable platform of the mechanism and a needle connected to the unit can perform task of micro-dissection for micro living organism by means of piercing as it moves with the platform. Kinematics of the micromanipulator is analyzed based on pseudo rigidity body model (PRBM) method, its kinematic dimensions are identified from performance atlas utilizing the method of dimension model (MODM). Moreover, flexure hinges are designed to create the flexure-based compliance mechanism. Static and dynamic performances of the solid model are analyzed with finite element method. The simulation result illustrates that motion of solid model is coincident to that of PRBM basically, and after a proper frequency of the vibration unit is chosen according to natural frequencies of the solid model the micromanipulator can avoid resonance effectively and implement accurate motion.",

The platform actuation system employs vibration micro motors. The dynamic model of the platform and of its actuation system is presented, and analytical expressions are derived which provide design guidelines for the platform. Simulations are performed which verify the analytical results and demonstrate the platform capabilities. The platform design is simple, compact and of low cost. Also the energy supply of the mechanism can be accomplished in an untethered mode using simple means such as single cell batteries.",

        "abstract": "Exoskeletons are structures of rigid links mounted on the body that promise to restore, rehabilitate, or enhance the human motor function. A major challenge in the practical use of exoskeletons for daily activities relate to the coupled control of human-exoskeleton system. This paper provides a method to resolve the control problem by relegation of the human control and exoskeleton control to two control subsystems. The first subsystem represents the execution of voluntary control from commands generated from the central nervous system. This subsystem is responsible primarily for the kinetic or dynamic components of the motion, including motion generation. The second subsystem represents the exoskeleton controller, responsible for joint level accommodation of all gravitational, static, and certain reactive forces. If all such forces are static, the exoskeleton controller can be viewed as a compensator that maintains the body in static equilibrium. The proposed strategy provides a clear partition between natural voluntary control by the CNS, and artificial assist by the exoskeleton controller. Two methods are presented for implementation of the proposed control algorithm. The first method is based on the principal of virtual work. The second method is a recursive algorithm based on force and moment balance equations. Analytical results are presented to study feasibility regions of exoskeleton control strategies in terms of mechanical efficiency. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm for a powered ankle-foot orthosis application.",

Both tasks are based on human motion trajectories and require a proper modelling. To accomplish these tasks, we acquire data from complex motions like setting the table, pouring water into a cup, or stirring the content of the cup. The objectives of our studies are to identify the subject doing the motion and to detect slight changes in motion constraints with automatic classification methods. For that purpose, we present reliable methods based on Elman networks and hidden Markov models.

        "abstract": "The required reliability in applications of a distributed computer system is continuous service for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, computer failures due to exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption, numerical error accumulation, and so on, may interrupt services and cause significant losses. Hence, this work proposes an application cluster service (APCS) scheme. The proposed APCS provides both a failover scheme and a state recovery scheme for failure management. The failover scheme is designed mainly to automatically activate the backup application for replacing the failed application whenever it is sick or down. Meanwhile, the state recovery scheme is intended primarily to provide an inheritable design pattern to support applications with state recovery requirements. An application simply needs to inherit and implement this design pattern, and then can accomplish the task of state backup and recovery. Furthermore, a performance evaluator (PEV) that can detect performance degradation and predict time to failure is developed in this study. By using these detection and prediction capabilities, the APCS can perform the failover process before node breakdown. Thus, applying APCS and PEV can enable a distributed computer system to provide services with near-zero-downtime.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we use the Bayesian Structural EM algorithm as a classification method to learn and interpret hyperspectral sensor data in robotic planetary missions. Hyperspectral image spectroscopy is an emerging technique for geological investigations from airborne or orbital sensors. Many spacecraft carry spectroscopic equipment as wavelengths outside the visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum give much greater information about an object. The algorithm presented combines the standard Expectation Maximisation (EM), which optimises parameters, with structure search for model selection. We use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score to learn the network struc ture. The procedure only converges to a local maxima, thus requiring a good initial graph structure. Two initial structures are used: the Na\u00efve Bayes, and the Tree-Augmented-Na\u00efve Bayes structures. Our preliminary experiments show that the former results in a structure that can correctly determine the presence and types of minerals with merely 13% accuracy while the latter results in a structure that has approximately 94% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Our group developed a method of path generation for wheel loaders as part of our ongoing research on the autonomous loading operation of wheel loaders at surface mines and construction sites. The path connecting the present vehicle position and scooping position consists of clothoid curves and straight lines. Each line segment is optimized in a path generation procedure. A simplified model of the pile shape and bucket trajectory is used to determine the scooping direction based on an estimation of the resistance force applied on the bucket during the scooping motion. We applied the proposed method in an experimental model. A stereo-vision system was used to measure the shape of the pile and the scooping direction that imposed the least moment on the bucket was selected as the scooping position. This method generates an appropriate path for the wheel loader.",

        "abstract": "The authors propose a unified modeling approach to product-robot information systems as a contribution to robot related applications of product models. Despite product modeling by CAD/CAM system is prevailing in the industry, robot processes are typically not product model data driven. The authors consider geometric aspect of robot programming as the main drawback of development. The main purpose of the reported work is to establish an application centered and multi-aspect-based communication between product modeling and industrial robot related engineering. Although the primary application area of the proposed approach is robot-assisted manufacturing of products, it also can be utilized at other applications where engineering object descriptions in product models are available for robot environment. In the proposed model, engineering objects are described as application oriented associative aspects. High level integration of engineering information including intelligent content is intended for environment adaptive model objects. In this manner, models with the ability to react changes in their affect zone can be established. The paper also explains key elements of the related modeling methodology. Implementation of the approach and methodology is considered as an extension to modeling procedures and models in advanced industrial CAD/CAM systems with open architecture.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Legged robots offer exceptional mobility in uncharted terrains. Their dynamic nature yields unrivaled mobility, but serves to destabilize the motion estimation process that underlies legged operations. In particular, the discontinuous foot fall patterns and flight phases result in severe impulses, which, in turn, result in excessive accumulation of drift by inertial sensors. Ground range measurements, amongst several others, are robust to this drift yet are limited in application due to their low-bandwidth and sensitivity to ground conditions. In considering the attitude estimation problem for this dynamic legged locomotion, this paper develops a pose calculation method based on ground range measurements. This is used in conjunction with a hybrid Extended Kalman Filter that takes advantage of the ballistic nature of the flight phases. Results indicate that this combination provides rapid, robust estimates of attitude necessary for extended dynamic legged operations. In single leg experiments, which were conducted using low-cost sensing hardware, this method had an RMS error of < 1 \u00b0, half that of a non-hybrid EKF approach.",

        "abstract": "We present enhancements of existing calibration methods that allow the automated calibration of a laser stripe profiler in an industrial environment. The first and most important enhancement is a new design of the calibration object. Basically it is a \u201cwire-frame model\u201d of a cube, where the edges are simply standard aluminium profiles. This allows establishing point correspondences in a simple and robust way without the need of intensity information. Furthermore this hollow kind of a calibration object allows simultaneous multi-view calibration since enough points of six different planes can be seen from many directions. Given a rough calibration (based on rough measurements with \u00b1 50% accuracy) the scanned points can be automatically allocated to the respective planes of the calibration object. Secondly we propose a new way of solving the linear model of a laser stripe profiler. By firstly solving the camera-independent geometry these values can be averaged over the multiple views, which further reduces the local offsets of point clouds and therefore enhances the output of subsequent operations like mesh generation on the combined calibrated point cloud. The paper describes the design of the calibration object and the calibration method in detail and presents experimental results on simulated and real range data sets. The industrial applicability has been demonstrated in a sensor cell with four cameras under real-world conditions including moderate oscillations of the calibration object.",

In robotic operation, during contact transition accelerometers and force sensors play a very important role and serve to overcome many of the difficulties of uncertain world models and unknown environments, limiting the domain of application of current robots used without external sensory provided. The calibration procedure helps to improve the performance as well as enhanced stability and robustness for the transition phase. A variety of accelerometers were used to validate the procedure. A dynamic model of the robot-grinding tool using the new sensors was obtained by system identification. An impedance control scheme was proposed to verify the improvement. The experiments were carried out on an ABB industrial robot with open control system architecture.",

Since we have redundant measures it is possible to detect non-systematic errors; in this paper, an automatic procedure to reduce non-systematic errors of the sensor is presented and validated with experimental results on a real mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "Information of high-level, topological contact states is useful and even necessary for a wide range of applications, including many robotics applications. While there is considerable research related to topological contact states between two polyhedral objects, little is studied about how to characterize, represent, and automatically generate topological contact states between curved objects. In this paper we extend the representation of topological contact states between polyhedral objects to general planar curved objects in terms of contacting curve elements, obtained from curvature monotonic segmentation [6]. We further introduce an approach to generate automatically graphs of such contact states between two planar curved objects, which represent not only valid contact states but also adjacency relations among those contact states. Implementation results of the related algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The approach can be naturally extended to generation of contact states between 3-D curved objects.",

To this aim, a system was developed that allows the surgeon to select a desired instrument location on a US image. Then a robot is programmed to automatically move the instrument towards the selected location. This approach requires robust tracking of the instrument in the US image, together with modeling of the overall system and implementation of a visual servoing loop. This paper presents geometrical and kinematic models of the system, as well as the control loop design, which is validated through both numerical simulations, and results of in vitro experiments.",

The paper contains development of the method as well as experimental results with a forklift prototype in actual pallet engagement tasks. The technology could be added to AGV (automatically guided vehicle) systems enabling them to engage arbitrarily located pallets.

Based on the measurement of the angle between the cable and the helicopter/ship, a novel hierarchical two time-scale controller has been proposed to ensure landing of the helicopter on the ship. The system is demonstrated by computer simulation. Currently, work is under progress to implement the algorithm using an instrumented model of a helicopter using a tether.",

The autonomous towed vehicle has three different navigation modes; towed mode, autonomous mode and kite mode, to assure safe and reliable inspection in such a port area. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is employed as a towed vehicle to increase autonomy. In towed systems, it is important to monitor a towed force for preventing cable breaks and making use of it more efficiently since a towing cable plays an important role in transmitting electric signals and towing forces. In this paper, we propose a sequence for towed force estimation consisting of different navigation modes and control methods for it. In addition, the navigation control system of the autonomous towed vehicle is briefly described. Simulations to verify the towed force estimation and control methods are carried out and the results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The BRIGIT project (Bone Resection Instrument Guidance by Intelligent Telemanipulator) aims at developing a surgical robot for orthopedic surgery. This robot should be used as a positioner of a guide providing a mechanical support during bone sawing or drilling. The planned position of the guide is obtained after a registration procedure consisting in collecting anatomical landmarks on the surface of the patient's bone. This can be done in a cooperative mode, by grabbing the tool tip, through an appropriate force control, or in a teleoperated mode via a master device. In order to facilitate the installation of the robot in the operating theatre and to improve its performance, a procedure based on interval analysis has been developed to optimize the robot placement with respect to the patient, the surgical staff, and the obstacles of the environment.",

The BSA basic algorithm is designed to work in an environment modeled by a coarse-grain grid. BSA has been extended to cover, not only the free cells, but also the partially occupied ones. In this paper, the concepts and algorithms used to extend BSA are introduced. The ideas used to extend BSA are generic, thus a similar approach can be used to extend most of the grid-based coverage algorithms. Finally, some simulation results that demonstrate that BSA performs a complete coverage are presented.",

Then, we show that stereo vision, besides giving an optimum estimation of the 3D position of the object, is useful to remove lots of the false identifications of the ball, thanks to the advantages of epipolar constraint. Finally, we describe a new strategy for ball following, by a mobile robot, which is able to\u201d look for\u201d the object whenever it comes out of the cameras view, by taking advantage of a\u201d block matching\u201d method similar to that of MPEG Video.",

First, the benefits of structuring highly articulated robots using networked control systems are discussed. Afterwards, an optimal bandwidth allocation policy for axes distributed control that allows to enhance robot tracking within the available bandwidth is introduced. It will be shown that axes control performance and thus tracking can be significantly improved by using feedback to dynamically allocate bandwidth to axis controllers as a function of the current state of each axis. Simulation results on a multiple axes robot corroborate our approach.",

While passive force display which uses only passive elements is an effective method for assuring safety, it has some directions and link postures which are hard to present force. To this problem, a method for improvement of controllability using redundant couple of brakes had been suggested. This method was able to make it possible to display various force directions and various postures of virtual objects. The purpose of this study was further improvement of controllability of systems with redundant couple of brakes. In this paper, we discussed the outline of developed redundant-type system and basic experiments with it. We also mentioned an algorithm how to use the brakes to represent various positions and orientations of virtual objects. It was confirmed by experiments in some typical cases.",

When information about the range is not available, the initial probability density function (pdf) of a landmark in the environment can not be represented using a Gaussian. The GSF is an attractive candidate for estimation in this scenario as it can deal with arbitrary pdfs represented as sets of Gaussians. However, the implementation of the GSF requires maintaining a bank of extended Kalman filters. The resulting computational complexity needs to be reduced by employing a minimum number of filters. In this work, the performance of each extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the GSF is evaluated using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). As such the number of members in the Gaussian sum can be reduced rapidly and the efficiency of the GSF can be significantly increased, providing a solution to the important problem of bearing-only SLAM. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation and experiment conducted using a Pioneer mobile robot.",

The tool representation described here uses a behavior-based approach to ground the tool affordances in the behavioral repertoire of the robot. The representation is learned during a behavioral babbling stage in which the robot randomly chooses different exploratory behaviors, applies them to the tool, and observes their effects on environmental objects. The paper shows how the autonomously learned affordance representation can be used to solve tool-using tasks by dynamically sequencing the exploratory behaviors based on their expected outcomes. The quality of the learned representation was tested on extension-of-reach tool-using tasks.",

In particular, the three key properties of the proposed control framework are highlighted in this paper: 1) cooperative fixtureless grasping and manipulation of inertial and deformable objects by multiple slave robots; 2) passive teleoperation of the overall behavior of the multiple slave robots (and the grasped object) over the delayed communication with force reflection; and 3) grasping safety (i.e. secure grasping) and interaction stability regardless of the communication delay and human command.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a control framework for the bilateral teleoperation between a single master robot and multiple cooperative slave robots with communication-delay in the master-slave communication channel. Using passive decomposition, we first decompose the dynamics of multiple slaves into two decoupled systems while preserving energetic passivity: the shape system describing cooperative grasping aspect, and the locked system representing overall behavior of the multiple slaves. Then, by locally controlling the decoupled shape system with the cancellation of disturbances on it, secure and tight (and possibly fixtureless) cooperative grasping can be achieved regardless of the communication-delay and human command. We also construct a bilateral teleoperation loop between the master and the locked system s.t., by operating the master, a human operator can control the overall behavior of the multiple slaves and the grasped object while perceiving environmental forces acting on them. Scattering-based communication is used to passify the master-slave communication-delay. By exploiting the passivity property of the decomposition and scattering-based communication, energetic passivity of the closed-loop system can be ensured, thus, interaction stability and safety are improved significantly. In a companion paper [1], simulation and semi-experiment (i.e. real master and simulated slaves) are performed to illustrate properties of this proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Recently, diseases in gastro-intestinal tract have drastically increased. As a result, endoscopic technologies are being developed to diagnose and treat these diseases. Bio-material property is essential information to develop endoscopic devices especially capsule type endoscope. Because the capsule endoscope is moved by the peristaltic motion, it has some limitations to get the image of the digestive organ. Therefore, locomotive mechanism for capsule is necessary. In order to develop the locomotive mechanism, the information of bio material property is required. Especially, the friction force between capsule endoscope and the tissues of the gastro-intestinal tract is very important information. In this paper, we propose the bio-material property measuring system which can supply the information for the design of the locomotive mechanism. By using the proposed measuring system, we evaluate the effects of design parameters such as velocity, diameter size and shape of capsule endoscope that influence the friction force to the capsule endoscope to get the dominant parameters. As a result, we can offer the useful information to design the locomotive mechanism of the capsule endoscope.",

This paper presents and discusses the design, fabrication, and evaluation of two novel bio-inspired climbing robots. Both are inspired by the locomotion of Geckos, a highly skilled natural climber. They are developed for terrestrial and extra-terrestrial environments, and their kinematics is inspired by the Geckos\u2019 gait. The first relatively large robot actuated by conventional motors is designed to operate at both in Earth and space scenarios. The second robot, whose motion is controlled using shape memory alloy actuators and size can be miniaturized to few centimeters scale, is designed for terrestrial applications. Preliminary prototypes of these robots are developed, demonstrated, and evaluated by steep and flat acrylic surface climbing tests. Current robots can successfully climb up to 65 \u00b0 slopes at 2 cm/sec speeds.",

        "abstract": "Biological systems are able to perform movements in unpredictable environments more elegantly than traditionally engineered robotic systems. A current limitation of robotic systems is their inability to simultaneously and independently control both joint angle and joint stiffness without electromechanical feedback loops, which can reduce system stability. In this paper, we describe the development and physical implementation of a servo-actuated robotic joint that uses antagonistic, series-elastic actuation with novel nonlinear spring mechanisms. These mechanisms form a real-time mechanical feedback loop that provides the joint with angle and stiffness control through differential and common-mode actuation of the servos, respectively. This approach to joint control emulates the mechanics of antagonistic muscle groups used by animals, and we experimentally show that it is capable of independently controlling both joint angle and joint stiffness using a simple open-loop control algorithm.",

The principles of locomotion of real boxfish have been investigated thoroughly from a biological point of view, but attempts to replicate such a device within the research community of Micro Underwater Vehicles (MUV) have been quite limited. The authors have developed a electromechanical device with rigid body propelled by a oscillating tail fin and steered by a pair of independent side fins. The oscilating motions of the fins are independently controlled by PZT bimorph actuators driving four-bar mechanisms for motion amplification. The goal is to build a centimeter-length microrobotic fish capable of sustained autonomous swimming, which can then be used in marine micro-organism sensing, underwater ship wreck explorations, in-pipe inspections, and in forming underwater sensor networks. In this paper, we present the system concept design, fabrication and preliminary experimental measurements.",

The algorithm is then applied to a two-axle compliant framed modular mobile robot. To this goal the complex robot kinematics are reduced to an equivalent unicycle kinematic model where we must consider physical constraints on wheel velocity and frame curvature. Bounded curvature and velocity expressions are thus derived as control inputs. The controller is then extended to compensate for non-ideal initial conditions and drift.

It is based on convolution of discrete functions representing the workspace and the robot to obtain a function that represents the C-space. An important key in the work is that the representation of discrete functions is made by hierarchical data structures, so the information is highly compact, and high dimensions or/and resolutions workspaces can be considered. It is important to highlight that the hierarchical data structures no only have been used for the representation, but for the evaluation. So, intermediate arrays to represent the discrete information are not used in the proposed method. Also, as the method is hierarchical, calculations at high resolutions are performed only in those regions where it is necessary. This makes the method suitable when the robot moves in large environments where other methods will fail due to the memory needs.",

        "abstract": "There are many randomized motion planning techniques, but it is often difficult to determine what planning method to apply to best solve a problem. Planners have their own strengths and weaknesses, and each one is best suited to a specific type of problem. In previous work, we proposed a meta-planner that, through analysis of the problem features, subdivides the instance into regions and determines which planner to apply in each region. The results obtained with our prototype system were very promising even though it utilized simplistic strategies for all components. Even so, we did determine that strategies for problem subdivision and for combination of partial regional solutions have a crucial impact on performance. In this paper, we propose new methods for these steps to improve the performance of the meta-planner. For problem subdivision, we propose two new methods: a method based on \u2018 gaps\u2019 and a method based on information theory. For combining partial solutions, we propose two new methods that concentrate on neighboring areas of the regional solutions. We present results that show the performance gain achieved by utilizing these new strategies.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with on-line navigation of a size D mobile robot in an unknown planar environment. The competitiveness of an on-line navigation algorithm measures its path length relative to the length of the optimal off-line path. While competitiveness usually means constant relative performance, it is generalized here to any functional relationship between on-line performance and optimal off-line solution. This paper describes a new on-line navigation algorithm, called CBUG, which requires constant memory and has a quadratic competitive performance. Moreover, it is shown that in general any online navigation algorithm must have at least a quadratic competitive performance. The CBUG algorithm achieves the quadratic lower bound and thus has optimal competitiveness.",

A four-neuron, mutual inhibitory network forms the basic coordinating pattern for locomotion. This network then inhibits an eight-neuron network used to drive patterned movement. We show that we can get predictable control of important relationships such as the phase of the hip and the knee by adjusting tonic parameters. We demonstrate the basic concept both in a simulation that is used to drive a trotting bipedal robot as well as an aVLSI CPG chip that generates spiking burst patterns. Our results indicate that an inhibitory framework can generate simple, understandable and flexible networks for legged robot control that can be implemented in custom VLSI circuits.",

The CPG model consists of the mutual inhibition network and the rotating manipulation is performed by the motion-triggers that are issued from the CPG model. The smooth change of the desired velocity can be given by the output of neurons that keep smooth increase and decrease. Experimental results using 4-fingered hand system suggest that the issuing cycle of the motion-triggers can be adaptively changed by the feedback of joint angle according to an object size.",

In addition to the identification of the sensor parameters - in our case the camera calibration - we focus on the adaptation of parameters that characterize the integration of the sensor into the control system or the application. The most important of such parameters are identified best when evaluating an application task, after a short pre-calibration phase.

        "abstract": "We are developing a process to quickly prototype millirobotic systems in which the approach is to identify and develop a construction kit for fabricating almost any design, similar to the kits that are available for larger-scale robots. Two of the basic elements of the kit, the links and flexure joints, have been identified, and an assembly method has been developed. This paper deals with the problem of integrating the wiring in these parts, a significant task on this size scale. This novel feature is achieved through the use of a flexible ribbon cable consisting of three wires made out of patterned copper foil and polyimide. Low melting point solder has been tested successfully to make the electrical interconnect between the parts. We discuss the issues that must be addressed in designing the flexure-wiring combination. In addition, the paper presents the methodology for fabricating structures with integrated wiring using a simple four bar mechanism as an example. Finally, the tests show that the wiring loop over a flexure connecting a distally located sensor on the mechanism maintains both its electrical and mechanical integrity even during large motions. Future work will include the automated assembly of the parts with a low cost assembly tool.",

This characterization, quantification of errors, and 3-D confidence in the distance readings of the sensor is vital for practical applications. These characteristics are compared to the counterpart characteristics of the laser range-finder. The PBS-03JN is a cost effective alternative to laser range-finders in indoor environments.

We developed a unique fiberoptic reflection position sensor and associated circuitry that yields a high resolution (approximately 5 \u00b5 m of linear motion), appropriate scale, and real time method for sensing the state of the MFI. Also included is the development of a clamping technique for the 2 wing, 4 degree of freedom MFI designed to expose actuator surfaces to be sensed while properly grounding the MFI without introducing added compliance or stiffness to the airframe. We include characterization data for a 2 DOF (flapping and rotation for one wing) wing structure, a clamped 4 DOF motor core of the MFI, and one side of an entire 4 DOF MFI.",

Locomotion over rough terrain has been achieved mainly by rigid body systems including crawlers and leg mechanisms. This paper presents an alternative method of moving over rough terrain, one that employs deformation. First, we describe the principle of crawling and jumping as performed through deformation of a robot body. Second, in a physical simulation, we investigate the feasibility of the approach. Next, we show experimentally that prototypes of a circular robot and a spherical robot can crawl and jump.",

The clamping system allows to stop the pill in desired sites of the GI tract for long monitoring purposes. After discussing the major technical constraints, the design of the clamping system, based on FEA (Finite Element Analysis), is illustrated as well as its fabrication process. The clamping unit is actuated exploiting Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), in wires and spring configuration, and it is driven by a dedicated electrical interface. A fine tuning has been performed in order to limit the power consumption. Then a working prototype is fabricated and preliminarily tested, pointing out a capability of the grasping system over 40 g.",

        "abstract": "Intense activity in neural prosthetic research has recently demonstrated the possibility of robotic interfaces that respond directly to the nervous system. The question remains of how the flow of information between the patient and the prosthetic device should be designed to provide a safe, effective system that maximizes the patient\u2019s access to the outside world. Much recent work by other investigators has focused on using decoded neural signals as low-level commands to directly control the trajectory of screen cursors or robotic end-effectors. Here we review results that show that high-level, or cognitive, signals can be decoded from planned arm movements. These results, coupled with fundamental limitations in signal recording technology, motivate an approach in which cognitive neural signals play a larger role in the neural interface. This proposed paradigm predicates that neural signals should be used to instruct external devices, rather than control their detailed movement. This approach will reduce the effort required of the patient and will take advantage of established and on-going robotics research in intelligent systems and human-robot interfaces.",

We also found several demographic effects on visitors\u2019 opinions of interactive spaces. These findings enhance our quantitative understanding of collective human behavior in interactive spaces and are a first step towards the construction of active environments that can automatically influence human motion and experience. This knowledge will be important in the design and construction of future interactive environments for enhancing the safety and enjoyment of shared areas for large numbers of people.",

Virtual force field between a robot and an obstacle is formed and regulated to maintain a desired distance. To avoid obstacles on the path of a mobile robot, intelligent hybrid force control is used to regulate force field of an accurate distance between a robot and an obstacle. Since uncertainties from robot dynamics and obstacles degrade the performance of a collision avoidance task, neural network is used to compensate for uncertainties. Simulation studies of avoiding obstacles by maintaining a desired distance on the path of a wheeled mobile robot are conducted to confirm the proposed algorithm.",

The robot consists of an arm covered with soft materials and hybrid joints, which can be put into active or passive mode as needed. In an unexpected or expected collision with human, the arising impulse force is attenuated effectively by the physical model formed with the hybrid joint and the soft material. Owing to the displacement movement of the link when the joint is passive, a recovery control algorithm has been developed for the end-effector to maintain its desired task position after the collision. Simulation and experiment results confirm that the proposed physical model is suitable for robot working in the human-robot symbiotic environment and the control method are useful for robot\u2019s task fulfillment.",

We exploit the parallel between the formulation of motion planning for group of robots coupled by constraints and the forward dynamics simulation of constrained multibody systems to develop the candidate approaches. We compare and contrast these approaches on the basis of ease of formulation, distribution of computation and overall computational accuracy. Traditionally penalty formulations have enjoyed a prominent position in motion planning of robot collectives due to their ease of formulation, decentralization and scalability. However, the instabilities introduced in the form of \u201cformulation stiffness\u201d at the algorithm development stage have the potential to hinder the subsequent control.

The proposed algorithm mainly operates by maintaining, as far as possible, small uncovered regions between covered areas and obstacles. In addition, the bounds on the amount of repeated coverage and time required for complete coverage are also investigated. Furthermore, it is shown that repeated coverage can occur only around regions where the paths between obstacles are less than twice the width of the robots\u2019 coverage range. This property holds even when the robots have no a priori knowledge of the environment, and therefore helps to prevent unnecessary wastage of time and resources.",

        "abstract": "Recent research trends and technology developments are bringing us closer to the realization of autonomous multirobot systems performing increasingly complex missions. However, existing multirobot task allocation mechanisms treat tasks as simple, indivisible entities and ignore any inherent structure and semantics that such complex tasks might have. These properties can be exploited to produce more efficient team plans by giving individual robots the ability to come up with new ways to perform a task, or by allowing multiple robots to cooperate by sharing the subcomponents of a task, or both. In this paper, we introduce the complex task allocation problem and describe a distributed solution for efficiently allocating a set of complex tasks to a robot team. The advantages of explicitly modeling complex tasks during the allocation process is demonstrated by a comparison of our approach with existing task allocation algorithms in an area reconnaissance scenario. An implementation on a team of outdoor robots further validates our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of identifying robust equilibrium postures of a planar mechanism supported by fixed frictional contacts in a two-dimensional gravitational field. The complex kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body, B, with a variable center of mass. Inertial forces generated by moving parts of the mechanism are lumped into a neighborhood of wrenches centered at the nominal gravitational wrench. The identification of the robust equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts is reduced to the identification of center-of-mass locations that maintain equilibrium of B with respect to any wrench in the given neighborhood. The static response of B to an external wrench involves static indeterminacy and frictional constraints. The region of center-of-mass locations that generate equilibrium with respect to a particular external wrench is formulated as a linear programming problem, and a full graphical characterization is provided. The result is then generalized to robust equilibrium postures that resist a neighborhood of external wrenches. Finally, we present experimental results that validate the criteria for feasible equilibrium postures.",

        "abstract": "Imitation equips robots with a simple and natural interface to learn new tasks. Although abstraction is a remarkable feature of imitation that discriminates it from mimicking, there has been no enough research on this dimension of imitation. Relational concepts are the simplest type of abstract concepts and can be an appropriate start point. These concepts may be learned by combining perceptual categorization and classical conditioning. The paper will first formalize relational concept learning within an imitative context. Internal modules of the learning agent are considered to be functions. We will prove that in this case the concept-motor mapping becomes one-to-one which simplifies learning. A learning algorithm for the model will be also proposed and evaluated in a phoneme acquisition experiment with a large number of highly overlapped samples.",

        "abstract": "Although micro-motion parallel manipulators have been used widely, their special architectures make it impossible to be applied in the condition demanding relative large workspace. In this paper, a novel large workspace flexure hinge-based parallel manipulator is presented, which can attain the sub-micron scale accuracy over the cubic centimeter workspace. This manipulator system is a 6-PSS parallel mechanism, in which piezoceramic motors actuate the prismatic joints, precision linear encoders detect the actuation displacements, and as the key technology, a kind of novel wide-range flexure hinges are utilized as passive spherical joints. Because of the adoption of wide-range flexure hinges, the whole system features large workspace differing from the conventional micro-motion flexure hinge-based parallel manipulators. The kinematics analysis of the whole mechanism is performed based on the stiffness model of the flexure hinges via FEM theory. The wide-range flexure hinges move over large space during the course of self-deformation, so the kinematics model is a typical geometrical nonlinear problem. In this paper, a Newton-Raphson increment iterative scheme for the kinematics model solution procedure of the whole mechanism is presented based on Updated Lagrange Formulation. And finally, the numerical calculation results about the theoretical model are given.",

Two sets of experiments were conducted. In one, sonar data were gathered from a Nomad 200 robot operating in typical indoor hallways. Another used sonars on an RWI Urban robot in a confined, irregular tunnel built from eight different construction materials. For each set, an occupancy grid map was built and evaluated through a quantitative comparison with the ground truth. It is expected that the results of this study will generalize not only to other sensors and multi-sensor fusion, but any application where consistency can be assumed. It also contributes a design for an inexpensive reconfigurable confined space testbed.",

Given the initial and final configuration of the robot, our algorithm computes an approximate path using the probabilistic roadmap method. We use \"constraint-based planning\" to simulate robot deformation and make appropriate path adjustments and corrections to compute a collision-free path. Our algorithm takes into account geometric constraints like non-penetration and physical constraints like volume preservation. We highlight the performance of our planner on different scenarios of varying complexity.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents an impedance controller for a class of underactuated Euler-Lagrange systems based on energy shaping. For shaping the potential energy, feedback variables are introduced, which are functions of the collocated state variables only, but which are statically equivalent to the noncollocated state variables. In this way the passivity of the system can be ensured, while exactly satisfying all steady state requirements formulated in terms of the noncollocated states (such as desired stiffness and desired equilibrium configuration). The method is constructive, allowing the direct formulation of the controller and of the corresponding energy function. The controller additionally uses the noncollocated feedback to shape the kinetic energy. Under some conditions on the potential energy of the plant, the closed loop system can then be seen as a feedback interconnection of passive systems and is proven to be asymptotically stable. Experimental results for a flexible joint robot validate the proposed controller.",

Although resource capacity constraints can be explicitly taken into account in existing continuous flow models, delays are rarely explicitly taken into account. The purpose of this paper is to introduce continuous Petri nets with delay for explicit modeling of delays for more realistic performance evaluation of failure prone transfer lines. One salient feature of this model is the explicit modeling of delays without destroying the nature of pure continuous flow model. This feature preserves the analyticity of pure continuous flow models for performance evaluation and optimization.",

Based on our devised method, our display uses a 16\u00d716 array of pin-rods with 30mm stroke at 5mm intervals. In this paper, we discuss the control method of the shape memory alloy with a simple matrix drive circuit. This type of drive circuit can dramatically reduce the number of switch. In addition, we propose a novel approach using linear programming, where the simulated time to display a whole shape is reduced by about 50% or more with a large number of actuators.",

Contacts occur both between the object and the robot, and between the object and the environment. Two sets of constraints govern the evolution of the system \u2014 contact velocity constraints that prevent separation and cause rolling, and, contact force constraints that arise from Coulomb friction. We combine the constraints in the space of contact accelerations, obtaining bounds on the robot acceleration as a function of the system state. We solve the motion planning problem by providing a feasible path for the system and generating the controls and the system trajectory by time-scaling the feasible path. We provide examples that illustrate the merits and limitations of our technique and discuss some of the open problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new control method to drive an array of wet Shape Memory Alloy actuators utilizing a Matrix Manifold and Valve system (MMV). The MMV architecture allows a vast DOF robotic system to be controlled using limited number of resources. Using biological inspiration, the robotic system contains a network of \u201cblood vessels\u201d transporting fluid to the various \u201cmuscle\u201d actuators. In general, an array of N2wet actuators can be controlled by 2N+2 fluidic valves, resulting in a scalable architecture. This would allow robots to contain a vast number of actuators like the human body, and be controlled in a scalable manner. The initial prototype contains a 4x4 array of 16 actuators controlled by 10 solenoid valves, where 25% of the actuators can be activated at any one time. Since only a subset of the actuators can be activated at any time, various methods of scheduling the resources (i.e. valves) are investigated, as well as various ways to define the error or difference between the desired and actual states of the array. The fluidic impedance of the system is taken into account in order to optimize the control. Results of simulation show that new scheduler options and definitions of error improve the performance of the system by a factor of 10 when operating the array near its maximum capacity.",

We propose a model-based control algorithm for the wearable device without using biological signals, that is, the knee joint support moment is calculated as a function of the user\u2019s posture and the GRF based on the gravity term and GRF term of the necessary knee joint moment, which is estimated based on a human model. The control algorithm is implemented in the wearable walking support device, referred to as Wearable Walking Helper-II, for supporting antigravity muscles on lower extremities, and experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed system.",

Apparently, control actions form a vector space with a handful of elementary controls as a basis. The reduction of admissible controls to a vector space plays in control theory a similar role to PCA in learning and recognition applications. Inspired by these observations, we first propose a mathematical model of the experimentally observed modular structure. We then show how to choose elementary control actions so as to make the system reach any desired final state. Finally, we determine the minimum number of elementary control actions to perform reaching.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new control method for a P-R-R type planar parallel manipulator, termed adaptive synchronized (A-S) control. The novelty of the proposed A-S control, a combination of synchronized control and adaptive control, is in the application of synchronized control to a planar parallel manipulator. To improve trajectory control, based on the kinematics of the planar parallel manipulator, we design a synchronization feedback control signal, termed the synchronization error, which represents the degree of coordination amongst the actuated joints. Employment of the synchronization error is shown to substantially reduce the pose error of the moving platform of the planar parallel manipulator during trajectory tracking. An adaptive controller is also used to estimate uncertain dynamic parameters of the manipulator. Under the assumption of persistent excitation, the proposed A-S control algorithm is theoretically proved to simultaneously guarantee the convergence of tracking errors and the synchronization error. Moreover, the estimated unknown parameters are guaranteed to converge to their true values as well. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify these claims and evaluate the performance of the proposed controller. Experimental results show that A-S control yields good trajectory tracking performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper focuses on finding the global minimum time control for the collision-free coordination of multiple robots with double integrator dynamics and with additional robot state constraints and control constraints. We initially assume each robot's path is specified and decompose it into collision segments and collision-free segments. The collision avoidance constraints for pairs of robots and the dynamics constraints can then be combined to formulate the coordination problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). In this paper, we first show convexity of the constraints for an individual robot path segment under certain assumptions. We next establish that we are guaranteed to find the global optimum of the MINLP because each subproblem of the MINLP is a convex program, based on the convexity result on individual robot segments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on directly obtaining the global optimum coordination of multiple (more than two) robots with dynamics constraints. Finally, we extend these results to the task of coordinating robots on a given roadmap, where the roadmap has multiple candidate paths for each robot. We present an approach to simultaneously select each robot's traversal path and generate its continuous velocity profile. These robot velocity profiles satisfy the dynamics constraints, avoid collisions, and globally minimize the completion time. We use the MINLP Solver [25], which combines a branch-and-bound algorithm with a filterSQP algorithm, to solve the MINLP coordination problems. We illustrate the approach with multiple robot coordination examples with up to 156 collision zones.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile robots can be easily equipped with numerous sensors which can aid in the tasks of localization and ego-motion estimation. Two such examples are Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), which provide a gravity vector via pitch and roll angular velocities, and wide-angle or panoramic imaging devices. As the number of powerful devices on a single robot increases, an important problem arises in how to fuse the information coming from multiple sources to obtain an accurate and efficient motion estimate. The IMU provides real-time readings which can be employed in orientation estimation, while in principle an Omnidirectional camera provides enough information to estimate the full rigid motion (up to translational scale). However, in addition to being computationally overwhelming, such an estimation is traditionally based on the sensitive search for feature correspondences between image frames. In this paper we present a novel algorithm that exploits information from an IMU to reduce the five parameter motion search to a three-parameter estimation. For this task we formulate a generalized Hough transform which processes image features directly to avoid searching for correspondences. The Hough space is computed rapidly by re-treating the transform as a convolution of spherical images.",

Based on the general dynamic model of the chain of flexible links, equations of motion for the manipulator are derived using the extended Hamilton\u2019s principle. An analytical solution for the inverse dynamics problem using the assumed modes method is presented to compute the required joint torques for the tip mass to move along the constrained surface. Cubic-splines interpolation has been adjusted for the joint motion profiles to make sure that the end-effector will follow the prescribed trajectory without degradation. The knot points of the trajectories have been chosen on the constrained surface to achieve minimum contact force as possible.",

We describe how to formalize a SLAM problem as a typical kinematic problem and we propose a simple SLAM algorithm based on an interval-based kinematic method called Cuik previously developed in our group. This new algorithm solves the SLAM problem taking advantage of the structure imposed in the SLAM problem by the motion and sensing capabilities of the autonomous robots. However, since we use a kinematic approach instead of a probabilistic one (the usual approach for SLAM) we can perfectly model the constraints between robot poses and between robot poses and landmarks, including the nonlinearities, and we can ensure those constraints to be fulfilled at any time during the map construction and refinement. The viability of the new algorithm is shown with a small test.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between men and machines has become an important topic for the robotics community as it can generalize the use of robots. In this context, advanced robots must integrate capabilities to interpret humans motion as well as persons gestures in order to perform tasks for the humans or in synergy with them. The purpose of this paper is to show a real-time system for face/hand tracking and hand gesture recognition in the particle filtering framework. We introduce mechanisms for visual data fusion within particle filtering to develop trackers combining in a novel way color and shape cues, skin blobs or frontal face detection. For the purpose of face tracking, the fusion of modalities based on color and shape allows to avoid noticeable drift, even possible subsequent loss in the worst case. For gestures interpretation, an extension is proposed to achieve in the tracking loop the recognition of the current hand posture and of its motion in the video stream. In both tracking scenarios, the combination or fusion of cues proves to be more robust in cluttered environments than any of the cues individually. The global performances of the proposed trackers and future works are also discussed.",

The first one employs classical preattentive saliency computa tions to select a reduced set of interest regions from the whole input image (data-driven stage). The second stage selects from the output of the first selection stage the region that can be considered as a potential landmark (model-driven stage). This potential landmark is the input of the attentive stage, that must characterize it and finally determine if this object is a real landmark. The used imaging sensor is a stereo vision system which is capable of providing depth data as well as color images. This stereo vision system is mounted on an autonomous mobile robot and serves map-building and localisation purposes. We present results achieved by applying the proposed visual attention scheme to on-line acquired stereo pairs of indoor and outdoor scenes.",

This paper addresses deadlock problems in automated manufacturing systems with multiple resource service. Petri net is used to model the flow of the parts and the usage and release of the resources. Deadlock structure objects in Petri net models, which lead the system to deadlock, are characterized. This paper proves that, by adding a control place for each deadlock structure so that the number of parts in the deadlock structure is limited, deadlock can be successfully prevented. Using the including relation between deadlock structures, from inside to outside, the Petri net controller is synthesized, and it is proved that the presented controller is a maximally primitive Petri net controller.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid progress of the robotic technology, it is becoming increasingly common to have multiple robots working together for material transport, cooperative assembly, etc. To ensure the proper handling of the load, especially if it is fragile or needs to be moved rapidly, the constraint force needs to be carefully managed. Tight force coordination is possible if all robots share their force information and the grasp geometry is completely known. When this is not the case, a common approach is to use the leader/follower strategy, where the leader provides the position control for the load and other robots comply based on the individual contact force measurements. This paper considers an alternate decentralized motion and force control method, where all robots participate in the control of the load without sharing any position and force information. Under centralized squeeze force control, robot motion is not affected. However, when the force control is decentralized, a perturbation term is added to the motion control loop. We show that the nominal exponential stability of the motion loop preserves the closed loop stability in the presence of this perturbation. Simulation and experimental results are included to demonstrate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The main task of a voice-enabled tour-guide robot in mass exhibition setting is to engage visitors in dialogue and provide as much exhibit information as possible in a limited time. In managing such a dialogue, extracting the user (visitor) goal or intention at each dialogue state is the key issue. In mass exhibition conditions uncooperative visitors and speech recognition limitations in noisy acoustic conditions may jeopardize user goal identification. In this paper, we introduce the use of sequential dialogue repair techniques, exploiting the inherent multimodality of the tour-guide robot, in order to reduce the risk of the resulting communication failures. Bayesian networks fusing acoustic and non-acoustic modalities during user goal identification serve as input to graphical models known as decision networks. Decision networks allow the definition of dialogue repair sequences as actions, and provide a decision-theoretic utility-based strategy for selecting actions. The benefits of the proposed repair strategies are demonstrated through experiments with the dialogue system of RoboX, a tour-guide robot successfully deployed at the Swiss National Exhibition (Expo. 02).",

Examples of these tasks include search and rescue, landmine detection, and carpet cleaning. Many researchers have been studying control, sensing, and coordination for these tasks. However, one major problem has not been fully addressed: the initial deployment of mobile robots. The deployment problem considers the number of robots needed and their initial locations. In this paper, we present a solution for the deployment problem when robots have limited energy and time to collectively accomplish coverage tasks. Simulation results show that our method uses 26% fewer robots comparing with two heuristics for covering the same size of area.",

In order to address these limitations, we have developed robotic systems that actively steer a needle in soft tissue. A bevel (asymmetric) tip causes the needle to bend during insertion, and steering is enhanced when the needle is very flexible. An experimental needle steering robot was designed that includes force/torque sensing, horizontal needle insertion, stereo image data acquisition, and controlled actuation of needle rotation and translation. Experiments were performed with a phantom tissue to determine the effects of insertion velocity and bevel tip angle on the needle path, as well as the forces acting on the needle during insertion. Results indicate that needle steering inside tissue does not depend on insertion velocity, but does depend on bevel tip angle. In addition, the forces acting on the needle are directly related to the insertion velocity.",

        "abstract": "External force at the end-effector is often required for the force control of robotic manipulator. In some cases, the force information measured by wrist force sensor consists of the external force and the undesired inertial force arising from the acceleration of the end-effector. Up to now, it is still difficult to extract the external force exactly for the insufficiency of acceleration information. A novel six-axis accelerometer in the type of dual annular membranes structure is presented in this paper. It can simultaneously measure all three linear acceleration components ax, ay, az and three angular acceleration components \u03b1x, \u03b1y, \u03b1z, which can be used to extract the external forces. The sensor structure and its sensing principle are described. The rated strains and interference strains obtained from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations indicate that the accelerometer has a low level cross-sensitivity. The characteristic experiments reveal that the experimental sensitivities are in good correspondence with the results of the FEM simulations. It also shows that this accelerometer has a good linearity and minor interference errors as well as principle errors.",

In our Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA) approach, actuators control in real-time both the reference position and the mechanical impedance of the moving parts in the machine in such a way to optimize performance while intrinsically guaranteeing safety. In this paper we describe an implementation of such concepts, consisting of a novel electromechanical Variable Stiffness Actuation (VSA) motor. The design and the functioning principle of the VSA are reported, along with the analysis of its dynamic behavior. A novel scheme for feedback control of this device is presented, along with experimental results showing performance and safety of a one-link arm actuated by the VSA motor.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve human-like quick eye movements and image processing for intelligent mobile robots, a high speed binocular camera head is developed. The aim of the binocular camera head is to provide a platform to reproduce the human brain information processing. Two neuromorphic vision chips with lenses, which are developed imitating human retinas, will be mounted on the camera head. The camera head has an azimuth DOF for each camera and a common elevation DOF, thus there are three DOF in total. The weight of the camera head is strictly limited, since it is mounted on a mobile robot. In order to satisfy both demands for the quick movements and light weight, the camera head is designed based upon a simple parallel mechanism. Consequently, all motors are mounted on the base. The characteristics of the camera head are quickness, lightweight and simple mechanism. This paper presents the design, development and evaluation of the camera head. The inverse and forward kinematics are also discussed in this paper.",

The actuation system utilizes the catalytic decomposition of a monopropellant as a hot gas generator for powering pneumatic-type actuators. Specifically, pressurization of a pneumatic actuator is provided via solenoid injection valves, which control the flow of the monopropellant through a catalyst pack into the respective sides of the cylinder. Depressurization is provided by a three-way proportional spool valve, which can exhaust one of the two cylinder chambers. A prototype of the actuation system is described, and experimental data is presented that demonstrates good force and motion tracking performance. Experimental results characterizing the energetic performance of the system demonstrate that the prototype provides an energetic figure of merit an order of magnitude greater than that of battery-powered servomotors.",

        "abstract": "We investigated some configurations of middle-size and high-aspect ratio wings for flapping flight by fluid-structure interaction simulation. Mimicking the flapping flight of insects is a useful method of microrobot motion. Its comprehensive unsteady aerodynamics has gradually been unraveled and several types of flapping-flight robots have been proposed. We examined the motion of a dragonfly, and try to apply it to microrobots. In designing such nimble flapping flight, adequate evaluation of the deformation of the wing is unavoidable. Wings of such species have high aspect ratio because a small momentum of inertia around the longitudinal axis is a great advantage in controlling. Such a slender wing is easy to twist around the longitudinal direction. Thus, in order to design such a wing, the wing behavior caused by interaction with the airflow must be analyzed, and the adequate stiffness must be determined. We designed two types of wings based on the architecture of the dragonfly\u2019s wing, and examined the performance of the wings by fluid-structure interaction analysis. Here we show some examples of the designs and the performance of the wings for hovering, as the results of the first trial.",

        "abstract": "The design of a free piston compressor (FPC) intended as a pneumatic power supply for pneumatically actuated autonomous robots is presented in this paper. The FPC is a proposed device that utilizes combustion to compress air into a high-pressure supply tank by using the kinetic energy of a free piston. The device is configured such that the transduction from thermal energy to stored energy, in the form of compressed gas, is efficient relative to other small-scale portable power supply systems. This efficiency is achieved by matching the dynamic load of the compressor to the ideal adiabatic expansion of the hot gas combustion products. The device proposed exploits this fact by first converting thermal energy into kinetic energy of the free piston, and then compressing air during a separate compression phase. The proposed technology is intended to provide a compact pneumatic power supply source appropriate for human-scale robots. The design and implementation of the FPC is shown, and preliminary experimental results are presented and discussed with regard to efficiency and energetic characteristics of the device. Most significantly, the device is shown to operate nearly adiabatically.",

First, the basic equations for jumping are derived and the simulation is performed. Then, the relationship between the jumping height and the pressure-receiving area of the cylinder is considered when the volume or the stroke of the cylinder is kept constant. This allows calculation of the optimal cross sectional area. In addition, the jumping height is also affected by the weight ratio between the rod and the cylinder tube. Based on these results, a robot equipped with a cylinder of the appropriate dimensions controlled by a well-selected valve is re-engineered and demonstrated. Experimental results show that the improved robot can jump considerably higher than the former design with the same energy efficiency, as shown in the following video. http://www.cm.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/study/jump/home.html.",

        "abstract": "We present a design concept and two initial prototypes of a robot arm for assembly operations inside an aircraft wing-box. The wing-box has a large span, but is only accessible through multiple small portholes along its length. The arm is compact enough to enter the wing-box through the small portholes and is capable of subsequent reconfiguration so as to access a number of assembly points inside the wing-box. Traditional electromechanical actuators are unsuitable for our purpose, because of limited space and large payload requirements. We use an actuator module comprising Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, which are known for their high stress to volume ratio. Our design also addresses the issue of limited strain of SMA wires through a displacement amplification mechanism. Our compact, high displacement actuator module can be readily integrated into the structure of the robot arm. We also discuss a deployment scheme for the robot arm, which eliminates gravity loading during the reconfiguration phase, and also helps to position the end effecter at the various assembly points inside the wing-box.",

However, it suffers from the well known trade-off between resolution and field of view. Traditional solutions involve moving the sample under the microscope using a moving stage or moving the microscope itself, and switching between low and high magnification objective lenses. In this paper, we present a new optical microscope design that uses a 2-dimensional high speed, high precision steering mirror system to scan the sample. By stitching the images together as a mosaic, we have the potential to achieve both high resolution and large field of view. Working in coordination with a deformable mirror, this arrangement offers certain advantages over the current state of the art in demanding spatial-temporal observations. We describe the theory of operation, our design methodology, and present a preliminary simulated design. A reduced functionality experimental prototype has been constructed to demonstrate the basic efficacy of the concept and we demonstrate with both biological and micro-assembly examples.",

        "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of a real-time vision-based approach to detect and track features in a structured environment using an autonomous helicopter. Using vision as a sensor enables the helicopter to track features in an urban environment. We use vision for feature detection and a combination of vision and GPS for navigation and tracking. The vision algorithm sends high level velocity commands to the helicopter controller which is then able to command the helicopter to track them. We present results obtained from flight trials that demonstrate our algorithms for detection and tracking are applicable in real world scenarios by applying them to the task of tracking rectangular features in structured environments.",

We first study the distributions of the angular positions and show that these distributions can be considered as Gaussian. We compute repeatability in different locations of the workspace using the experimental angular covariance matrix and the stochastic ellipsoid modeling. We measure repeatability and observe a high variability. We explain the phenomenon by drawing the distribution of the 30 sample repeatability index. We then compare the computed andmeasured repeatability and conclude that our modeling gives good results. We analyse the incidence of weight and workspace location on repeatability and bring additional results to the existing literature.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a control architecture that allows multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to cooperatively detect mobile RF (Radio Frequency) emitting ground targets. The architecture is developed under the premise that UAVs are controlled as a distributed system. The distributed system-based technique maximizes the search and detection capabilities of multiple UAVs. We use a hybrid approach that combines a set of intentional cooperative rules with emerging properties of a swarm to accomplish the objective. The UAVs are equipped only with low-precision RF direction finding sensors and we assume the targets may emit signals randomly with variable duration. Once a target is detected, each UAV optimizes a cost function to determine whether to participate in a cooperative localization task. The cost function balances between the completion of detecting all targets (global search) in the search space and increasing the precision of cooperatively locating already detected targets. A search function for each UAV determines the collective search patterns of collaborating UAVs. Two functions used by each UAV determine (1) the optimal number of UAVs involved in locating targets, (2) the search pattern to detect all targets, and (3) the UAV flight path for an individual UAV. We show the validity of our algorithm using simulation results. Hardware implementation of the strategies is planned for this coming year.",

By combining omnidirectional and active pan-tilt cameras, a robust vision system is created that builds on the strengths of each camera type. The system can be easily configured to provide nearly an entire spherical field of view and independently track several targets of interest within the environment. The novel design allows the camera modules to be stacked, creating a vertical sensor structure. This vertical arrangement also provides a simple solution to the epipolar geometry and triangulation for target localization. Applications for this modular system can range from simple mobile robot navigation to complex multi-target tracking and surveillance.",

The test in a water tunnel is further carried out to investigate the relationship between the vortex aerofoil design and turbulences created. The testing results show that the triangle wing aerofoil appears greater maximum lift coefficient and little occurrence of vortex and turbulences.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a new type of hybrid element to realize a human-friendly support device. The element is a flexible actuator (called Sponge Core Soft Rubber Actuator) and its structure is a soft mechanism in which a sponge rubber is covered with silicone rubber. In addition to its actuation capability, the element can estimate external forces by making use of the relation between inner pressure and external force. Therefore, the element can be used as a hybrid element that has both actuator and force sensor functions. This paper discusses the hybrid element design, actuator characteristics, and force control and sensing abilities of the element. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed hybrid element.",

In this operation, to introduce surgical instruments, spatulas which push tissues aside and retain the approach path to the affected area as well as workspace for the insertion of such instruments are necessary. Therefore, a new type of hydraulically-driven flexible manipulator for neurosurgery has been developed. With an attached balloon and using only physiological saline for the drive system, safety of the brain tissue, especially in terms of pressure, is assured as is the simplicity of the mechanism. In addition, this provides the advantage of MRI compatibility. From the results of several evaluations, this manipulator has been proved effective as a new type of medical device.",

WT-4 was developed to overcome the problems related to the lack of variation in the formant frequency of the sounds generated by the previous talking robot WT-3. These problems arose particularly on the first formant (F1) where frequencies of less than 500 [Hz] could not be reached. And the differences among WT-3\u2019s vowels were not clear; which may have been caused by the sound source of the vocal cords and the lips. Therefore, the connection between the vocal cords and the vocal tract was improved, as well as the lips mechanism. As the result of these improvements, WT-4\u2019s sounds were quite similar to a human\u2019s, and WT-4 was able to reproduce suitable sounds using auditory feedback.",

The aim of this study is to realize precise and quantitative texture sensing. Three physical properties, roughness, softness, and friction are known to constitute texture perception of humans. The sensor is designed to measure the three specific types of information by adopting the mechanism of human texture perception. First, four features of the human finger that were focused on in designing the novel sensor are introduced. Each feature is considered to play an important role in texture perception; the existence of nails and bone, the multiple layered structure of soft tissue, the distribution of mechanoreceptors, and the deployment of epidermal ridges. Next, detailed design of the texture sensor based on the design concept is explained, followed by evaluating experiments and analysis of the results. Finally, we conducted texture perceptive experiments of actual material using the developed sensor, thus achieving the information expected. Results show the potential of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an autonomous mobile surveillance system usually used in a factory premises with some high-rise buildings. This system consists of a wireless LAN network, a base station and an autonomous vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a GPS/INS navigation system using the network-based Real-Time Kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) with Positioning Augmentation Services (PASTM, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation 2003), an Area Laser Radar (ALR), a CCD camera called slaved camera, and an Omni-Directional Vision (ODV) sensor for surveillance and reconnaissance. The vehicle switches navigation modes according to the vehicle status. It has three guidance modes, which are \u201cNormal\u201d, \u201cRoad tracking\u201d, and \u201cCrossing recognition\u201d. A field test result shows that the vehicle can track the planned path within 0.10[m] accuracy at straight paths and within 0.25[m] for curved paths even if RTK fixed solutions are not available. Field experiments and analyses have proved that the proposed navigation method can provide good enough guidance accuracy even under poor satellite visibility and that the panorama image database with absolute position is useful for surveillance.",

This paper formulates the problem of steering a very flexible needle through firm tissue as a nonholonomic kinematics problem, and demonstrates how planning can be accomplished using diffusion-based motion planning on the Euclidean group, SE(3). In the present formulation, the tissue is treated as isotropic and no obstacles are present. The bevel tip of the needle is treated as a nonholonomic constraint that can be viewed as a 3D extension of the standard kinematic cart or unicycle. A deterministic model is used as the starting point, and reachability criteria are established. A stochastic differential equation and its corresponding Fokker-Planck equation are derived. The Euler-Maruyama method is used to generate the ensemble of reachable states of the needle tip. Inverse kinematics methods developed previously for hyper-redundant and binary manipulators that use this probability density information are applied to generate needle tip paths that reach the desired targets.",

The motion of active joints of the manipulator are measured with sensors with a known accuracy \u00b1\u0394\u03c1. These errors together with bounded manufacturing errors on the parameters describing the geometry of the robot induces a positioning errors \u0394X of the platform. We present an algorithm that allows one to determine geometries of the robot ensuring that these positioning errors will lie within pre-specified limits for any pose of the robot in its workspace even if the physical realization of the robot differs from the theoretical model while staying within the given manufacturing errors bounds. A by-product variant of this algorithm allows one to compute the maximal positioning errors of a given robot up to a predefined accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The paper considers the problem of setting the dimensions of a system of constrained parallel robots to ensure that together they can position an end-effector in a specified set of positions. The focus is on five degree-of-freedom serial chains that provide point contact, modelled as a spherical joint, with the end-effector. We identify seven such chains which can be used to form 756 parallel robots ranging from one to three degrees of freedom. The algebraic equations of the surfaces that contain the center of the spherical joint of these seven chains can be used to form the design equations for the parallel system. These equations are solved to determine some or all of the structural parameters depending upon the required number of task positions. We demonstrate this by computing the dimensions of a symmetric 3CS parallel robot such that it guides the end-effector through three arbitrarily defined task positions.",

        "abstract": "Besides a quantity of well-known positive characteristics, parallel robots also obtain a couple of negative properties which limit their efficient use in certain application areas nowadays. Direct kinematic singularities that constrain the internal workspace are one of these inconvenient properties. This paper establishes a unique index, with physical meaning, that indicates the entrance of the Hexa parallel robot, considering its joint limits, to all its direct kinematic singularities. For this, we complement two methods to detect singularities: the power inspired measure method and the Grassmann geometry method. The applied procedure uses screw theory and line geometry tools to represent movements, actions and lines, respectively, in the robot. This procedure is practically verified in Hexa robot and shows that some singularities are overlapped forming large singularities.",

This is shown to lead to an undesirable limit cycle due to a Hopf bifurcation. Second, 2 new discrete controllers and models for visual servoing ODIS are derived, which are closer to the servoing methods used in experiments. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop systems are locally asymptotically stable. Finally, experiments are presented which demonstrate successful discrete visual servoing.",

        "abstract": "Constructing climbing behaviors for hyper-redundant robots that account for the system dynamics requires a model of robot dynamics under contact and friction. One common model, rigid-body dynamics with coulomb friction, unfortunately is both an ambiguous and inconsistent set of dynamic axioms. This paper addresses the ambiguity problem by developing an algorithm which computes the set of joint torques such that all solutions are guaranteed to produce the desired system behavior. This algorithm is applied to a type of robot climbing which we denote climbing via bracing where a hyper-redundant robot stabilizes itself against gravity by pressing outward to induce friction. By bracing with a fraction of the robot, which we term a brace the remainder of the robot remains free to move upward and brace at a higher location. A sequence of braces thus moves the robot upward.",

The robot is actuated with pleated pneumatic artificial muscles, which have interesting characteristics that can be exploited for legged machines. They have a high power to weight ratio, an adaptable compliance and they can reduce impact effects. The discussion of the control architecture focusses on the joint trajectory generator and the tracking controller which is divided in four parts: a computed torque module, an inverse delta-p unit, a local PI controller and a bang-bang pressure controller. The control design is divided into single support and double support where specifically the computed torque differs for these two phases. A full hybrid dynamic simulation model is used to evaluate the control architecture of the biped. This simulator combines the dynamical behaviour of the robot with the thermodynamical effects that take place in the muscle-valves system. The observed hardware limitations of the real robot and expected model errors are taken into account in order to give a realistic qualitative evaluation of the control performance and to test the robustness. Finally the first results of the incorporation of this control architecture in the real biped Lucy are given.",

        "abstract": "Human beings cannot control a position of sphere on the disk without seeing it. Because under such a condition, as we determine the position and estimate the motion of sphere by use of visual information, it is very difficult for human beings to control it using only tactile or force information of a hand. This is why the tactile and the force information are less quantitative for human beings than the visual information. On the other hand, a robot can deal with this qualitative information as quantitative values. Therefore, the robot seems to have the possibility that it carries out such difficult tasks for human beings using only force information. In this paper, we propose the estimation method of the position of sphere (made of crystal) on the disk from the force information measured with three-directional force sensors. Then, we tried to examine whether the robot fingers can control the motion of sphere on the disk using only these force information. Actually, the position and the velocity information estimated from force information enable the robot fingers to control the sphere by applying a simple PD control algorithm. Moreover, this paper adds Lyanpunov\u2019s stability analysis of the proposed control algorithm. Finally, this results show new robot task which human beings cannot realize, whose demonstration is very interesting.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the dynamic modeling of linear object deformation based on differential geometry coordinates. Deformable linear objects such as cables and strings are widely used in our daily life, electric industries, medical operations. Modeling, control, and manipulation of deformable linear objects are keys to many applications. We have proposed the differential geometry coordinates to describe the 2D/3D deformation of a linear object with the minimum number of parameters. Based on this description, we have formulated the static deformation of a linear object using the differential geometry coordinates but the dynamic deformation has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we apply differential geometry coordinates to the dynamic modeling of linear objects. First, we formulate the dynamic 2D deformation of an inextensible linear object based on a differential geometry coordinate system. Second, we show simulation results using the proposed modeling technique. Next, we apply the proposed dynamic modeling to the control of a flexible link.",

In this paper, we present a novel method for dynamic recalibration for a structured light vision system. Given a single image in the scene, a closed-form solution for the pose of the camera is derived by enforcing the constraints via its generic Homography. Then 3D reconstruction can be performed immediately even when the system is displaced or its configuration is changed. Experiments have been carried out and satisfactory results are obtained by evaluating dimensional measurements and back-projection errors.",

The measure of stability is computed by solving for the range of acceptable velocities and accelerations that satisfy a set of dynamic constraints. The maximum acceptable velocity serves as a dynamic stability measure, whereas the maximum acceptable acceleration at zero velocity serves as a static stability measure. The utility of the static and dynamic stability margins are demonstrated for both two dimensional and longitudinal quasi-3D motion in several examples.",

        "abstract": "In order to implement a continuous and robust dynamic localization of a mobile robot, the fusion of dead reckoning and absolute sensors is often used. Depending on the objectives of precision or integrity, the choice of an algorithm could be crucial. For example, if the models used for the fusion are non linear, classical tools (such as a Kalman filter) cannot guarantee maximum error estimation. There are bounded error approaches that are insensitive to non linearity. In this context, the random errors are only modeled by their maximum bound. This paper compares a technique based on constraints propagation on intervals, with the usual Extended Kalman Filter for the data fusion of redundant sensors. We have thus developed both techniques and we consider the fusion of wheel encoders, a gyro and a differential GPS receiver. Experimental results show that the precision of a constraints propagation technique can be very good with guaranteed estimations. Moreover, such an approach is well adapted to a real time implementation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new adaptive controller for dynamic image-based visual servoing of a robot manipulator when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. To cope with nonlinear dependence of the image Jacobian on the unknown parameters, this controller employs a matrix called nonscaled image Jacobian which does not depend on the scale factors determined by the depths of feature points. By removing the scale factors, the camera parameters appear linearly in the close-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm, different from Slotine and Li\u2019s, is developed to estimate their values on-line. In the parameter adaptation, in addition to the regressor term, our algorithm also uses the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane so as to guarantee the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale. A new Lyapunov function is introduced to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors based on the robot dynamics. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based planners have solved difficult problems in many applications of motion planning in recent years. In particular, techniques based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have generated highly successful single-query planners. Even though RRTs work well on many problems, they have weaknesses which cause them to explore slowly when the sampling domain is not well adapted to the problem. In this paper we characterize these issues and propose a general framework for minimizing their effect. We develop and implement a simple new planner which shows significant improvement over existing RRT-based planners. In the worst cases, the performance appears to be only slightly worse in comparison to the original RRT, and for many problems it performs orders of magnitude better.",

Our purpose is to utilize microorganisms as micro-robots by using galvanotaxis.

However, until now the explanation of Paramecium galvanotaxis in previous works has remained only qualitative. In this paper, we construct a novel model of galvanotaxis as a minimal step to utilizing Paramecium cells as micro-robots. Numerical experiments for our model demonstrate realistic behaviors, such as U-turn motions, like those of real cells.",

The symmetrical arrangement of the springs supporting the bowl allow us to predict a simple structure for the stiffness matrix of the system. The cylindrical symmetry of the bowl itself then means that the linearized rigid body dynamics of the system can be simplified to a 2-dimensional system. The solutions to this system are elliptical motions of the bowl, vibrating about the symmetry axis and along it at the same time. We are able to find a condition for the system to be at resonance. There is some debate about how the parts move up the helical track inside the bowl. We are able to show that one alternative, a \u201cslip-stick\u201d motion, is unlikely.",

        "abstract": "This paper applies a new kind of recurrent neu ral networks (RNN) called Echo State Networks (ESN) [4] to the classical problem of motor speed control for a differential drive robot. ESNs can be trained orders of magnitude faster than other RNNs and previous simulation-based investigations showed promising results when ESNs where used as black box models in the domain of system identification or as a low-level plant controllers [11]. This paper validates for the first time the predicted superior simulation results by physical experiments. In order to compare the quality of an ESN controller fairly to the original PID based controller a complete test work flow is established. It consists of an embedded implementation of the ESN motor-controller, a trace facility, a procedure to train a new ESN motor-controller according to these traced data and a user interface to define and control test-drives of the robot. The results prove that the ESN controller shows a slightly better control quality as a PID controller with respect to various important error norms from control theory. For the experiments we used a RoboCup robot and for this special application scenario the ESN controller actually outperforms the PID.",

Our educational goals are to further an appreciation and understanding of NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), to illustrate the role of robotic rovers in scientific exploration, and to provide hands-on learning experiences that demonstrate robot autonomy. We have designed a new robot, the Personal Exploration Rover (PER) and the related interactive components of a museum exhibit to achieve these goals. Here we describe the exhibits developed and the formal evaluation results of the exhibits' educational impact and efficacy. These results suggest techniques by which learning can be measured and used as an indicator of successful human-robot interaction.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Stable and effective enforcement of hard constraints is one of the crucial components in controlling physics-based dynamic simulation systems. The conventional explicit Baumgarte constraint stabilization confines the time step to be within a stability limit and requires users to pick problem-dependent coefficients to achieve fast convergence or to prevent oscillations. The recently proposed post-stabilization method has shown a successful constraint drift reduction but it does not guarantee the physically correct behavior of motion and requires additional computational cost to decrease the constraint errors. This paper presents our new implicit constraint enforcement technique that is stable over large time steps and does not require problem dependent stabilization parameters. This new implicit constraint enforcement method uses the future time step to estimate the correct magnitude of the constraint forces, resulting in better stability over bigger time steps. More importantly, the proposed method generates physically conforming constraint forces while minimizing the constraint drifts, resulting in physically correct motion. Its asymptotic computational complexity is same as the explicit Baumgarte method. It can be easily integrated into various constrained dynamic systems including rigid body or deformable structure applications. This paper describes a formulation of implicit constraint enforcement and an accumulated constraint error and dynamic behavior analysis for comparison with existing methods.",

        "abstract": "RatSLAM is a system for vision based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) that has been shown to be capable of building stable representations of real world environments. In this paper we describe a method for using RatSLAM representations as the basis for navigation to designated goal locations. The method uses a new component, goal memory, to learn the temporal gradient between places. Paths are recalled or inferred from the goal memory by following the temporal gradient from the robot\u2019s current position to the goal location. Experimental results have been gathered in a combined office and laboratory environment using a Pioneer robot. The experiments show that the robot can perform vision based SLAM on-line and in real time, and then use those representations immediately to navigate directly to designated goal locations.",

        "abstract": "Mobile multi-robot teams are useful in many critical applications such as search and rescue. Explicit communication among robots in such mobile multi-robot teams is useful for the coordination of such teams as well as exchanging data. Since many applications for mobile robots involve scenarios in which communication infrastructure may be damaged or unavailable, mobile robot teams frequently need to communicate with each other by using ad hoc networking. In such scenarios, energy efficient routing protocols to deliver messages among robots are a key requirement. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two routing protocols tailored for use in ad hoc networks formed by mobile multi-robot teams: Mobile Robot Distance Vector (MRDV) and Mobile Robot Source Routing (MRSR). Both protocols exploit the unique mobility characteristics of mobile robot networks to perform efficient routing. Our simulation study show that both MRDV and MRSR incur lower overhead while operating in mobile robot networks when compared to traditional mobile ad hoc network routing protocols such as DSR and AODV.",

Addressing these challenges is particularly important in robotic surgical systems, where motion of the patient can result in surgical errors that degrade the quality of the surgery. The use of motion compensation by a robot manipulator to cancel the motion of the patient would represent a significant improvement over existing techniques. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the role of force-feedback in a motion-canceling teleoperation system. We have developed an experimental system in which the roles of motion-cancellation and teleoperation have been decoupled between separate robot manipulators. Our results lead us to the conclusion that force-feedback minimizes contact forces in motion-canceling teleoperation due to: 1) minimization of the collision forces due to the initial contact with the target surface, and 2) minimizing forces due to accidental contact generated by tracking errors by taking advantage of the naturally modulated impedance of the human hand during such tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a control method to realize continuous brachiation. The target brachiation is basically divided into two actions: a swing action and a locomotion action. In order to realize the continuous brachiation effectively and stably, it is necessary to control these actions according to the total energy of the system. Because brachiation has been modeled as a pendulum-like motion and the amplitude of the oscillation determines whether the robot can grasp the target bar or not. In consideration of this point, an energy based control method is proposed and introduced into the swing action controller. The purpose of this method is to control the angular velocity of the swing action in order to satisfy the desired energy evaluated by the distance of bars. Experimental results show that the robot can successfully achieve smooth, continuous brachiation.",

        "abstract": "Energy of Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) is usually supplied by batteries with finite energy. In order to extend run-time of battery-powered WMR, it is necessary to minimize the energy consumption. The energy is dissipated mostly in the motors, which strongly depends on the velocity profile. This paper investigates energy efficiency for typical 3-step velocity control methods to minimize a new energy object function which considers practical energy consumption dissipated in motors related to motor dynamics, velocity profile, and motor control input. We performed analyses on energy consumption for the four typical 3-step velocity profiles: S-C-S, T-C-T, S-C-T, and T-C-S (S is an acceleration/deceleration section by step control input, T is an acceleration/deceleration section by acceleration/deceleration phase of trapezoidal velocity profile, and C is a cruise section with a constant velocity). Also we suggested an efficient iterative search algorithm with binary search which can find the numerical solution quickly. We performed various computer simulations to show the performance of energy-efficient 3-step velocity control in comparison with a conventional 3-step trapezoidal profile with a reasonable constant acceleration rate as a benchmark. Simulation results reveal that the S-C-T is the most energy efficient 3-step velocity control profile, which enables WMR to extend working time up to 30%.",

        "abstract": "A humanoid robot under real-world environments usually hears mixtures of sounds, and thus three capabilities are essential for robot audition; sound source localization, separation, and recognition of separated sounds. While the first two are frequently addressed, the last one has not been studied so much. We present a system that gives a humanoid robot the ability to localize, separate and recognize simultaneous sound sources. A microphone array is used along with a real-time dedicated implementation of Geometric Source Separation (GSS) and a multi-channel post-filter that gives us a further reduction of interferences from other sources. An automatic speech recognizer (ASR) based on the Missing Feature Theory (MFT) recognizes separated sounds in real-time by generating missing feature masks automatically from the post-filtering step. The main advantage of this approach for humanoid robots resides in the fact that the ASR with a clean acoustic model can adapt the distortion of separated sound by consulting the post-filter feature masks. Recognition rates are presented for three simultaneous speakers located at 2m from the robot. Use of both the post-filter and the missing feature mask results in an average reduction in error rate of 42% (relative).",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an information-based approach to solve the SLAM problem using stereo vision. This approach results for an improvement, in terms of both efficiency and robustness, of our early multi-view ICP randomized algorithm. Instead of minimizing an ICP-based cost, we propose the minimization of the entropy of the 2D distribution induced by the projection of the 3D point cloud. In addition we embed both the egomotion/action estimation algorithm which precedes global rectification and the new global rectification algorithm in an autonomous exploration schema. We assume plane-parallel environments and, for the sake of efficiency, we also assume a flat floor and a fixed stereo camera mounted on the robot. We show successful experiments both under tele-operating the robot and under autonomous navigation.",

Microscope images have particular problems: notably sparsity of features and ambiguity of motion.

The output of the search algorithm are sets of correspondences and the inter-image transformations.",

The proposed visual servoing is based on the epipolar geometry and exploits the auto-epipolar property, a special configuration for the epipoles which occurs when the desired and the current views undergo a pure translation. This occurrence is detectable observing when the bi-osculating mirror conics co-intersect at the two epipoles. The auto epipolar condition enables our controller to retrieve the equal orientation between target and current camera. Translation is performed by exploiting the epipoles. Simulated experiments and Lyapunov-based stability analysis demonstrate the parametric robustness of the proposed method.",

There is no simplification on the dynamic analysis. Considering any possible differentiable function for the road\u2019s curve, the effect of the road\u2019s roughness is completely described in the dynamic equation evaluation. Although there are complicated relations between the wheel and rough terrain, due to the efficient generalized coordinate selection, closed form dynamic equation of the motion is derived. Because of the closed form formulation, required time for simulation will be reduced. From the proposed complete model a simplified model for the controller design could be extracted",

Using the fingertip different accelerations (or angular accelerations), velocities (or angular velocities) and forces information measured in pushing operations, the algorithms to estimate the object mass (or moment of inertia) are described. Then, a line called C.M. Line, is defined in this paper. The line contains the center of mass and is between two fingertips which are in point-contact with an object side. By using two or more than two orientation-different C.M. lines, an algorithm to estimate the center of mass of the object is given. Lastly, experimental verification on the proposed approach is performed and its results are outlined.",

Towards this goal, in this paper we discuss the inverse dynamics of musculoskeletal human model using the data from electromyogram (EMG) and force sensor. The inverse dynamics of musculoskeletal human models is formulated as an optimization problem subject to equality and inequality conditions taking into account of the equation of motion and muscle model from physiology literature. We evaluate the developed algorithm on a complex musculoskeletal model with 366 muscles driving a skeleton with 155 degrees of freedom.",

A high-power electrostatic motor is introduced and its MR-compatibility is examined, both experimentally and theoretically. The proposed motor was fabricated with only paramagnetic materials, and its MR-compatibility was evaluated by measuring the output performance of the motor and the signal-to-noise ratios of the MRI images. The experimental results showed that motor\u2019s thrust force while positioned within the MRI is almost the same as that in normal operation. The signal-to-noise investigation indicated that the motor did not affect the MRI images when it was operated over 60 cm away from the MRI\u2019s RF coil. The theoretical calculations showed that the magnetic field generated by the motor is relatively small and the effect of the MRI\u2019s magnetic fields on the motor is negligible, suggesting that the motor is MR-compatible.",

Stretch-walking patterns with straight legs for a biped robot are compared with conventional walking patterns with bent legs in terms of energy consumption. This paper discusses walking pattern generation for various walks. To confirm the walking pattern evaluation, we have developed a biped robot, WABIAN-2/LL, whose leg mechanism differs from the conventional leg mechanism that has 3 DOF (degrees of freedom) in each ankle, 1 DOF in each knee, 3 DOF in each hip, and 2 DOF in the waist. Walking experiments are conducted with WABIAN-2/LL, and the results demonstrate that stretch walking patterns are effective in terms of energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the novel insight that the SLAM information matrix is exactly sparse in a delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used in view-based representations of the environment which rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data. Scan-matching raw data results in virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a place its previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature based SLAM information algorithms like Sparse Extended Information Filters or Thin Junction Tree Filters. These methods have to make approximations in order to force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse. The benefit of the exact sparseness of the delayed-state framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space parameterization without having to make any approximations. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the \u201cfull-covariance\u201d solution.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an experimental impulse-momentum-based approach to make artificially discrete impulses between rigid bodies with multiple contacts. It is impossible for us to sense precisely impulsive waves between such bodies. For this reason, we calibrate each impulsive distribution of encountered bodies by minimizing the differences of their momentum variations in real and virtual dynamic simulations. If number of contact point is one, we can distinguish vertical and horizontal planes at the contact in each local coordinate system. Therefore, an uncertain parameter set (width and height of impulse, and coefficient of restitution) of vertical impulse and the other set (static and kinetic friction coefficients) of horizontal impulse are individually calibrated. However, if the number is more than two, they should be simultaneously calibrated along X, Y, and Z axes of the global (absolute) coordinate system. Furthermore in order to get more precise multiple impulses, we successively calibrate impulse transmission ratios of two or more contacts between three or more bodies. Finally, by comparing artificial and experimental dynamic simulations, we ascertain feasibility of our impulse-momentum-based approach.",

As a first step, the kinematic equations are written so as to underline linearity in a suitable set of unknown parameters; then, the least-squares method is applied to estimate them. The wide literature on the least-squares formulation can thus be exploited; suitability of the data can be numerically verified. The proposed technique has been implemented on the Khepera II mobile robot; the obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method also in comparison to other existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "A passive multiple trailer system provides various practical advantages in order to develop multi-functional service robots. So far, we have proposed kinematic design of passive trailers, and backward motion control schemes in our prior work. In this paper, we propose two significant considerations based on practical experiences on backward control of multi-trailer system. The first issue is an analysis on the effect of joint errors. Joint errors include joint angle sensing errors and backlashes at the joints. Due to the joint error, the trajectory shows an offset distance from a desired reference path. A second issue is a slip detection based on a simplified dynamic model of the trailer system. The trailer system is designed based on the kinematic constraints, which imply rolling without slipping at wheels. We discuss how a practical trailer system can be controlled without violating kinematic constraints. Finally, we show the analogies and relationships between the off-hooked trailer and the previously proposed three point trailer.",

However, few experimental attempts on real hardware 3D humanoid robots have yet been made. Our goal in this paper is to present our achievement of 3D biped locomotion using a neural oscillator applied to a humanoid robot, QRIO. We employ reduced number of neural oscillators as the CPG model, along with a task space Cartesian coordinate system and utilizing entrainment property to establish stable walking gait. We verify robustness against lateral perturbation, through numerical simulation of stepping motion in place along the lateral plane. We then implemented it on the QRIO. It could successfully cope with unknown 3mm bump by autonomously adjusting its stepping period. Sagittal motion produced by a neural oscillator is introduced, and then overlapped with the lateral motion generator in realizing 3D biped locomotion on a QRIO humanoid robot.",

In this paper, we try to condition the rats to push the levers on the robot to obtain food by the robot autonomously showing its functions without experimenter\u2019s teaching. On animal psychology, \u201cshaping\u201d is used to condition animals to perform difficult or complex behavior that would rarely occur spontaneously. By importing the concept of \u201cshaping,\u201d we developed an operational pattern generation algorithm for the robot that enabled it to autonomously operate to show the rats its function. We then conducted an interaction experiment for evaluating this algorithm and confirmed the effectiveness of it.

A new test dataset is also presented, consisting of over 100,000 images of Lego bricks, acquired by repeatedly dropping the bricks.

        "abstract": "Map building through cooperative localisation (co-location) using circular geometric targets and a SICK laser range scanner is investigated. The tenet of co-location is circle detection in laser range data. Two methods for circle detection, a Range Weighted Circular Hough Transform (RWCHT) and a novel squared-residual voting strategy are compared and their performance assessed. The custom squared-residual voting strategy outperforms the RWCHT in all respects and is subsequently used for localisation and map building. The results include robust continuous localisation at speeds of 0.2m/s with 98% of scan frames used and an error of less than 0.03m. This localisation accuracy helps build maps of 96% quality and occupancy grids of cluttered environments despite the presence of distractors.",

We first recall the principle of the trajectory deformation and the role of the potential field gradient in the configuration space. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First we show that the potential field gradient can be computed without any closed-form expression of the potential function if this latter depends only on the distance between the robot and the obstacles. Then an algorithm to filter obstacles that have no influence in Robot-Obstacle interactions is presented. This algorithm takes advantage of the spatial coherence of the planned trajectory, and has been evaluated by experiments on mobile robot Hilare2 towing a trailer.",

This reduction in cost is essential for real-time interaction with mobile robots. The considerable speed ups are achieved using Krylov subspace methods and the fast Gauss transform. Although these state-of-the-art numerical algorithms are known, their application to semi-supervised learning, active learning and mobile robotics is new and should be of interest and great value to the robotics community. We apply our fast algorithms to interactive object recognition on Sony\u2019s ERS-7 Aibo. We provide comparisons that clearly demonstrate remarkable improvements in computational speed.",

For a fixed number of bodies the expected complexity is therefore close to O(n) . Our method also improves numerical robustness, and removes the need to explicitly compute the large matrices associated with rigid body contact problems.",

It speeds up Q-learning by applying memory-based sweeping and enforcing the \u201cadjoining property\u201d, a technique that exploits the natural ordering of sensory state spaces in many robotic applications by only allowing transitions between neighbouring states. The algorithm is tested within an image-based visual servoing framework on a docking task, in which the robot has to position its gripper at a desired configuration relative to an object on a table. In experiments, we compare the performance of the new algorithm with a hand-designed linear controller and a scheme using the linear controller as a bias to further accelerate the learning. By analysis of the controllability and docking time, we show that the biased learner could improve on the performance of the linear controller, while requiring substantially lower training time than unbiased learning (less than 1 hour on the real robot).",

These regions are useful to provide some robustness to the grasp in the presence of uncertainty as well as in grasp planning. Most of the approaches to the computation of these regions for N fingers work on the contact space, implying a N-dimensional problem. This paper presents a new approach to determine independent regions on polygonal objects considering N friction or frictionless contacts. The approach works on the object space, implying that it is always a two-dimensional problem and, since it is not necessary to compute all the force-closure space, it becomes a very fast approach. Besides, the approach is also flexible since constraints on the fingers placement can be easily introduced. Some graphical examples are included in the paper showing the simplicity of the methodology.",

        "abstract": "Many tasks examined for robotic application like rescue missions or humanitarian demining require a robotic vehicle to navigate in unstructured natural terrain. This paper introduces a motion control for a four-wheeled offroad vehicle trying to tackle the problems arising. These include rough ground, steep slopes, wheel slippage, skidding and others that are difficult to grasp with a physical model and often impossible to acquire with sensory equipment. Therefore, a more reactive approach is chosen using a behavior-based architecture. This way a certain generalization in unknown environment is expected. The resulting behavior network is described and experiments performed in a simulation environment as well as in real world are presented. Additionally the performance of the utilized vehicle in case of mechanical or electronic defects is examined in simulation.",

        "abstract": "The wide and potential applications of humanoid robots require that the robots can walk in complex environments cluttered with various obstacles. In such environments, the robots often need to overcome obstacles by stepping-over, stepping-on/down, or stepping-around. Before the implementation, it must be made sure whether the robots can do so, which is the so-called feasibility. In this paper, we give a more thorough feasibility analysis and more practical results of stepping-over and stepping-on/down, by extending our previous analyses in 2-D case to 3-D motion of the robot. Considering the geometry of the obstacle, the shapes and sizes, and kinematics of the robot legs, we use optimization technique to build corresponding models with nonlinear constraints (including those on collision avoidance and robot balance) to find the maximum height of the obstacle that the robot can step over or on/down. The results can be used as a prior knowledge and a database for motion planning of obstacle overcoming. The feasibility also provides an approach for evaluating the humanoid capability of obstacle overcoming.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Humanitarian demining is a dangerous and time consuming task which leads to more victims among deminers. Thus large efforts are being made worldwide in order to develop autonomous robots able to detect landmines without human participation. Any single sensor currently available for antipersonnel landmine detection can not provide the required detection/false alarm ratio, thus a combination of several sensors together with sensor fusion techniques is used. One of the main problems in the practical implementation of sensor fusion for a demining robot is the lack of experimental data for training the algorithms. Formally using a small training and evaluation set does not allow to take conclusions about the results of sensor fusion. This work presents a sensor fusion strategy which helps to overcome the problem of having few experimental data by creating an unified landmine signatures database. Using this database for sensor fusion in general and for features selection in particular is described. In addition to commonly used statistical features several new features are proposed which reflect the shape and the nature of the object. Moreover the designed ROIs extraction algorithm provides additional information allowing to improve features extraction. The results of features selection using a combination of Mutual information and Hausdorff distance are presented. Preliminary results of sensor fusion for pulsed and continuous metal detectors are also presented.",

The predominately used laser range finders have difficulties to detect thin metallic table legs and protruding table surfaces. This papers presents a simple yet robust approach to locate table surfaces using stereo vision in home and office environments. Disparity image data is used to first locate the ground plane with an approach building on the results in [3]. Exploiting the expectation of the floor plane, parallel surfaces are detected. Robustness is achieved by using a combination of local grouping processes and probabilistic estimation to cope with the noisy disparity data and to cope with the typically large number of spurious data points. Tables are detected and located independently of clutter on the table or the type of legs. Experiments in a home environment show detection accuracy of less than two centimeters in estimating the table or chair surface height.",

To conduct this investigation, long traverses must be made across the desert with instruments for geologic and biologic measurements. In this paper we motivate the Life in the Atacama project from both astrobiologic and robotic perspectives. We focus on some of the research challenges we are facing to enable endurance navigation, resource cognizance, and long-term survivability. We conducted our first scientific investigation and technical experiments in Chile with the mobile robot Hyperion. We describe the experiments and the results of our analysis.

The robot hand is driven by a unique method using ultrasonic motors and elastic elements. The method makes use of restoring force as driving power in grasping objects, which enables the hand to perform stable and compliant grasping motion without power supply. In addition, all the components are placed inside the hand because the ultrasonic motors have characteristics of high torque at low speed and compact size. Applying the driving method to a multi-DOF mechanism, a five-fingered robot hand is designed. The robot hand has twenty joints and DOF. It is almost equal in size to the hand of an average grown-up man. The robot hand is produced, and control experiments are conducted. As a result, the potential of the robot hand is confirmed.",

        "abstract": "In the context of virtualized reality based telemicromanipulation, we present in this paper a visual calibration technique for optical microscope coupled with a CCD camera. In contrast to previous approaches, a virtual calibration pattern is constructed using the micromanipulator with a sub-pixel localization in the image. We also present a new camera calibration algorithm based on Parallel Single-Plane properties. The proposed procedure leads to a linear system from which the solution gives directly both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the geometrical model. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques, our method provides an alternative technical solution, easy to use and flexible in the context of micromanipulation and virtual reality.",

The Micromechanical Flying Insect (MFI) project at UC Berkeley has developed a simple fabrication method which works very well at the scale where the links are a few millimeters in length and the flexures are few hundred microns in length. Previous analysis has concentrated on the geometry of the composite material links for creating rigid links. Recently, we have found that for useful performance, detailed analysis is required of the flexures also. This paper presents a brief analysis of the issues involved in the design of the flexural components of such mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "A new distributed coordination algorithm for multi-vehicle systems is presented in this paper. The algorithm combines a particular choice of navigation function with Voronoi partitions. This results not only in obstacle avoidance and motion to the goal, but also in a desirable geographical distribution of the vehicles. Our algorithm is decentralized in that each vehicle needs only to know the position of neigh boring vehicles, but no other inter-vehicle communication or centralized control are required. The algorithm gives a natural priority to safety, goal convergence, and formation keeping, in that (1) collision avoidance is guaranteed under all circumstances, (2) the vehicles will move toward the goal as long as a given optimization problem is feasible, and (3) if prior criteria admit, the vehicles tend to a desirable lattice formation. These theoretical properties are discussed in the paper and the performance of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with realistic models of twenty all-terrain vehicles. Planned experimental evaluation using customized miniature cars is also briefly described.",

In particular, the ability to autonomously select foot placement positions to avoid obstacles while walking is an important step towards improved navigation autonomy for humanoids. We present a footstep planner for the Honda ASIMO humanoid robot that plans a sequence of footstep positions to navigate toward a goal location while avoiding obstacles. The possible future foot placement positions are dependent on the current state of the robot. Using a finite set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal sequences of footstep locations up to a time-limited planning horizon. We present experimental results demonstrating the robot navigating through both static and dynamic known environments that include obstacles moving on predictable trajectories.",

We propose a new control strategy based on multisensor fusion with three different sensors\u2014 that is, encoders mounted at each joint of the robot with six degrees of freedom, a wrist force sensor and an accelerometer\u2014 whose goal is to obtain a suitable contact force estimator for the three Cartesian axes. This new observer contributes to overcome many of the difficulties of uncertain world models and unknown environments, which limit the domain of application of currents robots used without external sensory feedback. An impedance control scheme was proposed to verify the improvement. The experiments were carried out on an ABB industrial robot with open control system architecture.",

Furthermore, reactive nature of the robots add complexity to develop robot applications. These challenges raise safety issues seriously. Considering that safe operation of home service robots is crucial, current practice of validating robot applications is, however, not mature enough for wide deployment of home service robots. In this paper, we present our experience of developing and formally verifying discrete control software of Samsung Home Robot (SHR) using Esterel. We give a brief background on Esterel, then illuminate our result in formally verifying stopping behavior of SHR. Through the verification, we could detect and solve a feature interaction problem which caused the robot not to stop when a user commanded the robot to stop.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present singularity-free fully-isotropic parallel wrists (PWs) with two degrees of freedom. The mobile platform has 2 rotations (2R) driven by two rotary actuators mounted on the base. A method is proposed for structural synthesis of 2R-PWs with uncoupled motions and fully-isotropic based on the theory of linear transformations. A one-to-one correspondence exists between the actuated joint velocity space and the external velocity space of the moving platform. The Jacobian matrix mapping the two vector spaces of 2R-PWs with uncoupled motions is a diagonal 2\u00d72 matrix. We use the condition number and the manipulability ellipsoids for their performance analysis. The Jacobian matrix of fully-isotropic 2R-PWs presented in this paper is the identity 2\u00d72 matrix throughout their entire workspace. The condition number and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix being equal to one, the manipulator performs very well with regard to force and motion transmission capabilities. As far as we are aware this paper presents for the first time solutions of singularity-free parallel wrists fully-isotropic throughout their entire workspace.",

Using the AFM tip as the end effector, it can be modified into a nano-robot which can manipulate objects in nanoscale. By functionalizing the nano-robot end effector with antibodies, atomic force microscopy is able to identify specific types of receptors on cells\u2019 membrane in an image much as fluorescent tags do in optical microscopy but with higher resolution. After the single receptors have been identified, it becomes possible to manipulate these biological macromolecules in their physiological environment.

Bipedal model has elastic strings attached to the designated places that imitate a part of human muscular-skeletal system. By combining spring-like properties with passive walking principles we accomplish energy exchanges between biped segments during stance and swing phases that also simultaneously facilitate solution to foot clearance problem during swing phase by enabling the biped to perform rocking movement in lateral plane. We designed and examined behavior of the biped when walking with extended and flexible knees. The observed joint trajectories in the configuration with flexed knees were very similar to those observed in normal human walking. The results show new perspectives on future bipedal robots development and for studying involvement of particular muscle in human gait.",

Tactile sensors are implemented on one prototype of underactuated finger and used to enhance the behaviour of the hand despite its limited number of control signals. First, tactile technology is briefly recalled and discussed. Second, the electronic design of the sensors' controller is presented. Third, a real-time control scheme is introduced, based on a fuzzy force control method. Finally, a slippage prevention technique is presented. Results are discussed based on experimental observations and indicate that the behaviour of underactuated fingers can be substantially enhanced with tactile information and a classic fuzzy control approach.",

The robot is composed by a self-cooling monorail vehicle carrying a fire fighting monitor. A fuzzy inference system is adopted for the automatic generation of the task-space trajectory for the robot and to solve the inverse kinematics problem in the presence of redundant degrees of freedom. Redundancy also allows assigning additional tasks besides the primary task. Simulation case studies are presented to test the performance of the whole system in a typical intervention scenario.",

In this paper a practical gait planning algorithm in the transition region of the boundary is proposed in terms of a geometrical view. The trajectory of the body is derived from the geometrical analysis of the relationship between the robot and the environment. And the position of each foot is determined by using parameters associated with the hip and the ankle of the robot. In each case of concave or convex boundaries, the trajectory that the robot moves along is determined in advance and the foot positions of the robot associated with the trajectory are computed, accordingly. The usefulness of the proposed method is confirmed through simulations and demonstrations with a walking and climbing robot.",

        "abstract": "In the real world, noisy sensors and limited communication make it difficult for robot teams to coordinate in tightly coupled tasks. Team members cannot simply apply single-robot solution techniques for partially observable problems in parallel because they do not take into account the recursive effect that reasoning about the beliefs of others has on policy generation. Instead, we must turn to a game theoretic approach to model the problem correctly. Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) provide a solution model for decentralized robot teams, however, this model quickly becomes intractable. In previous work we presented an algorithm for lookahead search in POSGs. Here we present an extension which reduces computation during lookahead by clustering similar observation histories together. We show that by clustering histories which have similar profiles of predicted reward, we can greatly reduce the computation time required to solve a POSG while maintaining a good approximation to the optimal policy. We demonstrate the power of the clustering algorithm in a real-time robot controller as well as for a simple benchmark problem.",

        "abstract": "We consider here a class of compliant mechanisms that consist of one or more flexible beams, the manipulation of which relies on the deflection of the flexible beams. As compared with traditional rigid-body mechanisms, compliant mechanisms have the advantages of no relative moving parts and thus involve no wear, backlash, noises and lubrication. In this paper, we present a formulation based on shooting method (SM) along with two numerical solvers to facilitate the analysis and the design process of a compliant mechanism. Unlike finite difference method (FDM) or finite element method (FEM) that offers accurate solutions at discrete nodes, the computed solution of SM, which treats the boundary value problem (BVP) as an initial value problem, is continuous. Three example compliant mechanisms are formulated to illustrate the generalized shooting method and the computed results are validated by comparing those obtained using FEM.",

Many of these systems are abstracted as planar programmable force fields. Quadratic potential fields, which belong to such a class of fields, lend themselves to analytical study and exhibit useful stability properties. This paper introduces a new methodology to build Quadratic fields with simple devices using the naturally existing phenomena of airflow which is an improvement to the traditional use of the complicated programmable actuator arrays. It also provides a basis for the exploitation, in distributed manipulation, of natural phenomena like airflow, which require rigorous analysis and display stability difficulties. A demonstration and verification of the theoretical results for the special case of the elliptic field with air flows is also presented.",

This representation allows force-closure test to be formulated as the problem of intersection detection between a line segment and a convex polygon. The resulting geometric condition is presented along with an efficient algorithm for using the condition in force-closure test.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The assembly planning problem has received significant attention due to its importance in autonomous manufacturing. Typical assembly planners assume that parts have nominal shapes, while in reality their geometry varies according to the tolerance specifications. To account for toleranced parts, an assembly plan must be feasible for all possible variations of its components. Despite its practical importance, very few works address this problem. This paper presents a general framework for mechanical assembly planning with toleranced planar parts and shows how to incorporate it into existing planners. Our framework uses a general tolerancing model for parts: vertices are standard elementary functions of the part dimensions, which are allowed to vary within tolerance intervals. The relative position of parts is uniquely determined by an assembly graph, which defines constraints between features of neighboring parts. The assembly graph supports placements of parts with rotational degrees of freedom, cyclic relations, and conditional constraints, which occur in non-nominal contacts between edges. Using this framework, we show how to augment existing algorithms for useful motion types, including single and multiple step translations, and infinitesimal rigid motions. We demonstrate the dramatic reduction in the number of valid assembly plans when tolerances are introduced.",

However, the rate of convergence of the map has a strong dependence on the order of the observations. We show that conventional exploration algorithms for collecting map data are sub-optimal in both the objective function and choice of optimization procedure. We show that optimizing the a-optimal information measure results in a more accurate map than existing approaches, using a greedy, closed-loop strategy. Secondly, we demonstrate that by restricting the planning to an appropriate policy class, we can tractably find non-greedy, global planning trajectories that produce more accurate maps, explicitly planning to close loops even in open-loop scenarios.",

In this paper, grasp recognition is considered in a programming by demonstration framework. Three methods for grasp recognition are presented and evaluated. The first method uses Hidden Markov Models to model the hand posture sequence during the grasp sequence, while the second method relies on the hand trajectory and hand rotation. The third method is a hybrid method, in which both the first two methods are active in parallel. The particular contribution is that all methods rely on the grasp sequence and not just the final posture of the hand. This facilitates grasp recognition before the grasp is completed. Also, by analyzing the entire sequence and not just the final grasp, the decision is based on more information and increased robustness of the overall system is achieved. The experimental results show that both arm trajectory and final hand posture provide important information for grasp classification. By combining them, the recognition rate of the overall system is increased.",

For efficiency of tasks, multiple objects had better been grasped and manipulated by a robot hand. In order to design stable grasp, grasp stability of multiple objects must be quantitatively evaluated. In case of two grasped objects in two dimensions, the number of parameters of object displacement is 6. However, the displacement of the objects is constrained by each other, because the contact between the objects must be maintained. Independent parameters of the object displacement are provided and then finger displacement is derived. The grasp stability is evaluated from the viewpoint of the potential energy method. From numerical examples, the effect of curvature at contact point between two objects is demonstrated. The effect of this curvature stands for the feature of multiple objects.",

How to effectively utilize such information remains an open and challenging issue. This paper presents the optimized scheduling of a group of elevators with advanced traffic information for normal operations and coordinated emergency evacuation. A look-ahead time window is first introduced to model advanced information. Key characteristics of group elevator scheduling are abstracted to establish an innovative formulation. The objective function is transformed into an additive form to facilitate the decomposition of the problem into individual car subproblems. Subproblems are independently solved by using a local search method in conjunction with dynamic programming with a novel definition of stages, states, decisions, and costs to optimize single car dispatching. With surrogate optimization, local search is \u201cgood enough\u201d to set multiplier updating directions. Individual cars are then coordinated through the updating of multipliers by using surrogate optimization for near-optimal solutions. Numerical testing results demonstrate that near-optimal solutions are obtained for problems of moderate sizes under selected traffic patterns. The results also show the value of advanced information through testing different window sizes and rescheduling intervals.",

        "abstract": "In many studies and applications that include direct human involvement such as human-robot interaction, control of prosthetic arms, and human factor studies, hand force is needed for monitoring or control purposes. The use of inexpensive and easily portable active electromyogram (EMG) electrodes and position sensors would be advantageous in these applications compared to the use of force sensors which are often very expensive and require bulky frames. Among non model-based estimation methods, \u201cMultilayer Perceptron\u201d Artificial Neural Networks (MLPANN) have widely been used to estimate muscle force or joint torque of different anatomy of humans or animals. This paper investigates the use of Radial Basis Function (RBF) ANN and MLPANN for force estimation and compares the performance of the two methodologies for the same human anatomy, i.e. hand force estimation, under an ensemble of operational conditions. In this unified study, the EMG signal readings from upper arm muscles involved in elbow joint movement and sensed elbow angular position and velocity are utilized as inputs to ANNs. Moreover, the use of elbow angular acceleration signal as input for ANN is investigated. Towards this end, a single degree-of-freedom robotic experimental testbed has been constructed, which allows for data collection, training and validation.",

        "abstract": "In [5], a version of Relative Map Filter (RMF) is proposed to solve the simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem. In the RMF, the map states contain only quantities invariant under shift and rotation. The estimation of the map states and their correlations is carried out in an optimal way using the Kalman filter. However, the dependency among the map states is not taken into account, thus the resulting map states are inconsistent. This paper presents two methods to enforce the consistency of the relative map states. The idea is to maintain a geometrically consistent map by solving a set of constraints between the map states. Experimental results obtained by using the proposed methods on real platform data show better performance than those deduced from the original RMF.",

Haptic Desktop System is an integrated system, which merges haptic functionalities, and VDT systems into one. Specific care has been given to HDS design for enhancing and improving human-computer interaction from the following points of view: esthetical, ergonomic and functional. In order to improve the quality of the interaction, the HDS fully integrates proprioceptive, visual, audio and haptic functionalities, into a desk while minimizing the visual interference of the physical components. In the proposed approach classic input devices (i.e. keyboard and mouse) have been replaced by new features integrated within audio and haptic. Such features allow commanding and rendering natural force stimuli in such a way that they are completely coherent and co-located with respect to the visual information. The new features of the HDS are designed for reducing considerably the mental load required to the users during interaction operations. In the present paper the design guidelines and the achieved results are reported.",

During implementation of the wave transformation on the sampled-data system, a unit time delay arises due to causality of the reflection wave. The unit time delay on the reflection wave occasionally becomes a passive element. From the passivity condition of the sampled-data system, the wave impedance can be designed such that the wave transformation using delayed reflection provides the effect of positive damping and thus the stable haptic interface is achieved on the sampled-data system. Various experiments for a 2-linked passive haptic device show that stable haptic interface can be accomplished for the wall-following task by use of the wave transformation using delayed reflection.",

Sensing and sensory data interpretation play ever increasing role because sensing becomes the primary way of collecting information about the environment. In this application domain the environment is unstructured, which results in demanding data interpretation and control algorithms. Similarly, the control and decision-making algorithms inevitably become more complex in order to be able to cope with the unstructured and dynamic environment. Consequently a sophisticated evaluation/test environment is required, which provides full control of the circumstances, reproducibility and flexible mix of real and virtual components. The paper presents a multi-agent based distributed HIL simulation environment (MARS), which assures scalable real-time performance and introduces an extension with high fidelity sensor simulation functionality.",

Compared to normal motion capture using spherical markers, the connectivity information of the mesh can be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the reconstruction process. As a result, the system can achieve faster and more precise measurement of hundreds of markers on the subject than other approaches such as using natural image or 3D scanning. The total computation time required to reconstruct the 3D mesh information including 408 markers (intersections) is 65.5 ms, allowing realtime motion capture at 15 fps.",

Setting the human machine interface (HMI) at the neuro-muscular level may lead to seamless integration and an intuitive control of the exoskeleton arm as a natural extension of the human body. At the core of the exoskeleton HMI there is a myoprocessor. It is a model of the human muscle, running in real-time and in parallel to the physiological muscle, that predicts joint torque as a function of the joint kinematics and neural activation levels. The study is focused on developing a myoprocessor based on the Hill phenomenological muscle model. Genetic algorithms were used to optimize model internal parameters using an experimental database that provides inputs to the model and allows for performance assessment. The results indicate high correlation between joint moment predictions of the model and the measured data. Consequently, the myoprocessor seems an adequate model, sufficiently robust for further integration into the exoskeleton control system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address tasks for multirobot teams that require solving a distributed multi-agent planning problem in which the actions of robots are tightly coupled. The uncertainty inherent in these tasks also necessitates persistent tight coordination between teammates throughout execution. Existing approaches to coordination cannot adequately meet the technical demands of such tasks. In response, we have developed a market-based framework, Hoplites, that consists of two novel coordination mechanisms. Passive coordination quickly produces locally-developed solutions while active coordination produces complex team solutions via negotiation between teammates. Robots use the market to efficiently vet candidate solutions and to choose the coordination mechanism that best matches the current demands of the task. In experiments, Hoplites significantly outperforms even its nearest competitors, particularly in the most complex instances of a domain. We also present implementation results on a team of mobile robots.",

The system consists of two parts: a 2-DOF force feedback mechanism for kinesthetic force display and a tactile display part for providing normal stimulation to the skin and the lateral skin stretch. A tactile display device, using eight piezoelectric bimorphs and a linear actuator, is fabricated and attached to a 2-DOF translational force feedback device to simultaneously simulate the texture and stiffness of the object. The developed system was adopted as a test bed to study the factors affecting perception of surface properties. We investigate three things: effective stimulating methods, limitation of surface discrimination based on kinesthetic force and the effectiveness of combining kinesthetic force feedback with tactile feedback. Seven kinds of stimulating methods are investigated to study effective methods in simulating texture. In addition, in order to find out the role of skin stretch during perceiving texture, the discernment abilities of active touch (rubbing), laterally-active-display and moving-wave-form have been compared.",

        "abstract": "In this study we propose a framework using neural oscillators for human-robot physical interaction such as \u201chandshaking\u201d. Neural oscillators are used for synchronization and entrainment between human and robot motions. Passiveness of the handshake can be changed by adjusting strength of the synchronization. Joint torque information is taken as an input signal for the neural oscillators, and the neural oscillator generates the desired trajectory of a robot joint. This paper addresses a model structure of the neural oscillator for human-robot physical interaction. The computer simulations of handshaking show the synchronization and the entrainment. Also the experiments with a joint torque sensing robot arm show that a handshake between a robot and a human being is realized by the proposed method. Lastly the validity of the proposed method is examined by a psychological evaluation with a paired comparison method, and it is found that the proposed method is better than conventional impedance control in terms of \u201cFlexible\u201d, \u201cNatural\u201d, \u201cKind\u201d and \u201cAffinity\u201d.",

This paper proposed a method of online trajectory generation based on key parameters of off-line typical walk patterns for a biped humanoid. The key parameters include hip parameters, step length, walking cycle and so on. The walking pattern can be obtained according to these parameters. In order to generate walking patterns online, first the key parameters of the on-line walking pattern are computed based on the parameters of off-line typical patterns, then stability optimization has been done on-line and on-line trajectories are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments with our developed humanoid robot with 33 DOF.",

        "abstract": "A number of advanced sampling strategies have been proposed in recent years to address the narrow passage problem for probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planning. These sampling strategies all have unique strengths, but none of them solves the problem completely. In this paper, we present a general and systematic approach for adaptively combining multiple sampling strategies so that their individual strengths are preserved. We have performed experiments with this approach on robots with up to 12 degrees of freedom in complex 3-D environments. Experiments show that although the performance of individual sampling strategies varies across different environments, the adaptive hybrid sampling strategies constructed with this approach perform consistently well in all environments. Further, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, the adaptive strategies are provably competitive against all individual strategies used.",

The assembly process consists of three phases, including visual positioning, searching meshing state, and inserting. Visual feedback is used to achieve the coarse positioning and guide the grasping and transporting of microparts during the visual positioning phase. During the searching phase, a fuzzy PID controller is used to control the contact force on z axis and fuzzy logic strategy is developed to search the meshing state by the force feedback on x and y axes. The tolerance compensations movement is used to support the inserting task to avoid the case of blocking and prevent the micro parts from damaging. The assembly experiment of three planetary gears validates the hybrid force control strategy.",

To overcome the visibility constraint, visual servoing methods can benefit from panoramic sensors such as catadioptric cameras (combining both mirrors and lenses). In this paper, we present a vision-based framework to control a nonholonomic mobile robot using a catadioptric imaging system. We particularly focus on a suitable catadioptric image-based control strategy of a nonholonomic robot in order to follow a 3D straight line. Such strategy can be applied to navigate in indoor or urban environment since the extraction and the tracking of straight lines are natural. First the control objectives are formulated in the catadioptric image space. The control law is then designed according to a well suited chained system for a mobile robot state vector directly expressed in the image space using a generic camera model. Simulation results illustrate the control strategy in the case of hypercatadioptric and paracatadioptric cameras.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the trajectory planning of a soccer ball driven by a kicking robot. The trajectory of a ball is function of its initial velocity, launch angle, and some aerodynamic effect. Specially, the initial velocity is created by an instant impulse given to the ball. The external impulse exerted to a ball by a kicking robot is function of robot geometry and dynamic parameters. Initially, we analyze the external impulses for several kicking postures and simulate trajectories for several different kicking conditions. Based on this observation, a trajectory-planning algorithm of a ball, in which the initial velocity and the launch angle of the ball are calculated for a desired trajectory of the ball, is proposed, and then an external impulse required for that motion is calculated and applied to the kicking simulation. The aerodynamic effect such as drag force and lift force is also incorporated into the dynamic simulation of the soccer ball. A kicking robot has been developed for experimental verification of the proposed analytical methodology. It was shown that experimental result is in good agreement with simulation result within 10% error bound.",

        "abstract": "An energetic approach to the impact problem in planar legged robot locomotion is hereby presented. The goal is to find the configurations that yield zero tangential velocity at the impacting leg, a condition known as sticking, and restitute the least energy back into the system. With this analysis, the ground contact friction and the inertial properties of the system, including those of the servo motors, play a determinant role in the impact analysis. This approach yields an energetic criterion for the analysis of the transition from impact to contact constraint conditions. This paper presents a simple, robust method that uses the system generalized coordinates and velocities, the Jacobian, the mass matrix, the coulomb friction law, and the energetic coefficient of restitution to determine whether or not the current configuration is advantageous for maintaining contact, and thereby controllability, in the presence of impulsive forces.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the impedance control of a pneumatic linear actuator for tasks involving contact interaction. The method presented takes advantage of the natural compliance of pneumatic actuators such that a load cell, typically used in impedance control, is not required. The central notion of the method is that by departing from a stiff actuation system, low-bandwidth acceleration measurements can be used in lieu of high-bandwidth force measurements. The control methodology presented contains an inner loop to control the pressure on two sides of a pneumatic cylinder, while an outer loop enforces an impedance relationship between external forces and motion and commands desired pressures to the inner loop. The inner loop enforces the natural compliance of the pneumatic actuator by controlling both the sum and difference of the pressures on both sides of the pneumatic actuator. This is accomplished by utilizing two three-way proportional spool valves instead of a four-way valve typically used in fluid power control. Experimental results are shown demonstrating the pressure tracking control of the inner loop. Experimental results are also shown that demonstrate the impedance tracking of the outer loop for free motion and the transition from free motion to contact.",

        "abstract": "Navigation in environments that are densely cluttered with obstacles is still a challenge for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs), especially when the configuration of obstacles is not known a priori. Reactive local navigation schemes that tightly couple the robot actions to the sensor information have proved to be effective in these environments, and because of the environmental uncertainties, fuzzy behavior systems have been proposed. The most difficult problem in applying these systems is that of arbitrating or fusing the reactions of the individual behaviors. This paper presents an architectural design of a fuzzy behavior based system for navigation control of robotic vehicles using multivalued reactive fuzzy behaviors. This design allows the robot to thoroughly use the available sensor information when choosing the control action to be taken. Experimental results show that the proposed method can smoothly and effectively guide a robot through cluttered environments such as dense forests.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Image gradient-based feature detectors offer great advantages over their standard edge-only equivalents. In driver support systems research, the radial symmetry detection algorithm has given real-time results for speed sign recognition. The regular polygon detector is a scan line algorithm for these features facilitating recognition of other road signs such as stop and give way signs. Radial symmetry has also been applied to real-time face detection, and the polygon detector is showing promising results as a feature detector for SLAM. However, gradient-based feature detection is more sensitive to noise than standard edge-based algorithms. As the total gradient magnitude at a pixel decreases, the component of the gradient at that point that arises from image noise increases. When a pixel votes in its gradient direction out to an extended radius, its position is more likely to be inaccurate if the gradient magnitude is low. In this paper, we analyse the performance of the radial symmetry and regular polygon detector algorithms under changes to the threshold on gradient magnitude. We show that the number of pixels correctly voting on a circle is not greatly reduced by thresholds that decrease the total number of pixels that vote in the image to 20%. This greatly reduces the noise component in the image, with only slight impact on the signal. This improves the performance, particularly for the regular polygon detector where the voting mechanism is complex and constitutes a large amount of the processing per pixel. This facilitates a real-time implementation, which is presented here.",

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper we present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution taking into account not only the movement of the robot but also the most recent observation. This drastically decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "More and more work in the field of artificial olfaction considers the integration of olfaction onto robotic systems. An important part of this integration is providing the robot with the ability to discriminate between different odour substances. This work presents the integration of an electronic nose onto a complete robotic system with multi-sensing modalities. The ambition of this work is to illustrate how classification performance of odours can be improved through the exploitation of the mobility of a robot, as well as through the cooperation between a human user and an electronic perceptual system. These points are highlighted in the context of a online robotic system designed to perform different tasks which require the ability to discriminate between odour characters. The robotic system and experimental results are presented where these tasks are tested and evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Telerobotics has long struggled to provide realistic force feedback to the user, especially across substantial time delays. Wave variable based controllers provide stable force reflection at frequencies up to a few Hertz for typical communication delays; however, the bandwidth of human perception extends to a thousand Hertz. We address this problem by incorporating a force sensor at the slave end effector and creating an additional feedback path to provide high frequency force information to the user. We build this augmented feedback system on top of a normal wave variable controller, leveraging the separation of power flows provided by the wave variable formalism and building a fundamentally asymmetric controller that better matches the sensory capabilities of the human operator. To further improve the user\u2019s perception of the slave site, we investigate the use of wave filters to compensate for wave reflections without introducing the excessive damping inherent to impedance matching. Both of these improvements are validated experimentally in a simple three degree of freedom teleoperator.",

        "abstract": "For Internet based real-time teleoperation systems, random time delay can cause instability in the closed loop control system and hence hinder task accomplishment. Event based control systems have been proposed to overcome the instability caused by the random time delay. High latency at the transport layer can still impede effective and reliable execution of tasks with high dexterity requirements. Network QoS based dynamic resource allocation has been proposed to increase the efficiency and reliability of task execution. However, these approaches only try to mitigate or overcome the effects of random time delay and do not address the cause of latency issues in the communication channel. This paper addresses the efficiency and reliability requirements for supermedia enhanced teleoperated systems by reducing the end-to-end transmission latency through the use of overlay networks. The proposed system reduces the transmission latency by using multiple, disjoint paths in overlay networks. The proposed system facilitates reliable and efficient task completion for tasks with high dexterity requirements. Experimental validation of the proposed teleoperated system using the PlanetLab Network is provided for the task of teleoperating a mobile manipulator system.",

Since the local user\u2019s environment is normally different from that of the remote agent, there exists a motion mapping from the remote agent to the local user. After the path of the remote agent is predicted or recognized, it should be transformed to fit into the local environment, considering the constraints from the local environment, and ensuring utmost similarities in the shape and length of the paths. Moreover, terminal position of the local user in the local environment after a piece of known movement should also be carefully arranged after path transformation for his consecutive motions. These issues are incrementally addressed from the optimization point of view. Two schemes are proposed for path transformation problem. Extensive simulations and comparisons show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

This independent control of stiffness and force removes a primary cause of contact instability when utilizing stiffness or impedance based force control during interaction with stiff environments. Specifically, in typical stiffness or impedance control, since the force is defined in terms of motion variables, the desired force term appears as high gain position feedback when a manipulator is in contact with a stiff environment. In the proposed approach, since stiffness and force are controlled independently, the force appears as an exogenous input rather than as high gain position feedback, and therefore this source of instability is removed. The paper describes the control approach for independent stiffness and force control, which is based on an MIMO sliding mode controller design. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the control approach.",

        "abstract": "When navigating in an unknown environment for the first time, a natural behavior consists in memorizing some key views along the performed path, in order to use these references as checkpoints for a future navigation mission taking a similar path. This assumption is used in this paper as the basis of a navigation framework for wheeled mobile robots in indoor environments. During a human-guided teleoperated learning step, the robot performs paths which are sampled and stored as a set of ordered key images, acquired by a standard embedded camera. The set of these obtained visual paths is topologically organized and provides a visual memory of the environment. Given an image of one of the visual paths as a target, the robot navigation mission is defined as a concatenation of visual path subsets, called visual route. When running autonomously, the robot is controlled by a visual servoing law adapted to its nonholonomic constraint. Based on the regulation of successive homographies, this control guides the robot along the reference visual route without explicitly planning any trajectory. Real experiment results illustrate the validity of the presented framework.",

        "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of actively searching for and localizing ground features by a coordinated team of air and ground robotic sensor platforms. The approach taken builds on well known Decentralized Data Fusion (DDF) methodology. In particular, it brings together established representations developed for identification and linearized estimation problems to jointly address feature detection and localization. This provides transparent and scalable integration of sensor information from air and ground platforms. As in previous studies, an Information-theoretic utility measure and local control strategy drive the robots to uncertainty reducing team configurations. Complementary characteristics in terms of coverage and accuracy are revealed through analysis of the observation uncertainty for air and ground on-board cameras. Implementation results for a detection and localization example indicate the ability of this approach to scalably and efficiently realize such collaborative potential.",

Instead of measuring a part surface point-by-point using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), an ADI system can measure a part surface patch-by-patch. Therefore, the inspection time can be significantly reduced. Many existing sensor planners were developed for one or two cameras. In the proposed ADI system, the sensor planner is developed for a digital area sensor, which is made by a CCD camera and a digital projector. In application, sensor viewpoints are estimated automatically. On each viewpoint, thousands of points on part surfaces can be measured in only several seconds.",

We examine several design issues that arise in the construction of a compliance renderer, specifically the interaction between impedances of tactile displays, impedances of robot arms, and the computational model. We also describe an implementation of a compliance rendering system combining a low-impedance robot arm for large workspace kinesthetic force feedback, a high-impedance shape display for distributed tactile feedback to the finger pad, and a real-time finite element modeler. To determine the efficacy of the integration of tactile and kinesthetic force feedback components, we conducted a study examining the user\u2019s ability to discriminate stiffness. Subjects were able to reliably detect a 20% difference in rendered material stiffness using our compliance rendering system.",

        "abstract": "Vision is one of the most powerful sensory modalities in robotics, allowing operation in dynamic envi ronments. One of our long-term research interests is mobile manipulation, where precise location of the target object is commonly required during task execution. Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed for real-time 3D tracking and most of them utilize an edge (wireframe) model of the target. However, the use of an edge model has significant problems in complex scenes due to occlusions and multiple responses, especially in terms of initialization. In this paper, we propose a new tracking method based on integration of model-based cues with automatically generated model-free cues, in order to improve tracking accuracy and to avoid weaknesses of edge based tracking. The integration is performed in a Kalman filter framework that operates in real-time. Experimental evaluation shows that the inclusion of model-free cues offers superior performance.",

Features and the spatial relationships between the features, form a signature, which can be used to uniquely identify each part. Using this signature we develop an indexing scheme to speed up database searching. In this work we propose a content based search technique to retrieve similar parts from a database of old parts.

The robot autonomously follows the user and is provided with a verbal commentary on the current location with phrases such as \u201cRobot, we are in the office\u201d. At the same time, a metric feature map is generated using fusion of laser and advanced sonar measurements in a Kalman filter based SLAM framework, which is later used for localization. When mapping is complete, the robot generates an occupancy grid for use in global task planning. The occupancy grid is created using a novel laser scan registration scheme that relies on storing the path of the robot along with associated local SLAM features during mapping, and later recovering the path by matching the associated local features to the final SLAM map. The occupancy grid is segmented into labelled rooms using an algorithm based on watershed segmentation and integration of the verbal commentary.

        "abstract": "Personal service robots are expected to help people in their everyday life in the near future. Such robots must be able to not only move around but also perform various operations such as carrying a user-specified object or turning a TV on. Robots working in houses and offices have to deal with a vast variety of environments and operations. Since it is almost impossible to give the robots complete knowl edge in advance, on-site robot teaching will be important. We are developing a novel teaching framework called task model-based interactive teaching. A task model describes what knowledge is necessary for achieving a task. A robot examines the task model to determine missing pieces of knowledge, and asks the user to teach them. By leading the interaction with the user in this way, the user can teach important (focal) point easily and efficiently. This paper deals with a task of moving to a destination at a different floor; the task includes not only the movement but also the operation of recognizing and pushing elevator buttons. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed teaching framework.",

        "abstract": "Redundant actuation of parallel manipulators admits internal forces without generating end-effector forces (preload). Preload can be controlled in order to prevent backlash during the manipulator motion. Such controlis based on the inverse dynamics. The general solution of the inverse dynamics of redundantly actuated parallel manipulators is given. For the special case of simple over actuation an explicit solution is derived in terms of a single preload parameter. With this formulation a computational effcient open-loop preload control is developed and applied to the elimination of backlash. Its simplicity makes it applicable in real-time applications. The approach is exemplified for a planar 4RRR manipulator.",

        "abstract": "We present a new sampling-based algorithm for iteratively locating Voronoi vertices of a point set in the unit cube Id= [0, 1]d. The algorithm takes an input sample and executes a series of transformations, each of which projects the sample to a new face of the Voronoi cell in which it is located. After d such transformations, the sample has been transformed into a Voronoi vertex. Locating Voronoi vertices has many potential applications for motion planning, such as estimating dispersion for coverage and verification applications, and providing information useful for Voronoi-biased or multiple-tree planning. We prove theoretical results regarding our algorithm, and give experimental results comparing it to naive sampling for the problem of dispersion estimation.",

The independent voltage control of three segments of patterned electrodes on the artificial muscle enables independent partial bending motions of each segment and realizes a multi-DOF control of the manipulator. We introduce the kinematic modeling of these multi-DOF bending motions and propose visual feedback control of the artificial muscle. For high-speed visual feedback, we have developed a visual sensing system with a 1ms sampling rate. Finally, we show the experimental results of the visual sensing and kinematic modeling of the bending motions of the manipulator.",

As the first step, an appropriate set of coordinates is selected and used to describe the state of the robot. Nonholonomic constraints imposed by the wheels are then expressed as a set of differential equations. By describing these equations in terms of the state of the robot an underactuated driftless nonlinear control system with affine inputs that governs the motion of the robot is derived. A set of experimental results are also given to show the capability of the UT-PCR in climbing a stepped pole.",

The mobility of the manipulator is analyzed via screw theory. The inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, and velocity analysis are performed and the singularity problems are investigated afterwards, which can be applied to a general 3-PRC TPM regardless of actuators arrangement. With the variation on actuators layout angle, the reachable workspace of the manipulator is generated and compared. Especially, it is illustrated that the manipulator in principle possesses a uniform workspace with a constant hexagon shape cross section. Furthermore, the dexterity characteristics is investigated in the global sense. Simulation results show that different specific tasks should be considered when the actuators layout angles of a general 3-PRC TPM are designed.",

        "abstract": "Landmark-based graphs are a useful and parsimonious tool for representing large scale environments. Relating landmarks by means of feedback-control algorithms encoded in a motion description language provides a level of abstraction that enables autonomous vehicles to navigate effectively by composing strings in the language to form complex strategies that would be difficult to design at the level of sensors and actuators. In such a setting, feedback control requires one to pay attention not only to sensor and actuator uncertainty, but also to the ambiguity introduced by the fact that many landmarks may look similar when using a modest set of observations. This work discusses the generation of language-based feedback control sequences for landmark-based navigation together with the problem of sensing landmarks sufficiently well to make feedback meaningful. The paper makes two contributions. First, we extend previous work to include the costs of sensing with varying degrees of accuracy. Second, we describe a Monte Carlo based approach to landmark sensing which relies on the use of particle filters. We include simulation results that illustrate our approach.",

These microtools are made of photo - crosslinkable resin. Colored microtool and fluorescent microtool are for cell manipulation using Image processing with low cost. Cell binding microtool is made for high - speed transportation of target cell. Rotation free microtool is made for position control and precise force measurement of cell and DNA. Rope shaped microtool is for versatile manipulation. Laser tweezers is employed to position control of microtools.

        "abstract": "Direct human control of multi-robot systems is limited by the cognitive ability of humans to coordinate numerous interacting components. In remote environments, such as those encountered during planetary or ocean exploration, a further limit is imposed by communication bandwidth and delay. Market based planning can give humans a higher-level interface to multi-robot systems in these scenarios. Operators provide high level tasks and attach a reward to the achievement of each task. The robots then trade these tasks through a market based mechanism. The challenge for the system designer is to create bidding algorithms for the robots that yield high overall system performance. Opportunity cost provides a nice basis for such bidding algorithms since it encapsulates all the costs and benefits we are interested in. Unfortunately, computing it can be difficult. We propose a method of learning opportunity costs in market based planners. We provide analytic results in simplified scenarios and empirical results on our FIRE simulator, which focuses on exploration of Mars by multiple, heterogeneous rovers.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of inferring sensor positions and a topological (i.e. qualitative) map of an environment given a set of cameras with non-overlapping fields of view. In this way, without prior knowledge of the environment nor the exact position of sensors within the environment, one can infer the topology of the environment, and common traffic patterns within it. In particular, we consider sensors stationed at the junctions of the hallways of a large building. We infer the sensor connectivity graph and the travel times between sensors (and hence the hallway topology) from the sequence of events caused by unlabeled agents (i.e. people) passing within view of the different sensors. We do this based on a first-order semi-Markov model of the agent's behavior. The paper describes a problem formulation and proposes a stochastic algorithm for its solution. The result of the algorithm is a probabilistic model of the sensor network connectivity graph and the underlying traffic patterns. We conclude with results from numerical simulations",

A nearest-neighbor control policy is represented by a set of nodes that induce a Voronoi partitioning of the input space. The Voronoi cells then define local control actions. Direct policy search is applied to optimize the node locations and actions. The selective addition of nodes allows for progressive refinement of the control representation. We demonstrate this approach on the challenging problem of learning to steer cars and trucks-with-trailers around winding tracks with sharp corners. We consider the steering of both forwards and backwards-moving vehicles with only local sensory information. The steering behaviors for these nonholonomic systems are shown to generalize well to tracks not seen in training.",

We have designed a physical awareness system called CAMEO (Camera Assisted Meeting Event Observer), a hardware/software system to record and monitor people's activities in meetings. CAMEO captures a high resolution omnidirectional view of the meeting by stitching images coming from almost concentric cameras. Besides recording capability, CAMEO automatically detects people and learns a person-specific facial appearance model (PS-FAM) for each of the participants. The PSFAMs allow more robust/reliable tracking and identification. In this paper, we describe the video-capturing device, photometric/geometric autocalibration process, and the multiple people tracking system. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system is demonstrated over several real-time experiments and a large data set of videos.",

Our objective is to control the positioning of small mechanical parts with a micromanipulation system for microfactory applications. The micropositioning platform is made of three linear actuators that move points to push the object toward a goal position. At the micrometric scale, it is really difficult to model the behaviour of manipulated objects. Moreover, due to the gap between real world and discrete world perceived by the camera, the motion of parts can be seen as a little stochastic. To overcome these problems and design an automated device, we use reinforcement learning methods and develop a new model-based algorithm taking into account the stochastic behaviour of the positioning task.",

This paper presents a machine-learning approach to deal with this question. In an off-line learning phase, a classifier is trained to quickly predict the feasibility of a query. Then, an improved multi-step motion planning algorithm uses this classifier to avoid wasting time on infeasible queries.

These approaches are primarily limited to human subjects and further progress along content-based lines is hamstrung by slow progress on the general computer vision problem. In this paper, we present a mobile robot system which solves the group-picture-framing problem without requiring content-based methods. The system finds photographic subjects based on measurements of motion parallax obtained via optical flow during robot movements. Our method requires only sufficient contrast to permit reasonably accurate sparse optical flow field estimation and is completely independent of any content-based image heuristics. The result is a working mobile robot system that can correctly photograph human and non-human subjects in a variety of posed-subject situations, and produce well-framed, cropped images for printing on standard-sized photo paper.",

        "abstract": "Estimation of three-dimensional information from two-dimensional images is an important requirement in many computer vision applications. The estimation task can often be formulated as a problem of estimating states and/or parameters in nonlinear dynamic systems. This paper presents an algorithm for recursive state estimation in nonlinear dynamic systems, where the estimated states correspond to three-dimensional positions of feature points on an observed object. The algorithm is designed as a nonlinear observer, with a gain matrix that can be determined using methods from linear control theory. A stability criterion for the resulting nonlinear system is derived, and simulations are presented in order to illustrate the estimation performance.",

First, we develop our proposed contact model, in which an elastic potential energy is formulated. Second, we show that the elastic potential energy due to the deformation of the soft fingertip is proportional to the cube of the maximum displacement of that fingertip. Also, it is firstly shown that the elastic force and the potential energy are functions of two variables: the maximum displacement and the orientation angle of the contact object. The most important point is that the potential energy of the fingertip have a local minimum when the object contacts with the soft fingertip keeping a vertical direction. Finally, we show that the local minimum of the elastic potential energy also appears in experiments.",

This paper investigates the local and global isotropy of an omnidirectional mobile robot with three caster wheels. All possible actuations with different number and combination of rotating and steering joints are considered. First, the kinematic model based on velocity decomposition and the algebraic conditions for the local isotropy are obtained. Second, the geometric conditions for the local isotropy are derived and all isotropic configurations are fully identified. Third, the global isotropy index is examined to determine the optimal parameters in terms of actuation set, characteristic length, and steering link length.",

There are many approaches for localization of mobile robots in outdoor environment, but their application to walking robots is rather rare.

Due to many degrees of freedom of walking robots the localization task becomes a even more complex challenge.

Today\u2019s humanoid robots, despite their undeniably impressive performance, are still a long way from the elegance and grace found in Nature. To narrow the gap between natural and artificial systems, we propose to rely more on morphology, intrinsic dynamics, and less on raw computation. This paper documents a series of simulated and real \u201cpseudo-passive\u201d dynamic biped walkers in which computation is traded off for good morphology, that is, adequate mechanical design and appropriate material properties These two factors are parameterized, and the resulting solution space is explored in simulation. Interesting solutions are then realized in the real world. Our experiments show that successful pseudo-passive walkers with a good morphology locomote by converting oscillatory energy into forward movement.",

The locomotion mechanism, especially the static force analysis and the climbing ability for different configurations of the multiple child-robots are presented in detail. The basic configurations of two child-robots systems were given in three modes: connecting in series with arm in front or back and combining to a loop with grasper. The simulation results of these three configurations based on static analysis demonstrate that the climbing ability is closely correlated to their configurations. Compared the results, the conclusion can be obtained that the loop configuration has the best effect than others on slope climbing. The actual experiments of the child-robots system have illustrated the simulating results, and an exciting phenomenon has emerged, which shows that all the configurations can climb bigger gradient than the simulating results. The phenomenon rightly discloses the characteristic of the novel architecture of the child-robot.",

In this paper, we introduce an evidential approach to the loop-closing problem for topological maps, based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In our approach, the robot makes a hypothesis whenever it may have revisited a place. It then attempts to verify hypotheses by continuing to traverse the environment, gathering evidence that supports (or refutes) the hypotheses. We describe methods for managing belief about multiple loop-closing hypotheses, and for determining a belief assignment given a piece of evidence. We also discuss methods for reducing the false alarm rate of our loop-closing algorithm, and provide simulated and real-world experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a low-cost Bluetooth communication for autonomous mobile minirobots. The interfacing of the Bluetooth hardware is done by a simple UART connection, which makes the approach easily portable. Using ASCII commands and events, which are exchanged over this serial link, the Bluetooth operations can be controlled and monitored. Since internal Bluetooth stack operations are concealed, no deeper knowledge of the Bluetooth technology is necessary to utilize this wireless communication. These features make the presented approach perfectly suited for the integration into minirobots like the Khepera, where computational power and spatial resources are strictly limited.",

        "abstract": "Manipulating in the micro- or even nano world still poses a great challenge to robotics. Conventional (stationary) systems suffer from drawbacks regarding integration into process supervision and multi-robot approaches, which become highly relevant to fight scaling effects. This paper describes work currently being carried out which aims to make automated manipulation of micrometer-scaled objects possible by robots with nanometer precision. The goal is to establish a small cluster of (up to five) micro robots equipped with on-board electronics, sensors and wireless power supply. Power autonomy has been reached using inductive energy transmission from an external wireless power supply system or a battery based system. Electronics requirements are fulfilled in the electronic module with the full custom integrated circuit design for the robot locomotion control and the closed loop force control for AFM tool in cell manipulation applications. The maximum velocity obtained is about 0.4 mm/s with a saw tooth voltage signals of 20Vpp and 2500 Hz. In order to keep a AFM tool on micro-robot a specific tip with integrated piezoresistance, instead of the classical laser beam methodology, is validated for force measurement.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a machine vision system, which is suitable for cooperative works between the human and computer. This system provides images inputted from a stereo camera head not only to the processor but also to the user\u2019s sight as binocular wide-angle foveated (WAF) information, thus it is applicable for Virtual Reality (VR) systems such as tele-existence or training experts. The stereo camera head plays a role to get required input images foveated by special wide-angle optics under camera view direction control and 3D head mount display (HMD) displays fused 3D images to the user. Moreover, an analog video signal processing device much inspired from a structure of the human visual system realizes a unique way to provide WAF information to plural processors and the user. Therefore, this developed vision system is also much expected to be applicable for the human brain and vision research, because the design concept is to mimic the human visual system. Further, an algorithm to generate features using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for binocular fixation in order to provide well-fused 3D images to 3D HMD is proposed. This paper examines influences of applying this algorithm to space variant images such as WAF images, based on experimental results.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to investigate how stigmergic information allow each individual of a group of autonomous robots to take advantages from other individual behaviors. The proposed analysis is based on the roboticle model where sensor data and effector commands are treated as energy exchange between the robot and its environment, eventually populated by other robots. Without explicit communication, the collective behavior of a group of teammates can be forced only if the robot designer makes each robot to become aware of distinguishing configuration patterns in the environment. Usually, the job is accomplished both by evaluating descriptive conditions as macroparameters and an appropriate dynamic role assignment among teammates. Since observed individual behaviors can affect the normal course of operations for each robot propagating to other teammates, we want to address some issues on how a collective behavior is fired and maintained.",

It is important for linear object manipulation in industrial/medical field to analyze knotting. Modeling of knotting/unknotting process is useful for design of knotting/unknotting system with different mechanism from human arms/hands and manipulation planning suitable for such system. Firstly, knotting/unknotting processes of a linear object is represented as a sequence of finite crossing state transitions. Secondly, grasping points and their moving direction to perform each state transition are defined. Then, possible qualitative manipulation plans can be generated on a computer system once the initial state and the objective state of a linear object are given. Thirdly, a planning method for tightly tying is proposed. Pulling parts for tightening knots can be determined by using this method. Finally, an experiment for tying an overhand knot by our developed system is shown.",

It investigates the formulation of assembly or disassembly tasks based on contact states. The result is an approach that facilitates the automatic extraction of robot programs from demonstrations in virtual reality and provides a base for the parameterization of detection algorithms. For this purpose, a contact state model for the description of assembly or disassembly tasks of DLOs is presented. It is described how the contact states can be derived from a geometric model of both the DLO and the environment. Such a model may be obtained by a simulation of the manipulation tasks in virtual reality. Further, the possible transitions between the contact states are classified into general transition classes. Those transition classes enable the selection of algorithms to detect such contact state transitions.",

The proposed kernel is based on probabilistic models called switching linear dynamics (SLDs). SLD is one of the powerful tools for tracking, analyzing and classifying human complex time-series motion. The proposed kernel incorporates information about the latent variables in SLDs with simplified designing approach called marginalized kernels. The empirical evaluation using real motion data shows that a classifier using SVM with our proposed kernel has much better performance than the classifier with some conventional kernel techniques. Another experiment using walking around motion shows that a classifier with the proposed kernel can properly segment the start and the end of the target action.",

        "abstract": "A matrix formulation of the constraint forces and moments, together referred here as the wrenches, for serial manipulators is presented in this paper. The methodology is based on the Newton-Euler dynamic equations of motions of the manipulator at hand. The formulation provides joint forces and moments that are necessary for designing the robot links, as well those required by the joint actuators. The latter information is required in inverse dynamics. The formulation is based on writing the kinematic constraint equations using the Decoupled Natural Orthogonal complement (DeNOC) matrices, introduced elsewhere. The kinematic information in the form of the DeNOC matrices of a serial manipulator is used for the determination of the joint torques and forces, which lead to the development of a uniform analytical tool for control and design.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a metric-based matching algorithm to estimate the robot planar displacement by matching dense two-dimensional range scans. The contribution is a geometric distance that takes into account the translation and orientation of the sensor at the same time. This result is used in the two steps of the matching - estimation process. The correspondences between scans are established with this measure and the minimization of the error is also carried out in terms of this distance. As a result, the translation and rotation are compensated in this framework simultaneously. In fact, this is the contribution with respect to previous work that addressed only translation or translation and rotation but separately. The new technique has been implemented and tested on a real vehicle. The experiments illustrate how it is more robust and accurate than prior techniques. At the end of the paper, we give an extension of our distance measure to 3D range-data matching problems.",

The target disease of the fetal surgery is spina bifida or myelomeningocele that is incomplete closure in the spinal column and one of the common fetal diseases. In the proposed surgical process, the abdominal wall and uterine wall would not widely be opened but rather surgical instruments inserted through the small holes in both walls to perform minimally invasive surgery. In this paper, a prototype of the micro manipulator of diameter is 2.4mm and bending radius 2.45 mm is presented. The diameter and bending radius of this manipulator is one of the smallest ever developed among surgical robots to the best of the knowledge of the investigating authors. The mechanism of the manipulator includes two ball joints and is driven using four wires able to bend through 90 degrees in any direction. The features of the mechanism include a small diameter, small bending radius, ease of fabrication, high rigidity and applicability for other surgical applications. Although the manipulator is not yet MRI compatible, the feature of the prototype demonstrated the feasibility of robotic intrauterine fetal surgery.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates micro-parts feeding using a saw-tooth surface. In parts feeding, the driving force applied on each part must vary according to the direction of motion of the part so that the part moves in one direction. Traditional feeders employ oblique or asymmetric vibration of the feeder surface, which often causes unstable motion of micro-parts. In this paper, we propose micro-parts feeding using a saw-tooth surface with simple planar and symmetric vibration. First, we describe the principle of the proposed technique. We then develop a model describing the contact between a micro-part and a saw-tooth, and formulate the condition for feeding. Next, we conduct experiments to assess the feasibility of micro-parts feeding by the proposed method. Finally, we discuss how well the feeding model fits experimental results.",

        "abstract": "IEC 61499 ushers in a new trend of software development in the area of Industrial Process Measurement and Control System (IPMCS). This new standard simplifies the development of distributed IPMCS applications through inclusion of re-usability, encapsulation and modularity. IEC 61499, due to its close resemblance with Object-Oriented (OO) paradigm also paves the way to integrate modeling techniques like UML into the development process of the distributed IPMCS applications. Yet a remarkable challenge is there to integrate or re-design the systems, elements or components designed using a monolithic language like the ones on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). In this work it is attempted to share the experiences faced while attempting to migrate a PLC controlled centralized laboratory application into an IEC 61499 compliant distributed control application. The targeted distributed control system consists of network-enabled controllers where the IEC 61499 compliant control sub-applications should run. It needs to be mentioned that the development process did not start from analysis of the specification of the instrument to be controlled but rather from a formal specification of it written in Signal Interpreted Petri Nets (SIPN).",

To realise fish-like swimming behaviours by a robotic system poses tremendous challenges, especially for the C-shape turning (CST). This requires fully understanding of fish biomechanics and the way to mimic it. Based on observations of fish swimming, this paper presents a new kinematics model to mimic the CST behaviour in a robotic fish with a 4-DOF (degrees of freedom) tail. The simulated and the real experiments are conducted to show the theoretic feasibility. Both behaviour analyses and hydrodynamics features between the robotic fish and the real fish are presented to show the performance.",

Since the main drawback of these devices is their high cost, the proposed actuator exploits the simplicity of its design to provide a low-cost actuation alternative. Based on shape memory alloy (SMA) technology, the actuator consists of an antagonist arranged pair of NiTi helical springs. The actuator of 1.5 mm diameter and 150 mg weight is capable of developing a 320 mN pull force and 1.5 Hz bandwidth by using simple forced-air convection. A combined computational/experimental study on the thermomechanical properties of both SMA active element and actuator is presented to evaluate characteristics such as actuation speed, force and stroke. In conclusion, the prototype and performance results are reported and discussed.",

We consider the problem of minimum distance localization in self-similar environments, where the robot's sensor has limited visibility, and describe two randomized algorithms that solve the problem. Our algorithms reduce the risk of requiring impractical observations and solve the problem without excessive computation. Our results are validated using numerical simulations.",

In this paper, experimental setup between Hashimoto Lab, University of Tokyo, Japan and Advanced Diagnosis Automation and Control (ADAC) Lab, North Carolina State University, USA is prepared to form an Inter-Continental Intelligent Space. A mobile robot at Hashimoto Lab is controlled by a path-tracking controller at ADAC Lab to track a predefined path with the tracking performance affected by the network time delay. Gain Scheduler Middleware is employed in the control loop to alleviate the effect of time delay. The experimental results of the mobile robot path-tracking has demonstrated the effectiveness of using Gain Scheduler Middleware to compensate the time-delay effect on teleoperation over IP network.",

It involves examining how well the legged system uses ground contact to produce acceleration of its body; these abilities are referred to as its force and acceleration capabilities. These capabilities are bounded by actuator torque limits and the no-slip condition. The resulting analysis describes the maximum translational and rotational accelerations of the main-body that are guaranteed to be achievable in every direction without causing slipping at the contact points or saturating an actuator. The method is illustrated using a hexapod as an example.",

        "abstract": "One of the major current developments in agricultural machinery aims at providing farm vehicles with automatic guidance capabilities. With respect to standard mobile robots applications, two additional difficulties have to be addressed: firstly, since farm vehicles operate on fields, sliding phenomena inevitably occurs. Secondly, due to large inertia of these vehicles, small delays introduced by low-level actuators may have noticeable effects. These two phenomena may lower considerably the accuracy of path following control laws. In this paper, a vehicle extended kinematic model is first built in order to account for sliding phenomena. These latter effects are then taken into account within guidance laws, relying upon nonlinear control techniques. Finally, a Model Predictive Control strategy is developed to reduce the effects induced by actuation delays and vehicle large inertia. Capabilities of this control scheme is demonstrated via full scale experiments carried out with a farm tractor, whose realtime localization is achieved relying uniquely upon a RTK GPS sensor.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses the capability to use concentration gridmaps to locate a static gas source. In previous works it was found that depending on the shape of the mapped gas distribution (corresponding to different airflow conditions) the gas source location can be sometimes approximated with high accuracy by the maximum in the concentration map while this is not possible in other cases. This paper introduces a method to distinguish both cases by analysing the shape of the obtained concentration map in terms of a model of the time-averaged gas distribution known from physics. The parameters of the model that approximates the concentration map most closely are determined by nonlinear least squares fitting using evolution strategies (ES). The best fit also provides a better estimate of the gas source position in situations where the concentration maximum estimate fails. Different methods to select the most truthful estimate are introduced in this work and a comparison regarding their accuracy is presented, based on a total of 34h of concentration mapping experiments.",

This paper builds on a recently proposed approach for achieving stable, high-gain force reflection via cancellation of the master mech anism\u2019s induced motion. Such a strategy hinges on obtaining a good model of the master\u2019s response to force feedback. Herein, we present a thorough modeling approach based on successive isolation of system components, demonstrated on a one-degree-of-freedom testbed. A sixth-order mechanical model, including viscous and Coulomb friction as well as a new method for modeling hysteretic stiffness, describes the testbed\u2019s high-frequency resonant modes. This modeling method\u2019s ability to predict induced master motion should lead to significant improvements in force-reflecting teleoperation via the cancellation approach.",

This paper presents a new force model for effectively simulating the interactions of the pulpal tissue with the endodontic tools. Based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, a particle-based pulpal tissue model is proposed, which takes into account characteristics of the tissue and constraints associated with both the tissue and current haptic devices. The stability, accuracy and speed of the proposed model are guaranteed by applying suitable smoothing kernels to calculate different forces applied to the pulpal tissue. Furthermore, a finite element model is used to model the deformation and dynamics of the endodontic tools. We also derive several boundary constraints associated with interactions of the pulpal tissue with the endodontic tools. With this force model, the virtual system can provide the convincing sense of touch of endodontic procedures in real time using current high fidelity haptic devices.",

To estimate intrinsic advantages and limitations of the proposed possible distributed control solution, we capture the dynamic of the system at a higher abstraction level using non-spatial probabilistic microscopic and macroscopic models. In a previous publication, we showed that we are able to predict quantitatively the performances of the swarm of robots for a given metric and a beaconless policy. In this paper, after briefly reviewing our modeling methodology, we explore the effect of adding an additional state to the individual robot controller, which allow robots to serve as a beacon for teammates and therefore bias their inspection routes. Results show that this additional complexity helps the swarm of robots to be more efficient in terms of energy consumption but not necessarily in terms of time required to complete the inspection. We also demonstrate that a beacon-based policy introduces a strong coupling among the behavior of robots, coupling which in turn results in nonlinearities at the macroscopic model level.",

The model includes the micro-cantilever's and piezotube actuator's coupled dynamics. An identification-based controller is proposed for piezotube scanner positioning accounting for the piezotube's nonlinear sensitivity and axes coupling. A novel robust adaptive controller is developed to compensate for large parametric uncertainties including time varying and switching parameters due to probe-surface contacts as well as time varying and impulsive forces due to contact and impact. Discussions and simulations are presented for typical nano-manipulation tasks.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Nanomanipulation using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has been extensively investigated for many years. However, control of tip position during nanomanipulation is still a major issue because of the deformation of the cantilever caused by manipulation force. The softness of the conventional cantilevers also cause the failure of the manipulation of relatively large and sticky nano-object because the tip can easily slip over the nano-object. In this paper, an active atomic force microscopy probe is used to solve these problems by changing the cantilever\u2019s flexibility or rigidity through different control strategies in imaging and manipulation modes respectively. During imaging mode, the active probe is controlled to bend up with respect to the interaction force between the tip and samples, thus making the tip response faster and increase the imaging speed. During manipulation mode, the active probe is controlled to bend down with respect to the interaction force between tip and the samples; thus increasing its nominal rigidity to avoid tip slipping over object. A detailed model of the active probe is presented in this paper and the controller designed based on the proposed active probe model is also implemented on the augmented reality system, which is an AFM based nanomanipulation system with both real-time visual and haptic feedback. The simulation results for the control strategies and the preliminary experimental results for the AFM based nanmomanipulation verified the validity of the model and effectiveness of the controller.",

        "abstract": "Three different neuromorphic vision sensors; a 2D smooth optical flow sensor, a 1D tracker sensor and a 1D motion sensor are modeled in a simulator. The sensors are modeled according to their spatio-temporal properties and the model is validated with experimental data obtained in previous work. The model parameters are fitted according to validation data, where a cost function is optimized with a gradient descent approach. The simulator used is the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) and the experimental data from previous work was collected in a typical RoboCup scenario. A soccer playing robot is here used to provide reference information from a standard digital tracker system. By modeling the output from neuromorphic vision sensors, it is possible to reconstruct the experiment in the simulator. We will present simulated data from this particular experiment and compare it to the ground truth validation data. This work is important in order to reduce the time needed for real-world experiments for the set-up and optimization phase during the integration of such sensors into robotic systems. At the end we will also make an indication of the direction of future research.",

The contribution in the modeling aspect is a formulation of the Detection and Tracking of Mobile Objects and the Simultaneous Localization and Map Building in such a way that the nature (static/dynamic) of the observations is included in the estimation process. This is achieved by a set of filters tracking the moving objects and a map of the static structure constructed on line. In addition, this paper discusses how this modeling module is integrated in a real sensor-based navigation system taking advantage selectively of the dynamic and static information. The experimental results confirm that the complete navigation system is able to move a vehicle in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, the system overcomes many of the limitations of previous systems associated to the ability to distinguish the nature of the parts of the scenario.",

When operating in circuit-like trajectories (e.g. surveillance), acquiring large cyclic maps and closing these trajectories is very important. This paper presents the use of map-based a-priori knowledge for constraining the solution to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This is formulated in a Bayesian framework where a probabilistic model of the traversable environment (e.g. road network map) is used to minimise the accumulated errors in robot localization during cyclic mapping. The implementation uses an adaptive Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to optimise computation. The map-based priors are generated from a road network map that describes the robot traversable areas. The principle is to bind effectively the adaptive sample-based representation of the robot estimation using the probability map whilst detecting and mapping distinct features found at the roadsides. it allows the number of samples to be reduced and the particle depletion problem that compromises the robot closing large loops minimized. Extensive experiments were conducted using a vehicle test-bed travelling at 15Km/h in a University Campus road network. These have shown that our approach enables us to build cyclic maps and thus close the cycles (trajectories) in a much better manner than other existing methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a motion control algorithm of a passive-type walking support system based on environment information. The passive-type walking support system we developed consists of a support frame, two casters, and two wheels with servo brakes. This system has a passive dynamics with respect to the force/moment applied to it, because it does not have any actuators for driving it, so that this system is intrinsically safe for using it based on the physical interaction between the system and the human being. In this research, we control the motion of the passive walker by adjusting the brake torque of each wheel based on the environment information, so that a user could avoid the collision with obstacles, prevent missing his/her step, and compensate the gravity of the system as if the user could use it safely on any roads such as the road with steep sloop. The proposed control algorithms are applied to passive-type walker referred to as RT Walker experimentally, and we show that RT Walker can be utilized successfully in environments such as the stairs, obstacles, and slops.",

For the long distance locating problem, a relay locating approach is presented to solve robot locating and to estimate the orientation of the robot by using vision and distance information from encoder and CAD model. The movement orientation can be adjusted rivet by rivet in the inspection process. The experimental results show that the control algorithm works well, and orientation estimation algorithm provides an acceptable orientation precision for continuous rivet inspection.",

In this paper, based on the dynamics-based information processing system, we propose the motion emergency system design method for a humanoid robot designing a dynamical system that has an attractor considering the robot body dynamics.

We propose a two layered approach to plan motions of multiple mobile agents in real-time. The mobile agents are moving in a 2-dimensional static environment with open spaces connected to each other by narrow corridors. The global path of each agent is computed by a decoupled planner during the preprocessing process with minimum delay. Each agent\u2019s local path is generated in real-time by combining steering behaviors and a new, principled and efficient AI technique for decision making and planning cooperative multi-agent dynamic systems, Coordination Graph (CG). With CG, we can not only avoid deadlocks in narrow corridors, but also achieve more complicated behavior such as leader-and-followers behavior. We show, via some preliminary examples, real-time performance of our approach, for instance, several robots avoiding deadlocks and successfully navigating a corridor.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a study of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with omni-directional mobility and rover-like climbing ability is presented. Various rovers with robust locomotion design had been developed. However, the rover locomotion design with omni-directional mobility has not been addressed commonly. Shrimp suspension system and parallel bogies were employed as robot locomotion. It adapts to the terrain profile passively and it has better climbing capability than other rovers. To achieve a singularityless motion, the kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR), including a platform equipped with six omni-directional wheels (ODWs), is formulated. The contents of this study are the design principle, kinematics, and motion studies. Also, experimental results have been employed to verify the model developed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system developed in the SmartTracking project to simultaneously estimate the egomotion of a mobile platform and the structure of the environment in which the platform moves. This is required in applications such as robot navigation and augmented reality (AR) to overlay virtual information correctly. The egomotion estimation is achieved by integrating visual and inertial sensor data. The structure estimation is based on the detection of corner features in the environment. From a single known starting position, the system can move into an unknown environment. To enable fast robotics applications the system uses specially developed CMOS cameras that operate at a rate of 2000 image windows per second. The vision and inertial data are fused with an extended Kalman filter. The filter is designed to handle asynchronous input from these two sensors, which typically operate at different and possibly varying rates. Additionally, a bank of filters is used to estimate the quality of structure points and to include them into the structure estimation process. The system is demonstrated on a set-up with known ground truth, such that the motion from a known reference template into a new unknown environment can be shown.",

One of the novel features of our approach is that each movement primitive is represented and stored as a set of joint trajectory basis functions; these basis functions are extracted via a principal component analysis of human motion capture data. By representing arbitrary movements as a linear combination of these basis functions, and by taking advantage of recently developed geometric optimization algorithms for multibody systems, dynamics-based optimization can be more efficiently performed. Case studies with a diverse set of arm movements demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

The selection of the sequence of locations, where the robot should go to collect the gas concentration measurements, is performed in real-time and is based on the minimization of the uncertainty of the estimated parameters and on reducing the time to convergence of this estimation problem. Simulation results are presented in order to confirm the described approach, which has significantly lower computational requirements than other well-known techniques based on exhaustive global search.",

The new actuator array uses Segmented Binary Control (SBC), which controls the SMA wires segment by segment in a digital manner. Normally, SMA wires are hard to control and require nonlinear controllers to control each wire. SBC simplifies the control of SMA wire but increases the complexity of the design and the number of control loops. A multi-axis segmentation theory has been developed to reduce the design complexity and the number of control loops by reducing the number of segments. Segmentation architecture of an actuator array is designed for five-fingered robotic hand that performs fourteen different postures. The segmentation architecture is implemented with ten SMA wires sandwiched between a layer of thermoelectric modules embedded on a printed circuit board and a layer of acrylic substrate board with grooves. Initial results of the segmented binary controlled SMA wire are verified with minimum segment architecture of a single axis.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new approach to the control of highly nonlinear shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator systems, in which SMA wires are divided into many segments and their thermal states are controlled individually as a group of finite state machines. Instead of driving a current to the entire SMA wire and controlling the wire length based on the analogue strain-temperature characteristics, the new method controls the discrete state (austenite or martensite) of individual segments and thereby controls the total displacement proportional to the number of the austenite segments. Although the inherent property of SMA is highly nonlinear and uncertain with a prominent hysteresis, this Hysteresis Loop Control is robust and stable, providing characteristics similar to a stepping motor. Furthermore, this method can apparently eliminate the latency time associated with phase transition of SMA actuators. Coordination of the multitude of segments having independent thermal states allows for fast response with zero latency time even for thick SMA wires. The new control method is implemented using the Peltier effect thermoelectric devices for selective segment-by-segment heating and cooling. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method, which exploits the inherent hysteresis and nonlinearity of SMA rather than compensating for the nonlinearity.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the possibility and necessity of multi-step trajectory planning in Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based SLAM is investigated. The objective of the trajectory planning here is to minimize the estimation error of the robot and landmark locations subject to a given time horizon. We show that the problem can be regarded as an optimization problem for a gradually identified model. A numerical method is proposed for trajectory planning using a variant of the nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed method is optimal in the sense that the control action is computed using all the information available at the time of decision making. Simulation results are included to compare the results from the one-step look-ahead trajectory planning and the proposed multi-step look-ahead technique.",

        "abstract": "Many robot navigation tasks require the computation of the motion of multiple objects moving in 3-D space from a collection of images taken by a moving robot. In this paper we present a unifying theoretical framework for both infinitesimal and discrete 3-D motion segmentation from optical flow or point correspondences in multiple affine, perspective or central panoramic views. We exploit the fact that for these motion and camera models, the image measurements associated with a single object live in a low dimensional subspace of a high dimensional space, hence motion segmentation is achieved by segmenting data living in multiple subspaces. We solve this problem in closed form using polynomial fitting and differentiation. Unlike previous work, our method does not restrict the motion of the objects to be full dimensional or fully independent. Instead, our approach deals gracefully with all the spectrum of possible motions: from low dimensional and partially dependent to full dimensional and fully independent. In addition, our method handles the case of missing data, meaning that point tracks do not have to be visible in all images. We test our algorithm on various real sequences with degenerate and nondegenerate motions, missing data, transparent motions, etc. Our algorithm achieves a misclassification error of less than 5% for sequences with up to 30% of missing data points.",

        "abstract": "A good localization ability is essential for an autonomous vehicle to perform any functions. For ground vehicles operating in outdoor, uneven and unstructured environments, the localization task becomes much more difficult than in indoor environments. In urban or forest environments where high buildings or tall trees exist, GPS sensors also fail easily. The main contribution of this paper is that a multi-aided inertial based localization system has been developed to solve the outdoor localization problem. The multi-aiding information is from odometry, an accurate gyroscope and vehicle constraints. Contrary to previous work, a kinematic model is developed to estimate the inertial sensor\u2019s lateral velocity. This is particularly important when cornering at speed, and side slip occurs. Experimental results are presented of this system which is able to provide a vehicle\u2019s position, velocity and attitude estimation accurately, even when the testing vehicle runs in outdoor uneven environments.",

The probability density function (PDF) for each individual target location is accurately maintained by an independent instance of a general Bayesian filter. The team utility for the search vehicles trajectories is given by the sum of the `cumulative' probability of detection for each target. A dual-objective switching function is also introduced to direct the search towards the mode of the nearest target PDF when the utility becomes too low in a region to distinguish between trajectories. Simulation results for both clustered and isolated targets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed search strategy for multiple targets.",

In the present work we explore the range of functions that whisker arrays can serve on a rover. We demonstrate that when mounted on a rover, whisker arrays can (1) Detect obstacles and determine obstacle distance (2) Map terrain features (3) Determine ground and surface texture (4) Provide an estimate of rover speed (5) Identify \u201cslip\u201d of the rover wheels, and (6) Perform 3-dimensional extraction of object shape.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new adaptive control scheme for bilateral teleoperation in unknown environments. Traditional fixed-gain teleoperation methods often sacrifice performance in order to remain stable in the presence of large variations in the environment dynamics. In contrast, the proposed approach adjusts itself to the changes in the environment to maintain its stability without compromising performance. It is assumed that the dynamics of the environment are governed by a model from a finite set of environment models at any given time with Markov chain switching between these models. The first-order generalized pseudo-Bayesian (GPB1) multi-model estimation technique is used to identify the effective model at each time step given the sensory observations. The control action is a weighted sum of mode-based control laws that are designed for each mode of operation. Numerical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for teleoperation in free motion and in contact with rigid environments.",

The area around the robot is subdivided into an occupancy grid with 0.5m by 0.5m cells. A data fusion algorithm, based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, is used to estimate the probability of human occupancy for each cell. This information is used to estimate the human\u2019s location.

We describe how to generate gaits in the base space of the fiber bundle, or the shape space of the robot on which we assume full control. Such gaits are guaranteed to generate a non-zero motion along the fiber space, i.e., a net change in the position of the robot, while making sure that the robot\u2019s shape is unchanged after a complete cycle. The gait generation technique presented in this paper is intuitive; it involves dividing the base space into well defined regions and devising a set of simple rules on how to generate curves in such regions. Not only do such curves guarantee non-zero position change but also do allow for gait optimization.",

        "abstract": "We present an outdoor terrain planner that finds near optimal trajectories under dynamic and kinematic constraints. The planner can find solutions in close to real time by relaxing some of the assumptions associated with costly rigid body simulation and complex terrain surface interactions. Our system is based on control-driven Proba bilistic Roadmaps and can efficiently find and optimize a near time-minimum trajectory. We present simulated results with artificial environments, as well as a real robot experiment using Segway Robotic Mobile Platform.",

        "abstract": "Searching for optimal needle insertion path by intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is complex and time-consuming task in MR-guided microwave thermotherapy of liver tumor. This paper reports the semi-active needle-guiding robot for MR-guided therapy by which a surgeon can freely selects needle insertion path while maintaining the remote center of motion at the pre-defined tumor site. The robot consists of three-degree-of-freedom active XYZ base stage with ultrasonic motors and passive needle holder with unconstrained two-degree-of-freedom rotation measured by optical fiber sensor with aluminum die cast. Once the target point on the tumor is defined in volumetric MR images, the base stage keeps the remote-center-of-motion at the target point, while physician can interactively selects the orientation of the needle path with continuous single slice MR imaging. Experiments to test the accuracy of remote-center-of-motion indicated that the robot can keep the needle tip with an average error of 0.7 \u223c 0.3 mm in the compatibility test showed the robot can be safely used in MR axial plane, and 1.0-0.4 mm in the sagittal plane. Unlike related studies published elsewhere where the MR compatible robot autonomously brings the tools to predefined location, the proposed approach is fit to use in microwave thermotherapy of liver cancer.",

Implement ing output feedback for control, instead of full-state feedback, allows use of only the position information. The position can be measured quite accurately, while velocity and acceleration measurements tend to get corrupted by noise. As well, having only a position sensor reduces costs in producing the robot. The three methods examined each use some form of state estimation. The methods examined are: a method proposed by Lee and Khalil using a high-gain observer, Craig, Hsu, and Sastry\u2019s method of adaptive robot control using a linear observer that we propose herein, and a method proposed by Gourdeau and Schwartz using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The methods are all implemented in simulation and compared in both noise-free and noise-contaminated cases.",

Given time series produced by a process composed of different underlying states, the algorithm predicts future time series values based on past time series values for each state. Unlike many algorithms, this algorithm predicts a multi-modal distribution over future values. This prediction forms the basis for labelling part of a time series with the underlying state that created it given some labelled example signals. The algorithm is robust to a wide variety of possible types of changes in signals including changes in mean, amplitude, amount of noise, and period. We show results demonstrating that the algorithm successfully segments signals from several robotic sensors generated while performing a variety of simple tasks.",

The imaging system consists of an isotropic convex mirror and a camera pointing vertically toward the mirror with its optical axis aligned with the mirror's optical axis. Because of these optics, angular resolution is independent of the azimuth angle. However, it is important for a mobile robot to find and avoid obstacles in its path. We consider that angular resolution in the direction of the robot's moving needs higher resolution than that of its lateral view. In this paper, we propose a non-isotropic omnidirectional imaging system for navigating a mobile robot.",

A stability condition has been derived based on the analysis in Ln \u221e space and its physical interpretation has been given. The analysis shows that the stability of nonlinear bang-bang impact control depends on sampling time and the accuracy of inertia estimation. Stability is enhanced with the decrease of changes in the Coriolis, centrifugal, and disturbance forces. The stability condition is verified by simulations and experiments. Experiments show that overall performance is comparable to or better than existing impact control techniques which employ more complicated control strategies.",

        "abstract": "To keep pace with recent advances in micro robotic structures demands actuator technologies which can deliver high power and precise motion. For electroactive material based actuators, high power typically implies either high field or high current drives which may lead to greater nonlinearities such as saturation, softening, and increased loss. Physical modeling of actuators is normally taken to be linear since the range of displacements, applied loads, and applied fields is typically small. If extrapolated to high drive conditions, these linear models significantly over predict the power which can be delivered. For actuators driving dynamic systems, a complete nonlinear model of the system will improve controllability and give more accurate estimations of power delivery capabilities. Here static nonlinearities and dynamic linear and nonlinear parameters are derived for high performance piezoelectric bending actuators.",

This sensor is a mechanical resonator sensor using a piezoelectric bimorph which measures elastic deformation of media by external force. The sensor is robust and has self-sensing capability. We derived the relationship between sensor output and spring constant at each vibration mode by the piezoelectric analysis and vibration analysis. The validity of sensor was demonstrated by experiment. As an application, a robot fingertip with tactile sensor was fabricated and evaluated.",

We show the orthogonality between the directions of active and passive force closures for general grasping systems. Based on the orthogonality, we decompose the dynamics of grasping system into the\u201d active part\u201d and the\u201d passive part\u201d. By using the decomposition, we show that the grasped object can be manipulated only by considering the dynamics of the active part. We also consider how to determine the desired internal forces in order to satisfy frictional constraints during the manipulation.

The optimal body posture is the posture with the maximum possible moving speed w. r. t. slope and moving direction. The proposed method based on dynamically changing body posture during gait-transitions, is used to maintain high robot motion velocity on slope. The timing of changing body posture is designed by considering the stability during gait-transition. Using the proposed method, the robot can walk into any direction with the fastest moving speed on a slope. Through walking experiments by computer simulation, the validity of the proposed method has been verified.",

Acquiring 3D models of environments is also an important task on its own with many possible applications like creating virtual interactive walkthroughs or as basis for 3D-TV. In this paper we present our method to acquire a 3D model using a mobile robot that is equipped with a laser scanner and a panoramic camera. The method is based on calculating dense depth maps for panoramic images using pairs of panoramic images taken from different positions using stereo matching. Traditional 2D-SLAM using laser-scan-matching is used to determine the needed camera poses. To receive high-quality results we use a high-quality stereo matching algorithm \u2013 the graph cut method. We describe the necessary modifications to handle panoramic images and specialized post-processing methods.",

However, both types of cameras suffer from the lack of depth perception. A practical method for obtaining depth in computer vision is to project a known structured light pattern on the scene avoiding the problems and costs involved by stereo vision. This paper is focused on the idea of combining omnidirectional vision and structured light with the aim to provide 3D information about the scene. The resulting sensor is formed by a single catadioptric camera and an omnidirectional light projector. It is also discussed how this sensor can be used in robot navigation applications.",

Similar to human beings, versatile sensors are involved in writing procedure of robot to percept stages of task fulfillment and status of writing-brush. It is well known that the structures of Chinese characters are very complex and delicate. The writing-brush is soft and can draw strokes of different and variable widths, which makes Chinese calligraphy a sort of art like painting. Since the relations of strokes of Chinese characters are complicated and the writing-brush is extremely intricate to handle that it might result in inconsistent strokes with even slight changes in environment, dynamic management of sensors is hence a critical issue for a successful writing of an elegant Chinese character. This paper presents a sensor management method based on fuzzy decision tree (FDT), with which necessary prerequisite knowledge of Chinese character writing can be integrated into control of calligraphic robot system. Properties of sensor management problem in calligraphic robot are analyzed. Implementation of the proposed method is discussed. Experiments evaluate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method.",

Modern advancements in wearable robotics may make those methods obsolete. Lower extremity exoskeletons seek to supplement the intelligence and sensory systems of a human with the significant strength and endurance of a pair of wearable robotic legs that support a payload. This paper outlines the use of Clinical Gait Analysis data as the framework for the design of such a system at UC Berkeley.",

        "abstract": "Feedback linearization is a viable nonlinear control technique for solving trajectory tracking problems in robots with (and without) elastic joints. However, the additional presence of dissipative effects due to joint viscosity destroys full state feedback linearizability. For robots with visco-elastic joints, the use of a static state feedback can achieve at most input-output linearization and decoupling, since an internal nonlinear dynamics is left in the closed-loop system. Although the stability properties of this unobservable dynamics still guarantee perfect output tracking in nominal conditions, control design based on static feedback becomes ill-conditioned as joint viscosity decreases. Instead, resorting to a nonlinear dynamic state feedback leads to the same closed-loop properties, but with a regularized control effort for any level of joint viscosity and elasticity. Static and dynamic nonlinear feedback control designs are presented for a reduced and a complete dynamic model of visco-elastic joint robots. A numerical comparison on a simple case study illustrates the benefits of the dynamic input-output linearization approach.",

        "abstract": "The first functional load-carrying and energetically autonomous exoskeleton was demonstrated at U.C. Berkeley, walking at the average speed of 1.3 m/s while carrying a 34 kg (75 lb) payload. Four fundamental technologies associated with the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) were tackled during the course of this project. These four core technologies include: the design of the exoskeleton architecture, control schemes, a body local area network (bLAN) to host the control algorithm and an on-board power unit to power the actuators, sensors and the computers. This article gives an overview of one of the control schemes. The analysis here is an extension of the classical definition of the sensitivity function of a system: the ability of a system to reject disturbances or the measure of system robustness. The control algorithm developed here increases the closed loop system sensitivity to its wearer\u2019s forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control method has little robustness to parameter variations and therefore requires a relatively good dynamic model of the system. The tradeoffs between having sensors to measure human variables and the lack of robustness to parameter variation are described.",

We propose a method to judge the possibility of excessive internal forces on manipulated objects. The judgment is based on rigid-body mechanics with Coulomb friction and given by solving a series of linear programming problems.

It is possible to decide whether a mechanism is trilaterable by relying only on its topology. Based on this fact, we here enumerate all trilaterable serial and in-parallel robots with six degrees of freedom. The relevance of the obtained family of manipulators is established when it is shown to contain the best-known commercial serial robots. As a result of this analysis, we come up with a general method to solve the inverse/direct kinematics of a wide family of manipulators.",

        "abstract": "Current and future NASA robotic missions to planetary surfaces are tending toward longer duration and are becoming more ambitious for rough terrain access. For a higher level of autonomy in such missions, the rovers will require behavior that must also adapt to declining rover health and unknown environmental conditions. The MER (Mars Exploration Rovers) called Spirit and Opportunity have both passed 350 days of life on the Martian surface, with possible extensions to 450 days and beyond depending on rover health. Changes in navigational planning due to degradation of the drive motors as they reach their lifetime are currently done on Earth for the Spirit rover. The upcoming 2009 MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) and 2013 AFL (Astrobiology Field Laboratory) missions are planned to last 300-500 days, and will possibly involve traverses on the order of multiple kilometers over challenging terrain. This paper presents an adaptive control algorithm for onboard learning of weights within a free flow hierarchy (FFH) behavior framework for autonomous control of planetary surface rovers that explicitly addresses the issues of rover health and rough terrain access. We also present the results of some laboratory and field studies.",

This paper presents a method for identifying multiple unknown soil parameters in real-time using the novel Modified Newton Raphson Method. The new approach involving a model selection strategy based on Parallel Execution Model, Flexible Parallel Execution Model and Hybrid Execution Model consisting of the Mohr-Coulomb soil model and the Chen and Liu Upper Bound soil model is examined. The identification of unknown soil parameters is achieved by minimizing the error between the measured forces and the modeled forces computed by the soil model. The results demonstrate that the proposed estimation scheme is accurate when comparing to the measured soil parameters. In addition, the reduced processing time of convergence and high robustness with respect to initial conditions show that the proposed method has real time estimation capability. The proposed method is very promising and highly suitable for soil-bucket interaction identification for an autonomous excavation system in an unpredictable, dynamic environment.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that in human-robot interaction, the effectiveness of a robot varies inversely with the operator engagement in the task. Given the importance of maintaining optimal task engagement when working with a robot, it would be immensely useful to have a robotic system that can detect the level of operator engagement and modify its behavior if required. This paper presents a framework for human-robot interaction in which operator's physiological signals were analyzed to infer his/her engagement level and the robot behavior was adapted as a function of the operator affective state. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and a control architecture inspired by Riley's original information-flow model was developed to implement such human-robot interaction. The results from affect-elicitation tasks for human participants showed that it is possible to detect engagement through physiological sensing in real-time. A teleoperation-based robotic experiment was also conducted to demonstrate that the presented control architecture allowed the robot to adapt its behavior based on operator engagement level.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a new approach to calculate the optical flow, which uses the decentralized information filter to accomplish a data fusion step. The proposal consists in taking some least mean square estimates of the optical flow vector associated to a certain region of the image considered and to fuse them in order to get a more accurate final estimate of such a vector. Besides this, the way the initial least mean square estimates are obtained is also modified, by reducing the number of observations used to get each one of them, in order to make the overall algorithm faster. The idea is that such initial estimates can be rougher, once the fusion engine improves the accuracy of the final estimate, in the sense that the decentralized information filter generates a final estimate whose variance is lower than the smallest variance associated to the initial estimates.",

        "abstract": "Robotic networks for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV\u2019s) are an area where efficient use of the communications channel can increase both the mission time and the amount of information communicated between the AUVs, thus resulting in a more effective mission. The traffic in robotic networks must be managed in such a way that takes into account transmission delay, power efficiency, and traditional network measures such as queue length, throughput, and bandwidth efficiency. System optimization of all these criteria is possible because of the cooperative nature of robotic networks. This paper presents a procedure for con structing optimal controllers that limit and route information flow in a network of AUVs. Particular attention is paid to the objectives of maximizing throughput and bandwidth efficiency while minimizing power consumption and queue length. A receding horizon control approach is adopted and shown to yield piecewise continuous optimal controllers that are unique.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes to optimally design a parallel machine based on multiple criteria. Many criteria, workspace, condition number, accuracy, stiffness, maximum velocity, and maximum force, are considered. The optimal design problem is proposed as to find a set of design parameters such that (a) the Cartesian workspace generated by the resulting manipulator contains a prescribed workspace; (b) the resulting manipulator possesses a good condition number at each points in the prescribed workspace; (c) the resulting manipulator possesses good performance on accuracy, stiffness, velocity/force transmission factor. By some manipulations, the requirements on the latter four criteria are reduced to constraints on singular values of the kinematic Jacobian. A trade-off must be made since there're opposite requirements among those four criteria. The singular values of kinematic Jacobian are limited in a given interval to guarantee good properties. All the requirement are finally reduced to polynomial inequalities with respect to design parameters. The optimal design problem is transformed into a Max-Det optimization problem that can be ef ficiently solved. The Orthoglide is used as an example to demonstrate the procedure.",

The general case of heterogeneous (in terms of sensor accuracy) robot teams performing Cooperative Localization is considered. An analysis of the time evolution of the covariance matrix of the position estimates allows us to express the steady-state positioning uncertainty of the robots as an analytic function of the relative positions of the robots in the formation. This metric encapsulates the effect of formation geometry on the information content of the exteroceptive measurements, as well as the effect of the influx of uncertainty due to the errors in the robots\u2019 odometry. Thus, by minimizing the trace of the steady state covariance matrix with respect to the positions of the robots, the optimal robot configuration can be determined. Numerical experiments are presented, which indicate that it is possible to derive a practical rule for determining optimal formations, without the need to resort to extensive simulations, or experimentation.",

Due to the specific movement characteristic of the Crawler robot, the path, or the rivet sequence should enable the Crawler robot to realize the localization-and-reposition process. Therefore a final path is subject to the following three requirements: i) the distance between any two consecutive rivets on the path should be less than a threshold distance; ii) the number of turns should be minimized and iii) the overall distance should be minimized. In this paper, a novel algorithm is developed to generate the required path. This algorithm first identifies the minimum set of line segments partitioning all the rivets and then connects the line segments to minimize the overall distance. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the task of repositioning a formation of robots to a new shape while minimizing either the maximum distance that any robot travels, or the total distance traveled by the formation. We show that optimal solutions in SE (2) can be achieved for either metric through second-order cone programming (SOCP) techniques. For the case where the orientation of the new formation shape is fixed, we obtain optimal solutions in both R2and R3. The latter also allows for complete regulation of the formation size via constraints on the shape scale. We expect that these results will prove useful for extending the mission lives of robot formations and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to obtain optimal cyclic gaits for a biped without actuated ankle. For the walking, the gait is composed of successive single support phases and instantaneous double support phases that are modeled by passive impact equations. The legs swap their roles from one single support phase to the next one. During each phase the evolution of the joints variables is assumed to be polynomial functions of a scalar path parameter. The coefficients of the polynomial functions are chosen to optimise a torque criterion and to insure a cyclic motion for the biped. Furthermore, the optimal gait is defined with respect to given performances of actuators. The torques and velocities at the output of the gearbox are bounded. For this study, the physical parameters of a prototype are used. Initial starting motions that are composed of a double support and a transitional single support are also defined.",

Such paths are typically computed without taking into account any optimality criteria and may contain many \u201cjagged\u201d segments because of the randomness involved in their generation. This paper presents a two-phase path planning algorithm, which uses a randomized planner to compute low-cost paths, and gradient descent to locally optimize these paths by minimizing a Hamiltonian function. The algorithm is tested on motion planning for a non-holonomic car-like robot. The results indicate that the two-phase approach is practical; however, gradient descent seems to be inefficient for the optimization of long paths.",

All our algorithms are output-sensitive, which means that their running times largely depend on the actual output size K rather than the (often much larger) maximum size of the output. More specifically, we show how to determine \u2022 all form-closure grasps with four points along four arcs in O(n8/3log1/3n + K) time, \u2022 all form-closure grasps with four points along three arcs in O(n5/2+\u03b5+ K) time, \u2022 all form-closure grasps with one point at a concave vertex and two points along two arcs in O(n2m1/2+\u03b5+ K) time, \u2022 all form-closure grasps with one point at a concave vertex and two points along a single arc in O(nm) or O(n3/2+\u03b5+ K) time (depending on the size of m), \u2022 all form-closure grasps with two points at concave vertices and one point along arc in O(nm2) or O (n2+\u03b5+ K) time (depending on the size of m), where \u03b5 is an arbitrarily small positive constant.

        "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate path planning for our formation space that represents permutation-invariant multi-robot formations. Earlier methods generally pre-assign roles for each individual robot, rely on local planning and behaviors to build emergent behaviors, or give robots implicit constraints to meet. Our method first directly plans the formation as a set, and only afterwards determines which robot takes which role. To build our representation of this formation space, we make use of a property of complex polynomials: they are unchanged by permutations of their roots. Thus we build a characteristic polynomial whose roots are the robot locations, and use its coefficients as a representation of the formation. Mappings between work spaces and formation spaces amount to building and solving polynomials. In this paper, we construct an efficient obstacle collision detector, and use it in a local planner. From this we construct a basic roadmap planner. We thus demonstrate that our polynomial based representation can be used for effective permutation invariant formation planning.",

These configurations correspond to minimal-energy curves. The representation is adaptive in the sense that the number of parameters automatically varies with the complexity of the underlying curve. We introduce a planner that computes paths from one minimal-energy curve to another such that all intermediate curves are also minimal-energy curves. Using a simplified model for obstacles, we can find minimal-energy curves of fixed length that pass through specified tangents at given control points.

        "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operate in ocean environments characterized by complex spatial variability which can jeopardize their missions. To avoid this, planning safety routes with minimum energy cost is of primary importance. This work explores the benefits, in terms of energy cost, of path planning in marine environments showing certain spatial variability. Extensive computations have been carried out to calculate, by means of an A* search procedure, optimal paths on ocean environments with different length scale of eddies and different current intensities. To get statistical confidence, different realizations of the eddy field and starting-ending points of the path have been considered for each environment. Unlike previous works, the more realistic and applied case of constant thrust power navigation is considered. Results indicate that substantial energy savings of planned paths compared to straight line trajectories are obtained when the current intensity of the eddy structures and the vehicle speed are comparable. Conversely, the straight line path between starting and ending points can be considered an optimum path when the current speed does not exceed half of the vehicle velocity. In both situations, benefits of path planning seem dependent of the spatial structure of the eddy field.",

To overcome this drawback, a combination with a random sampling scheme is proposed. Harmonic functions are computed over a 2 d-tree decomposition of a d-dimensional Configuration Space that is obtained with a probabilistic cell decomposition (sampling and classification). Cell sampling is biased towards the more promising regions by using the harmonic function values. Cell classification is performed by evaluating a set of configurations of the cell obtained with a deterministic sampling sequence that provides a good uniform and incremental coverage of the cell. The proposed planning framework opens the use of harmonic functions to higher dimensional C-spaces.",

By limiting the COG (Center of Gravity) motion space to a sculptured surface, the degree of freedom of the COG matches to the number of the ZMP (Zero Moment Point) equations. The COG motion can be uniquely generated along a specified surface satisfying the ZMP constraint with low calculation cost. Spatial and time parts are separable by representing motion surface of the COG as parametric variables. The motion surface defines the relative height of the COG from the landing foot position. Thus, the proposed method reflects geometric information directly to the motion planning without considering walk stability. In this paper, we show two actual examples, walking pattern including mostly stretched knee and going up stairs. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation. Walking with mostly stretched knee is also shown in experiment using HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "The self-propelled swimming performance of two prototypes designed to mimic the kinematics of real fish swimming at high Reynolds numbers is presented. The design methodology uses structural compliance instead of discrete assemblies to achieve desired kinematics. Experiments took place at Reynolds numbers between 15\u00d7103 and 90\u00d7103. A prototype with a thick peduncle, low aspect ratio caudal fin, and uniform material distribution throughout its flexible tail, reached a maximum forward velocity of 0.11ms\u2212 1 that coincided with a maximum thrust of 0.2N. A second prototype with a thin peduncle, high aspect ratio caudal fin, and nonuniform material distribution throughout its tail, reached a maximum forward velocity of 0.31ms\u2212 1 that coincided with a maximum thrust close to 0.11N. Peak velocities and thrusts occured at driving frequencies between 2.7Hz and 3.5Hz for the type of kinematics used, and corresponded to Strouhal numbers close to 1.75 and 0.8 respectively. Mechanism motions were achieved in open loop, hence improvements can be made by implementing closed loop control to correct errors in desired kinematics. Finally, this study shows that simpler, more robust mechanisms, as the ones accomplished with our new design methodology, can display similar or better performance than the state of the art.",

An application of specific interest is sinus surgery, in which complicated anatomic structure constrains the motion of the endoscope and other instruments, which are inserted through the nose into a sinus cavity. We have implemented this method in both hands-on cooperative operation and teleoperation control mode. We evaluate and compare user performance in these two operation modes. We show that cooperative operation is more intuitive for the user and easier to use. On the other hand, due to the robot stiffness of our current implementation, teleoperation mode shows more accurate. Both of these two robot-assisted modes significantly improve human\u2019s performance compared to the totally freehand motion.",

The main contributions of our approach include: 1) establishing the correspondence between the control inputs to the pan/tilt units and the pixel displacement in the image plane without using the intrinsic parameters of the cameras; and 2) derivation of the distance information from the correspondence between the centers of masses of the segmented color-blobs from the left and the right images without stereo camera calibration.

        "abstract": "Medical procedures such as RFA and cryosurgery require the insertion of a needle into the target area within the body. Needle insertion is difficult because it can easily result in organs being deformed and displaced. This research aims to produce an intelligent robot for needle insertion, incorporating the following three techniques, A: visual feedback B: organ-model base control C: force control. This research uses a robot model and a liver for the target object to evaluate organ-model base control. For the purpose of organ-model base control, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the physical properties of the liver for robot control. A dynamic viscoelastic test was then carried out to show the dynamic properties of the liver in the form of a differential equation. The nonlinearity of the liver was supported by the creep test while an axial needle insertion test was also carried out to model the force and the extent of deformation experienced during needle insertion. In addition, an intelligent needle insertion robot was developed for the purpose of the experimentation concerning intelligent control of the needle. The experimental result displayed the margin error between the needle tip and target marker when the needle reaches the target position was around 1[mm] and a result led to positive findings.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores what are the fundamentals of physiologically inspired robot control through investigating two interesting but difficult problems of robot control: 1) robotic hand-writing and 2) human-like multi-joints reaching with surplus DOFs (Degrees-of-Freedom). Noteworthy characteristics in control of these systems are a) redundancy in DOF, b) dexterity in execution of a target task, and c) indispensability of sensory motor coordination, though d) their dynamics are nonlinear and governed by geometric constraints in the former system. Due to these inherent characteristics, both the conventional control-theoretic approaches originated from the linear system theory and Lyapunov\u2019s direct method are likely to fail. By gaining physical insights into these nonlinear dynamics with redundancy in DOFs and physical descriptions of target tasks, this article claims that a symbiosis of \u201crobotics\u201d and \u201cneuro-physiology\u201d is quite effective in finding a simpler sensory-motor coordination principle in each case that leads to accomplishment of each imposed task regardless of annoying characteristics of its motion dynamics with nonlinearity and DOF-redundancy.",

        "abstract": "Pivoting manipulation can be an alternative to pushing operation when the floor is not flat enough, or when the object to manipulate is too heavy. The technique of pivoting is used by humans to move large and bulky furniture from one place to another. The decomposition of the task of pivoting has already been studied, in particular with the use of two fingers of a robotic arm. This work intends to apply the technique of pivoting using an humanoid platform. The robot should be able to pivot the object and to walk with it to displace it to a specific remote location. The research achievements proposed here take place in a more long term objective aimed at improving the dexterity and the autonomy of humanoid robots. As a matter of fact, such robots should be able to handle objects and move around in the environment in an autonomous way. This paper describes the algorithm designed to perform the displacement of a large object using the pivoting technique. It also presents the results of the dynamic simulation and the results of the real hardware experiment of the HRP-2 platform performing the task.",

Because accurate sensing and modeling of obstacles is notoriously difficult in such environments, we aim to build computational tools that can handle large point data sets (e.g. LADAR data). Using a priori aerial data scans of forested environments, we compute a network of free space bubbles forming safe paths within environments cluttered with tree trunks, branches and dense foliage. The network (roadmap) of paths is used for efficiently planning paths that consider obstacle clearance information. We present experimental results on large point data sets typical of those faced by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, but also applicable to ground-based robots navigating through forested environments.",

Most of nanomanipulation schemes go through the scan-design-manipulation-scan cycle manually which is time consuming and inefficient. Automated AFM tip path planning is desirable for nanomanufacturing, but does not receive much attention. In this paper, a CAD guided automated nanomanufacturing system is presented. Based on the CAD model of a nanostructure, the manipulation paths for both nanoparticles and nanorods are generated automatically. A local scanning method is developed to compensate for the random drift that may cause the failure of the nano-assembly. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed algorithm can be employed to manufacture nanostructures efficiently. The research work opens a door to the CAD guided automated nanomanufacturing.",

Planning for these procedures is difficult because the needles bend during insertion and cause the surrounding soft tissues to displace and deform. In this paper, we develop a planning algorithm for insertion of highly flexible bevel-tip needles into soft tissues with obstacles in a 2D imaging plane. Given an initial needle insertion plan specifying location, orientation, bevel rotation, and insertion distance, the planner combines soft tissue modeling and numerical optimization to generate a needle insertion plan that compensates for simulated tissue de formations, locally avoids polygonal obstacles, and minimizes needle insertion distance. The simulator computes soft tissue deformations using a finite element model that incorporates the effects of needle tip and frictional forces using a 2D mesh. We formulate the planning problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that is locally minimized using a penalty method that converts the formulation to a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems. We apply the planner to bevel-right and bevel-left needles and generate plans for targets that are unreachable by rigid needles.",

        "abstract": "We propose a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for biped walking in which the robot learns to appropriately modulate an observed walking pattern. Via-points are detected from the observed walking trajectories using the minimum jerk criterion. The learning algorithm modulates the via-points as control actions to improve walking trajectories. This decision is based on a learned model of the Poincar\u00e9 map of the periodic walking pattern. The model maps from a state in the single support phase and the control actions to a state in the next single support phase. We applied this approach to both a simulated robot model and an actual biped robot. We show that successful walking policies are acquired.",

        "abstract": "Polychaete annelid worms provide a biological paradigm of versatile locomotion and effective motion control, adaptable to a large variety of unstructured environmental conditions (water, sand, mud, sediment, etc.). The undulatory locomotion of their segmented body is characterized by the combination of a unique form of tail-to-head body undulations, with the rowing-like action of numerous lateral appendages distributed along their body. Computational models of polychaete-like crawling and swimming have been developed, based on the Lagrangian dynamics of the system and on resistive models of its interaction with the environment, and used for simulation studies demonstrating the generation of undulatory gaits. Several lightweight robotic prototypes have been developed, whose undulatory actuation achieves propulsion on sand. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the propulsion of these robots is characterized by essential features of polychaete locomotion, in agreement with the corresponding simulations.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and proper placement of ports during robotically-assisted endoscopic surgery is critical to the success of the procedure. Improper placement of ports can lead to robot collisions, the inability to reach the surgical site, the inability to manipulate the tools properly, or collisions between the tools inside the patient\u2019s body. In current practice, port placement methods do not consider the ability of the robot to manoeuvre the tools. Furthermore, there is a lack of guidance on what the position of the robot or the configuration of its arms should be. This paper proposes to choose the best port location and determine the position of the base and arms of the robot such that its performance is maximized. Performance measures developed in the past to optimize robot design and manipulation are used to optimize the placement of ports when using a surgical manipulator for artery dissection during coronary bypass surgery.",

It first estimates rotational matrix independently, then computes translation vector and recovers the 3D structure of the object directly. Linear and nonlinear strategies are presented to estimate the rotational matrix. One is for small rotational motion and the other is used to estimate large rotational parameters. When the nonlinear technique is applied, its initial guesses are given automatically by the proposed linear estimation method. On the other hand, the presented structure recovery method is not sensitive to the rotational matrix estimation results. The proposed method is applicable to three, four or more feature points and has no constraints, such as collinear or coplanar, on their relative positions. As the number of feature points increases, the estimation results are improved while the computation cost is almost unchanged. Many experiments are performed on synthetic data and real images to demonstrate the presented technique.",

A potential field is generated in the two-dimensional \u201ctrajectory space\u201d of the UGV path curvature and longitudinal velocity. Dynamic constraints, terrain conditions, and navigation conditions can be expressed in this space. A maneuver is chosen within a set of performance bounds, based on the potential field gradient. In contrast to traditional potential field methods, the proposed method is subject to local maximum problems, rather than local minimum. It is shown that a simple randomization technique can be employed to address this problem. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully navigate a UGV between pre-defined waypoints at high speed, while avoiding unknown hazards. Further, vehicle velocity and curvature are controlled to avoid rollover and excessive side slip. The method is computationally efficient, and thus suitable for on-board real-time implementation.",

        "abstract": "Proximity query is an integral part of any motion planning algorithm and takes up the majority of planning time. Due to performance issues, most existing planners perform queries at fixed sampled configurations, sometimes resulting in missed collisions. Moreover, randomly determining collision-free configurations makes it difficult to obtain samples close to, or on, the surface of C-obstacles in the configuration space. In this paper, we present an efficient and practical local planning method in contact space which uses \u201ccontinuous collision detection\u201d (CCD). We show how, using the precise contact information provided by a CCD algorithm, a randomized planner can be enhanced by efficiently sampling the contact space, as well as by constraining the sampling when the roadmap is expanded. We have included our contact-space planning methods in a freely available state-of-the-art planning library - the Stanford MPK library. We have been able to observe that in complex scenarios involving cluttered and narrow passages, which are typically difficult for randomized planners, the enhanced planner offers up to 70 times performance improvement when our contact-space sampling and constrained sampling methods are enabled.",

In most past cases, such localization has been studied on wheeled robots with range finding sensors such as sonar or lasers. In this paper, we consider the more challenging scenario of a legged robot localizing with a limited field-of-view camera as its primary sensory input. We begin with a baseline implementation adapted from the literature that provides a reasonable level of competence, but that exhibits some weaknesses in real-world tests. We propose a series of practical enhancements designed to improve the robot\u2019s sensory and actuator models that enable our robots to achieve a 50% improvement in localization accuracy over the baseline implementation. We go on to demonstrate how the accuracy improvement is even more dramatic when the robot is subjected to large unmodeled movements. These enhancements are each individually straightforward, but together they provide a roadmap for avoiding potential pitfalls when implementing Monte Carlo Localization on vision-based and/or legged robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a technological solution for the remote fruition of an archaeological site, a cave hosting pre-historical heritage of relevant importance, using a properly equipped mobile robot. The goal is twofold: to increase the fruition of these precious paintings (both off-line and on-line with the robot moving in the cave) and to collect data (about the two-dimensional map of the complex cave and about the three-dimensional structure of the wall hosting the paints) that can be important to increase the understanding of the environment by the experts. The choice of the robot is suitable for this task before it does need a very light and minimal installation of mobile and reversible infrastructures: in fact in such an environment any intervention can cause significant damages to the archaeological site. The current modules are able to explore the cave to determine the most interesting zones (with a richer content of pre-historical wall paintings), to collect three-dimensional data (using a laser range finder) that allow the reconstruction of a planar map of the cave, the navigation between these relevant zones, the fine positioning with respect to the paintings and the reconstruction of a full three-dimensional model of the walls hosting the paints starting from a set of three images acquired from slightly different points of view.",

A key component of the design is a cable-driven transmission that exhibits low friction, negligible backlash and high linearity. Use of this transmission in a 2-DOF test rig demonstrated the capacity for stable, smooth performance in grinding and polishing operations. The prototype could be programmed quickly to remove surface flaws using compliant lead-through for teaching. During grinding, the robot was capable of measuring surface profiles to monitor grinding progress. A full-mobility design concept is proposed for an advanced surface-finishing robot.",

        "abstract": "Diseases in the gastro-intestinal tract are on an increasing trend. In order to diagnose a patient, various signals of the digestive organ, such as temperature, pH, and pressure, can offer the helpful information. Among the above mentioned signals, we choose the pressure variation as a monitoring signal. The variation of a pressure signal of the gastro-intestinal tract can offer the information of a digestive trouble or some clues of the diseases. In this paper, a pressure monitoring system for the digestive organs of a living pig is presented. This is why a pig\u2019s gastro-intestinal tract is very similar as human\u2019s. This system concept is to transmit the measured biomedical signals from a transmitter in a living pig to a wireless receiver that is positioned out of body. The integrated solution includes the following parts: (1) the swallow type pressure capsule, (2) the receiving set consisting of a receiver, decoder box, and PC. The merit of the proposed system is that the monitoring system can supply the precise and repeatable pressure in the gastro-intestinal tract. In addition, the design of low power consumption enables it to keep sending reliable signals while the pressure capsule is working in the digestive organ. The subject of the study for the pressure monitoring system is in-vivo experiments for a living pig. We achieved the pressure tracings in digestive organs and verified the validity of system after several in-vivo tests using the pressure monitoring system.",

In this paper we present Bayesian algorithms that implement the core of an imitation learning framework. We use gaze imitation, coupled with task-dependent saliency learning, to build a state of shared attention between the instructor and observer. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in a gaze following and saliency learning task implemented on an active vision robotic head. Our results suggest that the ability to follow gaze and learn instructor-and task-specific saliency models could play a crucial role in building systems capable of complex forms of human-robot interaction.",

This goal involves two additional hard constraints \u2013 a. The area of each subset must equal an a priori value. b. The union of the closure of the subsets must be equal to the polygon itself. A soft constraint is that any edge that defines the closure of any subset measures \u03c9 units or more. We give a decomposition algorithm that satisfies these constraints. Our goal is motivated by a problem involving parallel utilization of multiple unmanned reconnaissance aerial vehicles (URAVs) with heterogeneous endurance characteristics and equipped with similar sensors with heterogeneous capabilities to conduct a photographic scan of regions with urban-like structures. We discuss our motivation in greater details.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses pushing a heavy object by a humanoid robot. We modify the whole body motion considering the hand reflecting forces for the walking pattern of a humanoid robot. By assuming that linear and angular momentum of a humanoid robot are calculated, we define the projection of the Center of the Mass(CoM) as\u201d Dynamically Complemental Zero Moment Point(DCZMP)\u201d, when external forces act to the end-effectors. We propose a new method using the DCZMP for the modification control of CoM position with balancing control. The robot can keep the dynamical balance considering the DCZMP and the walking velocity in both single and double support phase. In addition, for controlling pushing force, we implement an impedance controller with the manipulation and walking velocity controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments.",

In this model, a geometrical constraint between the grasped object and two fingertips, which includes the deformation of the fingertip, is derived. Using the constraint and the local minimum of the potential energy, we newly propose a numerical algorithm in the quasi-static manipulation. Finally, we conclude that the existence of the local minimum allows us to stably grasp an object in soft fingered manipulation.",

        "abstract": "We seek to develop vision-based autonomy for small-scale aircraft known as Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Development of such autonomy presents significant challenges, in no small measure because of the inherent instability of these flight vehicles. Therefore, we propose a virtual flight testbed that seeks to mitigate these challenges by facilitating the rapid development of new vision-based control algorithms that would have been, in its absence, substantially more difficult to transition to successful flight testing. The proposed virtual testbed is a precursor to a more complex Hardware-In-the-Loop (HILS) facility currently being constructed at the University of Florida. These systems allow us to experiment with vision-based algorithms in controlled laboratory settings, thereby minimizing loss-of-vehicle risks associated with actual flight testing. In this paper, we first discuss our testbed system, both virtual and real. Second, we present our vision-based approaches to MAV stabilization, object tracking and autonomous landing. Finally, report experimental flight results for both the virtual testbed as well as for flight tests in the field, and discuss how algorithms developed in the virtual testbed were seamlessly transitioned to real flight testing.",

        "abstract": "The topic of composing inputs for systems with mechanical flexibility has received attention for many years. Two popular methods are (1) shaping a nominal trajectory by convolution with an impulse sequence which itself cancels the flexibility, and (2) trajectory parameter optimization using structured basis functions, e.g. bang-coast-bang. However, each of these methods deteriorates in a different way when the motion is rapid compared to the natural period of the flexibility. Motions synthesized using dynamic programming offer clear advantages in these situations: (1) the resulting motions are smoother than those using impulse-convolution, and (2) dynamic programming is deterministic and does not rely on a convex objective function like gradient-based parameter optimization. Examples of the shortcomings of impulse-convolution and parameter-optimization will be shown; then we present both simulation and experimental evaluation of rapid transport of a suspended object using a robot manipulator and a minimum-energy trajectory obtained by dynamic programming.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents an analysis of human reaching movements in manipulation of flexible objects. To predict the trajectory of human hand, a minimum crackle criterion has been recently proposed in literature. A different approach is explored in this paper. To explain the trajectory formation, we resort to the minimum hand jerk criterion. First, we show that this criterion matches well experimental data available in literature. Next, we argue that, contrary to the minimum crackle criterion, the minimum hand jerk criterion produces bounded hand velocity profiles for multi-mass flexible objects. Finally, we present initial experimental results confirming the applicability of the minimum hand jerk criterion in manipulation of multi-mass objects.",

The operation feeling by hands or fingers is one of the important indexes for the high-grade products. However, skilled inspectors are used to inspect some products because automatic inspection is technologically difficult or too high in cost. This paper looks at a system for inspection of the quality of a product\u2019s reaction force characteristics. This system, until now considered difficult to realize, automates the inspection method utilizing the touching of an inspector's finger. Neural network classifier is applied to the system for products to learn an inspector's finger judgment. We provide an input layer of a neural network classifier with nodes corresponding to time-and frequency-domain features of reaction forces of a product and an output layer with three nodes corresponding to a judgment; being one of non-defective, defective, or unable to judge. From experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed neural network classifier has been clarified.",

We believe that for effective speech interaction with humans in the real world, not only is speech understanding and response generation required, but also other behavioral competencies are of paramount importance. Nodding, filler insertion, face tracking, and reactions to environmental stimuli during interaction are examples of such behaviors. In this paper, we discuss the importance of those competencies, termed\u201d Naturalness Support Behavior\u201d, and list the requirements for their implementation. A layered framework that satisfies the requirements is proposed. The system is integrated into the EGO architecture, which is the behavior control architecture for the Sony humanoid robot QRIO SDR-4XII. We also present preliminary experimental results of speech interaction based on the proposed ideas and conducted on QRIO.",

This method evaluates every action and chooses the best one with a particle filter for estimation and a state-value function of dynamic programming. Different from our past work, this paper applies it to a complicated decision making task that yields local maxima and discontinuity on the state-value function. We then verify whether the method can choose proper actions or not in such a condition. As an example, total behavior of a goalkeeper for robot soccer is planned by using value iteration. This task contains three strategies, which are related to three kinds of local maxima respectively. Simulations, experiments and actual games have suggested that the method can decide actions effectively according as uncertain result of state estimation.",

It can be applied to on-line collision avoidance with no prior knowledge of the obstacles. The sensitive skin is used to build a description of the robot\u2019s surroundings. This approach is based on the configuration space but the construction of the C-obstacle surface is avoided. The motion planning algorithm consists of three phases. In each phase, the point automation moves along a specified plane, on which the mapping of the obstacles into configuration space can be simplified. Hence, the computation time is reduced and the algorithm can work in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations.",

The robot is able to dynamically build an accurate map of its immediate limited surroundings for its navigation. The dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley\u2019s membrane equation.

Previous researches on collision detection of humanoid robots which reduce collision pairs or simplify a shape of a robot has disadvantages such as increasing the dangerousness or decreasing range of movement. However our self collision detection system uses detailed geometric model and collision pairs as many as possible. We have experimentally evaluated collision detection libraries on a real-time self collision detection application of a humanoid robot. This experiment suggests that AABBs based method is much faster than conventional OBBs based method. Finally, we demonstrated real-time collision detection and avoidance function that automatically stops entire motion if self collision occurs using HRP2 humanoid robot.",

As the cell is very small, kept in the liquid, and observed through a microscope, the two-dimensional visual feedback makes difficult accurate manipulation in the 3-D world. To improve the manipulation work, we proposed an augmented human-machine interface. A 3-D visual information is provided to the operator through a 3-D reconstruction method using vision-based tracking deformations of the cell embryo. In order to stable injection tasks, the operator needs force feedback and haptic assistance during penetrating the cell envelop, the chorion. The proposed human-machine user\u2019s interface allows real-time realistic visual and haptic control strategies for constrained motion in image coordinates. Virtual haptic rendering allows to constrain the path of insertion and removal in the 3-D scene or to avoid cell destruction by controlling adequately position, velocity and force parameters.",

        "abstract": "Biped walking is easily adaptable to rough terrain such as stairs and stony paths, but the walk speed and energy efficiency on the flat ground is not so effective compared with wheeled locomotion. In this paper, we propose a biped robot to be able to walk or wheel according to the ground conditions. For wheeled locomotion, WS-2 (Waseda Shoes -No. 2) is developed which is composed of a DC motor, a spherical caster and two rubber pads on each foot. WS-2 is attached to the feet of WL-16 (Waseda Leg -No. 16) that is the world's first biped-walking robot capable of carrying a human. Also, a path planning for wheeled locomotion is presented. Through hardware experiments, the effectiveness of this foot module is confirmed.",

At first, the walking period is controlled, by adjusting the amplitude of side-to-side rocking motion. Secondly, the value to lengthen the lateral inverted pendulum is decided according to the sagittal motion effect on it. By means of this new lateral control in addition to sagittal step-length control, the 3-dimensional stable dynamic walking based on the robot inherent dynamics is realized.",

We use state machines for process monitoring and a thread-safe realtime event system to communicate changes. The tasks can be distributed over a network and communicate using interfaces or manipulate streams of data in the loop. The presented task structure is applied to a real world example.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Most reconfiguration planners for self-reconfiguring robots do not consider the placement of specific modules within the configuration. Recently, we have begun to investigate heterogeneous reconfiguration planning in lattice-based systems, in which there are various classes of modules. The start and goal configurations specify the class of each module, in addition to placement. Our previous work presents solutions for this problem with unrestricted free space available to the robot during reconfiguration, and also free space limited to a thin connected region over the entire surface of the configuration. In this paper, we further this restriction and define free space by an arbitrarily-shaped bounding region. This addresses the important problem of reconfiguration among obstacles, and reconfiguration over a rigid surface. Our algorithm plans module trajectories through the volume of the structure, and is divided into two phases: shape-forming, and sorting the goal configuration to correctly position modules by class. The worst-case running time for the first phase is O(n2) with O(n2) moves for an n-module robot, and a loose upper bound for the second phase is O(n4) time and moves. However, we show this bound to be \u0398 (n2)time and moves in common instances.",

The used algorithm is based on calculating the 3D planes in the scene upon the measured 3D points, through the normal calculation, the projection of the points onto the found planes, and the 2D triangulation of the projected points. This way, the plane regions and the corresponding contours in the model are obtained. Concerning the texture, images are assigned to the plane regions, and the complete scene is built through a stitching algorithm. Images and 3D points are projected onto a sphere, in order the information loss on free form objects, and the distortion caused by points improperly assigned to planes, to be reduced.",

        "abstract": "Acquiring models of the environment belongs to the fundamental tasks of mobile robots. Approaches addressing the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) typically process the perceived sensor data and do not influence the motion of the mobile robot. In this paper, we present an approach to actively closing loops during exploration. It applies a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to maintain multiple hypotheses about potential trajectories of the robot and corresponding maps. To prevent the particle filter from becoming overly confident, we present a technique to recover the particle diversity after successfully closing a loop. This way the particle depletion problem is avoided. The combination of our approach with the active loop closing strategy allows to deal with multiple nested loops. Experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the advantage of our method over pervious approaches to mapping with Rao-Blackwellized particle filters.",

        "abstract": "Area coverage is an important task for mobile robots, with many real-world applications. Motivated by potential efficiency and robustness improvements, there is growing interest in the use of multiple robots in coverage. Previous investigations of multi-robot coverage focuses on completeness and eliminating redundancy, but does not formally address robustness, nor examine the impact of the initial positions of robots on the coverage time. Indeed, a common assumption is that non-redundancy leads to improved coverage time. We address robustness and efficiency in a family of multi-robot coverage algorithms, based on spanning-tree coverage of approximate cell decomposition. We analytically show that the algorithms are robust, in that as long as a single robot is able to move, the coverage will be completed. We also show that non-redundant (non-back tracking) versions of the algorithms have a worst-case coverage time virtually identical to that of a single robot\u2014thus no performance gain is guaranteed in non-redundant coverage. Moreover, this worst-case is in fact common in real-world applications. Surprisingly, however, redundant coverage algorithms lead to guaranteed performance which halves the coverage time even in the worst case.",

Since the desired region can be specified arbitrarily small, the region control concept is also a generalization of setpoint control problem. Lyapunov-like functions are presented for the convergence analysis.

        "abstract": "This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Electro-Rheological Fluid (ERF) actuators in orthotics, creating a new breed of rehabilitation devices. ERFs are fluids that experience dramatic changes in rheological properties, such as viscosity or yield stress, in the presence of an electric field. Using the electrically controlled rheological properties of ERFs, compact actuators with an ability to supply high resistive torques in a controllable and tunable fashion, have been developed. This study involves the design, fabrication and testing of an ERF based knee orthotic device and the innovative ERF actuators it uses. The knee orthotic is achieved through a standard brace design with a polycentric hinge and gear system. Coupled to this are two Flat-Plate ERF actuators, given that name for their characteristic set of parallel flat plates allowing for actuation of the fluid. A full model describing the field dependant torque output of these actuators is presented along with a full detailed description of the device design. The overall knee orthotic system is designed to resist up to 25.4% of an average human knee\u2019s torque abilities and be controlled in real-time. The goal of this work is to provide a much more efficient means of rehabilitation over the average orthotic, while matching the proficiency of rehabilitation machines, all in a smaller, simpler, and more cost efficient design.",

The robot cell is aimed at augmenting the standing-up capabilities of impaired or paraplegic subjects. The setup incorporates the rehabilitation robot device, functional electrical stimulation system, measurement instrumentation and cognitive feedback system. For controlling the standing-up process a novel approach was developed integrating the voluntary activity of a person in the control scheme of the rehabilitation robot. The simulation results demonstrate the possibility of \u201cpatient-driven\u201d robot-assisted standing-up training. Moreover, to extend the system capabilities, the audio cognitive feedback is aimed to guide the subject throughout rising. For the feedback generation a granular synthesis method is utilized displaying high-dimensional, dynamic data. The principle of operation and example sonification in standing-up are presented. In this manner, by integrating the cognitive feedback and \u201cpatient-driven\u201d actuation systems, an effective motion augmentation system is proposed in which the motion coordination is under the voluntary control of the user.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for effective control of single link flexible manipulators. Dynamic models of these arms are complex because their mass is distributed along the link. Then control systems of these arms are usually complicate because they include complex observers, or some kind of inversion of these high order dynamics. We propose here a simple controller for these arms, based on a relatively new control technique called repetitive control. In order to apply this technique here, the dynamics of the arm has to be modified in such way that all the vibration modes have to be multiple of a basic frequency. This can be easily achieved by attaching some small masses at some points of the link. After repetitive control may be applied. The resulting controller is very simple, it is easy to tune, and only needs feedback of two signals: motor angle and torque measured by a strain gauge placed on the base of the arm. Simulations carried on a standard flexible arm show the effectiveness of our method.",

This paper addresses the modeling, dynamics and control of the TRIKKE and the development of a robotic platform called the ROBOTRIKKE that is derived from similar principles. The TRIKKE can be modeled as a modified roller-racer with an unstable steering arrangement. The model of the TRIKKE reduces to the roller-racer [8] in the absence of this steering arrangement. We prove that under certain conditions on the geometric parameters of the system, the TRIKKE and roller-racer systems cannot be stopped after motion starting from rest using the steering control as the sole input. As a consequence, the ideal model is severely limited from the point of view of controllability. We demonstrate the validity of our model through comparison with experimental measurements on a small-scale robotic prototype of the TRIKKE. We present closed-loop control results for tracking (on average) a straight line trajectory using visual feedback from an overhead camera.",

        "abstract": "A mobile version of the NASA/DARPA Robonaut humanoid recently completed initial autonomy trials working directly with humans in cluttered environments. This compact robot combines the upper body of the Robonaut system with a Segway \u2122 Robotic Mobility Platform yielding a dexterous, maneuverable humanoid ideal for interacting with human co-workers in a range of environments. This system uses stereovision to locate human teammates and tools and a navigation system that uses laser range and vision data to follow humans while avoiding obstacles. Tactile sensors provide information to grasping algorithms for efficient tool exchanges. The autonomous architecture utilizes these pre-programmed skills to form complex behaviors. The initial behavior demonstrates a robust capability to assist a human by acquiring a tool from a remotely located individual and then following the human in a cluttered environment with the tool for future use.",

Their features include low power consumption, continuous computation, light-weight, and robustness to different light and contrast conditions. Their outputs are not compatible with controllers that require precise measurements from their sensors. We describe a preliminary investigation into neural architectures that can translate information from these type of sensors into an output suitable for controlling the motor outputs of a robot. In this work, we use a neural network to produce an output that is similar to the range measurements of infrared range sensors, and we use this output to guide the behavior of the robot in a collision-avoidance task.",

We introduce Variable-Resolution Percept Discretization (VRPD) as an extension to Utile Suffix Memory (USM), an algorithm designed to solve discrete POMDPs. This extension allows USM to function effectively in noisy, continuous worlds. We describe the extension in detail, then we demonstrate experimentally the improvements that it makes to USM in the context of continuous POMDPs.",

The physical brain models were proposed based on the results of physical property tests. Finite element analyses of virtual tension tests were carried out under the same conditions as the actual tension tests, and the results of the analysis coincided with those of the test. The finite element analyses of robotic brain surgery were carried out using a two-dimensional structure, which consisted of the proposed physical models. Assuming two types of robot models are used (the brain spatula and capsule type robot respectively), stress distribution in the brain, caused by each robot model, was simulated in the analyses. The preoperative planning was considered based on the analysis results, and the safe velocity of the robot\u2019s movement was estimated from the same. The results of this research showed that organ modeling was necessary for preoperative planning in order to implement safe surgery.",

Navigation is achieved by understanding the underlying world behind the image and using these results as a guideline to control the robot. As retrieving semantic information from vision is computationally demanding, short-term tasks are planned and executed while new vision information is processed. Thanks to learning techniques, the methods are adapted to different environment conditions. Fusion and filtering techniques provide reliability and stability to the system. The procedures have been fully integrated and tested with a real robot in an experimental environment. Results are discussed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "High-precision autofarming is rapidly becoming a reality with the requirements of agricultural applications. Lots of research works have been focused on the automatic guidance control of farm vehicles, satisfactory results have been reported under the assumption that vehicles move without sliding. But unfortunately the pure rolling constraints are not always satisfied especially in agriculture applications where the working conditions are rough and not expectable. In this paper the problem of path following control of autonomous farm vehicles in presence of sliding is addressed. To take sliding effects into account, a vehicle-oriented kinematic model is constructed in which sliding effects are introduced as additive unknown parameters of the ideal kinematic model. Based on backstepping method a stepwise procedure is proposed to design an adaptive controller in which time-invariant sliding effects are learned and compensated by parameter adaptations. It is theoretically proven that for the farm vehicles subject to sliding, the lateral deviation can be stabilized near zero and the orientation errors converge into a neighborhood near the origin. To be more robust to disturbances including external noises and unmodeled time-varying sliding components, the adaptive controller is refined by integrating Variable Structure Controllers (VSC) or projection mappings. Simulation results show that the proposed robust adaptive controllers can reject sliding effects and guarantee high path-following accuracy.",

        "abstract": "A stereo pair of cameras attached to a robot will inevitably yield images with different contrast. Even if we assume that the camera hardware is identical, due to slightly different points of view, the amount of light entering the two cameras is also different, causing dynamically adjusted internal parameters such as aperture, exposure and gain to be different. Due to the difficulty of obtaining and maintaining precise intensity or color calibration between the two cameras, contrast invariance becomes an extremely desirable property of stereo correspondence algorithms. The problem of achieving point correspondence between a stereo pair of images is often addressed by using the intensity or color differences as a local matching metric, which is sensitive to contrast changes. We present an algorithm for contrast invariant stereo matching which relies on multiple spatial frequency channels for local matching. A fast global framework uses the local matching to compute the correspondences and find the occlusions. We demonstrate that the use of multiple frequency channels allows the algorithm to yield good results even in the presence of significant amounts of noise.",

This paper proposes a multi-lateral control architecture for teleoperation in cooperative environments. The proposed framework allows for transmission of position and force information between all master and slave robots rather than merely between corresponding units. A \u03bc-synthesis-based control design is introduced for the proposed architecture. This approach guarantees robust stability of cooperative teleoperation in the presence of dynamic interaction between slave robots as well as unknown passive operators and environment dynamics. It also enhances task coordination by optimizing relevant cooperative performance objectives.

Secondly, a fast classifier verifies the hypothesis by detecting balls at regions of interest. The combination of both approaches makes the system highly robust and eliminates false detections. Furthermore, the system is quickly adaptable to balls in different scenarios: The complex classifier is universally applicable to balls in every context and the attention system improves the performance by learning scenario-specific features quickly from only a few training examples.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery in combination with ultrasound (US) imaging imposes high demands on the sur geon\u2019s hand-eye-coordination capabilities. A possible solution to reduce these requirements is minimally invasive robotic surgery in which the instrument is guided by visual servoing towards the goal defined by the surgeon in the US image. This approach requires robust tracking of the instrument in the US image sequences which is known to be difficult due to poor image quality. This paper presents computer vision algorithms and results of visual servoing experiments. Adaptive thresholding according to Otsu\u2019s method allows to cope with large intensity variations of the instrument echo. Subsequently applied morphological operations suppress noise and echo artefacts. A fast labelling algorithm based on run length coding allows for realtime labelling of the regions. A heuristic exploiting region size and region velocity helps to overcome ambiguities. The overall computation time is less than 10 ms per frame on a standard PC. The tracking algorithm requires no information about texture and shape which are known to be very unreliable in US image sequences. Experimental results for different instrument materials (polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, nylon, and plexiglas) are given, illustrating the performance of the proposed approach: when chosing the appropriate material the reconstructed trajectories are smooth and only few outliers occur. As a consequence, the visual servoing loop showed to be robust and stable.",

A passive adaptation mechanism equipped between the front and rear body enables the ROBHAZ-DT3 to have good adaptability to uneven terrains including stairs. The passive adaptation mechanism reduces energy consumption when moving on uneven terrain as well as its simplicity in design and remote control, since no actuator is necessary for adaptation. Starting from this novel design, dynamic analysis and simulation were conducted to verify the mobility of the double-track mechanism and to obtain significant design parameters such as a suitable track size and an allowable attack angle. Based on this novel mobile platform, a rescue version of the ROBHAZ-DT3 with appropriate sensors and a semi-autonomous mapping and localization algorithm is developed to participate in the RoboCup2004 US-Open: Urban Search and Rescue Competition. From the various experiments in the realistic rescue arena, we can verify that the ROBHAZ-DT3 is reliable in travelling rugged terrain and the proposed mapping and localization algorithm are effective in the unstructured environment with uneven ground.",

Both of these representations generally scale with the size of the environment, not the complexity of the environment. Many thousand parameters may be required even when the structure of the environment can be represented using a few geometric primitives with many fewer parameters. We describe a novel SLAM model called IPSLAM. Our algorithm clusters sensor data into line segments using the Probabilistic PCA algorithm, which provides a data likelihood model that can be used within a SLAM algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of map and robot pose parameters. Unlike previous work in extracting line-based representations from point-based maps, IPSLAM builds non-point-based maps directly from the sensor data. We demonstrate our algorithm on mapping part of the MIT Stata Centre.",

We show that these are particular subsets of a more general view of the SLAM problem, in which variables representing all robot poses and features are kept. The general technique of variable reduction is a unifying view of these methods that is mathematically sound, and which enables us to explore other interesting and computationally compelling forms for solving SLAM problems.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Within the context of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), \u201cloop closing\u201d is the task of deciding whether or not a vehicle has, after an excursion of arbitrary length, returned to a previously visited area. Reliable loop closing is both essential and hard. It is without doubt one of the greatest impediments to long term, robust SLAM. This paper illustrates how visual features, used in conjunction with scanning laser data, can be used to a great advantage. We use the notion of visual saliency to focus the selection of suitable (affine invariant) image-feature descriptors for storage in a database. When queried with a recently taken image the database returns the capture time of matching images. This time information is used to discover loop closing events. Crucially this is achieved independently of estimated map and vehicle location. We integrate the above technique into a SLAM algorithm using delayed vehicle states and scan matching to form interpose geometric constraints. We present initial results using this system to close loops (around 100m) in an indoor environment.",

A big problem is that the suspended load swings easily. This leads to possibilities of collision of load with obstacle during the crane work. Emergency stop for collision avoidance is, however, also dangerous. Because residual sways after the stop is easy to be caused by the stop. Therefore, this paper presents an anti-sway control method when the emergency stop. The method is based on inverse dynamics of the crane system. Thus the inverse dynamics problem is also discussed. Using the inverse dynamics calculation and a real time obstacle detection system, a feed-forward based emergency stop control method is proposed. Experiments of emergency stop control using the method are shown.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work was to design a compact, accurate, safe, and ease-to-use surgical robot for total knee arthroplasty. The goal of the bone-mounted robot, named Praxiteles, is to precisely position a surgical bone-cutting guide in the appropriate planes surrounding the knee, so that the surgeon can perform the cuts manually using the guide. The robot architecture is comprised of 2 motorized degrees of freedom (DOF) whose axes of rotation are arranged in parallel, and are precisely aligned to the implant cutting planes with a 2 DOF serial adjustment mechanism. An initial prototype was first developed and tested on saw bones and cadavers, and construction of a new, refined version is now well underway. A backdrivable system, with high-stiffness, high-precision static positioning capabilities and safe low-force dynamic movement is achieved using a quick-release, spring-loaded mechanical braking system integrated in a gear transmission unit at the level of the motor outputs. This paper discusses the technical challenges encountered during the development, design, and construction of the system.",

Sampling generation is a difficult issue that entails the challenge of obtaining an incremental and uniform coverage of the configuration space. This objective is even harder when the planning of motions of 3D rigid bodies is tackled, since the corresponding configuration space is SE(3), which requires the careful handling of rotations. This paper proposes a deterministic sampling sequence that generates configurations of SE(3) for the planning of 3D rigid-body motions using sampling-based methods. The proposed sequence is able to generate samples in an incremental low-dispersion manner, giving a good uniform coverage and a lattice structure.",

        "abstract": "Robotic motion planning requires configuration space exploration. In high-dimensional configuration spaces, a complete exploration is computationally intractable. Practical motion planning algorithms for such high-dimensional spaces must expend computational resources in proportion to the local complexity of configuration space regions. We propose a novel motion planning approach that addresses this problem by building an incremental, approximate model of configuration space. The information contained in this model is used to direct computational resources to difficult regions, effectively addressing the narrow passage problem by adapting the sampling density to the complexity of that region. In addition, the expressiveness of the model permits predictive edge validations, which are performed based on the information contained in the model rather then by invoking a collision checker. Experimental results show that the exploitation of the information obtained through sampling and represented in a predictive model results in a significant decrease in the computational cost of motion planning.",

The great sophistication of the rover's Athena Science Payload required a wide variety of visualization modalities to make the large amounts of scientific data accessible and readily understood by the science planners under the tight time constraints of the tactical planning schedule. A number of techniques were also newly developed to support science operations, including on-the-fly mosaic stitching and rendering, image cube visualization, and data fusion. Many other well-established visualization techniques were applied to science operations also, such as anaglyph stereo, high performance 3D visualization, and optimized I/O and memory management techniques for the loading, processing, and visualization of very large data sets. We discuss each of these topics and demonstrate their application in the MER mission with examples.",

        "abstract": "In this paper it is demonstrated that pronking (or trotting or pacing) is the preferred mode of behavior of a fairly generic quadruped model. This gait often occurs even though no explicit control is used to force it, and thus the system is said to \"self-organize.\" Further, it is demonstrated that, despite the complicated coupled nonlinear dynamics, the system is still amenable to analysis if certain parameters are assumed small, namely the leg masses and the hip spring constants. Explicit conditions are presented for a symmetric pronk. In one condition, the leg length and the hip spring constant determine the pronking height, which has implications for quadruped robot design.",

We implement this estimation procedure on the hexapod robot RHex and evaluate its performance using a visual ground truth measurement system.

In this scheme, data from the vehicle\u2019s onboard vision and motion sensors are fused to identify the target 3D dynamic features in the world coordinate. Here several simple and basic linear dynamic models are combined to make the approximation of the target\u2019s unpredicted or complex motion properties. With these basic linear dynamic models a detailed description of the 3D target tracking system with the interacting multiple models (IMM) for Extended Kalman Filtering is presented. The target\u2019s final state estimates are obtained as a weighted combination of the outputs from each different model. Performance of the proposed interacting multiple dynamic model tracking algorithm is demonstrated through experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for a planar rigid body consisting of multiple convex bodies to explore an unknown planar workspace, i.e., an unknown configuration space diffeomorphic to SE(2). This method is based on a roadmap termed concave hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (concave-HGVG). Just as in our previous work, we decompose the free configuration space into contractible cells in which we define the concave generalized Voronoi graphs (concave-GVG), and then connect these graphs using an additional structure termed one-tangent edges. Since the robot consists of multiple convex bodies, the one-tangent edges are defined using the diameter function of the convex hull of the convex bodies as well as the individual convex bodies. These two structures together form the concave-HGVG, which is a one-dimensional roadmap of the multi-convex bodies in plane. Both components are defined in terms of workspace distance measurement, and thus the concave-HGVG can readily be constructed in a sensor-based way.",

The idea is to handle a collision at a generic point along the robot as a fault of its actuating system. A previously developed dynamic FDI (fault detection and isolation) technique is used, which does not require acceleration or force measurements. The actual robot link that has collided can also be identified. Once contact has been detected, it is possible to switch to a suitably defined hybrid force/motion controller that enables to keep the contact, while sliding on the obstacle, and to regulate the interaction force. Simulation results are shown for a two-link planar robot.",

The method assumes that the mode shapes are approximately known a priori. A Kalman filter exploits a mechanics-based dynamic model to extract the modal frequencies and damping as well as the modal coefficients and their time rate of change.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an original approach to coding the light patterns for robust depth imaging based on structured light. We have discovered that the degradation of precision and robustness, seen in most conventional approaches to structured light, comes mainly from the overlapping of multiple codes in the signal received at a camera pixel, where the overlapped codes are from the neighbouring and/or, even, distant pixels of the projecting mirror array. Considering the criticality of separating the overlapped codes to precision and robustness, we propose a novel signal separation code, referred to here as \u201cHierarchical Orthogonal Code (HOC),\u201d for depth imaging. HOC provides not only the separation of overlapped codes, but also a robust decision on pixel correspondence with error correction based on a contextual likelihood among the sets of separated codes from neighbouring camera pixels. The experimental results have shown that the proposed HOC significantly enhances the robustness and precision in depth imaging, compared to the best known conventional approaches. The proposed approach opens a greater feasibility of applying structured light based depth imaging to a 3D modelling of cluttered workspace for home service robots.",

This paper discusses the investigation of a method to self-locate using an onboard 3D range sensor, when a 3D map of the environment is available. We have examined the performance in terms of what is needed for data coverage and terrain types. Localization is accomplished through surface fitting. Surface fitting is an important component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for 3D terrains. Three environments were chosen for testing, including a hilly desert scene, an indoor corridor scene, and a forest scene. A simulated 3D range sensor was used to scan models corresponding to these three environments. Various parameters were modified to identify strong and weak points in the scheme.",

And we use the minimum number of joint for each swimming mode. We derive the dynamic equation for each system using Kane\u2019s method and these results are compared by the result of DADS.

Sampling based motion planners perform approximate exploration of the configuration space in order to render the problem tractable. Each sample of configuration space as an opportunity to gain information about that configuration space. A formal definition of information gain can be used to guide a motion planner to achieve maximal progress toward the discovery of a path. We call such a motion planner entropy-guided since entropy reduction is synonymous with information gain. In the following we describe a single-query entropy-guided motion planner which uses a formal definition of information gain to focus its efforts on the acquisition of a single path from start to goal locations. Experimental evidence indicates that this approach can outperform existing single-query techniques.",

These equations contain the coordinates of the joint axes explicitly and have a systematic structure that can be exploited in their solution. As an example we fit a seven degree-of-freedom CCS chain to a 12 position task trajectory.

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators (PEA) are the fundamental elements for high-precision high-speed positioning/tracking task in many nanotechnology applications. However, the intrinsic hysteresis observed in PEAs has impaired their potential, specially, the motion accuracy. In this paper, the complicated nonlinear dynamics of PEA including hysteresis, creep, drift and time-delay etc. are treated as a black-box system exhibited as rate-dependent hysteresis. The multi-valued hysteresis is analyzed as a single-valued function so that a neural network (NN) can be built to model the hysteresis and its inversion. A sliding mode controller (SMC) augmented with inverse hysteresis model is then developed to compensate the hysteretic behavior, modeling error and disturbance to improve the positioning/tracking stability and accuracy. The effectiveness of this algorithm experimentally verified through the actual tracking control of a PEA.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses a fully decentralized algorithm able to control the morphology of a two-dimensional modular robot called \u201cSlimebot\u201d, consisting of many identical modules, according to the environment encountered. One of the significant features of our approach is that we explicitly exploit \u201cemergent phenomena\u201d stemming from the interplay between control and mechanical systems in order to control the morphology in real time. To this end, we particularly focus on a \u201cfunctional material\u201d and a \u201cmutual entrainment\u201d, the former of which is used as a spontaneous connectivity control mechanism between the modules, and the latter of which plays as the core of the control mechanism for the generation of locomotion. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can induce \u201cprotoplasmic streaming\u201d, which allows us to successfully control the morphology of the modular robot in real time according to the situation without losing the coherence of the entire system.",

A path planning methodology for planar free\u2013 floating space manipulator systems is developed that allows simultaneous manipulator end-point and spacecraft attitude control using manipulator actuators only. The method is based on mapping the angular momentum to a space where it can be satisfied trivially. Smooth and continuous functions such as polynomials are employed driving the system to a desired configuration. It is shown that the method allows for smooth configuration changes in finite and prescribed time, without requiring small cyclical motions. Limitations are discussed and examples are presented.",

One of the main enabling components of this system is a Distal Dexterity Unit that implements a novel design using a flexible multi-backbone snake-like unit with actuation redundancy and push-pull actuation. The design of this snake-like unit is compared to other alternative designs that use a single flexible-backbone and wire-actuation. A unified kinematic and virtual work model is used to perform this comparison between a multi-backbone snake like unit with an equal-diameter snake-like unit using a single flexible backbone and wire actuation. The comparison is presented for several actuation redundancy resolutions that minimize the load on the flexible backbones. The results show that the multi-backbone design is superior to the alternative wire-actuated designs using a single flexible backbone. The advantages manifest in smaller required actuation forces on the backbones and, as a result, a reduced risk of buckling of the backbones and enhanced potential downsize scalability.",

The suggested solution is based on a novel concept this paper introduces called: nonlinear, anisotropic, dampening forces. In addition to eliminating the narrow corridor artifact, improving the quality of the trajectory, the suggested solution significantly increases the speed of the robot.

To support the mature of the FB-related design paradigm in this paper, we discuss the specification of FBs and FB applications in UML. The paper suggests three types of models which have the purposes of general specification, automated code generation and test case generation. The first and second models are specified in UML while the third one is to be formalised in certain formal language. We focus on the first two model specification in this paper which transform FB-related elements in UML expressions. This shows that the rich resources provided for UML can be applicable to FB paradigm. The characteristics and the potential use of the model are discussed.",

The paper presents an approach in which control is inherently stable as long as the time instant of sensing is known, independently of delays. In addition to sensor data the method uses the actual robot pose to compute a desired pose which is then controlled by the existing positional control loop. Updated sensor data affect the system as a refined target for positional control. So the positional control and the use of sensor data are decoupled. This is useful for the integration of a priori information on the task. The method is applicable especially for force control tasks as contour following and for visual servoing.",

These involve moving an exploring robot to locations in the world where the anticipated information gain is maximized. In this paper we demonstrate that, for map construction using bearings-only information and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), driving exploration so as to maximize expected information gain leads to ill-conditioned filter updates and a high probability of divergence between the inferred map and reality. In particular, we present analytical and numerical results demonstrating the effects of blindly applying an information-theoretic approach to bearings-only exploration. Subsequently, we present experimental results demonstrating that an exploration approach that favours the conditioning of the filter update will lead to more accurate maps.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a control method that overcomes the instability arising from both the low update rates of the virtual environment (VE) and the time delay in a communication line. The instability arising from the time delay in a communication line can be overcome using the wave variables since time delay on the wave variables is passive. The so-called multirate control scheme is applied to cope with the problems presented by the low update rates of VE. Since digital sample and hold (rate transitions) can be represented as a series of time delay, the passive nature of time delay on the wave variables is applied. By computing the norm of the scattering matrix, it was verified that rate transitions on the wave variables are passive, thereby deriving a stable haptic interface with the multirate wave transform. Various experiments have shown that a stable force display is achieved with the multirate wave transform.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to determine whether an assembly of planar parts will stay assembled as it is pushed over a support surface. For a given pushing motion, an assembly is classified into one of three categories: (P = possible) any force necessary to assure stability of the assembly can be generated by the pushing contacts; (I = impossible) stability of the assembly is impossible; and (U = undecided) pushing forces may or may not be able to stabilize the assembly. This classification is made based on the solution of linear constraint satisfaction problems. If the pushing contacts are frictionless, motions labeled P are guaranteed to preserve the assembly. The results are based on bounds on the possible support friction acting on individual parts in the face of indeterminacy in the distribution of support forces. Experimental results supporting the analysis are given.",

While throughput analysis and scheduling of single-cluster tools have been well-studied, the corresponding research on multi-cluster tools is still at the early stage. This paper analyzes steady-state throughput and scheduling of multi-cluster tools. A decomposition method is utilized to reduce a multi-cluster tool problem to multiple single-cluster tool problems. Existing research on the throughput and scheduling results is then applied to each single-cluster tool. For an M-cluster tool, an O(M) throughput calculation and robot scheduling algorithm is presented. A chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) polisher is used as an example of the multi-cluster cluster tools to illustrate the proposed decomposition method and algorithms.",

To determine optimal poses, a nonlinear program that minimizes the MSE while satisfying the sensor constraints of resolution, focus, field of view, visibility, workspace, and incidence angle constraints is presented. The probability that the measurement errors are within a specified tolerance for this setup is formulated. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model against real data.",

Soft fingers, which are made of macromolecular and have large elastic deformation, have gotten a lot of attention. Soft fingers have a peculiarity that high friction force, which stabilizes a grasping condition, is generated by expansion of contact area between tip of soft finger and grasping object. However, until now nobody focuses on the fact that deformation of soft finger enables multi-fingered hand to generate force to manipulate a object which has high aspect ratio and restricted by environment. Accordingly, we focus on a task to pick up a thin plate on a floor using deformation of soft finger. The effectiveness of grasping strategy is confirmed by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Active contours have been widely used as image segmentation methods. The use of level set theory has provided more flexibility and convenience for the implementation of active contours. However, traditional active contour models have some limitations on the segmentation of complicated images whose sub-regions consist of multiple components. The segmentation of multispectral images is even a more difficult problem. We propose an advanced active contour model using the statistics of image intensity based on a multivariate mixture density model. The proposed active contour model shows a robust segmentation capability on the images that traditional segmentation methods cannot properly partition. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real images are presented.",

Differently from standards PEGs where the environment and the location of evaders is unknown and a probabilistic map is built based on the pursuer\u2019s onboard sensors, here we consider a scenario where a sensor network, previously deployed in the region of concern, can detect the presence of moving vehicles and can relay this information to the pursuers. Here we propose a general framework for the design of a hierarchical control architecture that exploits the advantages of a sensor network by combining both centralized and decentralized real-time control algorithms. We also propose a coordination scheme for the pursuers to minimize the time-to-capture of all evaders. In particular, we focus on PEGs with sensor networks orbiting in space for artificial space debris detection and removal.",

Experiments have been carried out to characterize how the speed of locomotion depends on the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase lags of undulatory gaits, both in water and on ground. Using this characterization, we can identify the fastest gaits for a given medium. Results show that the fastest gaits are different from one medium to the other, with larger optimal regions in parameter space for the crawling gaits. Swimming gaits are faster than crawling gaits for the same frequencies. For both media, the fastest locomotion is obtained with total phase lags that are smaller than one. These results are compared with data from fishes and from amphibian snakes.",

        "abstract": "This paper first presents a novel control strategy for periodic motion control based on a Hamiltonian system. According to the strategy, hybrid symmetric orbits (ideal walking gaits) are explored using reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian system. Then, an invariance controller, a Symmetric Walking Controller, is derived systematically to distribute the symmetric orbits densely throughout the entire phase space. Finally, a new robust walking speed controller is formulated based on the passivity of the controlled system. Consequently, solutions starting from any point globally converge to a stable limit cycle having a desired energy level. The controller has strong passivity and robustness, thereby rendering it capable of using external disturbances as energy for walking propulsion. It requires no model parameters and can be implemented in a very small program size. Furthermore, it is applicable to any biped robot without major modification. In this report, the effectiveness of this controller is proved mathematically, validated numerically, and confirmed experimentally.",

The desired style is specified with a kinematic target trajectory that may or may not be physically realizable. A nearest-neighbor controller representation is used and its free parameters are optimized using a local parameter search technique. The optimization function is constructed by integrating a mass-distance metric over fixed time intervals, which serves to measure the deviation of a simulated motion from a desired target motion. We demonstrate simulated bipedal walks having user-specified styles, walks for bipeds of varying dimensions, walks over terrain of known slopes, and walks that are robust with respect to unobserved terrain variations and modeling errors.",

To assess the potential utility of this scheme, we developed synthetic jet actuator prototypes, and verified their function via both force measurement and flow visualization experiments. We used a genetic-algorithm based technique for optimizing the actuation profile of the thrusters. Also presented is an initial discussion of vehicle design. Our conclusion is that synthetic jet thrusters are a viable propulsion method for small underwater vehicles.",

To control all joint axes effectively, the distributed control architecture is used, which reduces computation burden on the main controller, and allows convenient system. A servo motor controller was used as the sub-controller, whereas a 3-axis force/torque sensor and an inertia sensor were used in the sensory system. The main controller attached on the back of KHR-2 communicates with the sub-controllers in real-time through CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol. Windows XP was used as the operation system, whereas RTX HAL extension commercial software was used to realize the real-time control capability in Windows environment. We define the walking pattern and describe several online controllers in each stage. Some of the experimental results of KHR-2 are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Target acquisition and continuous surveillance using fixed-wing UAVs is a difficult task due to the many degrees of freedom inherent in aircraft and gimbaled cameras. Mini-UAVs further complicate the problem by introducing severe restrictions on the size and weight of electro-optical sensor assemblies. We present a field-tested mini-UAV gimbal mechanism and flightpath generation algorithm as well as a human-UAV interaction scheme in which the operator manually flies the UAV to produce an estimate of the target position, then allows the aircraft to fly itself and control the gimbal while the operator re fines or moves the target position as required.",

Tasks to be allocated are dynamically perceived from the environment and can be tied by execution constraints. Conflicts among team mates arise when an uncontrolled number of robots execute the same task, resulting in waste of effort and spatial conflicts. The critical aspect of task allocation in Multi Robot Systems is related to conflicts generated by limited and noisy perception capabilities of real robots. This requires significant extensions to the task allocation techniques developed for software agents. The proposed approach is able to successfully allocate roles to robots avoiding conflicts among team mates and maintaining low communication overhead. We implemented our method on AIBO robots and performed quantitative analysis in a simulated environment.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is well-known that a human musculo-skeletal body is redundant in terms of both kinematics and dynamics. The former means that the degree of freedom in joint space is larger than that in task space, and the latter means that a joint is driven by a number of muscles. All human skillful movements can be performed by using both redundancies. However, these redundancies induce the underlying ill-posedness problem that each joint angle and muscle\u2019s output forces cannot be uniquely determined. These ill-posedness problems are known as \u201cBernstein\u2019s problem\u201d and are important to understand how human multi-joint movements are produced. In this study, we address the latter redundancy problem on how muscle\u2019s output forces can be determined from the viewpoint of robotics. In this paper, we consider a reaching movement by means of a two-link planar arm with six muscles and show that both damping and elastic properties coming from nonlinear dynamics of the muscles play a crucial role. By using a simple task space feedback control input together with an additional term to control the internal force to regulate damping and elasticity in joint space, we show some simulation results which exhibit human-like quasi-straight line movement.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to develop an intuitive interface to control rescue robots. We propose a new image stabilization system for easy operation of rescue robots. A promising method to search victims in rubble, is the use of teleoperated rescue robots. In the rescue activities with such robots, operators remotely control the robots through images captured by cameras mounted on the robots. Since the orientation of the robots change intensively while they move in rubble, image stabilization is necessary so that the operators can search victims without suffering from fatigue nor motion sickness. However, the orientation changes of the rescue robots are so intensive that conventional methods may not be capable of stabilizing the camera images. In this paper, we propose a new image stabilization system which can cancel the camera motion due to the intensive changes of the robot\u2019s orientation on an uneven terrain. After a preliminary experiment, a 3-DOF camera system was designed based on the newly proposed mechanism. To verify the performance of the camera system, we conducted three experiments. The result of the experiments confirmed that the proposed mechanism shows good performance in motion stabilization as well as good performance in tracking the commanded head motion. Finally, we verified that the camera system works properly even when it was mounted on a crawler running on an uneven terrain.",

In this paper, user\u2019s motion intention is combined with real-time environment information for applying appropriate assistance. If the current task is following a path, a virtual fixture is applied. If the task is aligning the end-effector with a target, an attractive force field is produced. Similarly, if the task is avoiding obstacles that block the path, a repulsive force field is generated. In order to successfully recognize user\u2019s motion intention, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based algorithm is developed to classify human actions, such as following a path, aligning target and avoiding obstacles.",

Our goal is to recreate to the greatest extent practical, both for the user and the people at the remote location, the sensory experience relevant for face-to-face interactions of the user actually being in the remote location. To enhance immersion for the user, our second-generation system can automatically preserve the head height of the user at the remote location. In order to eliminate loss of immersion due to teleoperation delays, in our third generation system we are eliminating one class of teleoperated mechanical motion by allowing rotations to take place at the user\u2019s location instead of at the remote location. A key component of this is a low-profile synchronous drive base. We also provide a novel natural interface for controlling translational motion at the remote location.",

Temporal logics naturally express traditional robot specifications such as reaching a goal or avoiding an obstacle, but also more sophisticated specifications such as sequencing, coverage, or temporal ordering of different tasks. In order to provide computational solutions to this problem, we first construct discrete abstractions of robot motion based on some environmental decomposition. We then generate discrete plans satisfying the temporal logic formula using powerful model checking tools, and finally translate the discrete plans to continuous trajectories using hybrid control. Critical to our approach is providing formal guarantees ensuring that if the discrete plan satisfies the temporal logic formula, then the continuous motion also satisfies the exact same formula.",

With high-speed visual feedback at a rate of 1kHz, high-speed catching of a falling ball are achieved. In this catching task, a target was dropped from about 1m in height, and the speed of the falling ball became more than about 4m/s just before it hit the ground. The hand could precisely catch it using two fingertips, and the percentage of the success was almost 100%. This successful catching depends on not only high-speed precise motion of the hand, but also softness of the target surface. In this paper, the dynamical analysis of the high-speed catching is proposed, and the softness of the target surface makes very important roles in this tasks.

        "abstract": "In this paper we present the design and theoretical analysis of a novel algorithm (LRV) that efficiently solves the problems of coverage, exploration and sensor network deployment at the same time. The basic premise behind the algorithm is that the robot carries network nodes as a payload, and in the process of moving around, emplaces the nodes into the environment based on certain local criteria. In turn, the nodes emit navigation directions for the robot as it goes by. Nodes recommend directions least recently visited by the robot, hence the name LRV. We formally establish the following two properties: 1. LRV is complete on graphs, and 2. LRV is optimal on trees. We present some experimental conjectures for LRV on regular square lattice graphs and compare its performance empirically to other graph exploration algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots are often required to navigate environments for which prior maps are incomplete or inaccurate. In such cases, initial paths generated for the robots may need to be amended as new information is received that is in conflict with the original maps. The most widely used algorithm for performing this path replanning is Focussed Dynamic A* (D*), which is a generalization of A* for dynamic environments. D* has been shown to be up to two orders of magnitude faster than planning from scratch. In this paper, we present a new replanning algorithm that generates equivalent paths to D* while requiring about half its computation time. Like D*, our algorithm incrementally repairs previous paths and focusses these repairs towards the current robot position. However, it performs these repairs in a novel way that leads to improved efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Robotic wrists are commonly used in manipulators for applications that require a large dexterous workspace. Although bevel-gear wrists are widely used in industrial manipulators due to their simple kinematics and low manufacturing cost, their gear trains function under rolling and sliding, the latter bringing about noise and vibration. Sliding is inherent to the straight teeth of the bevel gears of these trains. To alleviate these drawbacks, a wrist with cam-roller pairs under pure rolling is proposed here. This paper reports the design of an innovative robotic pitch-roll wrist using multi-lobe cams. The wrist has two degrees of freedom and consists of two roller-carriers (RCs) driving a multi-lobe cam to produce roll and pitch motions. The pure rolling between cam and rollers helps reduce the friction. Moreover, the cam transmission works with low backlash and high stiffness. In view of the kinematic performance, the wrist exhibits favorable features, including a singularity-free unlimited workspace.",

Second, the robot must perform without the need for staff intervention, from system autonomy to energetics enabling full-day operation without battery replacement. Third, the user-end interaction software must be self-explanatory as well as instructional and engaging in order to effectively communicate the learning goals of the exhibit.

Although never a profound technical achievement to attach a PUMA robot to a network, the extended period of operation permits interesting observations of long-term usage trends, comparison of operation through several generations of user interface and a voluminous body of artwork to consider. This paper will present a discussion of long-term usage trends of the PumaPaint project over six years of operation at two locations. We will present a study of the most interesting artwork produced in the last two years and discuss trends from the perspective of the canvas. We will also present a case study of a recent phenomenon: the appearance of a dedicated and persistent vandal who returned to the site nightly for a period of several months. The second section of the paper will detail our current project: moving the PumaPaint concept to three dimensions. We are continuing the theme of artistic creation, this time allowing web users to model clay. We have partially completed construction on a pair of opposing anthropomorphic hands with force sensing capability and expect to have these operational by spring 2005. This paper will present the \u201cRoboSculpt\u201d concept; detail the design and proposed user interface and present the progress to date.",

        "abstract": "To realize natural human-robot interactions and investigate the developmental mechanism of human communication, an effective approach is to construct models by which a robot imitates cognitive functions of humans. Focusing on the knowledge that humans utilize motion information of others\u2019 action, this paper presents a learning model that enables a robot to acquire the ability to establish joint attention with a human by utilizing both static and motion information. As the motion information, the robot uses the optical flow detected when observing a human who is shifting his/her gaze from looking at the robot to looking at another object. As the static information, it extracts the edge image of the human face when he/she is gazing at the object. The static and motion information have complementary characteristics. The former gives the exact direction of gaze, even though it is difficult to interpret. On the other hand, the latter provides a rough but easily understandable relationship between the direction of gaze shift and motor output to follow the gaze. The learning model utilizing both static and motion information acquired from observing a human\u2019s gaze shift enables the robot to efficiently acquire joint attention ability and to naturally interact with the human. Experimental results show that the motion information accelerates the learning of joint attention while the static information improves the task performance. The results are discussed in terms of analogy with cognitive development in human infants.",

The definitions of the local and global strategy entropy are proposed respectively. The global strategy entropy is proved to be a quantitative problem-independent measurement for the learning progress, i.e. the convergence degree of the strategy. To improve the learning performance, a new learning algorithm with self-adaptive learning rate is proposed based on the local strategy entropy.

The algorithm is vision-and odometry-based, and enables low-cost navigation in cluttered and populated environments. No initial map is required, and it satisfactorily handles dynamic changes in the environment, for example, lighting changes, moving objects and/or people. Typically, vSLAM recovers quickly from dramatic disturbances, such as \u201ckidnapping\u201d.",

        "abstract": "Considering a stereoscopic visual system, this paper deals with the error involved by a 3D reconstruction process. If image pixels are seen as surfaces instead of points, interval analysis provides bounding boxes in which the reconstructed 3D point lies with certainty. This paper presents a method which refine this bounding box and gives a tighter approximation of the error. Using bisection, and a reprojection test in the image planes, the space in which the 3D reconstructed point may be located is given as an octree. This is achieved through the resolution of a set inversion problem using the SIVIA algorithm. For a lighter manipulation of the result, an englobing ellipsoid is deduced from this approximation. Finally the three models are tested on a recognition process for a humanoid robot.",

This method allows the tracking of image trajectories assuring the correct behaviour in the 3-D space and avoiding the limitations of the time-dependent systems used up to now for tracking trajectories. This aspect has allowed its application to manipulation tasks in which the trajectory can be obstructed during the tracking.",

The severe weight and energy constraints of indoor flying platforms led us to take inspiration from flying insects for the selection of sensors, signal processing, and behaviors. This paper presents the control strategies enabling obstacle avoidance and altitude control using only optic flow and gyroscopic information. For experimental convenience, the control strategies are first implemented and tested separately on a small wheeled robot featuring the same hardware as the targeted aircraft. The obstacle avoidance system is then transferred to a 30-gram aircraft, which demonstrates autonomous steering within a square textured arena.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally focused on applications where humans have been kept safely out of reach, the field of robotics is undergoing a major shift as recent developments have brought humans much closer to robots. While device hardware has progressed to fill this new field, the underlying controller and amplifier architecture has remained nearly the same as that developed for industrial robots decades ago. Herein we develop a new, integrated control architecture designed to address the unique requirements of human-interactive robotic devices. This new architecture takes advantage of recent technological advances to produce a single-loop, third order controller integrating both switching control and a fullstate observer. In this paper, we explore the performance on a simplified, first-order system, specifically focusing on the interaction between the controller and the DC motors found in many devices. Experimental testing demonstrates improvements compared to existing PWM and linear amplifiers, with the promise of future improvements for the field of human-interactive robotics.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Autonomous place detection has long been a major hurdle to topological map-building techniques. Theoretical work on topological mapping has assumed that places can be reliably detected by a robot, resulting in deterministic actions. Whether or not deterministic place detection is always achievable is controversial; however, even topological mapping algorithms that assume non-determinism benefit from highly reliable place detection. Unfortunately, topological map-building implementations often have hand-coded place detection algorithms that are brittle and domain dependent. This paper presents an algorithm for reliable autonomous place detection that is sensor and domain independent. A preliminary implementation of this algorithm for an indoor robot has demonstrated reliable place detection in real-world environments, with no a priori environmental knowledge. The implementation uses a local, scrolling 2D occupancy grid and a real-time calculated Voronoi graph to find the skeleton of the free space in the local surround. In order to utilize the place detection algorithm in non-corridor environments, we also introduce the extended Voronoi graph (EVG), which seamlessly transitions from a skeleton of a midline in corridors to a skeleton that follows walls in rooms larger than the local scrolling map.",

The goal is to compare the newly acquired skill or task with already existing task knowledge and decide whether to add a new task representation or to expand the existing representation with an alternative. Furthermore, a constraint for the representation is that at execution time the built knowledge base can be integrated and used in a symbolic planner.",

In particular, we consider the relevant case of putting bounds on the maximum end-effector tracking error (accuracy constraints) with respect to a nominal path while enforcing also constraints on the maximum contact force exchanged between the end-effector itself and the environment. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, a master/slave teleoperation simulation is considered.

Algebraic graph theoretic properties associated with the interconnection graph are shown to affect the shape of the navigation function. The approach is centralized but the potential function is constructed in a way that facilitates complete decentralization.

        "abstract": "Nanoscale linear servomotors with integrated position sensing are investigated from experimental, theoretical, and design perspectives. Prismatic motion is realized using the interlayer motion of telescoping multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Position sensing can be achieved by monitoring field emission or by measuring resistance change between a MWNT and a gold substrate during sliding movement. Experimental results demonstrate resolution in the nanometer range. Actuation experiments demonstrate the feasibility of a linear nano servomotor with integrated position sensing based on field emission. A local \u201ckink\u201d-like fluctuation of emission current is observed, which is caused by the change of the protruding length of the nanotube core, thus demonstrating the potential of using emission as a \u201clinear encoder\u201d. Complete extension of the inner core is observed and the electrostatic force is calibrated to be tens of nano-Newtons for individual nanotubes\u2014 13.3 to 23.3 nN for voltages from 20 to 30V. These results demonstrate the possibility of fabricating linear servomotors at the nanometer scale with integrated position sensing.",

As such, we present a systemic approach to autonomous topological exploration of a mine environment to facilitate the process of mapping. This approach focuses upon the interaction of three high-level processes: topological planning, intersection identification and local navigation. Topological planning tasks the robot to investigate stretches of mine corridor for the purpose of collecting data. Intersection identification converts sensory input into topological components used to construct an online topological map and provide the robot with a global sense of position. Local navigation transforms topological exploration objectives into robot actuation enabling traversal of mine corridors. These processes are described in detail with results presented from experiments conducted at a research coal mine near Pittsburgh, PA.",

Firstly, an Extended Kalman Filter combines the DGPS and odometer measurements to produce an approximation of the vehicle\u2019s pose, which is then used to select the most likely segment from a road network database. The selection strategy merges several criteria based on distance, direction and velocity measurements using Belief Theory. In this work, a particular attention is given to the elaboration of a Localization Uncertainty Gauge which takes into account imprecision of data sources (the sensors and the map) and uncertainty of the techniques used in the fusion process. This Gauge indicates the level of confidence assigned to the selected road by the system. Real experimental results illustrate this approach.",

        "abstract": "Delays in the visual feedback can seriously impact operator performance in telerobotics. In predictive display synthesized visual feedback is rendered immediately in response to operator motions. In this paper we present a system using a geometric and appearance model that is captured using structure-from-motion by an uncalibrated camera. The geometric model is integrated into a registration based tracking algorithm that allows stable tracking of full 3D pose of the robot. Experimentally we show that predictive scene views can be rendered with both high visual fidelity and metric accuracy.",

Naturally, the yaw-dynamic can be stabilized without difficulties and independently of other motions. The remaining dynamics are linearly approximated around a small roll and pitch angles. It will be shown that the system presents a flat output that is likely to be useful in the motion generation problem. The tracking feedback controller is based on receding horizon point to point steering. The resulting controller involves the lift (collective) time derivative for what flatness and feedback linearization are used.

In many of these procedures, the needle can be considered rigid and the tissue deforms and displaces substantially as the needle is advanced to its target. An energy based, fracture mechanics approach is presented to show that the velocity dependence of tissue properties can reduce tissue motion with increased needle velocities. In-vitro test results on porcine heart samples show that the force required to initiate cutting reduces with increasing needle velocity up to a critical speed, above which, the rate independent cutting force of the underlying tissue becomes the limiting factor. In-vivo tests show increased needle speed results in reduced force and displacement for needle insertion into the heart. Results indicate that automated insertion could substantially improve performance in some applications.",

A reference feasible trajectory for the position and orientation of the AUV is planned so that it is consistent with vehicle dynamics. Using these reference values the dynamics of the vehicle is transformed to the error one. Partial state-feedback linearization, backstepping and non-linear damping techniques are utilized to stabilize the above system and force the tracking error to a neighborhood about zero that can be made arbitrarily small. Simulation results that validate the proposed tracking methodology are presented and discussed.",

For a trajectory tracking control of snake robots, it is one of the important problem to avoid the singular configuration like a straight line. Using input-ouput linearization for the head position of snake robots based on dynamic model, we can control the head position by PD feedback, but the robot will converge to the singular configuration. In order to solve this problem, we propose a control law that controls shape controllable points for avoiding the singular configuration. Using the proposed control law, the robot can accomplish trajectory tracking of the head position without converging to the singular configuration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control law.",

        "abstract": "Transference of controllers evolved in simulation to real vehicles is an important issue in evolutionary robotics (ER). We have previously evolved autonomous navigation controllers for fixed wing UAV applications using multi-objective genetic programming (GP). Controllers were evolved to locate a radar source, navigate the UAV to the source efficiently using on-board sensor measurements, and circle around the emitter. We successfully tested an evolved UAV controller on a wheeled mobile robot. A passive sonar system on the robot was used in place of the radar sensor, and a speaker emitting a tone was used as the target in place of a radar. Using the evolved navigation controller, the mobile robot moved to the speaker and circled around it. The results from this experiment demonstrate that our evolved controllers are capable of transference to real vehicles. Future research will include testing the best evolved controllers by using them to fly real UAVs.",

The proposed control signal is composed of gravity compensation for fingers, damping shaping, exertion of forces to the object from opposite directions, generation of moments for rotational moment balancing, and regressors for estimating unknown steady-state terms, all of which neither need the knowledge of object parameters nor use any object sensing data. In other words, stable grasping can be realized by using only finger joint sensing in a blind manner without using force sensors and tactile sensing. Stability of pinching motion with convergence to the state of force/torque balance is shown through computer simulations and is also proved theoretically.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to utilize UPnP as a middleware for robots. It describes the advantages of UPnP by comparing UPnP with TAO CORBA that was used in a few robot development projects. In order to consider real situation, we select a sample robot architecture, and examine the possibility of UPnP as a robot middleware with the robot architecture. This paper shows how UPnP architecture can be applied to building a robot in the view of software architecture, message mapping, realtime, network selection, performance, memory footprint, and deployment issues.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a prototype of a robotic system for accurate and consistent insertion of a percutaneous biopsy needle into the prostate. The robot manipulates a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe to collect a series of 2 dimensional (2D) images of the prostate, which are later used to create a 3D computer model of the organ. The urologist defines the needle\u2019s entry point at the perineal wall and the biopsy points within the 3D model following a biopsy protocol or otherwise. The robotic system then calculates the required trajectory of the needle. The path of the needle going into the prostate can also be simulated with the 3D model before the actual insertion. Being satisfied with the predicted outcome, the urologist configures the robot accordingly and manually pushes the mechanically guided needle into the patient to take the biopsy. Cadaveric and human trials have validated the robot\u2019s needle placement error to be less than 2.5mm. Our future work includes the integration of a cancer predictive modality into the system to increase the cancer detection rate. The robotic system could also be modified to accurately place foreign bodies into the prostate, which could improve therapeutic procedures such as Brachytherapy.",

At the end of the algorithm, we get 3D localization subpaving which is supposed to contain in a guaranteed way the robot\u2019s position. Concerning the uncertainty, it is managed throw a propagation architecture based on the used of the Transferable Belief Model of Smets.",

The unified formalism applies to the whole range from industrial manipulators over cooperating robots to humanoid robots, and from pure position control tasks over industrial processes to interaction between a humanoid robot and its environment.",

The technique consists in computing the vehicle prior using an Unscented Transformation. The UT allows a better nonlinear mean and variance estimation than the EKF. There is no need however in using the UT for the entire vehicle-map state, given the linearity in the map part of the model. By applying the UT only to the vehicle states we get more accurate covariance estimates. The a posteriori estimation is made using a fully observable EKF step, thus preserving the same computational complexity as the EKF with sequential innovation. Experiments over a standard SLAM data set show the behavior of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous mobile agents require object recognition for high level interpretation and localization in complex scenes. In urban environments, recognition of buildings might play a dominant role in robotic systems that need object based navigation, that take advantage of visual feedback and multimodal information for self-localization, or that enable association to related information from the identified semantics. We present a new method \u2013 the informative local features approach \u2013 based on an information theoretic saliency measure that is rapidly derived from a local Parzen window density estimation in feature subspace. From the learning of a decision tree based mapping to informative features, it enables attentive access to discriminative information and thereby significantly speeds up the recognition process. This approach is highly robust with respect to severe degrees of partial occlusion, noise, and tolerant to some changes in scale and illumination. We present performance evaluation on our publicly available reference object database (TSG-20) that demonstrates the efficiency of this approach, case wise even outperforming the SIFT feature approach [1]. Building recognition will be advantageous in various application domains, such as, mobile mapping, unmanned vehicle navigation, and systems for car driver assistance.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the acquisition of three-dimensional maps has become more and more popular. This is motivated by the fact that robots act in the three-dimensional world and several tasks such as path planning or localizing objects can be carried out more reliable using three-dimensional representations. In this paper we consider the problem of extracting planes from three-dimensional range data. In contrast to previous approaches our algorithm uses a hierarchical variant of the popular Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [1] to simultaneously learn the main directions of the planar structures. These main directions are then used to correct the position and orientation of planes. In practical experiments carried out with real data and in simulations we demonstrate that our algorithm can accurately extract planes and their orientation from range data.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The fully flexible navigation of autonomous vehicles in industrial environments is still unsolved. It is hard to conciliate strict precision requirements with quick adaptivity to new settings without undergoing costly rearrangements. We are pursuing a research project trying to combine the precision of laser-based local positioning with the flexibility of vision-based robot motion estimation. An enhanced circle approach to dynamic triangulation combining laser and odometric signals has been used to improve positioning accuracy. As regards to vision, a novel technique relating the deformation of contours in an image sequence to the 3D motion underwent by the camera has been developed. Interestingly, contours are fitted to objects already present in the environment, without requiring any presetting. In this paper, we describe a practical experience conducted in the warehouse of a beer production factory in Barcelona. A database containing the laser readings, image sequences and robot odometry along several trajectories was compiled, and subsequently processed off-line in order to assess the accuracies of both techniques under a variety of circumstances. In all, vision-based estimation turned out to be about one order of magnitude less precise than laser-based positioning, which qualifies the vision-based technique as a promising alternative to accomplish robot transfers across long distances, such as those needed in a warehouse, while backing up on laser-based positioning when accurate docking for loading and unloading operations is needed.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of whole-body trajectory generation in humanoid robot performing a manipulation task. The approach utilizes coordination of prioritized movements of the Center of Mass (CM), foot and hand. A Center of Mass trajectory is computed from the desired Zero Moment Point (ZMP) trajectory while stepping. The ability to maneuver horizontal CM is related to the ability to maintain balance. Generally, the vertical CM movement is left unspecified. In this paper, the horizontal CM manipulability is associated with the CM height through the shape of the CM manipulability ellipsoid. A posture with a larger horizontal CM manipulability ellipsoid is more stable in the sense that its CM can be easily maneuvered as required by the desired ZMP with less joint effort. Computer simulation was conducted to verify the performance and consistency of the proposed approach for generating balance stepping motion with a manipulation task.",

        "abstract": "In this research, we have developed a variable baseline stereo tracking vision system using a 1ms high-speed vision system and a high-speed linear slider. The vision system tracks a moving object, captures a stereo image pair and estimates its distance in only 1ms. It also calculates stereo matching and estimates its 3D shape every 2ms. The high speed linear slider moves stereo cameras horizontally and independently so the baseline length can be changed. We also propose a baseline control method which is adaptive to the distance to the object. When the object appears large in the image, the system reconstructs its 3D shape, and when the object appears small in the image, the system only estimates the 3D position of its center of gravity. The experimental results show that the proposed baseline control method improves the depth accuracy and the system can track and estimate the 3D shapes of fast moving objects.",

This paper presents a method to classify terrain based on vibrations induced in the rover structure by wheel-terrain interaction during driving. Vibrations are measured using an accelerometer on the rover structure. The classifier is trained using labeled vibration data during an off-line learning phase. Linear discriminant analysis is used for on-line identification of terrain classes such as sand, gravel, or clay. This approach is experimentally validated on a laboratory testbed.",

To enable this capability, a fully autonomous onboard system that identifies and avoids hazardous features such as steep slopes and large rocks is required. Such a system will also provide greater functionality in unstructured terrain to unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper describes an algorithm for landing hazard avoidance based on images from a single moving camera. The core of the algorithm is an efficient application of structure from motion to generate a dense elevation map of the landing area. Hazards are then detected in this map and a safe landing site is selected. The algorithm has been implemented on an autonomous helicopter testbed and demonstrated four times resulting in the first autonomous landing of an unmanned helicopter in unknown and hazardous terrain.",

It is a general representation for features that addresses symmetries and constraints in the feature coordinates. Furthermore, the representation allows for the features to be added to the map with partial initialization. This is an important property when using oriented vision features where angle information can be used before their full pose is known. The number of the dimensions for a feature can grow with time as more information is acquired. At the same time as the special properties of each type of feature are accounted for, the commonalities of all map features are also exploited to allow SLAM algorithms to be interchanged as well as choice of sensors and features. In other words the SLAM implementation need not be changed at all when changing sensors and features and vice versa. Experimental results both with vision and range data and combinations thereof are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for vision-based control of the end-effector of parallel mechanisms. It is based on the metrological redundancy paradigm, which simplifies their kinematic models by introducing additional proprioceptive sensors. By observing the mechanism legs, vision replaces advantageously these sensors by delivering, in a Cartesian frame, an exteroceptive measurement of the internal state of the mechanism. Formally, the latter is expressed by an original concept of vision-based kinematics for parallel mechanisms. Based on it, control is derived that visually servoes the direction of the legs, rather than the end-effector pose. The method is illustrated and validated on a Gough-Stewart platform simulation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a vision-based landmark extractor for goal-oriented navigation of a mobile robot is proposed. An indoor space scene analysis allows to detect natural structures relevant for navigation like doors or the floor in monocular images of the environment. The detection is based on a priori knowledge of the shape and functionality of searched structures. This algorithm works in real-time and is stable against variation of illumination. The approach is applicable for indoor environments which have clear line structures and large homogenous colour surfaces. The core of this method combines region based as well as edge based elements. The segmentation begins with an orientation selective Hough-Transform (OHT) including line segment detection and generates a reticule of convex polygons. Homogeneous colour similar polygons are segmented and merged by an region growing process. Finally a feature extraction and identification is performed to assign regions to known objects.",

Harris-Laplace interest points characterized by SIFT descriptors are used as natural landmarks. These descriptors are indexed into two databases: an inverted index and a location database. The inverted index is built based on a visual vocabulary learned from the feature descriptors. In the location database, each location is directly represented by a set of scale invariant descriptors. The localization process consists of two stages: coarse localization and fine localization. Coarse localization from the inverted index is fast but not accurate enough; whereas localization from the location database using voting algorithm is relatively slow but more accurate. The combination of coarse and fine stages makes fast and reliable localization possible. In addition, if necessary, the localization result can be verified by epipolar geometry between the representative view in database and the view to be localized. Experimental results show that our approach is efficient and reliable.",

        "abstract": "Classical visual servoing approaches tend to constrain all degrees of freedom (DOF) of the robot during the execution of a task. In this article a new approach is proposed. The key idea is to control the robot with a very under-constrained task when it is far from the desired position, and to incrementally constrain the global task by adding further tasks as the robot moves closer to the goal. As long as they are sufficient, the remaining DOF are used to avoid undesirable configurations, such as joint limits. Closer from the goal, when not enough DOF remain available for avoidance, an execution controller selects a task to be temporary removed from the applied tasks. The released DOF can then be used for the joint limits avoidance. A complete solution to implement this general idea is proposed. Experiments that prove the validity of the approach are also provided.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method to control casting manipulation by means of real-time visual feedback. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a robotic end-effector at large distances from the robot\u2019s base, by throwing the end-effector and controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light tether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can also be used to retrieve the end-effector and exert forces on the robot\u2019s environment. Previous work has shown that casting manipulation is able to catch objects at a large distance, proving it viable for applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In previous experiments, the position of the target object was known exactly. In this paper, we present a first attempt at closing a real-time control loop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. As accurate planning methods developed for off-line open-loop planning cannot be used in real-time, we develop a simplified model and control algorithm, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments.",

This paper proposes a wearable EMG-based human-computer interface (HCI) for electric-powered wheelchair users with motor disabilities by C4 or C5 level spinal cord injury. User expresses his intention as shoulder elevation gestures, which are recognized by comparing EMG signals acquired from the levator scapulae muscles with a preset threshold value. In this paper HCI command to control electric-powered wheelchair is made of combinations of left-, right-and both-shoulders elevation gestures. The proposed wearable HCI hardware consists of two active surface electrodes, a high-speed micro-controller, a Bluetooth module, and a battery. Experimental results using the wearable EMG based HCI and the electric-powered wheelchair developed show the proposed wearable EMG-based HCI is feasible for the users with severe motor disabilities.",

We first discuss a ubiquitous control platform based on ubiquitous functions to allow a robot the infinitive freedom of movement and knowledge acquirement. We then explain the fundamental ubiquitous functions management framework for a robot. In this framework, the applications are constructed from multiple Web services that work together to provide data and services for the application.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a wide-area recognition technique for mobile robots, which proves to be specifically effective with biped robots, using Hybrid Motion Stereo is presented. The proposed technique uses several cameras and divides the field of view into two groups, namely, areas visible in more than two cameras (MCVA : Multiple Camera Visible Area) and areas visible in only a single camera (SCVA : Single Camera Visible Area). Positional informations contained in MCVA can be computed constantly by stereo vision, while those contained in SCVA require movement of the camera to be computed by motion stereo. Estimation of the movement of cameras can be obtained by calculating the movement of immobile objects in MCVA. The measure of precision in computation by motion stereo depends on the magnitude of the movement of points in the image. Thus, high precision in SCVA can be obtained by lateral or longitudinal motions of the cameras. One such motion can be generated with biped robots for its lateral cyclic motion caused by the movement of the center of gravity for stability retainment. The authors have implemented these methods into the humanoid robot HRP-2 and evaluated the effectivity of the technique.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an algorithm to estimate wind direction by using a small and light Unmanned Air Vehicle(UAV) called KITEPLANE was proposed. KITEPLANE had a big main wing which is a kite-like delta shape and, therefore, it was easy to be disturbed by wind. However, this disadvantage implies that the KITEPLANE has an ability to sense wind and that it is expected to use the KITEPLANE as a sensor for wind estimation. In order to achieve this feature, dynamics of the KITEPLANE under wind disturbance were derived and a numerical estimation method was proposed. Devices equipped on board were also developed and the proposed method was implemented. Results of an experiment showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We show that a control architecture with integrated real-time features ensures better performance in terms of accuracy in navigation and reactivity to external events, compared with an architecture where no provision for real-time has been made. We argue that proper consideration to real-time operation should be given in order to ensure safe, dependable robot operation in human-inhabited environments. Along the paper, we describe features of YARA, a software framework improving dependability of mobile robot architectures by virtue of its support for real-time operation.",

        "abstract": "The paper investigates the global \u03c1-exponential stabilizability for nonholonomic Caplygin systems that are linear in certain state variables. A simple and easily verified controllability condition is proposed to guarantee the global \u03c1-exponential stabilizability. For an important subclass of Caplygin systems, the controllability condition is further reduced to some conditions relating to the degree and non-zero property of the lowest nonzero polynomials in the Taylor expansion of constraint function. A new feature in this paper is that all parameters can be explicitly determined from the constraint function. Moreover, a novel coordinate transformation between Caplygin systems can be used to enhance the proposed criterion so that it can be applied to various situations. Several interesting examples, including of the rolling wheel system and a set-point problem of hopping robot, are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed results.",
