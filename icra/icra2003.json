        "abstract": "This paper deals with the further development of the tube crawling robot \"MORITZ\", which was built at the Technical University of Munich. This robot can climb through pipes of different inclinations. It is improved in the recent research project, so that it also can manage tube junctions. After a brief introduction about problems concerning such a robot the used gait pattern is explained. Additionally some simulation results-showing the load at the robot during a motion through a tube crossing-are presented. Moreover the new developed joints in the central body as well as the sensors are described. The paper ends with a brief description of the crawler's control and its modifications for the new climbing maneuver in tube crossings.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "To fixture sheet metal parts for welding, we propose \"unilateral fixtures\" consisting of modular fixturing elements that lie almost completely on one side of the part. These are based on cylindrical jaws with conical grooves which provide the equivalent of 4 point contacts. We propose a two-phase procedure for designing unilateral fixtures. The first phase is a geometric algorithm that assumes the part is rigid and computes vg-grips (vertex-groove grips). The vg-grip algorithm uses a fast sufficient test for immobility to generate a list of vg-grips and find bounds on jaw cone angles for each. The second phase is a fast heuristic procedure that uses FEM to arrange secondary contacts to reduce part deformation. For a part described by n concave \"virtual vertices\", a list of vg-grips and minimum half cone angles for each vg-grip can be generated in O(n/sup 2/) time. We also propose a quality metric based on the sensitivity of the part's orientation to an infinitesimal relaxation of the jaws that can be evaluated in constant time for a given fixture. For an FEM model with m nodes, the second phase takes O(m/sup 3/r) time to arrange r secondary contacts for each vg-grip.",

        "abstract": "The use of atomic force microscope (AFM) as a nanomanipulator has been evolving for various kinds of nanomanipulation tasks. Due to the bow effect of the piezo scanner of the AFM, the AFM space is different from the Cartesian space. In this paper, different 3-D nanomanipulation tasks using AFM such as nanolithography, pushing and cutting are discussed. 3-D path planning are performed directly in the AFM space and the 3-D paths are generated based on the 3-D topography information of the surface represented in the AFM space. This approach can avoid the mappings between the AFM space and Cartesian space in planning. By following the generated motion paths, the tip can either follow the topography of the surface or move across the surface by avoiding collision with bumps. Nanomanipulation using this method can be considered as the \"true\" 3-D operations since the cantilever tip can be controlled to follow any desired 3-D trajectory within the range of AFM space. The experimental study shows the effectiveness of the planning and control scheme.",

        "abstract": "Neurophysiological studies show that humans possess the capability of generating appropriate motor behaviors to different uncertain environmental conditions by combining a forward action, produced by the internal forward dynamic model, and a feedback control, realising the transformation from sensory information to motor commands. To this regard, a control system based on the combination of a feedforward and a feedback control loop has been developed in order to provide a robot arm with human-like adaptation capabilities. The work analyses the role of biological coactivation in the mechanism of adjustable visco-elastic arm properties and proposes a function for the evaluation of the robot arm coactivation based on the measure of the position error and the interaction force. The coactivation function is used to update the proportional and derivative parameters of the feedback controller and, consequently, the arm visco-elasticity in unpredictable environmental conditions. Finally, experimental results on the evolution of the coactivation in the adaptation and de-adaptation phases are provided in the last section of the paper.",

It combines a biologically inspired motion planner and a nonlinear feedback controller in order to make a simple and practical motion controller in natural unknown environments. The motion planner part is designed in the frame of behavior-based scheme and adopts the biological concept \"homeostasis\". It plays the role of determining desired temporal target posture and modifying controller's gain parameters. The other nonlinear controller part drives the robot to the given target posture from the planner. As a result, the stable nonlinear feedback controller in ideal obstacle free space becomes practical one in natural environments constrained by obstacles. The proposed controller is simple mainly due to its behavior-based characteristics and stable due to the feedback controller considering robot's physical constraints. Simulated results and some experimental feature for autonomous navigation of the differential drive mobile robot, named \"MARI\", are shown for the present.",

        "abstract": "We have proposed a prototype model of walking micro robot using IPMC (Ionic Polymer Metal Composite) actuators. The stiffness of IPMC actuator is a key parameter to implement a walking robot. Therefore, the casting process is developed to increase the stiffness of the actuator by controlling thickness of ion-exchange polymer film. The process of fabricating a solid film front liquid state of ion-exchange polymer is difficult since any process parameter and handling material are not disclosed and has to be set by trial and error. The bending characteristics and generative tip force of IPMC actuator under variation of thickness and length of the actuator and voltage input are investigated. Also, mechanical model is derived to predict the generative tip force and displacement of IPMC actuator according to the variation of thickness. With cast film based IPMC actuators, a ciliary type 8-legged micro robot, which can be operated in aqueous surroundings like inside of human body, is constructed and tested. The robot shows good reliability and can reach up to 17 mm/min in speed.",

        "abstract": "Cellular manufacturing is an essential application of group technology (GT) in which families of parts are produced in manufacturing cells. This paper describes the development of a cell formation approach based on association rule mining and 0-1 integer programming. It is valuable to find the important associations among machines such that the occurrence of some machines in a machine cell will cause the occurrence of other machines in the same cell. A clustering model using the discovered association data is formulated to maximize the closeness measures among machines within each cell. From the results of three medium-sized problems, the proposed approach shows its ability to find quality solutions of cell formation problems.",

        "abstract": "For the transportation in semiconductor fabricating bay, route planning of multiple AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) is expected to minimize the total transportation time without collision and deadlock among AGVs. In this paper, we propose a distributed route planning method for multiple mobile robots using Lagrangian decomposition technique. The proposed method has a characteristic that each mobile robot individually creates a near optimal route through the repetitive data exchange among the AGVs and the local optimization of its route using Dijkstra's algorithm. The proposed method is successively applied to transportation route planning problem in semiconductor fabricating bay. The optimality of the solution generated by the proposed method is evaluated by using the duality gap derived by using Lagrangian relaxation method. A near optimal solution within 5% of duality gap for a large scale transportation system consisting of 143 nodes and 15 AGVs can be obtained only within five seconds of computation time. The proposed method is implemented on 3 AGVs system and the route plan is derived taking the size of AGV into account. It is experimentally shown that the proposed method can be found to be effective for various types of problems despite the fact that each route for AGV is created without considering the entire objective function.",

In particular, it supports no, complete, or partial node and edge validation and various evaluation schedules for path validation, and it enables path customization for variable, adaptive query requirements. While each of the above features is present in some PRM variant, the general framework proposed here is the only one to include them all. Our framework enables users to choose the best approximation level for their problem. Our experimental evidence shows this can result in significant performance gains.",

A general framework is developed to automatically generate trajectories of a free-form surface for these tasks. A given task is first transformed into one of the groups. Based on the CAD model of a free-form surface, constraints and tool model, a trajectory for a free-form surface is generated. Velocity optimization is discussed to optimize the material quantity. Simulations are performed to verify the developed framework. This framework can also be extended to other applications.",

Generalizing our previous work, this framework provides a template encompassing all possible retraction approaches. It also removes the requirement of exactly computing distance metrics thereby enabling application to more realistic high dimensional problems. In particular, our framework supports methods that retract a given configuration exactly or approximately onto the medial axis. As in our previous work, exact methods provide fast and accurate retraction in low (2 or 3) dimensional space. We also propose new approximate methods that can be applied to high dimensional problems, such as many DOF articulated robots. Theoretical and experimental results show improved performance on problems requiring traversal of narrow passages. We also study tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency for different levels of approximation, and how the level of approximation effects the quality of the resulting roadmap.",

We present a changing navigation function to allow the robots to incorporate new sensor data into their maps of the environment. We choose a Gaussian function to model attractors and a higher-order Gaussian-like function to model obstacles in order to avoid undesired local minima. Using arguments from hybrid systems theory, we show that this changing navigation function can be viewed as a mode-specific team Lyapunov function that stabilizes the system at all times. We. have verified our approach in simulations of a robot team mapping and foraging in an initially unknown environment. The team is able to map the environment, noting the location of all obstacles and attractive objects, then retrieve the attractors and return them to a goal position. Potential field navigation succeeds in this task while avoiding collisions between robots and obstacles as well as collisions among team members.",

The novel version is capable of performing path generation for highly dynamic environments. The neural network has discrete-time dynamics, is locally connected, and, hence, computationally efficient. No preliminary information about the world status is required for the planning process. Path generation is performed via the neural-activity landscape, which forms a dynamically-updating potential field over a distributed representation of the configuration space of a robot. The network dynamics guarantees local adaptations and includes a set of strict rules for determining the next step in the path for a robot. According to these rules, planned paths tend to be optimal in a L/sub 1/ metric. Simulation results in a series of experiments for various dynamical situations prove the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

This new adaptive law is designed without using projection or deadzone mechanism and can be applied to system with non-periodic or non-repeatable disturbance. Via a rigorous technical analysis, it is shown that all adjustable parameters as well as the internal signals remain bounded in the time-domain for each iteration and the tracking error can be driven to zero in the iteration-domain. Finally, the learning performance will be demonstrated by a simulation example.",

Most parallel mechanisms are designed for three- or six-axis machining applications. In the last case, the position and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the shape of the workspace is complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translation motions and to add one or two legs to add one or two-dofs for rotation motions. The kinematics and singular configurations are studied for each mechanism.",

Furthermore, the interaction between humans and robots is one of the essential factors for the Neuro-Robotics. We believed that the Mental Dynamics caused by the stimuli from the internal and external environment is important in expressing emotion. Therefore, we newly developed a human-like head robot WE-4 (Waseda Eye No.4) in 2002. The \"Learning System\", the \"Mood Vector\" and the \"Second Order Equations of Emotion\" were introduced to the mental model of the robot. Moreover, an internal clock was introduced as an autonomic nerve system to express the activation component of the Mood Vector. And, we realized the expression of mental transition caused by the stimuli from the internal and external environment of the robot. In this paper, we describe the new mental model of a human-like head robot WE-4.",

The approach computes, similar to that done in electrostatics, repulsive force and torque between charged objects. A collision-free path can be obtained by locally adjusting the robot configuration to search for minimum potential configurations using these force and torque. The proposed approach is efficient since these potential gradients are analytically tractable. In order to speedup the computation, a sequential planning strategy is adopted. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works well, in terms of collision avoidance and computation efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a visual servoing strategy for dealing with the problem of keeping the observed points in the camera field of view is proposed. The approach consists of a switching control law based on camera displacement estimation and regulated from the position of the points in the image. In absence of uncertainties on the intrinsic parameters and optical axis direction, global stability is achieved and all points are kept in the field of view. Moreover, the trajectory length is minimized in the rotational space and, for some cases, also minimized in the translational one. Robustness against uncertainties is also guaranteed.",

        "abstract": "Precise tracking control of a mobile manipulator is a challenging problem in which tracking errors of the vehicle and the manipulator merge and jointly affect the endpoint trajectory performance. A synchronization approach to minimize the mutual errors between the vehicle and the manipulator is reported in this paper. The basic idea is to utilize the cross-coupling concept to cooperate motions of the vehicle and the manipulator so that the both tracking errors are compensated each other. An adaptive synchronized controller is proposed to guarantee asymptotic convergence to zero of the position tracking error and the synchronization error of the mobile manipulator. The controller is in a decentralized architecture for easy implementation, and is able to address model uncertainty problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

One system is based on a cart instrumented by laser range finders, pushed through a mine by people. Another is a remotely controlled mobile robot equipped with laser range finders. To build consistent maps of large mines with many cycles, we describe an algorithm for estimating global correspondences and aligning robot paths. This algorithm enables us to recover consistent maps several hundreds of meters in diameter, without odometric information. We report results obtained in two mines, a research mine in Bruceton, PA, and an abandoned coal mine in Burgettstown, PA.",

It will be possible for a humanoid robot to drive an industrial vehicle instead of a human operator. If a humanoid robot can be operated by a human operator from a remote site, it enables to use a general type of vehicle safely in a dangerous field. We introduced a backhoe as the target vehicle to show the possibility of driving a vehicle in a sitting posture. The robot sits down with balancing on a cockpit of the backhoe and manipulates control levers for driving. We developed a portable remote control device and remote control methods to operate the humanoid robot. For the evaluation, it is tested to sit down and manipulate the levers on the driving cockpit of the real backhoe. To compare it with a human's work, the efficiency is close to practical use.",

Such behaviours depend on how heavy and hard it is when held, how its surface feels when touched, how it deforms on contact, etc. Recently, there are thus growing needs for haptic exploration to estimate and extract such physical object properties as mass, friction, elasticity, relational constraints etc.. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm, we call haptic vision,which is a vision-based haptic exploration approach toward an automatic construction of reality-based virtual space simulator, by augmenting active vision with active touch. We apply this technique to mass, relational constraints estimation and elasticity, and use these results to construct virtual object manipulation simulator. Experimental results show that feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.",

In this paper we evolve a gallop gait in a simulated quadruped robot at speeds from 3.0 to 10.0 m/s. To do so, we must generate periodic trajectories for the body and legs. An evolutionary algorithm known as set-based stochastic optimization (SBSO) is used to find the body trajectory while alternative methods are used to find periodic leg trajectories. The focus of this paper will be to evaluate three different methods for generating periodic leg trajectories. The combined solutions for the body and legs yield biological characteristics that are emergent properties of the underlying high-speed dynamic running gait.",

Sensor fusion is one of the fundamental issues to develop such intelligent environments. The sensor fusion in previous works is performed in the task-level layer through individual representations of the sensors. Therefore, it does not provide new information by fusing sensors. This paper proposes another method that fuses sensory signals based on mutual information maximization in the signal-level layer. The fused signal provides us new information that cannot be obtained from individual sensors. As an example, this paper also shows experimental results in an audio-visual fusion task.",

Additionally, a time-varying feedback gain induces a terminal attractor in the visual error manifold to guarantee finite-time convergence of image-based tracking errors. Simulations results of a two degrees-of-freedom manipulator with uncalibrated CCD camera are presented to illustrate the dynamic closed-loop performance.",

We show that, for bounded misalignments, if an admittance satisfies the misalignment-reduction conditions at a finite number of contact configurations and a given coefficient of friction /spl mu//sub M/) then the admittance will also ensure that the conditions are satisfied at all intermediate configurations for all coefficients less than /spl mu//sub M/.",

        "abstract": "Producing sculptured surfaces of special parts always poses challenges to machining industry. In this paper, an effective tool path error restraining method utilizing adaptive rules for cutting control is proposed for freeform surface machining. Based on the proposed approach an experimental verification is accomplished in milling a sample part with curved surfaces. Specifically, the parametric spatial curves representing the part's sculptured surface are approximated by sequences of connected line segments. From the current reference point of the cutting tool, the method has the capability of predicting the next reference point of the tool for a given feed. If the predicted position is not within the required tolerance, the algorithm will automatically adjust the position of the cutter so as to satisfy the tolerance requirements using feedback control philosophy. It is proved that the developed adaptive cutting laws are robust in achieving the desired freeform surface cutting with pre-specified tolerance requirements. The given tolerance is measured as the angular deviations to which the generated tool path deviates from the desired profile. Feedrate variations have been implemented in the investigation in the range between 5 mm/second and 30 mm/second. The tool paths generated with and without the adaptive mechanisms are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tolerance feedback mechanism is very effective for producing parts having curved surfaces.",

In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid switched system approach, in which a high-level decision maker selects between two visual servo controllers. We have evaluated our approach with simulations and experiments using three individual visual servo systems and three candidate switching rules. The proposed method is very promising for visual servo tasks in which there is a significant distance between the initial and goal configuration, or the task is one that can cause an individual visual servo system to fail.",

The objective of this section is to develop a system that enables users to control the humanoid robots in their homes remotely via the Internet with a simple mobile terminal. To construct such a system, we focused on developing sensor-based autonomy sufficient to achieve task-level teleoperations. The system included view simulation based on CG technologies to help users perceive conditions at the robot's site and the client-server architecture necessary for remote task execution to reduce the load on the mobile terminal. Based on these technologies, we implemented a prototype system and conducted some experiments that illustrate that the system achieves the basic required functions for a building and home management service.",

        "abstract": "We explore the control of a nonholonomic robot subject to additional constraints on the state variables. In our problem, the user specifies the path of a subset of the state variables (the task freedoms X/sub P/), i.e. a curve X/sub P/(s) where s/spl isin/[0,1] is a parameterization that the user chooses. We control the trajectory of the task freedoms by specifying a bilateral time-scaling s(t) which assigns a point on the path for each time t. The time-scaling is termed bilateral because there is no restriction on s(t), the task freedoms are allowed to move backwards along the path. We design a controller that satisfies the user directive and controls the remaining state variables (the shape freedoms X/sub R/) to satisfy the constraints. Furthermore, we attempt to reduce the number of control switchings, as these result in relatively large errors in our system state. If a constraint is close to being violated (at a switchings point), we back up X/sub P/ along the path for a small time interval and move X/sub S/ to an open region. We show that there are a finite number of switching points for arbitrary task freedom paths. We implement our control scheme on the Mobipulator and discuss a generalization to arbitrary systems satisfying similar properties.",

        "abstract": "Bundled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) were successfully and repeatably manipulated by AC electrophoresis to form resistive elements between Au microelectrodes and were demonstrated to potentially serve as novel thermal and anemometrical sensor as well as simple electronic circuit elements. We have measured the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of these MWNT bundles and also integrated them into constant current configuration for dynamic characterization. The I-V measurements of the resulting devices revealed that their power consumption were in /spl mu/W range. Besides, the frequency response of the testing devices was generally over 100 kHz in constant current mode operation. Using the same technique, bundled MWNT was manipulated between three terminal microelectrodes to form simple potential dividing device. This device was capable of dividing the input potential into 2.7:1 ratio. Based on these experimental evidences, carbon nanotube is a promising material for fabricating ultra low power consumption devices for future sensing and electronic applications. Hence, we are currently developing fast and low cost MEMS fabrication processes to incorporate carbon nanotubes as sensing elements for various types of micro sensors.",

In the case with redundant cables, feedback control laws can be designed to make all tensions positive while attaining desired control performance.

Because both the human operator and machine are involved in the control loop and they are connected via the network instead of a direct link, the development of a telerobotic system poses challenges different from systems involving machines alone. And these challenges become more severe when the telerobotic system is used for compliance task, in which simultaneous control of both position and force are demanded and inevitable contact with the environment is encountered. In this paper, we discuss the challenges we may face in designing a telerobotic system. We then describe the networked VR-based telerobotic system developed in our laboratory and report the results by using the developed telerobotic system to execute several different kinds of compliance tasks.",

This paper presents a cooperative robot system consisting of a robot hand and a mobile robot carrying a stereo vision, which can be tele-operated by operators at different sites via the Internet. To overcome the instability and reliability problem caused by the random time delay of the Internet communication, we adopt an event as the reference for controller design of the system. A vision-based method is adopted to maintain interactions among the operations. Results obtained in teleoperation experiments among Hong Kong, the mainland China, and USA will be demonstrated to confirm the usefulness and effectiveness of the developed method and system.",

The environment captures many events collaboratively from multiple viewpoints using a combination of stationary sensors that track people's behaviors and interactions, and wearable sensors that observe the viewpoints and areas of interest of individual persons. Humanoid communication robots also play a role as assistants to help visitors pay attention to significant events. First of all, the basic framework of the environment is described. Next, our developing exhibition room is introduced as an example of an intelligent environment.",

        "abstract": "Automated guided vehicles (or AGVs) have become an important option in material handling. In many applications, such as container terminals, the service area is often arranged into rectangular blocks, which leads to a mesh-like path topology. Therefore, developing efficient algorithms for AGV routing on the mesh topology has become an important research topic. In this paper, we present a discrete time model, based on which a simple routing algorithm on the mesh topology is presented. The algorithm works by carefully choosing suitable parameters such that the vehicles using a same junction will arrive at different points in time, and hence no conflicts will occur during the routing; meanwhile, high routing performance can be achieved. Analyses of the task completion time and the requirements on timing control during the AGV routing are also presented.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade, model based tracking of objects and its necessity in visual servoing and manipulation has been advocated in a number of systems. Most of these systems demonstrate robust performance for cases where either the background or the object are relatively uniform in color. In terms of manipulation, our basic interest is handling of everyday objects in domestic environments such as a home or an office. In this paper, we consider a number of different parameters that effect the performance of a model-based tracking system. Parameters such as color channels, feature detection, validation gates, outliers rejection and feature selection are considered here and their affect to the overall system performance is discussed. Experimental evaluation shows how some of these parameters can successfully be evaluated (learned) on-line and consequently improve the performance of the system.",

Using Math Works' SIMULINK and OPAL-RT's RT-LAB executed on Windows NT and QNX target systems, control software and pattern generator are developed. A walking control capable of dealing with various dynamic walking is proposed and tested indoors and outdoors using the WL-15. Dynamic biped walking is realized with the maximum step length of 200 mm, the maximum walking speed of 0.8 s/step and the minimum speed of 1.92 s/step. Also, the WL-15 is confirmed to be able to turn 90 deg in two steps and carry a load of 18 kg.",

The motion data must be adapted for the marionette because its kinematic and dynamic properties differ from those of the human actor in degrees of freedom, limb length, workspace, mass distribution, sensors, and actuators. This adaptation is accomplished via an inverse kinematics algorithm that takes into account marker positions, joint motion ranges, string constraints, and potential energy. We also apply a feedforward controller to prevent extraneous swings of the hands. Experimental results show that our approach enables the marionette to perform motions that are qualitatively similar to the original human motion capture data.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the coordination of multiple robots with kinodynamic constraints along specified paths. The presented approach generates continuous velocity profiles that avoid collisions and minimize the completion time for the robots. The approach identifies collision segments along each robot's path and then optimizes the motions of the robots along their collision and collision-free segments. For each path segment for each robot, the minimum and maximum possible traversal times that satisfy the dynamics constraints are computed by solving the corresponding two-point boundary value problems. Then the collision avoidance constraints for pairs of robots can be combined to formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since this nonconvex MINLP model is difficult to solve, we describe two related mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations that provide schedules that are lower and upper bounds on the optimum; the upper bound schedule is a continuous velocity schedule. The approach is illustrated with robots modeled as double integrators subject to velocity and acceleration constraints. An implementation that coordinates 12 nonholonomic car-like robots is described.",

The objective is to design a single controller that stabilizes the system during both constrained and unconstrained motion, avoiding problems that arise when using switching controllers. A coherent system identification based robust control design methodology is presented. As a robust controller, we consider the quantitative feedback theory (QFT) based design. The proposed method is very suitable since linear model of constrained SFL manipulator is a gross simplification and includes significant uncertainties that can be handled well in the QFT frame work.",

To show the validity of our proposed KP method, comparative experiments are performed for the cases that:(1) only a delayed reward is used, (2) some of S-R pairs are preprogrammed, (3) immediate reward is possible, and (4) our KP method is applied.",

These forces and moments may cause undesirable translation and rotation of the base. The objective of this paper is to systematically analyze the fundamentals of reactionless robots. Based on this analysis, designs of two distinct classes of spatial robots are proposed. The designs are achieved through appropriate choices of geometric and inertial parameters. Due to the underlying conservation laws, the trajectory must satisfy additional constraints. We illustrate the reactionless feature of these robots through computer simulations. Currently, we are fabricating reactionless robots to illustrate the underlying concepts.",

A composite control algorithm is proposed for the flexible joint robots, which consists of two main parts. Fast control, u/sub f/, which guarantees that the fast dynamics remains asymptotically stable, and the corresponding integral manifold remains invariant. Slow control, u/sub s/, itself consists of a robust PID designed based on the rigid model, and a corrective term designed based on the reduced flexible model. The stability of the overall closed loop system is proved to be UUB stable, by Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control law is verified through simulations. It is shown that the proposed control law ensure the robust stability and performance, despite the modeling uncertainties.",

Since low inertia is vital to backdrivability and transparency of the haptic device, all actuators are placed on the base and thus some forces for haptic feedback are transmitted by tendon-driven mechanism. This device was intended to teleoperate a mobile manipulator, which requires planar 3 DOF motion for navigation of the vehicle and full 6 DOF motion for manipulation. Therefore, the proposed device is designed to have two modes of a planar task and a 3D task which are switchable without any change in hardware. This feature provides efficient actuation and reduces computational burden since only 3 actuators are involved in the case of a planar task. The paper deals with a detailed description of the proposed haptic master and Jacobian analysis. Some applications are given to verify the validity of this device.",

The kinematics for the leg mechanism is derived and a kinematic index to measure force transmission ratio are introduced. It is demonstrated through simulation that incorporation of redundant actuator into the leg mechanism enhances the power of the mechanism approximately 4 times of the minimum actuation. The leg mechanism is developed and has been integrated into the biomimetic system for the purpose of payload enhancement.",

The result is an interactive moving machine which can operate in human environments and interacts by seeing humans, talking to and looking at them, showing icons and asking them to answer its questions. The complete design of mechanics, electronics and software is presented in the first part.

        "abstract": "Mobile robots frequently replace humans in handling and transporting wafer carriers in semiconductor production lines. A mobile robot is constructed in this paper. The developed mobile robot is primarily composed of a mobile base, a robot manipulator, and a vision system. Since the guidance control system of the mobile base inevitably causes positioning errors of the mobile base, this study employs the eye-in-hand vision system to provide visual information for controlling the manipulator of the mobile robot to grasp accurately stationary material during pick-and-place operations between a predefined station and the mobile robot. This work further proposes a position-based look-and-move task encoding control strategy for eye-in-hand vision architecture, that maintains all target features in the camera's field of view throughout the visual guiding. Moreover, the manipulator can quickly approach the material and precisely position the end-effector in the desired pose. Numerous techniques are required for implementing such a task, including image enhancement, edge detection, corner and centroid detection, camera model calibration method, robotic hand/eye calibration method, using a camera with controlled zoom and focus, and task encoding scheme. Finally, the theoretical results for the proposed control strategy are experimentally verified on the constructed mobile robot. Specific experimental demonstrations include grasping the target object with different locations on the station and grasping the target object tilted by different angles to the station.",

We first analyze the geometrical relation of the soft fingertip when it is deformed. Secondly, the force distribution of the soft fingertip is investigated by using a compressional strain mechanism. And then, we propose a nonlinear model of the soft fingertip which enables us to obtain the total contact force at the contact surface of each finger in manipulating tasks. Finally, the proposed force function is verified by experiment, where a tactile sensor is used to measure the contact force distribution in the contact surface and its total force. The developed soft fingertip and its force function can be usefully applied to soft-fingered manipulations.",

Software engineering technique was used to analyze the manual operation of polishing procedure to obtain the task specifications for the automatic system. Four main modules were designed in the system: geometric data processing, polishing process planning, polishing path planning, and the user interface modules. The geometric data of molds can be input via three methods. The mold geometry and the polishing path can be drawn in 3D for verification. The AMPS can also generate process task list according to the mold polishing requirements. The task list includes all the procedures and optimal polishing parameters. The polishing tasks were then executed by a force controllable robot. The experiment shows that the resultant of surface roughness is closed to the prediction in the process planning.",

First the fabrication process of a piezoelectric bending actuator comprising a standard unimorph and a rigid extension is described together with the advantages of adding such an extension. Then the convenience of obtaining an embedded piezoelectric sensor by a simple and inexpensive variation of the fabrication process is pointed out. A model for the sensor embedded into a unimorph actuator with rigid extension is derived together with its flat response band limits. Calibration steps are also outlined which allow, despite residual parasitic actuator-sensor coupling, the use of the actuator with the embedded sensor for measuring position and inertial forces when external mechanical structures are driven. An experiment is carried out which validates the model for the actuator/sensor device under desired operating conditions. Preliminary application of the fabricated device to the MFI is also presented where the mechanical power fed into the wing is estimated.",

Application of robotics and virtual reality technology makes possible for new training methods and exercises on upper limb rehabilitation and for quantitative evaluations to enhance the qualitative effect of training. However, rehabilitation systems applying training within a three-dimensional to upper limbs have not been in practical use.

Because humanoid robots have a human-like figure and can walk in a biped way and can take an action like a human being, we consider applying the humanoid robot platform in HRP to service fields of caring people such as the elderly, patients, etc. Taking the technical limitation of the current humanoid robot into account, we assume a situation where the robot serves such people. We regard the robot as users' avatar or another existence of users, and consider the class of users: a nurse, a patient, and a person in a remote site. This allows us to propose four types of user interfaces for the humanoid service robot system: an on/off-line user interface for a nurse who wants to control the robot as his avatar, a user interface for a patient who wants to control the robot as another existence, and a user interface for a person in a remote site who wishes to control the robot as his avatar.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new search algorithm, the Dual Dijkstra Search. From a given initial and final configuration, Dual Dijkstra Search finds various paths which have different topologies simultaneously. This algorithm allows you to enumerate not only the optimal one but variety of meaningful candidates among local minimum paths. It is based on the algorithm of Dijkstra, which is popularly used to find an optimal solution. The method consists of two procedures: First computes local minima and ranks the paths in order of optimality. Then classify them with their topological properties and take out only the optimal paths in each groups. Computed examples include generating collision-free motion along 2D space and motion planning of 3-DOF robot. We also proposed the idea of motion compression, which simplifies the high dimensional motion planning problem. Together with this idea, we applied Dual Dijkstra Search to 7-DOF arm manipulation problem and succeeded in obtaining variety of motion candidates.",

An appropriately designed body path could lower the forces at the joints during inversion and thus minimizing potential injury. This paper presents a method of developing dynamic models that characterize the interaction between the body of a live object undergoing inversion and the mechanical system driving the rotation. The method offers an effective means to analyze the sensitivity of the design and operational parameters on the body rotation. The models have been validated experimentally. The simulated and experimental results offer significant insights to the joint forces and a means to improve the body dynamics. While the results have immediate application in inverting live birds for poultry meat processing, we expect the model will provide a basis for analyzing body rotational dynamics in other applications such as gymnastics and roller coasters.",

In particular, the real-time performance of existing integrated planning and control architectures is still not optimal because the reactive control capabilities have not been fully realized. This paper aims to enhance the low-level reactive capabilities of integrated planning and control with Cooperative Extended Kohonen Maps for handling complex, unpredictable environments so that the work-load of the high-level planner can be consequently eased. The enhancements include fine, smooth motion control, execution of more complex motion tasks such as overcoming unforeseen concave obstacles and traversing between closely spaced obstacles, and asynchronous execution of behaviors.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a general approach to specify and execute complex robot tasks considering uncertain environments. Robot tasks are defined by a precise definition of so-called skill primitive nets, which are based on Mason's hybrid force/velocity and position control concept, but it is not limited to force/velocity and position control. Two examples are given to illustrate the formally defined skill primitive nets. We evaluated the controller and the trajectory planner by several experiments. Skill primitives suite very well as interface to robot control systems. The presented hybrid control approach provides a modular, flexible, and robust system; stability is guaranteed, particularly at transitions of two skill primitives. With the interface explained here, the results of compliance motion planning become possible to be examined in real work cells. We have implemented an algorithm to search for mating directions in up to three-dimensional configuration-spaces. Thereby, on one hand we have released compliant motion control concepts and on the other hand we can provide solutions for fine motion and assembly planning. This paper shows, how these two fields can be combined by the general concept of skill primitive nets introduced here, in order to establish a powerful system, which is able to automatically execute prior calculated assembly plans based on CAD-data in uncertain environments.",

        "abstract": "To learn a new everyday task under the \"Learning from Observation\" framework, the system needs to detect which parts of the demonstration are essential to complete the task without task-dependent knowledge. In the previous research, we proposed a technique to estimate essential interactions in a task by integrating multiple demonstrations which represent virtually the same task. Although, the technique could automatically segment the essential interactions and determine the number of the interactions, the segmentation algorithm depends on some heuristics and only stationary interactions could be obtained. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed, which overcomes this limitation and can estimate almost any types of interactions. In this approach, a demonstrator needs to give a explicit signal once during each essential interaction as a hint on the occurrence of the essential interaction. From visual information and these signals, the system automatically analyzes the essential parts of the task and their periods, and also detects which environmental objects are interacted with the manipulated object. These information is hard to be obtained from a single demonstration, because of the ambiguity in interpreting the interaction especially in cluttered environment. The proposed method is evaluated in a simulation and also in a real world by using a humanoid robot.",

The twist data are inferred from the acceleration signals delivered by an accelerometer array $a kinematically redundant array of tri-axial accelerometers. The array signals can also be utilized to calculate the translational and angular accelerations of the micro-manipulator base, which are in turn used to obtain a set of dynamics equations for the macro-manipulator, thus reducing the order of the dynamics model. Next, the dynamics equations of the macro-manipulator and the state-output relations are linearized, the latter in closed form so as to lower the computational cost in a control loop. The relations thus obtained are then used in an extended Kalman filter to estimate the flexural states of the system.",

Here, the gradient of a potential field that is generated by solving the Poisson equation subject to a set of mixed boundary conditions is used to generate a sequence of directions to guide the motion of an evader so that it will escape a group of pursuers while avoiding a set of forbidden regions (clutter). The focus here is on continuous evasion where the agent does not have the benefit of a target zone (e.g., a shelter) which up on reaching it can discontinue engaging the pursuers. The capabilities of the approach are demonstrated using simulation experiments.",

Inter-agent communication, in particular explicit communication is applied to create multiple cooperating mobile robots in order to accomplish the foraging task. Explicit communication can significantly multiply the capabilities and effectiveness of teams of robotic systems. However, the drawback is it introduces more interference among robots at the goal and home region in comparison to robotic system without the implementation of inter-agent communication. Thus, to investigate how well the explicit communication can be adopted in designing efficient cooperative mobile robotic system, experiments were carried out on the simulated robots. The efficiency of the strategies are measured in terms of three criteria: time, density of robots and interference.",

From the ERPM, an existence probability value, ridge lines of the potential, and the Q-value at a point on a ridge line, were elicited. As a usage of these information, methods of finding a position where a collision probability of a mobile robot and a human is high, finding major trajectories of human locomotion, and evaluation of path width to avoid collision with a human, were indicated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a problem of how to confirm a feasible condition of applied force to a multi-legged robot on rough terrain. The problem often appeals as a subject of walking stability criterion for a legged robot. ZMP (zero moment point) is one of the well-known criteria. It shows the condition as footprints of a legged robot, but it cannot be defined on the rough terrain. Therefore, we suggest a new criterion FSW (feasible solution of wrench), which gives the feasible condition even on the rough terrain from the viewpoint of \"wrench\"-a special representation of force screw. And we present two short examples of FSW for a biped robot, how to analyse the validity of ZMP on stairs and how to design a force trajectory on rough terrain.",

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulation by rolling contacts is an appealing method for achieving dexterity with relatively simple hardware. While there exist techniques for planning motions of rigid bodies in rolling contact under nominal conditions, an inescapable challenge is the design of robust controllers of provable performance in the presence of model perturbations. As a preliminary step in this direction, we present in this paper an iterative robust planner of arbitrary accuracy for the plate-ball manipulation system subject to perturbations on the sphere radius. The basic tool is an exact geometric planner for the nominal system, whose repeated application guarantees the desired robustness property on the basis of the iterative steering paradigm. Simulation results under perturbed conditions show the effectiveness of the method.",

        "abstract": "Behavior imitation ability will be a key technology for future human friendly robots. In order to understand the principles and mechanisms of imitation, we take a synthetic cognitive developmental approach, starting with minimum components and create a system that can learn to imitate others. We developed a visuo-motor neural learning system which consists of orientation selective visual movement representation, distributed arm movement representation, and a high-dimensional temporal sequence learning mechanism. The vision and the movement representations model the findings in primate brain, i.e. macaque area MT(or human area V5) and the primary motor area. The learning mechanism is inspired by the finding that there are excessive connections in neonate brain. As our robot explores the visuo-motor self movement patterns, it learns coherent patterns as high-dimensional trajectory attractors. After the learning, a human comes in front of the robot showing arm movements which are similar to the ones in self learning. Although the robot has never seen or programmed to interpret human arm movement, and the detail of visual stimuli are very different, the robot identifies some of the patterns as similar to those in self learning, and responded by generating the previously learned arm movement. In other words, the robot exhibits early imitation ability based on self exploratory learning.",

Uncertain knowledge of such tasks asks specific reasoning and adapted fuzzy logic modeling and analysis methods. In this context, we propose a new fuzzy Petri net called Fuzzy Reasoning Petri Net: the FRPN. The modeling consists in a set of two collaborative FRPN. The first is used for the fault dynamic state of the system by temporal spectrum of the marking. A monitoring fuzzy Petri net (MFPN) represents the fault tree. The second model, the recovery fuzzy Petri net (RFPN) corresponds to recovering activities. The two proposed models form a dynamic loop for production system monitoring and recovery. Production system is supposed to be modelized using temporal Petri nets, with the assumption that the primary fault symptoms are detected. These symptoms are considered in the MFPN and evolve according to all other derived faults of the system. Synchronizing signals, corresponding to different warning levels and alarms, form the interface between these two tools.",

This paper describes the process to generate whole body motions which can be performed by an actual biped humanoid robot. Human dance motions are acquired through a motion capturing system. We then extract symbolic representation which is made up of primitive motions: essential postures in arm motions and step primitives in leg motions. A joint angle sequence of the robot is generated according to these primitive motions. Then joint angles are modified to satisfy mechanical constraints of the robot. For balance control, the waist trajectory is moved to acquire dynamics consistency based on desired ZMP. The generated motion is tested on OpenHRP dynamics simulator. In our test, the Japanese folk dance, 'Jongara-bushi', was successfully performed by HRP-1S.",

A velocity field defines the desired robot velocity in the operational space as a function of its current position, thus the robot performs the desired motions. In this paper, a controller is proposed for operational space velocity field control. The proposed controller is based on a hierarchical structure that result of using the kinematic control concept and a joint velocity controller. Experimental results on a two degrees-of-freedom direct-drive robot arm illustrate the viability of the proposed scheme.",

Today manufacturing setups rely increasingly on technology. It is common to have all sources of equipment on the shop floor, commanded by industrial PCs or PLCs connected by an industrial network to other factory resources. Also, the production systems are becoming more and more autonomous requiring less operator intervention in every day normal operation. That means using computers for controlling and supervision of the production systems, industrial networks and distributed software architectures. It means also designing application software that is really distributed in the shop floor, taking advantage of the flexibility installed by using programmable equipment.",

The sequences of interpreted behaviors are represented as a behavior graph to extract behavior rules.

        "abstract": "For stabilization of a robot manipulator upon collision with a stiff environment, a nonlinear bang-bang impact controller is developed. Under this control, a robot can successfully achieve contact tasks without changing control algorithm or controller gains throughout all three modes: free space, transition and constrained motion. It uses a robust hybrid impedance/time-delay control algorithm to absorb impact forces and stabilize the system. This control input alternates with zero when no environment force is sensed due to loss of contact. This alternation of control action repeats until the impact transient subsides and steady state is established. After impact transient, the hybrid impedance/time-delay control algorithm is utilized. This bang-bang control method provides stable interaction between a robot with severe nonlinear joint friction and a stiff environment and achieves rapid response while minimizing force overshoots. During contact transition, we employ one simple control algorithm with same gains that switches only to zero, while other controllers use more than one control algorithms or different control gains. It is shown via experiments that overall controlled performance is superior or comparable to existing impact force control techniques.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the concepts of car maneuvers, fuzzy logic control (FLC), and sensor-based behavior are merged to implement the human-like driving skills in the garage-parking task by an autonomous car-like mobile robot (CLMR). We decompose the garage-parking control into four modes to synthesize the fuzzy garage parking control (FGPC). Computer simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. The setup of the CLMR is provided, where the FGPC is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. Finally, the real-time experiments of the FPGA-based CLMR for the garage-parking task demonstrate the feasibility in a practical car maneuvering.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we examine locomotion in the context of self-reconfigurable robots. Self-reconfigurable robots are robots built from many connected modules. A self-reconfigurable robot can change its shape and configuration by changing the way these modules are connected. The focus of this paper is to understand how several locomotion gaits can be represented in such a robot and how the robot can select one of these gaits depending on its configuration. We implement a control system based on role based control in a physical self-reconfigurable robot built from seven modules. In several experiments we successfully demonstrate that when the robot is manually reconfigured from a chain to a quadruped configuration the robot changes gait from a sidewinder snake gait to a quadruped walking gait. We conclude that role based control is a promising central method for controlling locomotion of self-reconfigurable robots.",

        "abstract": "D* is a planning method that always routes a robot in initially unknown terrain from its current location to a given goal location along a shortest presumed unblocked path. The robot moves along the path until it discovers new obstacles and then repeats the procedure. D* has been used on a large number of robots. It is therefore important to analyze the resulting travel distance. Previously, there has been only one analysis of D*, and it has two shortcomings. First, to prove the lower bound, it uses a physically unrealistic example graph which has distances that do not correspond to distances on a real map. We show that the lower bound is not smaller for grids, the kind of map-based graph on which D* is usually used. Second, there is a large gap between the upper and lower bounds on the travel distance. We considerably reduce this gap by decreasing the upper bound on arbitrary graphs, including grids. To summarize, we provide new, substantially tighter bounds on the travel distance of D* on grids, thus providing a realistic analysis for the way D* is actually used.",

In particular, an accurate scaled euclidean reconstruction of the object is built in the first steps of the visual servoing by suitably using existing linear methods, and from this reconstruction the camera displacement is suitably estimated. Extensive proves performed in random conditions have shown that the proposed approach provides significantly better results with respect to the existing linear methods actually used in visual servoing.",

We provide experimental results establishing that significant roadmap improvements can be obtained relatively efficiently by utilizing a suite of CC connection methods, which include variants of existing methods such as RRT and a new ray tracing based method. The coordinated application of these techniques is enabled by methods for selecting and scheduling pairs of nodes in different CCs for connection attempts. In addition to identifying important and/or promising regions of C-space for exploration, these methods also provide a mechanism for controlling the cost of the connection attempts. In our experiments, the time required by the improvement phase was on the same order as the time used to generate the initial roadmap.",

They simultaneously combine the qualities found in many other sequences: i) the incremental and self-avoiding tendencies of pseudo-random sequences, ii) the lattice structure provided by multiresolution grids, and iii) low-discrepancy and low-dispersion measures of uniformity provided by quasi-random sequences. The resulting sequences can be considered as multiresolution grids in which points may be added one at a time, while satisfying the sampling qualities at each iteration. An efficient, recursive algorithm for generating the sequences is presented and implemented. Early experiments show promising performance by using the samples in search algorithms to solve motion planning problems.",

        "abstract": "Mass-spring systems have widely and effectively been used for modeling in real-time deformable objects. Easier to implement and faster than finite elements, these systems, on the other side, suffer from several drawbacks when coming to render physically believable behaviors. Neither isotropic or anisotropic materials can be controlled easily and the large number of springs and mass points composing the model makes it fastidious to define parameters to control elongation, flexion and torsion at a macroscopic level. Another weakness is that most of the materials found in nature maintain a constant or quasi-constant volume during deformations; unfortunately, mass-spring models do not have this property. In this paper, we extend the current state-of-the-art in soft tissue simulation by introducing a six-degree of freedom macroscopic elastic sphere described by mass, inertia and volumetric properties. Spheres are placed along the medial axis transform of the object whose centers are connected by a skeleton composed of a set of three-dimensional elastic links. Spheres represent internal mass, volume and control the global deformation of the object. The surface is modeled by setting point masses on the mesh nodes and damped springs on the mesh edges. These nodes are connected to the skeleton by individual elastic links, which control volume conservation and transfer forces between the surface and volumetric model. Using this framework we also present an efficient method to approximate collision detection between multiple bodies in real-time.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a unified approach for inverse and direct dynamics of constrained multibody systems that can be served as a basis for analysis, simulation, and control. The compactness of the dynamics formulation can result in computational efficiency. Furthermore, the acceleration is explicitly related to the generalized force by an introduced \"constraint inertia matrix\" which is proved to be always invertible. Thus a simulation may proceed even with the presence of redundant constraints or singular configurations. The generalized forces are decomposed onto two orthogonal subspaces which are considered as control inputs for controlling position and constraint force. The motion controller scheme, remarkably, requires no force feedback, proves to be stable, and minimizes actuation force. Finally, numerical and experimental results obtained from dynamic simulation and control of constrained mechanical systems, based on the proposed inverse and direct dynamics formulations, are documented.",

In this paper, an inverse dynamic formulation is presented by the Newton-Euler approach for a spatial parallel manipulator, which has two translational degrees of freedom and one rotational degree of freedom. The inverse kinematics analysis is firstly performed in closed form. Then the force and moment equilibrium equations for the manipulator are presented. According to the kinematic constraints of the legs and the platform, some joint constraint forces are eliminated and an algorithm to solve the actuator forces is given. In addition, ADAMS is used to perform the kinematic and dynamic simulation for the manipulator. The simulation results are compared to those derived from algebraic formulae and the comparison shows the validity of the mathematical model.",

We present the advanced capability to dynamically reconfigure autonomous systems because their goals and environments vary frequently. We determine the specification of units and agents in order to analyze the behavior of overall system and to implement the dynamic reconfiguration as easy and simple as possible.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Within the field of Neuro Robotics we are driven primarily by the desire to understand how humans and animals live and grow and solve every day's problems. To this aim we adopted a \"learn by doing\" approach by building artificial systems, e.g. robots that not only look like human beings but also represent a model of some brain process. They should, ideally, behave and interact like human beings (being situated). The main emphasis in robotics has been on systems that act as a reaction to an external stimulus (e.g. tracking, reaching), rather than as a result of an internal drive to explore or \"understand\" the environment. We think it is now appropriate to try to move from acting, in the sense explained above, to \"understanding\". As a starting point we addressed the problem of learning about the effects and consequences of self-generated actions. How does the robot learn how to pull an object toward itself or to push it away? How does the robot learn that spherical objects roll while a cube only slides if pushed? Interacting with objects is important because it implicitly explores object representation, event understanding, and can provide definition of object-hood that could not be grasped with a mere passive observation of the world. Further, learning to understand what one's own body can do is an essential step toward learning by imitation. In this view two actions are similar not only if their kinematics and dynamics are similar but rather if the effects on the external world are the same. Along this line of research we discuss some recent experiments performed at the AI-Lab at MIT and at the LIRA-Lab at the University of Genova on COG and Babybot respectively. We show how the humanoid robots can learn how to poke and prod objects to obtain a consistently repeatable effect (e.g. sliding in a given direction), to help visual segmentation, and to interpret a poking action performed by a human manipulator.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the problem of how human control strategy can be represented as a parametric model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and how an SVM-based controller can be used to effectively control a dynamically stable system. We formulate the learning problem as a support vector regression and develop a new SVM learning structure to better implement human control strategy learning in control. The approach is fundamentally valuable in dealing with problems that normally dynamically stable robots experience, such as small sample data and local minima, and therefore is extremely useful in abstracting human controller for dynamic systems. The experimental study on the SVM approach with respect to other approaches clearly demonstrated the superiority of the SVM approach in terms of fidelity, efficiency and effectiveness in implementation.",

The system learns to perform visual servoing based on rewards given relative to tracking performance. The learned controller compensates for the velocity of the target and performs lag-free pursuit of a swinging target. By comparing controllers exposed to different environments we show that the controller is predicting the motion of the target by forming an implicit model of the target's motion. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of implicit modelling.",

Abstract action representations serve several purposes, such as structuring the control code, optimizing the robot performance, and providing a basis for reasoning about future robot action. The paper presents results about re-designing the RHINO navigation system by introducing an HTN plan layer. Besides yielding a more structured robot control software, this layer is used as a basis for optimizing the navigation performance by plan transformations. We show how a robot can learn to select plan transformations based on projections of its intended behavior. Our experimental evaluation shows that the overall robot navigation performance is increased by almost 42 % when using learned projective models to select plan transformations.",

Using NdFeB magnets and diamagnetic materials such as graphite in a particular configuration, we build a passive levitated force sensor with a variable stiffness and linear output. The suspended part is used as the sensing device and two directions of force measurement are possible. The absence of friction makes the sensor highly sensitive and forces around nN can be measured. The established model of both magnetic and diamagnetic forces allows to calculate the applied force on the end point of the levitating device after measuring the position of the levitating part. This paper presents the description of the levitated sensor, force calculation and experimental results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A machine vision system for SMT-mounting machine applications is usually a two-stage algorithm. It first measures the centroid and rotation angle of the SMD, and then checks each pin's area, position error, and grid coordinate location. In this paper, a set of complete procedures is proposed to locate and check the BGA image. During the locating procedures, we first calculate a threshold of the frame using an iterative threshold algorithm. If an object is found under this threshold, then the pin's area is calculated by the local threshold by using a momentum algorithm. After that, whether this object is a pin or not is decided by its neighbors' relative positions, the approximate rotation angle for finding the outer pins is calculated, and the centroid as well as the rotation angle of a BGA component is calculated by the rectangular least squares algorithm. The checking procedure also measures each pin's area using the momentum algorithm, then it calculates the radius of the moving sum using each pin's area, and finally measures the position error using a moving sum algorithm and judges each pin's type by gray level. The new method uses the gray level statistic information to solve the empty pad's problem and utilizes the symmetrical property of a circle to deal with the shape problem. Lastly, the CRC algorithm is used to check the correspondence between each pin and its pin type. This new method has a high accuracy and a low execution time. It can meet the crucial timing requirement of a high-speed SMT machine through experimental verification.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel design approach for the development of robot hands is presented. This approach, that can be considered alternative to the \"classical\" one, takes into consideration compliant structures instead of rigid ones. Compliance effects, which were considered in the past as a \"defect\" to be mechanically eliminated, can be viceversa regarded as desired features and can be properly controlled in order to achieve desired properties from the robotic device. In particular, this is true for robot hands, where the mechanical complexity of \"classical\" design solutions has always originated complicated structures, often with low reliability and high costs. In this paper, an alternative solution to the design of dexterous robot hand is illustrated, considering a \"mechatronic approach\" for the integration of the mechanical structure, the sensory and electronic system, the control and the actuation part. Moreover, the preliminary experimental activity on a first prototype is reported and discussed. The results obtained so far, considering also reliability, costs and development time, are very encouraging, and allows to foresee a wider diffusion of dexterous hands for robotic applications.",

Legs were developed by integrating in each two thermal bimorph actuators, which give two degrees of freedom. After their fabrication and their experimentation, the legs were integrated on a body to realize the complete structure of the microrobot in a monolithic way. This microrobot was totally made by microfabrication in a clean room. The microrobot has a total volume of 6 mm/spl times/3.5 mm/spl times/0.5 mm and possesses six legs. Its experimentation allowed to determine its potential performances. This microrobot can find numerous applications in microrobotics, such as the inspection of stuffy environments, the micro-escorting or as a plug and play function in a system.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A fundamental requirement of micromanipulation is to control the impact force and subsequently the contact force in the transition of the micromanipulator end-effector from noncontact to contact state. This is especially important in protecting fragile microstructures and preventing undesirable motion. This paper proposes a method of using the integration of selective focusing and microforce control to achieve fast transition control while minimizing impact force. The method is applied to contact transition in microassembly pick-and-place operations. The initial long-range approach motion of the end-effector towards its target is controlled based on focus measures computed from images captured through a microscope. When the end-effector comes into focus near the target, the system switches to microforce control to minimize impact force and to regulate the contact force. An optics model for microscope focusing is proposed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the end-effector images during the approach motion. The connection between this model and the scale-space theory of computer vision is emphasized. Three different focus measures are tested and compared in performance. The proposed method has been experimentally verified to be able to achieve fast transition control with minimal impact force.",

Gripper compliance is desirable to compensate for positional errors and to prevent the breakage of a gripper during assembly tasks. An analytical model is derived to study the motion and force profiles during compliant insertion. Thermal bimorph microgrippers with a compliant tip are designed and fabricated using a silicon DRIE process, and are mounted on a precision motion stage. A series of micropeg manipulation tasks such as pick up, rotation, and insertion are successfully performed. Finally, a comb structure is integrated in the gripper to calculate insertion force by measuring the deflection of a gripper, which is essential for automated microassembly.",

This compensator improves the robustness of the arm configuration which is far out of the RAC. The compensator consists of a constant gain matrix and acceleration of each joint. The design method for this mode shaping matrix is presented based on the mode shaping algorithm. Effect upon the manipulability is also examined. It suggests that inclining of DME's principal axes, resulting in changing the rigid body dynamics, by the compensator leads to the improvement of the robustness. The validity is confirmed by a numerical example performed with a 2 DOF planar manipulator mounted on a 1 DOF flexible base. A high bandwidth settling is realized with obtained compensator.",

Two approaches are often used for this type of problems: decoupled and centralized. The tradeoff of these two approaches is that the decoupled approach is considered faster while the centralized approach has the advantage of being complete. In this paper, we propose an efficient centralized planner that is much faster than the traditional randomized planning approaches. This planner uses a hierarchical sphere tree structure to group robots dynamically. By taking advantage of the problem characteristics on independently moving robots, we are able to design a practical planner with the centralized approach when the number of robots is rather large. We use several simulation examples to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the planner.",

The problem is to generate a sequence of continuous one-step motions between consecutive holds that will allow the robot to reach a particular goal hold. A detailed algorithm is presented to compute a one-step motion considering the equilibrium constraint only. The overall framework combines this local planner with a heuristic search technique to generate a complete plan. An online implementation of the algorithm is demonstrated in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning is one of the key capabilities for autonomous humanoid robots. Previous researches have focused on weight balancing, collision detection, and gait generation. Most planners either assume that the environment can be simplified to a 2D workspace or assume that the path is given. In this paper, we propose a motion planning system capable of generating both global and local motions for a humanoid robot in a layered or two and half dimensional environment. The planner can generate a gross motion that moves the humanoid vertically as well as horizontally to avoid obstacles in the environments. The gross motion is further realized by a local planner that determines the most efficient footsteps and locomotion over uneven terrain. If the local planner fails, the failure is feedback to the global planner to consider other alternative paths. The implemented humanoid planning system is an interactive tool that can compute collision-free motions for a humanoid robot in an online manner.",

        "abstract": "A new motion planning framework is presented that enables multiple mobile robots with limited ranges of sensing and communication to maneuver and achieve goals safely in dynamic environments. To combine the respective advantages of centralized and de-centralized planning, this framework is based on the concept of centralized planning within dynamic robot networks. As the robots move in their environment, localized robot groups form networks, within which world models and robot goals can be shared. Whenever a network is formed, new information then becomes available to all robots in this network. With this new information, each robot uses a fast, centralized planner to compute new coordinated trajectories on the fly. Planning over several robot networks is decentralized and distributed. Both simulated and real-robot experiments have validated the approach.",

This system could potentially replace the functions of the mouse, pen, and keyboard as input devices to the computer. The system could also be used as a general wireless 3D motion sensing device. In this paper, we will present our work on using MIDS for motion sensing application of robot hands. MIDS is used to evaluate the performance of PD adaptive control and Impedance control schemes in manipulating a five-fingered robot hand and in manipulating this hand to grasp a ball. Experimental results indicate that MIDS is capable of obtaining real-time 3D acceleration/vibration data wirelessly for the robotic hand, hence eliminating the need to perform the time-consuming integration of the position sensor data to obtain acceleration. Moreover, our initial results also indicate that further exploration of this technology could eventually produce a new control-input device for robotic grasping manipulators. These results are presented in this paper.",

An optimization for the hand trajectory and muscle's force distribution is needed to acquire the reaching motion. The proposed architecture can acquire an optimized motion through learning the task. However, the biological control system composed of musculoskeletal system is not able to sense the state without time delay. The time delay causes instability of learning. The proposed scheme consists of the reinforcement learning part and neural internal model. Neural internal model is employed to compensate for the time delay by estimating the state of musculoskeletal system. Then, there must be a modeling error if some noise is included. Thus we introduce the minimum modeling error criterion for reinforcement learning, which gives not only the reduction of total muscle level but also the smoothness of the hand trajectory. The effectiveness and the biological plausibility of the present model is demonstrated by several simulations.",

The objective of planning is to find optimal forces exerted on the object by agents with which the object can follow a given trajectory. The main contributions of the proposed approach is: First, through integrating of noncooperative game and neural-net approximation, the planner can deal with unknown pressure distribution effectively. Second, by introducing cooperative game between agents, the forces exerted by agents distributed optimally. Based on the dynamic model of the pushed object, the planing problem is solved in two levels hierarchically. In the lower control level, generalized force inputs are designed by using minimax technique to achieve the tracking performance. In the coordination level, cooperative game is formulated between agents to distribute the generalized force, and the objective of the game is to minimize the worst case interaction force between agents and object. Simulations are carried out for the three-agent cooperative manipulation, results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning method.",

        "abstract": "Agility is important to modern enterprises. The effective coordination of large numbers of potential suppliers and manufacturer, demands a scientific methodology rather than just practical experience to make decisions on supply manufacturing planning problems. Particularly in cases where multiple decision objectives are important to process planning, empirical decisions are insufficient. This paper introduces formal methods to solve such multi-objective decision problems involved in general supply manufacturing planning, and specifically describes the extension of differential evolution methods to discrete problem domains. An enterprise planning problem with two objectives-cycle time and cost is used as a principal example. Such multi-objective optimization problems usually are very large and nonlinear. In this paper, the concept of differential evolution, which is well-known in single-objective continuous domain for its fast convergence and adaptive parameter setting, is extended to the discrete domain by introducing greedy probability, mutation probability, and crossover probability. Moreover, this concept is extended to discrete multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed discrete multi-objective differential evolution, or D-MODE algorithm is applied to obtain Pareto solutions of this general planning problem. A practical example in the electronics industry is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed D-MODE.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a self-reconfigurable robot which can form a 5R closed kinematic chain, only two of whose joints are actuated. This paper discusses its dynamic rolling. When it rolls, it has one DOF of its absolute orientation besides two DOFs of its shape. We show that the absolute orientation is subject to an acceleration constraint, not a velocity constraint. Therefore, the dynamics of the rolling motion needs to be formulated to control it. This paper proposes a controller which can reduce its negative acceleration caused by gravity. The shape and orientation of the robot cannot be controlled simultaneously. This paper proposes a control strategy switching shape and orientation controllers. We verify the effectiveness of the control strategy by simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "The decades of research in motion planning have resulted in numerous algorithms. Many of the most successful algorithms are randomized and can have widely differing run-times for the same problem instance from run to run. While this property is known to be undesirable from user's point of view, it has been largely ignored in past research. This paper introduces the large run-cost variance of randomized motion planners as a distinct issue to be addressed in future research. Run-cost variance is an important performance characteristic of an algorithm that should be studied together with the mean run-cost. As a positive example of possibilities for reducing the run-cost variance of a randomized motion planner, simple heuristic techniques are introduced and investigated empirically.",

The cost of a path is defined to be the energy expended due to both friction and gravity. The model allows for ranges of impermissible traversal directions caused by overturn danger or power limitations. This model is interesting and challenging as it incorporates constraints found in realistic situations and these constraints affect the computation of optimal paths. We give some upper and lower bound results on the combinatorial size of energy-minimizing paths on terrains. We also present an efficient approximation algorithm that computes for two given points a path whose cost is within a user-defined relative error ratio. Compared to previous results with the same approach, this algorithm improves the time complexity by using: (1) a discretization with reduced size, and (2) an improved discrete algorithm for finding optimal paths in the discretization. We present some preliminary experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm. We also provide a similar discretization for the same model but under less restricted assumptions.",

        "abstract": "There are many kinds of rheology objects in our living life. If such rheology objects are individually and completely modeled, we can flexibly deal with such various objects in a factory by a robotic manipulator controlling six degrees-of-freedom forces and moments and also operate them at a 3-D graphics world in a house by a human via a wonderful haptic device feeling the forces and moments. If such a system is developed after acquiring a rheology dynamic model, we can enjoy a clay work in a 3-D virtual environment. For this purpose, we calibrate deformation model of a rheology object by a modified randomized algorithm based on experimental data. The data is measured from a bread material pushed by a robotic manipulator exactly. The model is a 3-D voxel/lattice structure with many elements, and each element consists of two dampers and one spring. By changing three coefficients of dampers and spring, we can describe various material properties concerning to viscosity and elasticity. In this paper, by minimizing shape difference between real and virtual rheology objects in the near-optimal algorithm, we find a better set of coefficients. Using the calibrated model, we can feel three degrees-of-freedom forces and three degrees-of-freedom moments attracted from a calibrated virtual object in a haptic device and synchronously we can watch shape deformation of the object in a 3-D graphics animation.",

By virtue of quasiholonomy, a concept introduced elsewhere, the robot is underactuated by design. One challenge here is the control of the motion of the intermediate body, which will tend to rotate about the wheel axis as the wheels are actuated. We prove that it is possible to completely control the robot using only the wheel motors, while tracking a desired trajectory, with apparent advantages in terms of cost, weight and efficiency. To do this, we show that every linearization of the robot dynamics model around an equilibrium point verifies the Kalman rank condition for controllability. Moreover, using modern results from nonlinear control theory, we prove that the robot is locally accessible and small-time locally controllable.",

The main problem is to guarantee global properties, such as algorithm convergence or trajectory optimality, based on local information. In this paper we present a new non-heuristic sensor-based planning algorithm, characterized by: 1) it is based in potential functions, allowing to introduce optimality criteria, 2) it is computed incrementally to introduce last sensor readings, and 3) it accounts for robot dynamics. The result is a method suitable for real-time navigation, it is intuitive and easy to understand, and produces smooth and safe trajectories.",

Next, this approach is implemented in an online motion planning algorithm. This method can be generalized to higher spaces, and uses only the line of sight information of sonar sensors. It is much simpler than HGVG method, and is complete. The simulations showed good results for different environments.",

The motion is optimal for the tracking robot (the observer) in the sense that the target either remains visible for the longest possible time, or it is captured by the observer in the minimum time when feasible. Thus, the algorithm maximizes the minimum time-to-escape. Our algorithm assumes that the target moves along a known path. Thus, it is an off-line algorithm. Our theoretical results for the algorithm's runtime assume that the target is moving along a shortest path from its source to its destination. This assumption, however is not required to prove the optimality of the computed solution, hence the algorithm remains correct for the general case.",

After conducting the static force analysis of the mechanism, the force balancing is formulated as an optimisation problem such that a sum-squared values of bearing forces is minimized throughout an operation range of the manipulator, provided that a set of balancing constraints consisting of balancing conditions, the sizes of some inertial and geometric parameters are satisfied. Optimisation results indicate that the proposed optimisation approach is systematic, versatile and easy to implement for the optimum balancing of the parallel manipulator and other more general parallel manipulators. This work contributes to previously published work from the point of view of being a step towards optimum design of parallel manipulators, which is currently lacking in the literature.",

The paper focuses on 3-limb robots, but the algorithm generalizes to robots with a higher number of limbs. The input to the PCG algorithm is a description of a tunnel having an arbitrary piece-wise linear geometry, a lower bound on the amount of friction at the contacts, as well as start and target foothold positions. Using efficient convex programming techniques, the algorithm approximates the possible foothold positions as a collection of cubes in contact c-space. A graph structure induced by the cubes has the property that its edges represent feasible motion between neighboring sets of 3-limb postures. This motion is realized by lifting one limb while the other two limbs brace the robot against the tunnel walls. A shortest-path search along the graph yields a 3-2-3 gait pattern that moves the robot from start to target using a minimum number of foothold exchanges. Simulation results demonstrate the PCG algorithm in a tunnel environment.",

        "abstract": "A method for passivity analysis of a class of nonlinear systems is described. For linear plants controlled by sampled-data controllers, the resulting interaction admittance is nonlinear. It is shown that satisfying the linear requirements for passivity is insufficient to guarantee passivity of the nonlinear system. To analyze such plants, we first show that if a waveform constituting a counter-example of passivity exists, then a counter-example may also be found within a limited class of functions. By restricting attention to this class of functions, a numerical passivity evaluation is feasible. Examples using the method are presented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel method for robot path planning based on learning motion patterns. A motion pattern is defined as the path that results from applying a set of probabilistic constraints to a \"raw\" input path. For example, a user can sketch an approximate path for a robot without considered issues such as bounded radius of curvature and our system would then elaborate it to include such a constraint. In our approach, the constraints that generate a path are learned by capturing the statistical properties of a set of training examples using supervised learning. Each training example consists of a pair of paths: an unconstrained (raw) path and an associated preferred path. Using a Hidden Markov Model in combination with multi-scale methods, we compute a probability distribution for successive path segments as a function of their context within the path and the raw path that guides them. This learned distribution is then used to synthesize a preferred path from an arbitrary input path by choosing some mixture of the training set biases that produce the maximum likelihood estimate. We present our method and applications for robot control and non-holonomic path planning.",

This paper describes a design pattern-based architecture to build remote laboratories for mobile robotics. The proposed remote laboratory is currently used to provide remote experiments on indoor mobile robotics, addressing different approaches to solve the main problems of mobile robotics, such as sensing, motion control, localization, world modeling, planning, etc. These experiments are being used in several mobile robotics and autonomous systems courses, at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",

Instead, the robot's planner must compute an optimal or near-optimal path through the goals. This problem occurs, for instance, in spot-welding, inspection, and measurement tasks. It combines two computationally hard sub-problems: the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems. This paper describes a greedy algorithm that operates under the assumption that the number of goals is relatively small (a few dozen at most) and the computational cost of finding a good path between two goals dominates that of finding a good tour in a graph with edges of given costs. Although the algorithm computes a quadratic number of goal-to-goal paths in the worst case, it is much faster in practice.",

To find the desired initial velocities for free sliding objects is a key step for implementing dynamic manipulation. In order to plan the initial velocities, the motion of free sliding objects is modeled as a set of 6 first order differential equations, and the planning problem is formulated as a free boundary value problem (FBVP). Through a simple transformation, the FBVP is reduced to a standard Two-point boundary value (TPBV) problem. Quasi-Newton based optimization procedures are utilized to solve the planning problem. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed method does not require qualitative motion characteristics, thus it can be used for objects with general shape and arbitrary pressure distribution. Simulation results on polygonal objects with three to five vertices are used to demonstrate the planning method.",

The generated path is described by continuous curves, instead of the traditional chaining of different curves. Parametric polynomials of third degree are used to calculate the robot configuration variables, x(/spl lambda/) and y(/spl lambda/). The orientation angle, /spl theta/(/spl lambda/), is imposed to respect the non-holonomic constraint. The free polynomial coefficients are used to refine the path, avoiding maximal or minimal values of x(/spl lambda/) and y(/spl lambda/) which tends to generate shorter paths, avoiding unnecessary motions.",

Linear visual servoing is based on the linear approximation between binocular visual space and joint space of the arm of the humanoid robot. It is very robust to calibration error, especially to camera angle errors and joint angle errors, because it uses neither camera angles nor joint angles to calculate feedback command. In this paper, we propose a method to expand work space of linear visual servoing by using neck joint. We obtain the linear approximation matrix in wide space and express it as a function of the neck angle by using the neural network. Some experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The algorithm is based on a generalized potential field model of 3-D workspace. The approach computes, similar to that done in electrostatics, repulsive force and torque between manipulator and obstacles using the workspace information directly. Using these force and torque, a collision-free path of a manipulator can be obtained by locally adjusting the manipulator configuration for minimum potential. The proposed approach is efficient since these potential gradients are analytically tractable. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works well, in terms of computation time and collision avoidance, for manipulators up to 6 links.",

        "abstract": "Despite the increasing interest in parallel mechanisms during the last years, few researchers have addressed the motion planning problem for such systems. The few existing techniques lie in a representation of the workspace of the mechanism (or its boundary). However, obtaining this representation is generally too difficult, only partial solutions exist for particular cases. In this paper we propose a general approach based on probabilistic motion planning techniques. This approach does not need any modeling of the robot's workspace. It combines random sampling techniques with simple but general geometric algorithms that guide the sampling toward feasible configurations satisfying the closure constraints of the parallel mechanism. The efficiency and the generality of the method are demonstrated onto several complex mechanisms mode up with serial or parallel associations of Stewart platforms, or created with several redundant robots manipulating an object.",

Methods developed to evaluate the production cycle time are usually based on either the Design for Manufacture (DFM) or Design for Production (DFP) scheduling techniques. To evaluate the real cycle time at the programming level of controllers such as the ladder logic design of programmable logic controller (PLC) in DECS, this paper discusses a method to analyze the production cycle time based on the sensor-based stage Petri nets technique. The production time can be estimated at each stage directly from all the I/O sensors that are represented by the extended Petri nets: the sensor-based stage Petri net (SBSPN). The production cycle time required to complete each product is marked on the individual stage transition through the real timers in the SBSPN model. For the production of multiple products, different production cycles times are estimated through the stage-by-stage real timers of controller program. These production cycle times are able to evaluate the bottleneck of integrated manufacturing systems. An example is used to illustrate the approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a cooperative sweeping strategy with deadlock avoidance of complete coverage path planning for multiple cleaning robots in a changing and unstructured environment is proposed, using biologically inspired neural networks. Cleaning tasks require a special kind of trajectory being able to cover every unoccupied area in specified cleaning environments, which is an essential issue for cleaning robots and many other robotic applications. Multiple robots can improve the work capacity, share the cleaning tasks, and reduce the time to complete sweeping tasks. In the proposed model, the dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting neural equation. Each cleaning robot treats the other robots as moving obstacles. The robot path is autonomously generated from the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network, the previous robot location and the other robot locations. The proposed model algorithm is computationally efficient. The feasibility is validated by simulation studies on three cases of two cooperating cleaning robots. The multiple cleaning robots sweeping will not be trapped in deadlock situations.",

Since the algorithm is part of a real-time visual servoing system designed for assembly of automotive parts on-the-fly, the main constraints in the design of the algorithm were: speed and accuracy. That is: close to frame-rate performance, and error in pose estimation smaller than a few millimeters. The algorithm proposed uses only three model features, and yet it is very accurate and robust. For that reason both constraints were satisfied: the algorithm runs at 60 fps (30 fps for each stereo image) on a PIII-800 MHz computer, and the pose of the object is calculated within an uncertainty of 2.4 mm in translation and 1.5 degree in rotation.",

The algorithm maintains a rigid body formation as a group robots follows a specified trajectory at the beginning and end of the trajectory. At this point, our algorithm is open loop.

Traditional methods perform congestion control by means of monitoring the queue length. When the queue length is greater than a predefined threshold, the source rate is decreased at a fixed rate. However, the determination of the congested threshold and sending rate is difficult for these methods. We adopted a simple reinforcement learning method, called Adaptive Heuristic Critic (AHC), to solve the problem. The AHC controller maintains an expectation of reward and takes the best policy to control source flow. By way of learning and then taking right actions, simulation results have shown that the approach can promote the system utilization and decrease packet loss.",

The method enables the remote user to drive the mobile robot without collisions. It consists of a real-time environment modeling algorithm using ultrasonic sensors, and a mobile robot control algorithm for obstacle avoidance. The former solves the limitations of the ultrasonic sensors such as noise sensitivity, poor directionality, and specular reflection for obtaining more accurate sensor data. Then the latter conducts wall or center following implemented by a fuzzy controller for obstacle avoidance using the environment model obtained by the previous algorithm. The command for obstacle avoidance is actually applied as a reflective force using a haptic device such as a force feedback joystick. The remote mobile robot, ROBHAZ-DT(RoBot in HAZardous environment-Double Track) developed by KIST(Korea Institute of Science and Technology), is employed as the mobile robot model. The normal and the maximum speed of the ROBHAZ-DT are 3.1 km/h and 7.2 km/h, respectively. The weight of the robot is 50 kg. Simulations with the ROBHAZ-DT model are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel motion planning algorithm based on adaptive random walks. The proposed algorithm turns out to be easy to implement and the solution it produces can be easily and efficiently optimized. Furthermore the algorithm can incorporate adaptive components, so that the developer is not required to specify all the parameters of the random distributions involved, and the algorithm itself can adapt to the environment it is moving in. Proofs of the theoretical soundness of the algorithm are provided as well as implementation details. Numerical comparisons with well known algorithms illustrate its effectiveness.",

Generating a trajectory for a surface with only one patch is widely studied to satisfy the paint thickness constraints. However, a complex surface has to be divided into several patches to satisfy the paint thickness and paint gun orientation constraints. Trajectory generation for a surface with multiple patches has not been addressed yet. In this paper, optimization processes are developed to optimize the paint thickness on a surface which consists of several patches. Optimization results are presented. Simulations are performed to verify the optimized parameters. Verification results is consistent with the optimization results.",

A good model of the robot joint used was obtained by system identification. Experiments were carried out on an ABB industrial robot 2000 to demonstrate results on observer-based SPR feedback applied in the design. Stability was shown via a modified Popov criterion.",

An experimental setup was developed for gathering basic data on the forming process. Some results of preliminary experiments are presented. The influence of the clearance between the roller and mandrel is also discussed. The author proposes applying hybrid position/force control for shear spinning, which is free from fine adjustment of the clearance.

In this paper, we report our tentative classification experiments of several objects using the human-like autonomous robot, \"WAMOEBA-2Ri\". As modeling the environment, we focus on not only static aspects of the environment but also dynamic aspects of it including that of the system own. The visualized result of this experiment shows the integration of multimodal sensor dataset acquired by the system-environment interaction (\"grasping\") enable robust categorization of several objects. Finally, in discussion, we demonstrate a possible application to making \"invariance in motion\" emerge consequently by extending this approach.",

Manipulator dynamics and actuator dynamics including the dynamics of the valves are taken into account. The stability proof is based on the Lyapunov method and passivity arguments. It is shown that the stability proof is not restricted to the proposed control law of the hydraulic actuators but also holds for arbitrary hydraulic force control laws as long as certain requirements are fulfilled.",

First, a path planning method dealing with localization uncertainties is proposed, where the uncertainties in both position and orientation of a non-holonomic mobile robot are considered. The safety of this method is due to the mixing of the planning phase and the navigation phase using the same process of localization (the Kalman filter). Next, while previous works planned safe paths in the configuration space, we show that it is necessary to plan safe paths in an uncertain-configuration space. Then, we introduce the novel concept of \"towers of uncertainties\" and show the effectiveness of this concept with some examples.",

        "abstract": "Multiple, independent robot platforms promise significant advantage with respect to robustness and flexibility. However, coordination between otherwise independent robots requires the exchange of information; either implicitly (as in gestural communication), or explicitly (as in message passing in a communication network.) In either case, control processes resident on all coordinated peers must participate in the collective behavior. This paper evaluates the potential to scale such a coupled control framework to many participating individuals, where scalability is evaluated in terms of the schedulability of coupled, distributed control processes. We examine how schedulability affects the scalability of a robot system, and discuss an algorithm used for off-line schedulability analysis of a distributed task model. We present a distributed coordinated search task and analyze the schedulability of the designed task structure. We are able to analyze communication delays in the system that put upper bounds on the size of the robot teams. We show that hierarchical methods can be used to overcome the scalability problem. We propose that schedulability analysis should be an integrated part of a multi-robot team design process.",

Sensor-based versions of Lazy DRM and Lazy LRM are used to exploit the information obtained from sensors and to compute a feasible collision-free path. The algorithm tries to reach the goal, executing the local method in the known free region. If it succeeds, a path to the goal is found and the algorithm finishes. Otherwise, the algorithm executes more scans to extend its free space, an so on. We have performed some simulations that show the promise of our approach.",

The closed loop equation renders local exponential tracking by means of the existence of a chattering-free second order sliding mode regime for all time. Additionally, a time-varying feedback gain induces a well-posed terminal attractor of visual tracking errors to prove finite-time tracking of image-based desired trajectories. The system is computationally very inexpensive in comparison to the few dynamic visual servoing controllers available in the literature since the regressor is not computed. Simulations results presented, which confirms the expected dynamic closed-loop performance.",

The control law scales linearly with the number of actuators and is simple to implement. Moreover, we prove that control law has desirable robustness properties in the presence of the nonsmooth mechanics inherent in distributed manipulation systems that rely upon frictional contact. This algorithm has been implemented on an experimental distributed manipulation test-bed, whose structure is briefly reviewed. The experimental results confirm the validity and performance of the algorithm.",

Another requirement is that human operators can manipulate the robots with ease. In this paper, a path expression methodology consisting of line segments, circular arcs and clothoid arcs is presented. In addition, a method of global path generation with a visibility graph is proposed. To establish this method, the following steps are proposed: (a) the arrangement of subgoals (middle points) and (b) the construction of the graph for path generation. By using the proposed method, the paths were shortened 14% on average.",

In the previous research, we categorized robots into four categories in terms of appearance. Then, we introduced a cat robot and a seal robot, and evaluated them by interviewing many people in Japan. The results showed that physical interaction improved subjective evaluation. Moreover, a priori knowledge of a subject has much influence into subjective interpretation and evaluation of mental commit robot. In this paper, 440 subjects evaluated the seal robot, Paro by questionnaires in an exhibition at Science Museum in London, UK. This paper reports the results of statistical analysis of evaluation data, and compares them with those obtained in Japan.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the Conservative Congruence Transformation (CCT), K/sub /spl theta//-K/sub g/=J/sub /spl theta///sup T/K/sub p/J/sub /spl theta//, is applied to a 3-link redundant planar manipulator. Since 3-link planar manipulator has one degree of redundancy, one constraint is allowed to be used to define the parameters of the system. Different constraints can be used to meet the specific requirements of manipulation. In this paper, two constraints are employed to obtain solution for redundant manipulation. One involves maintaining the most distal link along specific orientations; the other requires that the moment at the end-effector be always zero. In the latter case, the orientation of the distal link is decided in such a way that this constraint is satisfied. Numerical simulation and results are presented to illustrate that CCT is indeed a general and correct stiffness mapping in the analysis of redundant manipulators. The incorrect results of the conventional formulation, K/sub /spl theta//=J/sub /spl theta///sup T/K/sub p/J/sub /spl theta//, are also computed and compared with the results of the CCT theory.",

In the following, different task-level control issues (shared, traded, cooperative and priority) are discussed and tested on a micro device assembly workcell.",

For an autonomous robot, energy is a very important factor, so it is only natural that the ability of the robot to accumulate energy should be used as evaluation of the robot's survival strategy. The robot in this study is equipped with a solar panel, and a model of neural network ensemble. The solar panel enables the robot to autonomously accumulate energy in the outdoor environment, while the neural network ensemble enables the robot to acquire strategies that are needed in order to survive in the environment. The accumulated energy is considered as the feedback from the environment to measure the efficiency of the strategy exerted by the robot, and used as learning guidance for the robot to survive.",

This paper identifies procedures for selecting the appropriate admittance to achieve reliable planar force-guided assembly for multi-point contact cases. Conditions that restrict the admittance behavior for each of the various types of two-point contact are presented. These conditions ensure that the motion that results from contact reduces part misalignment for each case. We show that, for bounded misalignments, if the conditions are satisfied for a finite number of contact configurations, the conditions ensure that force guidance is achieved for all configurations within the specified bounds.",

In this paper, new method for generating human-like natural motions based on the motion database acquired by motion capture systems is described. On the analysis step, the acquired motions are divided into some motion segments, and then the characteristic poses and motions are archived as 'motion styles'. The motion style is a kind of the human skill, and it's unique to the motions' scenario, such as the different kinds of dances. On the synthesis step, users direct the key poses of human figures. The system generates the characteristic motions according to the user's directions and motion style database.

The problem arises in various applications in production planning and scheduling. We address several variants of the problem and discuss implementations of some of the proposed solutions. The objective is to compute a processing-and-delivery schedule so as to minimize the sum of delivery completion times. All the variants we consider are NP-hard. We experimentally evaluate the performance of some heuristics and show that the shortest processing time (SPT) heuristic consistently yields good schedules. We also briefly discuss results on scheduling with transportation in planar weighted subdivisions, that specifically address the computation of transportation times.",

The generalized formulation and symmetric property of the 6/spl times/6 Cartesian stiffness matrix are presented via the CCT theory in the presence of external loads. Examples of the serial manipulators are conducted to verify the conservative stiffness mapping.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planners have been successful in path planning of robots with many degrees of freedom, but narrow passages in a robot's configuration space create significant difficulty for PRM planners. This paper presents a hybrid sampling strategy in the PRM framework for finding paths through narrow passages. A key ingredient of the new strategy is the bridge test, which boosts the sampling density inside narrow passages. The bridge test relies on simple tests of local geometry and can be implemented efficiently in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The strengths of the bridge test and uniform sampling complement each other naturally and are combined to generate the final hybrid sampling strategy. Our planner was tested on point robots and articulated robots in planar workspaces. Preliminary experiments show that the hybrid sampling strategy enables relatively small roadmaps to reliably capture the connectivity of configuration spaces with difficult narrow passages.",

        "abstract": "Anti-Personal landmines are a significant barrier to economic and social development in a number of countries. Several sensors have been developed but each one will probably have to find, if it exists, a specific area of applicability, determined by technological as well as economical or even social factors, and possibly other sensors to work with using some form of sensor fusion. A significant issue concerns the safety of the deminer. For every 5000 mines removed, one deminer is killed. The design of an accurate sensor may reduce the amount of time needed to determine whether a landmine exists, but does not increase the safety of the deminer. Since the safety issues during the eradication process are of great concern, the use and integration of cheap and simple robots and sensors in humanitarian demining has been raised. This removes the deminer from close contact with mines. This paper is concerned mainly with the work that has been done in the area of robotics and landmine detection, the problems involved, the issues that have been overlooked and the future of robots in the field.",

        "abstract": "Natural Admittance Control (NAC) has been proposed as a means of implementing responsive force control that is both gentle and rapid while maintaining an end-effector admittance that is passive. Practical implementations, however, must deviate from the ideal NAC formulation, impacting the passivity of the manipulator. Issues arise particularly in the case where NAC is retrofitted to an existing industrial robot controller. Command input may be restricted to only position commands, and the servo algorithm may be fixed. Direct torque control is often not possible, precluding the use of torque feed-forward. Finally, the feedback sensors signals themselves often contain filters. Each of these three effects is examined and their effects on NAC implementations are identified by considering a simplified, continuous-time model of a typical NAC implementation.",

The possible paths are constrained by the limitations on the terrain and the capability of the vehicle. To deal with these constraints, the notions of forbidden point, forbidden direction, and forbidden path are introduced. After certain constants are specified, the method of dynamic programming is then invoked to find the optimal solution. If the target is beyond the maximal range of the vehicle, appropriate service stations are selected by using the auction algorithm. To speed up the computation process, the ideas of bi-spiral scheme and instant update are employed. With all the techniques at hand, numerical results show that the proposed method can generate the desired trajectory efficiently.",

Then, we derive a dynamics model of the mobile manipulator considering it as the combined system of the manipulator and the mobile platform. ZMP criterion is used as an index for the system stability. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with some constraints. To solve the problem, we use a hierarchical gradient method which synthesizes the gradient function in a hierarchical manner based on the order of priority.

        "abstract": "The forms of communication available now are categorized into the one or three dimensional. One dimensional communication includes metal wires and optical fibers in which the electro-magnetic field is confined in one dimensional medium. Wireless communication based on RF or optical connection emits electro-magnetic field in 3-D space. Now what if we have \"two-dimensional communication\" in which signals travels from one point to another point freely in elastic two-dimensional space using electromagnetic field confined in 2-D space? In this paper, we describe such a new technology of 2-D communication brings new paradigm to robotics. The methodologies of machine-design, system-integration, sensing, and computing will be drastically changed. We show architecture of the 2-D signal transmission based on relaying packets between communication chips on a thin sheet, the physical structure of the 2-D signal transmission, the protocols of the signal relay, and the results of the basic experiments.",

An extended state observer is designed for online estimation of the image Jacobian matrix that is regarded as the system's unmodeled dynamics. A nonlinear feedback control law is then adopted for the coordination controller. With this scheme, a universal calibration-free controller is developed, which is independent from specific tasks and system configuration, for uncalibrated hand-eye coordination. Simulations and experiments of 3-D robotic visual positioning and tracking tasks show the validity and feasibility of the proposed control scheme.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a moving target tracking system with estimation of the image Jacobian without knowledge of camera configuration or robot kinematics. We propose an efficient algorithm to track a moving target using a numerical method and apply this algorithm to a robot system. The robot system is controlled using the nonlinear least squares optimization technique. The Full Newton's method and the secant approximation method are used to calculate joint angles. In this paper, large residuals of joint values are calculated using the secant approximation method. The image Jacobian is then estimated using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. In addition, the velocity of the target influences the performance of the system because of the delay to process an image. Thus, we present a motion prediction algorithm for a moving target. The target position on the image plane is predicted using the autoregressive model (ARM). We then compare the performance of the small residual case with the performance of the large residual case using simulation. The experimental results show the improved performance using this prediction algorithm.",

Given the information of the playground, the robot can decide where to go autonomously by calculating its position and comparing it with the predetermined routine coordinate in the map.

The method works for a single eye-in-hand camera with unknown hand-eye transformation, viewing a stationary object with unknown position. The method uses dual quaternions to express the relationship between the camera and end-effector screws. It is shown how using the measured motion of the robot end-effector can improve the accuracy of the estimation, even if the relative position and orientation between sensor and actuator is completely unknown. The method is evaluated in simulations on images from a real-time 3D rendering system. The system is shown to be able to track the pose of rigid objects and changes in intrinsic camera parameters, using only rough initial values for the parameters. The method is finally validated in an experiment using real images from a camera mounted on an industrial robot.",

A suitably constructed navigation function represents the task, in the sense that for a completely actuated machine in the horizontal plane, the gradient dynamics guarantee convergence to the visually cued goal without ever losing sight of the beacons that define it. Since the horizontal plane behavior of RHex can be represented as a unicycle, feeding back the navigation function gradient avoids loss of beacons, but does not yield an asymptotically stable goal. We address new problems arising from the configuration of the beacons and present preliminary experimental results that illustrate the discrepancies between the idealized and physical robot actuation capabilities.",

In fact, we consider here complex objects like those one can encounter in the agrifood industry. A 3D reconstruction phase is first considered yielding to the parameters of the plane. This computation is based on the measurement of the 2D velocity in a region of interest and on the measurement of the camera velocity. Once the parameters of the plane are sufficiently stable, a visual servoing scheme is used to control the orientation of the camera with respect to the object and to ensure that it remains in the camera field of view for any desired orientation. This 3D reconstruction phase is maintained active during the servoing to improve the accuracy of the parameters and, consequently, to obtain a small positioning error. Finally, experimental results validate the proposed approach as well as for its effectiveness than for the obtained accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents kinematic analysis of a class of parallel manipulators, namely, Hexaslides, for machine tool applications. Hexaslides have constant-length legs. The inverse and direct kinematics solutions, to study the workspace properties of hexaslides are presented. Various kinematic performance indices, namely, workspace volume, workspace volume index, i.e. the ratio of workspace volume to machine size and global dexterity index of hexaslides having same foot print size are used to study different rail-arrangements. Secondly, effect of two important parameters related to configuration, i.e. gap between adjacent rails in case of hexaslide configuration and inclination of rails incase of slanted configuration, on the performance measures is presented.",
