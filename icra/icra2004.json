        "abstract": "For the design of active vibration control laws for flexible linkages in high-speed mechanisms, dynamic models incorporating the coupling of rigid body motion and flexible motion and the electromechanical coupling of transduction devices and the host linkage are very important. In the first part of this paper, the Lagrange finite element (FE) formulation is used to derive such a dynamic model for a flexible planar linkage with one rotary and two translational degrees of freedom. Linear electromechanical coupling of surface-bonded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patches with the host linkage is incorporated into the model. In the second part of this paper, this dynamic model is simplified and applied to simulate active vibration control of flexible linkages in a high-speed planar parallel platform based on kineto-elastodynamics assumptions: (1) the influence of flexible motion on rigid body motion is ignored; and (2) joint constraint forces in the flexible linkage case are close to those in the rigid linkage case. Based on these assumptions, the rigid body motion and joint constraint forces are regarded as inputs to flexible dynamics, which is obtained from rigid body simulation. Using the simplified dynamic model, simulation of strain rate feedback control using PZT sensors and actuators is performed. Experimental results are also presented. Both simulation and experimental results show that PZT actuators effectively damp the vibration of the flexible linkages.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel fuzzy logic control system is developed for reactive navigation of a behavior-based mobile robot in dynamic environments. A combination of multiple sensors is equipped to sense the obstacles near the robot, the target location and the current robot speed. A fuzzy logic system with 48 fuzzy rules is designed, which consists of three behaviors: target seeking, obstacle avoidance and barrier following. The \"symmetric indecision\" problem is resolved by several mandatory-turn rules, while the \"dead cycle\" problem is resolved by a state memory strategy. Under the control of the proposed fuzzy logic model, the mobile robot can preferably \"see\" the environment around, and avoid static and moving obstacles automatically. The robot can generate reasonable trajectories toward the target in various situations without suffering from the \"symmetric indecision\" and the \"dead cycle\" problems. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by simulation studies.",

What seems to be lacking, however, is excessive performance reduction in non-singular region and difficulty in performance tuning. In this paper, we develop a new method to solve kinematic and algorithmic singularities using task reconstruction approach. This new method drives the manipulator singularity-free path, and simultaneously guarantees task performance. And it can be easily extended singularity avoidance of multiple tasks case in task priority based method of redundant manipulators. The advantage and performance of the proposed method is validated by simulation works.",

The proposed genetic algorithm also features a unique and simple path representation and a simple but effective evaluation method. The knowledge based genetic algorithm is capable of finding an optimal or near-optimal robot path in both complex static and dynamic environments. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed genetic algorithm is demonstrated by simulation studies. The irreplaceable role of the specialized genetic operators in the proposed GA for solving robot path planning problem is demonstrated by a comparison study.",

The map building process is the cluster of several functions: sort of measures in subsets, model of these subsets, elaboration of a map, and updating it with previous measures. Furthermore this process must be quick and sufficiently robust to deliver in real time a safe map to the robot.",

The main idea of this paper is to combine existing standard technology (CMOS imaging sensors, FPGA \"glue logic\", and USB 2.0 interface) to use direct pixel access capabilities for real-time tracking. We designed and built such a prototype camera system, including FPGA programmed functionality for Fixed Pattern Noise (FPN) calibration, subsampling and direct subwindow access. The performance of this new camera is on one hand limited by the maximum pixel clock of the sensor, on the other hand by the USB 2.0 microframe timing and bandwith constraints. We achieve \"frame rates\" of up to 2.5 kHz for small subwindows which can be randomly and individually addressed for each update cycle. Besides all given technical details and specifications of the system, we show a demonstration application of a high-speed blob tracking system which verifies the usability of our new camera for highly demanding tracking applications.",

        "abstract": "Since Global Navigation Satellite systems are able to supply very accurate coordinates of a point (about 2 cm with a RTK GPS), such a sensor is very suitable to design vehicle guidance system. It is especially the case in agricultural tasks where a centimeter precision is often required (seeding, spraying,...). To answer to growing high precision agriculture principle demand, several control laws for automated vehicle guidance relying on this sensor have been developed. Such guidance systems are able to supply an acceptable steering accuracy as long as vehicle does not slide (path tracking on even ground with good adherence properties...), what alas inevitably occurs in agricultural tasks. Several principles are here presented to steer vehicle whatever properties of ground and path to be followed are. In this paper a new extended kinematic model with sliding accounted is presented which allows describing vehicle dynamics in all guidance conditions. Via this model a new nonlinear control law can be designed, which integrates sliding effects. Its capabilities are investigated through simulations and experimental tests.",

The fish-like microrobot is one of the micro and miniature devices, which is installed with sensing and actuating elements. This paper describes the new structure and motion mechanism of an underwater microrobot using ICPF actuator, and discusses the swimming possibility of the microrobot in water. Characteristic of the underwater microrobot is measured by changing the frequency and the amplitude of input voltage. The experimental results indicate that the swimming speed of proposed underwater micro robot can be controlled by changing the frequency of input voltage; the moving direction (upward or downward) can be controlled by changing the amplitude and the frequency of input voltage.",

By explicitly considering kinematic, model of the robot, the family of feasible trajectories and their corresponding steering controls are derived in a closed form. Then, a new collision avoidance condition is developed for the dynamically changing environment, it consists of a time criterion and a geometrical criterion, and it has explicit physical meanings in both the transformed space and the original working space. By imposing the avoidance condition, one can determine the corresponding steering angle for collision avoidance in a closed form. Such a path meets all boundary conditions, is continuous, and can be updated in real time once a change in the environment is detected. Simulations show that the proposed method is effective.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have great advantages for activities in deep sea, and expected as the attractive tool. However, AUVs have various problems which should be solved. In this paper, the self-organizing map (SOM) is applied as the clustering method for the navigation system. The SOM is known as one of the effective methods to extract the principle feature from many parameters and decrease the dimension of parameters. Through the competitive learning algorithms, the obtained map is tuned to express specific features of the input signals. We have been investigating the possibility of a navigation system based on SOM through simulations and experiments with an AUV called \"twin-burger\". The learning algorithm of usual SOM is unsupervised learning. However, supervised learning algorithms should be introduced because the relationship between distances information and desirable behavior of the robot, that is, the relationship from inputs to outputs should be acquired and learned. In this paper, a supervised learning algorithm is introduced into SOM and a method to adapt the local map to its environment by learning and evaluating the trajectory of robot is proposed. In the proposed method, the \"initial map\" is made static and digital vale as teaching data. In order to include more information of environment in the initial map, the trajectories of robot are evaluated, and the evaluation is utilized in the learning process. This method enables the map to have both the effect of dynamics of robot and environmental information. The efficiency of the method is investigated through the simulations and experiments.",

In rainy days, it is often the case that images taken by the camera are hard to see because of adherent waterdrops on the surface of the protecting glass of the camera. In our method, an image of a distant prospect is taken at first and another image is taken after changing the direction of eyeshot. The new image is transformed with the projective transformation and compared with the first one to detect the region where waterdrops may exist. We can distinguish which image portion belongs to waterdrops by considering the distance between two waterdrop candidate regions. Finally, the region where waterdrops exist can be eliminated to merge two images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a technological development of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking system motivated by science requirements. Twenty-seven case studies were drafted after having elaborate discussions with twelve senior marine scientists from a wide range of oceanographic fields including physical oceanography, ocean chemistry, midwater ecology, biological oceanography, molecular biology, marine microbiology, geology, evolutionary biology, and benthic ecology. These science cases spread over coastal ocean, deep-ocean, mid-ocean ridge, and polar regions. All of these science missions can be significantly benefited from new and improved sets of data and samples that will be collected by using a docked AUV. The case studies are organized to address the science issue, significance of the problem, required data and measurements to address the scientific importance, a non-docked method for acquiring data, and the benefit of using a docked AUV. More than twenty science instruments (in addition to navigational sensors) are identified and evaluated for these science missions. Science pay loads for the AUV and the docking system are discussed in detail. Functional requirements for a general purpose docking system are identified and pros and cons of various docking subsystems are explained. A fuzzy logic based solution approach for an autonomous docking system design and development is also proposed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Obstacle detection is a critical task in mobile robot navigation. To allow for rapid reactions to changes in the environment, it is required to complete its operation in short time intervals. That can be difficult if computing and/or sensing robot resources are limited. Therefore, it is important to design precisely what sensorial information would be needed to guarantee detection, and how it would be gathered to guarantee throughput. In this paper we present analysis and experiments related to the design of an obstacle detection system for a mobile robot with limited sensing capabilities. Objectives are to preserve safety while maintaining good motion performance. The design is made in two steps. Firstly, to find what is the minimum information needed to assure safety as a function of the sensors at hand, the robot capabilities and the intended motion control policy. Second, to manage the available sensors in order to provide the required information when needed. For the example studied, a justified solution has been defined which guarantees detection, robot safety, and good motion performance in real time. The solution has been tested with experiments that illustrate the effectivity achieved.",

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that a robot can learn to interact purposefully with its environment through a developmental acquisition of sensory-motor coordination. Teleoperation can bootstrap the process by enabling the robot to observe its own sensory responses to actions that lead to specific outcomes within an environment. This paper reports the results of learning to navigate an indoor environment by a simple mobile platform using only LIDAR and odometry. Descriptors of sensory-motor coordination in the form of LIDAR scan images coupled to concurrent motor activity are extracted from five teleoperated trials of driving the robot through the environment. From these a topological action map of the environment is constructed. A hierarchical discrete event dynamical system is defined wherein higher levels encompass increasing time intervals, longer sensory and motor histories, more complex behaviors, and higher degrees of abstraction. An event that cannot be handled at the current level precipitates a jump to the next higher level for processing. The sensory-motor associations learned and encoded in the action-map enable autonomous navigation while avoiding localization errors. Test results are given that demonstrate the robustness of autonomous navigation through the learned environment in the face of both stationary and moving obstacles.",

A mechanism for converting the blocking force of the PSA to a bending moment is studied and a model for the whole system consisting of a flexible beam and B A is obtained. The simulation results show that the suggested method may open new possibilities in active vibration control of large flexible manipulator.",

The proposed method is based on the model of trend surface, which is the regional feature of a surface for describing the global tendency of change. A new mathematical model is developed for predicting the unknown area of the object surface. A unique surface model is established by analyzing the surface curvature. Furthermore, a criterion is defined to determine the exploration direction. The algorithm is developed for determining the next view pose, which satisfies the placement constraints such as resolution, focus, and field of view.

        "abstract": "The passive dynamic walker described in this paper is a robot with a minimal number of degrees of freedom which is still capable of stable 3D dynamic walking. First, we present the reduced-order dynamic models used to tune the characteristics of the robot's passive gait. Our sagittal plane model is closely related to the compass gait model, but the steady state trajectory passively converges from a much larger range of initial conditions. We then experimentally quantify the stability of the mechanical device. Finally, we present an actuated version of the robot and some preliminary active control strategies. The control problem for the actuated version of the robot is interesting because although it is theoretically challenging (4 degrees of under-actuation), the mechanical design of the robot made it relatively easy to create controllers which allowed the robot to walk stably on flat terrain and even up a small slope.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic roadmap planners have proven to be effective in solving complex path planning problems. These planners sample the configuration space to compute a representation of its free space connectivity. One of the major difficulties for this approach is the planning of a path through narrow configuration space passages, since samples are placed inside narrow passages only with small probability. To address this problem, approaches have been devised that rely on the medial axis of the workspace to bias sampling in configuration space such that the probability of generating samples inside narrow passages is increased. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for computing an approximation to the medial axis, which can be computed more efficiently than the exact or discretized medial axis. We demonstrate that, compared to the true medial axis, this approximation is equally well suited to bias the sampling in probabilistic roadmap planners. Furthermore, we present a novel sampling strategy based on the approximated medial axis. This strategy results in high sampling density in narrow passages, while sampling open spaces sparsely. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the medial axis approximation and its application to motion planning based on the proposed sampling scheme.",

In order to increase the sensitivity of the sensorized microgripper, shape design and determination of sensor position are performed using finite element analysis. Micro EDM (electric discharge machine) and wire cutting technique are employed to fabricate the microgripper. Empirical model of the microgripper is achieved to analyze the performance and to control the position and gripping force. By using this identification model, both the perfect tracking controller (PTC) for the position control, and the adaptive zero-phase error tracking controller (ZPETC) for the force control are implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed model-based control method is verified by both simulation and experimental studies. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control method can be effectively applied to improve the motion tracking performance. Especially, in case of force control to grip and manipulate soft materials such as biomaterials and tissues, the proposed controller can be very useful to prevent the invasion of the target material by excessive force.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for identifying the static biomechanical parameters of all three upper extremity body segments. The experiment is based on coupling the human arm with an industrial robot which is then used for imposing a specified sagittal plane trajectory. Joint angles and forces in the contact point are collected during this process. An optimization based identification procedure was developed, which assumes the upper extremity model of a 3-degree of freedom (3DOF) rigid body planar structure in a closed kinematic chain configuration with the robot. The solution is based on fitting the joint torques calculated from contact forces to those predicted by the inverse dynamic model of the linkage. In order to verify the developed identification procedure the experiment was first performed on a 2DOF mechanical arm with dimensions similar to those of the actual arm. This mechanical model was designed using CAD software that provides an accurate assessment of all necessary dynamic parameters. A suitable low velocity trajectory was imposed into all joints, with very small angular deviations. The outcome of the identification is an estimate of masses and center of gravity (COG) coordinates for the lower arm and palm segments, their products for the upper arm and the passive moments around the measured angle of all joints in the sagittal plane. Finally, the results obtained for the human arm are compared to the literature estimates which are based on average population.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for the internal inspection of sewers through the use of sonar techniques, generating enhanced 3D graphs which represent the inner sewer surfaces. These graphs not only show the inner contour of the pipe but also integrate the intensity of the received echoes. The enhanced profile is generated by superimposing the peak intensity from the returning echoes at the calculated x, y and z coordinates where they are reflected from the pipe wall. These coordinates are calculated by measuring the time of flight of the first reflections, which are extracted from consecutives B-mode images generated during the ultrasonic scanning of the pipe. The proposed method has been capable of showing anomalous conditions, inside pipes filled with liquid, with dimensions smaller than the theoretical lateral and axial resolution of the transducer, in contrast to traditional methods where these kinds of defects were not detected. The proposed inspection method and its capabilities were validated through the realization of simulations and experiments. The simulations were conducted to validate the proposed method and explore its limitations. The proposed approach was particularly developed with the aim of scanning internal sections of sewers or water pipes filled with liquid using rotary ultrasonic sonars where visual methods could not be employed. It is expected that this research could also be expanded to the inspection of other submerged structures, such as water tanks, or pressurized vessels.",

This power source is capable of operation in environments with no oxygen, such as underwater and space. The design, unlike the internal combustion engine, produces power on demand, eliminating idling when there is no load on the system. Steam and oxygen are the only byproducts of this power supply. This monopropellant-powered free piston hydraulic pump (FPHP) was designed as a human scale (1.0 to 3.0 kW) power supply. The FPHP utilizes high concentration hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes into hot gas when exposed to a catalyst, as the monopropellant energy source. Energy is extracted from the hydrogen peroxide and transferred directly to hydraulic fluid by expanding the hot decomposition gas in an integrated piston/cylinder arrangement. Based upon a specific power and specific energy analysis using a Ragone plot, the performance of the FPHP potentially exceeds that of a battery based hydraulic power supply for short operation times.",

We have been developing the pneumatic humanoid type robot arm, which can be installed in any models of construction machine. In consideration of portability, the lightweight fiber knitted type pneumatic artificial rubber muscle (FARM) was adopted as the actuator. In this paper, we developed the static and dynamic characteristic models of the FARM taking the effect of elasticity of rubber and frictional force into consideration. Then we realized the remote control of the construction machine using the pneumatic robot that has 6 degree of freedom using the FARM. Moreover, we did some experiments on the remote control of the construction machine. Experimental results show that the developed system is available in remote control of a construction machine.",

The approach can be applied to achieve automated \"intervention when necessary\" to enforce system safety at interactive rates. Applications are shown to several low-dimensional systems, including steering control of a vehicle constrained to a given environment geometry.",

This human-based approach is prone to error because of the exorbitant amount of data to be assessed, and smaller anomalies or defects are likely to be overlooked reducing the chance of detection of faults at an early stage. Laser profilers for pipe inspection have been recently proposed to overcome CCTV problems. Positional as well as intensity information, related to potential defects, can be extracted from the laser-camera acquired images. While most of these systems are based on the geometrical analysis of pipes, here the intensity distribution of the reflected light is also exploited. This paper describes the strategies developed for the automation of defect classification in pipes and explores new methods to fuse intensity and positional information and shows how they can be used to improve multi-variable defect classification. A neural network-based classification method is presented. Experimental results are provided.",

The originality of our system is that it takes advantage of adhesion to grip micro-objects by using a single fingered gripper. This is in fact a tipless cantilever previously designed for atomic force microscopy applications. We describe vision techniques employed to process images provided by an optical microscope, allowing to position accurately the end-effector for a gripping task. A theoretical study of the direct force measurement device and an experimental validation show how we can improve the measurement of impact and contact forces. Then we explain the strategy used to bring the gripper into contact with the object, based on force control and kinematic redundancy.

        "abstract": "To enable a robotic assistant to autonomously reach for and transport objects while avoiding obstacles we have generalized the attractor dynamics approach established for vehicles to trajectory formation in robot arms. This approach is able to deal with the time-varying environments that occur when a human operator moves in a shared workspace. Stable fixed points (attractors) for the heading direction of the end-effector shift during movement and are being tracked by the system. This enables the attractor dynamics approach to avoid the spurious states that hamper potential field methods. Separating planning and control computationally, the approach is also simpler to implement. The stability properties of the movement plan make it possible to deal with fluctuating and imprecise sensory information. We implement this approach on a seven degree of freedom anthropomorphic arm reaching for objects on a working surface. We use an exact solution of the inverse kinematics, which enables us to steer the spatial position of the elbow clear of obstacles. The straight-line trajectories of the end-effector that emerge as long as the arm is far from obstacles make the movement goals of the robotic assistant predictable for the human operator, improving man-machine interaction.",

The ability to classify human behaviors in real-time is fundamental to the success of intelligent surveillance systems. The recognition of different human walking trajectory patterns is an important step towards the achievement of this goal. In this research, we utilize the approach of Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) in determining the similarity between different types of walking trajectories. In order to establish the position and speed boundaries required for the similarity measure, we compare the performance of a number of approaches, including fixed boundary values, variable boundary values, learning boundary by support vector regression, and learning boundary by cascade neural networks. The LCSS similarity approach is also compared with a similarity measure based on hidden Markov model. We found that the boundary establishing method based on learning by support vector regression gives the best results using real-life data during testing.",

(2000). The robot plans the next sensing action to maximally reduce the expected C-space entropy, also called the maximal expected entropy reduction, or MER criterion. The expected C-space entropy computation, however, made an idealized assumption. The sensor was assumed to measure exact data, i.e., it was not subject to noise. In this paper we extend this approach by using a real noisy sensor model. Sensing actions can then be compared on the basis of their uncertainty models. This offers the ability for using more than one principle sensor (multisensory exploration), because sensor readings can be weighted by evaluating the expected measurement quality. Additionally, it makes robot motion planning viable for tasks such as object surface inspection, which require the robot to come very close to the obstacles to achieve high sensing accuracy.",

Production environments often contain automated transport systems to move items between different work stations. We present a solution for modeling transport systems with respect to their interaction with all peripheries like robots and treatment machines. Modeling follows the process of mechanical assembly by putting together constructional components in 3-D space. Models of devices are of sufficient physical and electrical accuracy to test unmodified controller programs in a virtual commissioning phase to save time at the real start-up. In emulation, real controllers connect to the model to test and optimize control programs. In contrast to conventional discrete event simulation software, developers can play with the model during simulation to test its reaction and perform event of fault analysis. Simulation results are suited to secure design decisions of planners and reduce the risk of incorrect planning. Easy to recognize 3-D geometry and simulation interactivity qualify models for presentation and personnel training. Finally, simulation reveals suboptimal behavior and makes optimizations easier.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two different algorithms for object tracking and pose estimation. Both methods are based on an appearance model technique called Active Appearance Model (AAM). The key idea of the first method is to utilize two instances of the AAM to track landmark points in a stereo pair of images and perform 3D reconstruction of the landmarks followed by 3 D pose estimation. The second method, the AAM matching algorithm is an extension of the original AAM that incorporates the full 6 DOF pose parameters as part of the minimization parameters. This extension allows for the estimation of the 3D pose of any object, without any restriction on its geometry. We compare both algorithms with a previously developed algorithm using a geometric-based approach [14]. The results show that the accuracy in pose estimation of our new appearance-based methods is better than using the geometric-based approach. Moreover, since appearance-based methods do not require customized feature extractions, the new methods present a more flexible alternative, especially in situations where extracting features is not simple due to cluttered background, complex and irregular features, etc.",

The system consists of two sets of binocular cameras; a peripheral set for disparity based attention and a foveal one for higher level processes. Thus the conflicting requirements of a wide field of view and high resolution can be overcome. One important property of the system is that the step from task specification through object recognition to pose estimation is completely automatic, combining both appearance and geometric models. Experimental evaluation is performed in a realistic indoor environment with occlusions, clutter, changing lighting and background conditions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a compliant motion control system for a redundant manipulator, based on the model-based collision detection system[l] is proposed. First, we discuss the collision detection sensitivity of the model-based collision detection system and do a case study for a 7-DOF serial link manipulator to discuss the validity of the collision detection system. Then, we propose a compliant motion control system for the 7-DOF manipulator taking the result of the sensitivity analysis into account. The ann angle of the 7-DOF manipulator, which is a redundant degree of freedom of the manipulator, is controlled compliant to the external force applied by the collision and estimated by the colIision detection system. The proposed compliant motion control system is implemented in the 7-DOF manipulator and the experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an efficient algorithm to generate a set of local optimal paths between two given end points in cluttered environments or over open terrain. The local optimal paths are selected from the set of shortest constrained paths through every node (one for each path) in the graph, generated by running twice a \"single-source\" search. The initial set of the shortest constrained paths spans the entire search space and includes local optimal paths with costs equal or better than the longest constrained path in the set. The search for the optimal path is transformed to a search for the best path in each homotopy class generated by this search. The initial search is of complexity O(nlogn), and the pruning procedure is O(nmlogm), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of homotopy classes generated by this search. The algorithm is demonstrated for motion planning on rough terrain.",

        "abstract": "We present several biologically inspired concept designs and feasibility analyses for underwater swimming exoskeletons. These designs are biologically inspired, based on observations of dolphins, sea turtles, and penguins. Biologically inspired designs have the advantages of stealth, maneuverability, and a natural interface when compared to propeller driven underwater propulsion devices. We present a lower body concept, based on dolphin locomotion and an upper body concept based on sea turtle and penguin locomotion. The dolphin based concept has the advantages of using the wearer's most powerful muscle groups, of being the most natural to swim with, and of leaving the user's hands free for other tasks. The sea-turtle based concept has the advantage of novelty and may have appeal as a recreational device. We predict that with actuation and energy storage components available today, an exoskeleton that produces a cruising speed of over 1 m/s and a top speed of over 1.5 m/s is feasible. We estimate that cruising at 1 m/s can be achieved with less than 504 Watts power consumption, which translates into 2.4 kg of off-the-shelf silver-zinc batteries per hour of operation.",

This neuro-robotic interface has not yet been fully achieved because existing interface systems cannot establish sufficiently close contact between neurons and communicating electrodes. We present here the synthesis and testing of a new class of conductive polymer that can be used to coat metal electrodes and achieve the necessary close contact. The polymer coatings can be made to incorporate biological adhesion proteins to maximize biocompatibility. Neurons extracted from mouse and rat brains were able to attach to the coatings, survive beyond five days, and grow out long, communicating processes. These new polymer films offer the potential for a new level of communication between robotic devices and the nervous system and may eventually make a high-bandwidth interface a reality.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Successful construction of a humanoid largely depends on the performance of the actuators which are used at ankles, knees, and/or hip joints. For the reasons of control convenience and relative accuracy of position, DC servo-motors are widely used as the actuator of the humanoid. Most of the actuators for small humanoids are the RC-type DC servo-motors because it is convenience to use them with their relatively small size. However, since the RC-type motor does not have feedback information, we cannot control the position and the force accurately. Moreover, the motors are connected to the central processor of the humanoid with the star type peer-to-peer connection, which results in the complicated line connections. In this paper, we develop a modular type joint actuator which overcomes the shortcomings of the existing actuators for constructing humanoid robots. The proposed actuator is composed of DC motor, reduction gear, potentiometer, motor controller, and processor. And this actuator is characterized by modular structure, instruction based control, multi-drop networking, low backlash, and hybrid dynamic control using position and force feedback. Furthermore, the actuator has some intelligent functions like alarms for over-current and overheating, shutdown function, and batch motion function by installing the processor. Though the proposed actuator has been designed mainly for humanoid robots, it can be also applied to VR and haptic systems, medical equipment, control parts of the automobile, and main part of factory automation equipment, etc.",

        "abstract": "A mobile service robot can achieve reconfigurability by exploiting passive trailer systems. Reconfigurability provides significant practical advantages in order to deal with various service tasks. However, a motion control problem of a passive multiple trailer system is difficult, mainly because a kinematic model is highly nonlinear. It is shown how a robot with n passive trailers can be controlled in backward direction. Once a desired trajectory of a last trailer is computed, then the control input of a pushing robot is obtained by the proposed control scheme. A kinematic design of a trailer system is proposed in our prior work. It is shown that the high performance of trajectory tracking is also valid for the backward motion control problem. Experimental verifications were carried out with the PSR-2 (public service robot) with three passive trailers. Experimental result showed that the backward motion control could be successfully carried out using the proposed control scheme.",

In order to develop swimming robot like a real fish, extensive hydrodynamic analysis were made followed by the study of biology of the fishes especially its maneuverability and propel styles. Swimming mode is achieved by mimicking fish-swimming of carangiform. This is the swimming mode of the fast motion using its tail and peduncle for propulsion. In order to generate configurations of vortices that gives efficient propulsion, yawing and surging with a caudal fin is applied, and in order to submerge and maintain the body balance, pitching and heaving motion with a pair of pectoral fin is used. We have derived the equation of motion of PoTuna by two methods. In first method, we use the equation of motion of underwater vehicle with the potential flow theory for the power of propulsion. In second method, we apply the method of the equation of motion of UVM (underwater vehicle-manipulator). Then, we compared these results.",

Each section uses 6-8 opposing contracting and extending McKibben actuators to provide two-axis bending. The contracting/extending actuator pairs are sized and positioned to provide matched rotation and torque. The experimental manipulator generates large rotation (30 - 35 degrees per section and 50 degrees for the entire manipulator) and load capacity (25 lb vertical lift) at 60 psi. With a large strength to weight ratio, this manipulator also is highly flexible, simple to manufacture, and is cost-effective.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate issues in the discrete-time implementation of passivity based control of bilateral teleoperators. The usual scattering formalism which, in continuous time, guarantees passivity for any constant delay, is extended in several important ways to the discrete domain, in particular to the case where communication between the master and slave robots occurs over a packet-switched network. We first show that passivity can be maintained in the face of varying delay and packet loss but that it depends fundamentally on the mechanism used to handle missing packets. Passivity alone is not sufficient to guarantee good performance. Therefore, we also introduce a novel buffering and interpolation scheme which not only preserves passivity but has been shown through simulation and experiments to improve tracking performance and transparency in a single-degree-of-freedom teleoperator system.",

The kinematics of such mobile manipulators are represented by a pair of driftless control systems driven by platform and manipulator controls, and sharing an output function that describes positions and orientations of the end effector. The approach assumed in this paper is based on the concept of endogenous configuration defined as a pair of control functions of the platform, and of the aboard manipulator. For doubly nonholonomic mobile manipulators we define local performance measures and examine the inverse kinematic problem. Our results consist in a definition of the dexterity ellipsoid, a characterization of dextrous and isotropic endogenous configurations, and a derivation of a Jacobian pseudoinverse inverse kinematics algorithm. Computer simulations involving a 3 d.o.f. planar nonholonomic manipulator mounted on a kinematic car type platform illustrate our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to find energy-efficient motion plans for mobile robots. Motion planning has two goals: finding the routes and determining the velocities. We model the relationship of motors' speed and their power consumption with polynomials. The velocity of the robot is related to its wheels' velocities by performing a linear transformation. We compare the energy consumption of different routes at different velocities and consider the energy consumed for acceleration and turns. We use experiment-validated simulation to demonstrate up to 51% energy savings for searching an open area.",

An appropriate navigation algorithm can facilitate robots to map the environment within shorter time. A real-time navigation algorithm based on virtual centrifugal force is proposed in this paper for a robot to implement on-line exploration of an unknown environment in real time, and collision between a robot and an obstacle can be avoided with the VCF algorithm. The wall-following strategy is one of the special cases of the proposed algorithm when the robot approaches an obstacle. Simulation experiments are implemented to verify the effectivity of the proposed algorithm.",

The SNNs are inspired by biological neurons that communicate using pulses or spikes. As SNNs have shown to be excellent control systems for biological organisms, they have the potential to produce good control systems for autonomous robots. In this paper we present the use and benefits of SNNs for mobile robot control. We also present an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve the weights of the SNNs online using real robots. The adaptive GA using adaptive crossover and mutation converge in a small number of generations to solutions that allow the robots to complete the desired tasks. We have performed many experiments using real mobile robots to test the evolved SNNs in which the SNNs provided a good response.",

An example is given using a fully spatial redundant robot, the seven degree-of-freedom Mitsubishi PA-10. This article addresses the issue of finding a collision-free path such that a redundant robot can successfully move from a start to a goal position and/or orientation in the workspace despite any single locked-joint failure at any time. An algorithm is presented that searches for a continuous obstacle-free monotonic surface in the configuration space that guarantees the existence of a solution. The method discussed is based on the following assumptions: a robot is redundant relative to its task, only a single locked-joint failure occurs at any given time, the robot is capable of detecting a joint failure and immediately locks the failed joint, and the environment is static and known.",

In this paper, a prediction error based dead-zone residual function and nonlinear observers are used to detect and identify a class of actuator faults. Advantages of the proposed fault detection and identification methods are that they are based on the nonlinear dynamic model of a robot manipulator (and hence, can be extended to a number of general Euler Lagrange systems), they do not require acceleration measurements, and they are independent from the controller. A Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to prove that the developed fault observer converges to the actual fault.",

        "abstract": "In this paper an observer-based fault diagnosis (FD) approach for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), subject to actuator faults (i.e., faults affecting the propulsion system and/or the control surfaces), is proposed. A diagnostic observer is developed based on the available dynamic model of the AUV. Compensation of unknown dynamics, uncertainties and disturbances is achieved through the adoption of a class of neural interpolators (support vector machines, SVMs) trained off line. On the other hand, interpolation of unknown actuator faults is performed by adopting a radial basis function (RBF) network, whose weights are adaptively tuned on line. The effectiveness of the approach is tested in a simulation case study developed for the NPS AUV II (PHOENIX) vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot reliability must be guaranteed before they can be employed in hazardous domains like mine clearing or nuclear waste handling, but recent studies of robots used in urban search and rescue and military scenarios have shown a mean time between failures (MTBF) in the field of 6 to 20 hours. This paper extends previous work characterizing robot failures by including recent data and organizing failures according to a novel taxonomy , which includes human failures. Failure type and frequency data were collected from 15 robots representing three manufacturers and seven models over a period of three years, in a variety of environments. Standard manufacturing measures for product reliability were used. The results show that overall MTBF and availability have improved since the previous analysis but are still low. The MTBF across all robot types was 24 hours and availability was 54%. The control system was the most common source of failures (32%), followed by the mechanical platform. Statistical analysis shows that the time between failures, time to repair, and downtime vary widely. For this reason the means reported here are not reliable predictors for future failures, but still provide information on the overall frequency and consequences of mobile robot failures.",

        "abstract": "Cable-actuated manipulators possess a number of unique properties, which can have complex effects on their wrench-exertion and stability characteristics. Consequently, their useful workspaces are often unknown or irregularly shaped, so such robots are typically restricted to operate in unnecessarily small, conservatively estimated workspaces. To describe this \"useful\" workspace, this paper introduces the force-feasible workspace (FFW), defined as the set of end-effector poses for which static equilibrium is maintained and all of a set of required wrenches can be exerted on the environment. Next, this paper presents a means for analytically deriving this region for the case of a point-mass end-effector, which has been validated via numerical simulation. Characteristics and trends of the FFW are observed and analyzed, and correlations between robot design parameters and observed workspace properties are determined. The analysis presented here is a valuable tool for the design of cable robots with optimized workspace properties.",

Considerations of on-board power, bearing means, wireless communications, and systems integration are discussed in the paper.

In order to evaluate the efficiency of this method two different manipulators with different friction characteristics are examined. A 2-DOF manipulator used for high-speed, micro-meter precision manipulation and a 4-DOF macro manipulator used for long reach positioning task are examined. These manipulators are characterized, according to compensation task classifications (Armstrong, B. et al., 1994), as high-reversal-velocity and low-reversal-velocity tracking tasks, respectively. In each case a steady-state model of friction is experimentally obtained. This model is further utilized in dynamic equations of the friction force during manipulation. It is shown that despite the different nature of the two manipulators the same method can effectively improve the speed and performance of the manipulation in both cases.",

Based on a fuzzy multi-sensor data fusion scheme, a novel strategy for integrating task scheduling, sensing, planning and real-time execution is proposed so that task scheduling, action planning and motion control can be treated in a unified framework, and the design of task synchronization becomes much easier. A hybrid method is employed to create robot's gaits by switching the robot between continuous motion modes with the help of a finite state machine driven by the signals from robot sensors. For a highly non-linear system as the micro wall climbing robot, a fuzzy motion controller is designed to improve the robot's performance at different situations. Experimental results prove the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we define a class of graph grammars that can be used to model and direct distributed robotic assembly or formation forming processes. We focus on the problem of synthesizing a grammar so that it generates a given, prespecified assembly. In particular, to generate an acyclic graph we synthesize a binary grammar (rules involve at most two parts), and for a general graph we synthesize a ternary grammar (rules involve at most three parts). We then show a general result that implies that no binary grammar can generate a unique stable assembly. We conclude the paper with a discussion of how graph grammars can be used to direct the synthesis of parts floating in a fluid or for self-motive robotic parts.",

The designed control hardware can perform a real time control of the backpropagation learning algorithm of a neural network. The basic PID control algorithms are implemented in an FPGA chip and a neural network controller is implemented in a DSP board. By using high capacity of an FPGA, the additional hardware such as an encoder counter and a PWM generator can be implemented in a single FPGA device. As a result, the controller is very cost effective. In order to show the performance of the controller, it was tested for controlling nonlinear systems such as an inverted pendulum.",

        "abstract": "Real time estimation for soil-tool interaction is a key method for the development of an autonomous excavation strategy. This paper presents a method for identifying the unknown soil parameters in real-time using a novel hybrid soil model. The hybrid models consist of the Mohr-Coulomb soil model and the Chen and Liu Upper Bound soil model. A switching mode is utilized to select a more accurate soil model to compute the failure force depending on the position of the excavator bucket. The Newton Raphson method is proposed to identify the soil parameters by minimizing the error between the experimental forces and the forces computed by the hybrid soil model. The results demonstrate that the proposed estimation scheme is accurate when comparing to the measured soil parameters and the experimental data. In addition, the high speed estimation time shows that the proposed method has a real time estimation capability. A very high robustness is achieved when compared to the least square method. The proposed method is very promising and highly suitable for the soil-tool interaction identification of an autonomous excavator in an unpredictable, dynamical and potentially hazardous environment.",

So it is a prerequisite to have this distortion corrected. Typically, the correction uses a calibration pattern, which might be a chessboard, dot, grid, or circle pattern. Based on this pattern, enough characteristic samples can be extracted accurately and conveniently, and mathematic model can be built for the distortion in the captured image with respect to the original calibration pattern. Then the correction parameters, including image centers and mapping polynomials, could be found to realize the correction. If the model is too complicated to be accurately built, correction using neural network is a good choice, since it does not rely on the mathematic model of the distortion.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new index for dynamic performance analysis of serial link manipulators named impedance matching ellipsoid, or IME. Several indexes have been proposed for indicating static and dynamic performance of robot manipulators. For example, dynamic manipulability ellipsoid (DME) characterizes distributions of hand acceleration produced by normalized joint torque. manipulating-force ellipsoid (MFE) denotes static torque-force transmission efficiency from actuators at joints to a hand. On the other hand, the proposed IME characterizes dynamic torque-force transmission efficiency from actuators at joints to a load held at the hand of the manipulator. The IME includes a wide range of concepts proposed so far as measures of manipulator's performance. The DME and the MFE are both derived from the IME as limiting forms about the load mass. In this paper, we demonstrate the IME with some numerical examples including the selection of an optimal leg posture for jump robots, optimum active stiffness control, and an extension for manipulators mounted on satellites in outer space.",

        "abstract": "Although sampling-based planning algorithms have been extensively used to approximately solve motion planning problems with differential constraints, gaps usually appear in their solution trajectories due to various factors. Higher precision may be requested, but as we show in this paper, this dramatically increases the computational cost. In practice, this could mean that a solution would not be found in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we substantially improve the performance of an RRT-based algorithm by planning low precision solutions, and then refining their quality by employing a gap reduction technique that exploits group symmetries of the system to avoid costly numerical integrations. This technique also allows PRMs to be extended to problems with differential constraints, even when no high-quality steering method exists.",

In particular, teams involved in robot soccer RoboCup competitions have developed many different motions for kicking the ball. Designing effective motions and determining their effects is a challenging problem that is traditionally approached through a generate and test methodology. In this paper, we present a method we developed for learning the effects of kicking motions. Our procedure acquires models of the kicks in terms of key values that describe their effects on the ball's trajectory, namely the angle and the distance reached. The successful automated acquisition of the models of different kicks is then followed by the incorporation of these models into the behaviors to select the most promising kick in a given state of the world. Using the robot soccer domain, we demonstrate that a robot that takes into account the learned predicted effects of its actions performs significantly better than its counterpart.",

        "abstract": "The liveness of a closed AGV system is understood as the constant potential of each vehicle to attain any given zone in the guide path network. Based on the DES model of AGVS and the liveness condition proposed in our earlier work, we conduct a further analysis of the system behavior. The result is a general, algorithmically defined supervisor for AGVS, given in the form of the pseudo-code of a recursive parametric function. The parameter is a function that can implement various selection algorithms, and in combination with the general supervisor defines a class of particular, directly applicable supervisors of various permissiveness level. The correctness of the provided control is formally proved.",

        "abstract": "Topological and metrical methods for representing spatial knowledge have complementary strengths. We present a hybrid extension to the spatial semantic hierarchy that combines their strengths and avoids their weaknesses. Metrical SLAM methods are used to build local maps of small-scale space within the sensory horizon of the agent, while topological methods are used to represent the structure of large-scale space. We describe how a local perceptual map is analyzed to identify a local topology description and is abstracted to a topological place. The map building method creates a set of topological map hypotheses that are consistent with travel experience. The set of maps is guaranteed under reasonable assumptions to include the correct map. We demonstrate the method on a real environment with multiple nested large-scale loops.",

It is necessary to have a capability to move at even overturned and adapt simple mechanism to fabricate it easily with small size. In this paper, a novel bio-mimetic micro robot with simple mechanism using shape memory alloy (SMA) is introduced to generate earthworm-like locomotive motion. There have been many kinds of mobile micro robot using the SMA. However, these actuators generally require electric cable for power supply, which might have an adverse effect on the mobility of the micro robot The proposed micro robot system is composed of an actuator with SMA spring and silicone bellows, wireless control system, wireless power supply (battery) and body frames. The robot is also analyzed to customize required specifications. After the design and experiment, we find out that the micro robot can move a wireless free motion and be fabricated easily. Like an earthworm, the robot can travel on uneven, slippery and flexible environment.",

Zebrafish eggs at different developmental stages were collected and an integrated biomanipulation system was employed to measure cellular force during penetrating the egg envelope, the chorion. First, the biomanipulation system integrated with cellular force sensing instrument is implemented to measure the penetration force of the chorion envelope and then to characterize mechanical properties of zebrafish embryos. Second, the cellular force sensing of penetrating the chorion envelope at each developmental stages was experimentally performed. The results demonstrated that the biomanipulation system with force sensing capability can measure cellular force in real-time while the injection operation is undergoing. The magnitude of the measured cellular force decrease as an embryo develops. This result quantitatively describes the chorion softening in zebrafish embryos. Experimental results also demonstrate that subtle modification of the chorion, the extracellular matrix of the egg, can be monitored physically using the developed real-time force sensing system.",

For environmental modeling, we directly use the depth and color information in image pixels as visual features. Furthermore, only the depth and color information at horizontal centerline in image is used, where optical axis passes through. The usefulness of this method is that we can easily build a measure between modeling and sensing data only on the horizontal centerline. That is because vertical working volume between model and sensing data can be changed according to robot motion. Therefore, we can build a map about indoor environment as compact and efficient representation. Also, based on such nodes and sensing data, we suggest a method for estimating mobile robot positioning with random sampling stochastic algorithm. With basic real experiments, we show that the proposed method can be an effective visual navigation algorithm.",

It is well known in the actuation community that the power-to-weight ratios and the power-to-volume ratios of hydraulic actuators are, respectively, around 5 times and 10 to 20 times larger than comparable electric motors. Due to fundamental limitations in the magnetic flux density in the supporting structures and limitations in the heat transfer out of electric actuators, significant changes in these ratios are not likely in the near future [2]. Thermal limitations associated with electric motors do not apply to hydraulic actuators since the hydraulic fluid cools and lubricates the system. However, with all of these virtues, hydraulic actuators have serious practical implementation problems. Typically, servo-based hydraulic actuators are leaky and have generally poor energy efficiencies. This work addresses a new type of electric actuator that combines the best of both the electric and hydraulic mediums.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a development of a cleaner robot for vertical type air conditioning duct. The air conditioning duct is used for ventilation and air conditioning. After years use of the duct without cleaning, much dust is gathered inside the duct. That leads scattering the dust into rooms. This is not desirable in the view point of sanitation or health. Thus, periodic cleaning of the duct is requested. For the cleaning work, an air hose type cleaner robot is developed. An air nozzle is attached with the tip of the hose type robot. Compressed air blows off the dust from the air nozzle, then the dust inside the duct is collected by a dust collector with a filter. The part of nozzle is manipulated by wires' constraint using two DC motors. By watching TV monitor which shows inside of the duct, the cleaning work is done remotely using a control stick operation. To control the nozzle of the hose robot, the paper discusses a relation between position of nozzle (tip of hose robot) and wire length. Discussions on wire force for the position are also given. An experiment of the motion for the hose robot is presented, then theoretical solutions and experimental results are compared.",

The dynamics of the mobile manipulator is assumed to be unknown completely, and is learned on-line by the radial basis function network (RBFN) with weight adaptation rule derived from the Lyapunov function. Generally, a RBFN can be used to properly approximate a nonlinear function. However, there remains some approximation error inevitably in real application. An additional control input to suppress this kind of error source is also used. The proposed algorithm does not need a priori knowledge about the exact system dynamic parameters. Simulation results for a two-link manipulator on a differential-drive mobile platform are presented to show the effectiveness for uncertain system.",

Therefore we aim to realize an intelligent and robust motion for a dual-arm mobile manipulator. To carry out a research of intelligent motion, we set a concrete task as \"grasping a book and returning it to a bookshelf\". In this task, a path of an end-effector that grasps a book should be planned according to the book's position. A motion of returning a book also requires confirming return position and planning manipulator's motion. In this paper, we introduce our motion planning algorithm for a dual-arm mobile manipulator, and shows an example of integrated motion of \"tidying a room\" task.",

When changes are detected in the workspace, the validity state of affected edges and nodes of a precompiled roadmap are updated accordingly. We concentrate in this paper on analyzing the tradeoffs between maintaining dynamic roadmaps and applying an on-line bidirectional rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) planner alone, which requires no preprocessing or maintenance. We ground the analysis in several benchmarks in virtual environments with randomly moving obstacles. Different robotics structures are used, including a 17 degrees of freedom model of NASA's Robonaut humanoid. Our results show that dynamic roadmaps can be both faster and more capable for planning difficult motions than using on-line planning alone. In particular, we investigate its scalability to 3D workspaces and higher dimensional configurations spaces, as our main interest is the application of the method to interactive domains involving humanoids.",

The method presupposes an infrastructure of robots with feedback controllers obeying simple restriction on a planar grid. The automata formalism merely presents a high-level model of environment, robots and control, but allows composition and formal symbolic reasoning about coordinated solutions. Composition is achieved through synchronization, and the verification software UPPAAL is used for a symbolic verification against specification requirements formulated in computational tree logic (CTL). In this way, all feasible trajectories that satisfy specifications and which moves the robots from a set of initial positions to a set of desired goal positions may be algorithmically analyzed. The trajectories can then subsequently be used as a high-level motion plan for the robots. This paper reports on the timed automata framework, results of two verification experiments, promise of the approach, and gives a perspective for future research.",

In this paper, we focus on the segmentation of ladar data using local 3-D point statistics into three classes: clutter to capture grass and tree canopy, linear to capture thin objects like wires or tree branches, and finally surface to capture solid objects like ground terrain surface, rocks or tree trunks. We present the details of the method proposed, the modifications we made to implement it on-board an autonomous ground vehicle. Finally, we present results from field tests using this rover and results produced from different stationary laser sensors.",

The proposed algorithm incorporates a neural dynamics model derived from a biological membrane equation with the conventional full-state tracking control technique. It is capable of generating real-time smooth and continuous velocity control signals that drive the mobile robot to follow desired trajectories. The proposed approach resolves the speed jump problem existing in some previous tracking controllers. In addition, it can track both continuous and discrete paths. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed tracking controller were demonstrated by simulation and comparison results.",

        "abstract": "The neural-based control of a robotic hand has many clinical and engineering applications. Current approaches to this problem have been limited due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between neural signals and dynamic finger movements. Here, we present a technique to predict index finger joint angles from neural signals recorded from the associated muscles. The neural signals are converted to a torque estimate (EBTE) and then input to artificial neural networks. The networks predict the finger position more closely when the input to the networks are torque estimates rather than neural signals. Furthermore, the networks trained with the EBTE signals could predict the joint angles for different phases of finger movements (i.e. dynamic reaching and positioning task) while networks trained with the neural signals could not. Our results indicate that (1) similar finger movements are executed with different synergistic strategies and (2) different phases of finger movements employ different neural strategies. Through these results, we have demonstrated the first concrete technique to control a hand prosthetic device or dexterous tele-manipulator using natural neural control signals.",

This paper presents a controller, which includes three parts: a proportional-plus-derivative (PD) feedback controller, a friction compensator, and a disturbance observer. The friction compensator is based on LuGre model and it compensates for nonlinear friction. The disturbance observer is used to eliminate the friction compensation error and other external disturbances. Experimental results show that the controller gives high positioning accuracy and more robust performance in the presence of disturbances.",

For this general class of systems, we can construct (and check the existence of) bounded controls driving the system from initial to final regions of the state space. This can be used for tasks requiring repositioning or changing the velocity of the vehicle under constraints on both controls and state. We illustrate the procedure by solving the problem of changing the angular velocity of a parallelepiped aircraft under velocity and control constraints imposed by the task. The method should be seen as a \"maneuver\" procedure, allowing automatic generation of control laws for bringing the system in a desired region of its state space. If stabilization to a point is required, then locally stabilizing control laws can be used after the maneuver.",

In this algorithm, the fuzzy inference mechanism is extracted automatically from observed data without any human help, which thus eliminates the necessity of expert knowledge and a priori information on moving targets, as required by most traditional techniques. This algorithm does not require training, which enables it to work in a completely on-line fashion. Another important and distinct advantage of the algorithm exists in the fact that it is very fast and efficient in terms of computational cost and thus can be implemented in real time. In the mean time, the introduced algorithm has the ability to adapt quickly to the dynamics of moving targets. All these features make it especially suitable for the task to predict the trajectory of moving targets in robotic tracking. Simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies optimal control of multiple robot systems with frictional contact. The task is to move the robots into goal regions with specified velocities using external control forces. The robots have nonlinear dynamics, which may arise from the robot body dynamics, friction between robot and environment, and friction between robot and robot. Nonpenetration constraints between robots are imposed, and the robots are assumed rigid. The problem is modeled as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). The MPCC model is solved by using its elastic mode, which is a well-behaved nonlinear programming problem. Preliminary results with this approach are illustrated on example problems. The main contributions of this paper are a novel optimal control model that can deal with friction in the multiple robot system, and application of a new mathematical programming algorithm to solve the MPCC formulation. This optimal control model has potential applications in robot systems with friction, such as multifinger manipulation, manipulation with ropes, and multirobot pushing coordination.",

This paper presents a simple and complete algorithm for automatic and optimal fixture design on 3-D workpieces represented by discrete points. A new performance index is proposed to simultaneously address three fundamental requirements: form-closure constraint, minimum locating errors of the workpiece, and even load distribution among the fixturing points. To find the optimal future, the algorithm combines a local optimization procedure with a recursive problem decomposition strategv. The local optimization procedure searches for a solution in the direction of minimizing the performance index. When the performance index reaches a local minimum, the algorithm decomposes the discrete point set into subsets, and then carries out new rounds of local search in the subsets. The algorithm ends when a locally optimal solution is obtained. Compared to the exhaustive search, this algorithm is more efficient; and compared to other heuristic methods, the proposed algorithm is complete. The efficiency of this algorithm is demonstrated by numerical examples.",

For robot programming, automation, teleoperation and haptics, such environments enforce a trade-off between position and force control, which can be accommodated by impedance controllers. In this work, we extend the concept of duality and consider impedance matching in order to optimise a combined position and force trajectory error metric. The analysis of numerical optimisation results provides clear guidance on the choice of target impedance parameters, based on environment and manipulator dynamics.",

Two optimization criteria are considered, isotropy and fault tolerance. To meet the mission critical needs imposed by laser weapons applications, nine-strut isotropic GSPs that retain kinematic stability despite the loss of any three struts are found. First, we develop methods for generating a five parameter class of isotropic nine-strut GSPs. Next, new measures of fault tolerance are introduced and used to optimize the free parameter space. The optimized design is much more fault tolerant than the GSP currently baselined for the airborne laser.",

The dynamic balancing is formulated as an optimisation problem such that a sum-squared values of bearing forces, driving torques, shaking moment, and the deviation of the angular momentum from its mean value are minimized throughout an operation range of the manipulator, provided that a set of balancing constraints consisting of the shaking force balancing conditions, the sizes of some inertial and geometric parameters are satisfied. Sets of optimisation results corresponding to various combinations of the elements of the objective function are evaluated in order to quantify their influence on the resulting bearing forces, the driving torques, shaking moment and force. The results prove that the proposed optimisation approach can be used to minimize any desired combination of the forces, moments, and torques involved in any parallel mechanism by choosing a suitable set of weighting factors. The method is systematic, versatile and easy to implement for the optimum balancing of the parallel manipulator and more general parallel manipulators.",

Previous comparisons of optical flow methods have evaluated performance only in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency, and typically in isolation. These comparisons are inadequate for addressing applicability to continuous, real-time operation as part of a robot control loop. We emphasise the need for comparisons that consider the context of a system, and that are confirmed by in-system results. To this end, we give results for on and off-board trials of two biologically inspired behaviours: corridor centring and visual odometry. Our results show the best in-system performances are achieved using Lucas and Kanade's gradient-based method in combination with a recursive temporal filter. Results for traditionally used Gaussian filters indicate that long latencies significantly impede performance for real-time tasks in the control loop.",

        "abstract": "Instead of making decisions with fast but local dispatching functions, the increasing computing power and up-to-moment information provisioning have made possible real-time vehicle scheduling in an automated material handling environment in 300mm semiconductor manufacturing. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work to adopt the scheduling approach to solve the 300mm vehicle transportation problems. We adopt Petri nets to model the coupling dynamics among transport jobs and OHT vehicles in an intrabay loop. The congestion phenomenon among OHT vehicles is captured. The OHT scheduling problem is then formulated into an integer programming problem whose goal is to efficiently allocate OHT vehicles to jobs such that average job delivery time is minimized. A solution methodology that combines Lagrangian relaxation and the surrogate subgradient methods [13] is developed. To reduce computational efforts in solving each subproblem optimally, an approximation method is developed to solve for subproblems. A heuristic algorithm is developed to adjust the dual solution to a feasible schedule. Numerical results demonstrate that our solution methodology can generate good schedules within a reasonable amount of computation time for realistic problems. Compared to a popular vehicle dispatching rule, our approach can achieve 25.6% improvements on the average delivery time in our realistic test cases.",

        "abstract": "In traditional trajectory planning it is usually assumed that the mean path of an ensemble of open-loop trajectories is the same as would be obtained if no noise were present. However, even zero-mean noise tends to cause the mean trajectory to deviate from the nominal one. This paper introduces a stochastic model-based motion planning method to compensate for this bias. An implementation for nonholonomic mobile robots based on the kinematic cart model is provided. The examples show that the proposed method takes full advantage of the results of existing optimal trajectory planning methods, and makes the resulting mean trajectory conform to the pre-selected nominal trajectory. As a result, the average amount of online trajectory correction required of a controller is minimized.",

These challenges are dealt with through closed-looped integration of video from multiple cameras and manipulator joint angle measurements, along with moving edge detection and model-based feature tracking. A powerful technique based on a Lie group and its associated Lie algebra is employed for pose estimation. Eflectiveness of the proposed techniques is illustrated by good test results for data acquired in the laboratory.",

It follows the general Bayesian active sensor network approach introduced in [2] where each decision maker plans locally based on an equivalent representation of the target state probability density function (PDF). This paper focuses on the prediction stage of the decentralized Bayesian filter. It looks at how different types of realistic external constraints may affect the target motion and how they may be taken into account in the process model. Two general classes of constraints are identified soft and hard. A few constraint examples from each class are given to illustrate their impact on the evolution of the target state PDF. Multiple constraints of various types can be combined to increase the accuracy of the predicted PDF estimate, thus affecting the individual trajectories of the search platforms. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated for a team of airborne search vehicles looking for a drifting target lost in a storm at sea.",

A proper characterization of sensor performance, however, allows either removing the resulting noise from the image or accounting for it within image processing algorithms. This paper proposes new methods for estimating the distribution parameters of two of such sources of noise: dark current and the so-called fixed pattern noise. Since both methods require knowledge about the scene illumination, an estimation method using a calibrating sphere is also presented. This method models illumination as the combination of directional and ambient lighting. Experimental results can be found at the end of the paper.",

A particularity of this method is that it can avoid reconstructing the entire scene without limiting the displacements possible. To achieve this, an image base of the environment is used to describe the navigation space. We extract from this base a sequence of overlapping images which define the zone that the robot must traverse, in order to reach the desired position. Motions are computed on-line using only points of interest extracted from these images. A method based on potential field theory has been adapted in order to ensure a sufficient visibility of these features during the entire motion of the robot. Experimental results obtained on a six degrees of freedom robotic system are presented and confirm the validity of our approach.",

        "abstract": "We address two key goals pertaining to autonomous mobile robots: one, to develop fast accurate sensory capabilities - at present, the localization of sound sources - and second, the integration of such sensory modules with other robot functions, especially its motor control and navigation. A primary motivation for this work was to devise effective means to guide robotic navigation in environments with acoustic sources. We designed and built a biomimetic sound-source localization apparatus. In contrast to the popular use of time-of-arrival differences in free field microphone arrays, our system is based on the principles observed in nature, where directional acoustic sensing evolved to rely on diffraction about the head with only two ears. In this paper we present an integrated robot phonotaxis system which utilizes the robot's movement to resolve frontback localization ambiguity. Our system achieves high angular localization acuity (/spl plusmn/ 2/spl deg/) and it was successfully tested in localizing a single broadband source and moving towards it within a cluttered laboratory environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new hybrid motion planning technique based on harmonic functions (HF) and probabilistic roadmaps (PRM). The proposed harmonic function based probabilistic roadmap (HFPRM) method comprises three phases: in phase one, the Laplace's equation, pertinent to potential flow, in an environment cluttered with obstacles is solved. In phase two, a probabilistic roadmap with a novel sampling scheme is constructed based on information obtained about the environment topology through the HF technique developed in phase one. The roadmap is then searched for the shortest path in phase three. Simulation results presented in this paper show that the combination of the HF and the PRM works better than each individual in terms of finding a collision free path in environments where narrow passages exist. The proposed HFPRM method can be extended to sensor-based motion planning problem in environments not known a priori.",

        "abstract": "We describe a practical method for computing the statically stable postures of a planar mechanism in a two-dimensional gravitational field. Our method lumps the complex kinematic structure of the mechanism into a rigid body B having a variable center of mass, while inertial forces generated by moving parts of the mechanism are lumped into a neighborhood of disturbance wrenches centered at the nominal gravitational wrench. Given this reduction, the statically stable postures of the mechanism correspond to center-of-mass locations of B that guarantee static stability for the neighborhood of wrenches. However, the response of B to an applied wrench involves dynamic ambiguity associated with different reaction modes at the contacts. Hence we compute only those center-of-mass locations where B maintains a non-ambiguous equilibrium for the entire neighborhood of wrenches. These center-of-mass locations are called the robust stability region of the posture. Focusing on two-contact postures, we compute the robust stability region as an arrangement of planar cells. Finally, we sketch an application of the results to robust locomotion planning of a 3-legged mechanism.",

Complementary filters provide a means of fusing information from sensors with different characteristics in order to produce a more reliable estimate of the desired variable. Here, the range and bearing of landmarks observed by the vision system are fused with odometry information and a vehicle model, providing a more reliable estimate of these states. We also present a method of combining a compass sensor with odometry and a vehicle model to improve the heading estimate.",

However, reliable and efficient tele-micromanipulation systems with haptic feedback over the Internet face strong problems due to the nonlinear nature of the microenvironment and time-varying delays in communication lines. Towards this end, this paper presents a robust bilateral controller design using H/sub /spl infin//-optimal control and /spl mu/-synthesis frameworks. This approach allows a convenient means to tradeoff the optimization of various performance criteria (micro scale force/position) and robustness for a prespecified time-delay margin and force scaling factors.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A new approach to the design and control of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators is presented. SMA wires are divided into many segments and their thermal states are controlled individually in a binary manner. The Peltier effect is used for heating and cooling individual segments of the SMA. Unlike the traditional way of controlling the wire length by driving a current to the entire SMA wire, the new method controls the binary state (hot or cold) state of each segment. The total displacement is then proportional to the number of the segments having the heated state, i.e. austenite phase. This architecture has three salient features, which would overcome fundamental difficulties of SMA. 1) Although the inherent property of SMA is highly nonlinear and uncertain with a prominent hysteresis, the binary state/phase control does not depend on the complexity of SMA state transition. 2) With use of the Peltier effect thermoelectric devices the response of SMA becomes more controllable, stable, and more accurate compared to the traditional air cooling and electric wire heating. 3) By operating at the heated state, SMA shows considerable load disturbance rejection compared to traditional methods. First, the basic principle and architecture of the segmented SMA actuator system are described. Initial implementation and feasibility tests are then presented, followed by discussion of the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Actuation ability introduces a fundamentally new design dimension in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks, allowing the network to adaptively reconfigure and repair itself in response to unpredictable run-time dynamics. One of the key network resources in these systems is energy and several uncontrollable factors lead to situations where a certain segment of the network becomes energy constrained before the remaining network. The performance gets limited due to the constrained sections. We argue that in this scenario, instead of rendering the complete network useless, the remaining energy resources should be reorganized to form a new functional topology in the network. We present methods for the network to be aware of its own integrity and use actuation to improve performance when needed. This capability of the system is referred to as \"self aware actuation\". In this paper, we consider a network where nodes (or a subset of the nodes) have traction ability. The network uses mobility to repair the coverage loss in the area being monitored by it. We present a completely distributed energy aware algorithm (referred to as CO-Fi) for coordinated coverage fidelity maintenance in sensor networks. The energy overheads of mobility are incorporated in the algorithm, thus leaving no hidden costs. Our preliminary analysis shows that CO-Fi can significantly help improve the usable lifetime of these networks.",

Defective bore surfaces lead to increased friction and abrasion, leakage, and reduced stability. Therefore, industry demands ever higher quality of components' bore surfaces. Today industrial automation is limited to high part volumes. Current systems miss a high flexibility or are mainly driven by human interaction and control. Therefore the main target of this work is to develop an automatic system for rapid and flexible 100% surface inspection of bores with diameters from 4 to 50 mm. Further a method for the detection and localization of bores on arbitrary metallic objects has to be developed as well as the image processing for the inspection with a vision system has to be done. The main focus is on easy operating of the system achieved with rapid programming for the user. The paper describes the system, in overview and detail, and shows the promising results of the experiments and a public long-term demonstration (4 days) during an industrial fair.",

The software planning tool described here generates sensor placements automatically for use in assessing deviations in construction environments. The first step is to separate construction information goals into clusters, simplifying the planning space in order to reduce computational complexity. For each cluster, the planner generates the space of potential sensor placements for a set of information goals and selects a minimal set of subspaces to take advantage of views that can achieve multiple goals simultaneously. Sensing locations are chosen that maximize the probability of achieving each goal and a path is generated to minimize the transit cost between the various sensing locations within each cluster. Finally, paths are generated that minimize the transit cost between clusters. This method is demonstrated on a desktop computer and shown to support LIDAR information goal sensor planning within a construction site.",

It consists of two small fingers for grasping, an actuator which changes its shape upon heating by Joule effect and a parallel elastic structure to provide a pullback force on cooling as well as to guide the finger movement. All the elements are laser-cut from the same Ni-Ti-Cu sheet but have different mechanical properties and are used for different functions. Using local laser annealing, a local shape memory effect is introduced on the actuator while leaving other areas in a cold-worked state, i.e. no shape memory effect occurs. The material has nonlinear mechanics and the actuator undergoes large deflections. A numerical method is introduced to compute the nonlinear dynamics of the coupled system formed by the actuator and pullback spring. The predicted deflection and force are in good agreement with the measured ones, and this model can be used to optimize the design.",

        "abstract": "Tracked vehicles can offer the best solution for operation over complex terrains, including difficult surfaces. Tracked configuration is often required to guarantee the best mobility for unrestricted, all-weather tactical operations. A safe and reliable motion requires the vehicle to maintain stable contact with the terrain while avoiding slippage. This becomes critical when traveling over complex surfaces, especially steep and slippery slopes. This paper deals with the problem of how to maintain a stable motion of a multi tracked vehicle traveling over steep slopes. Changes in the vehicle's internal configuration adjust the center of gravity to guarantee a stable motion. The paper analyzes the acceptable positions for the center of gravity given the slope's inclination, and the friction between the vehicle and the surface. Geometric solution for a two dimensional model is first presented, followed by the linear programming solution of a 3D model. Experimental results, as well as a field test conducted on our multi-tracked autonomous vehicle verify the theoretical analysis and provide constraints for stable motion given the vehicle and terrain geometry and friction between the vehicle's tracks and the surface.",

Through the analysis of the reverse net, we obtain not only the weakly forbidden markings used to deal with uncontrollable transitions but also the maximally permissive state feedback control policy. Moreover, it is illustrated by an example in the reported literature that the method can be applied conveniently to a class of Petri nets whose uncontrollable subnets are Output Dominant Petri nets.",

The end-effector of the manipulator can produce 3-DOF spherical motion, 3-DOF translation, 3-DOF hybrid motion, or complete 6-DOF spatial motion depending on the types of the actuation (rotary or linear) chosen for the actuators. The manipulator architecture decouples translation and rotation of the end-effector for individual control. The structure synthesis of SA-PM is achieved using the line geometry. A Lego model of the SA-PM is built for the constructibility and preliminary study. Singularity analysis of the SA-PM based on geometry is presented for all actuation schemes to facilitate the kinematic design of the manipulator. Because of the decoupled motion, the SA-PM has a great potential for high precision motion alignment and assembly, especially in micro- or nano-motion stage design.",

        "abstract": "The snake-like robots of the 'Genbu' series (Genbu 1,2,3) consist of multiple modules, equipped with active wheels, connected to each other by passive joints. These robots are categorized as Active-Wheel Passive-Joint articulated mobile robots (AW-PJ type). AW-PJ type robots have high-speed mobility and high-durability on rough terrain in spite of several problems, such as stuck condition, due to the passive joints. These are good proper-ties for fire-fighting robots or planetary rovers. Genbu 3, developed in this study, could climb a 280mm vertical wall whereas the diameter of the wheel is 250mm. This paper de-scribes automatic stuck detection algorithm and stuck avoidance methods. Para-skid steering is also described. Results of experiments with Genbu 3 are presented and discussed in order to verify these methods.",

        "abstract": "A reconfigurable modular snake robot has been developed, which can not only move on a plane but aIso achieve some f-dimensional motions while reconfigured. Control equations of 3-dimensional locomotion were established by the composition of two bending motions in mutual orthogonal plane. Three types of lateral rolling locomotion, flapping, linear rolling and curved rolling, were achieved by controlling the amplitudes and the number of two waves in the two bending motions. Using the three types of locomotion the snake robot can realize net lateral translation, alternation of its contact base and rolling over some obstacles. The lateral rolling locomotion obtains its driving force through the interaction with the environment. The rolling shape and its direction depend on the transferring direction and phase difference of the two waves respectively.",

We investigate the advantages and feasibility of controlling a motor using very fast (MHz) switching using digital components in place of traditional amplifiers. A switching controller combines the current and encoder (position) feedback paths into a single loop, and a model based observer estimates the unsensed motor velocity. When compared to second order controllers built with traditional amplifiers, the proposed design promises increased performance, better efficiency, and unproved velocity estimation. Advances in semiconductor technology facilitate the implementation of these fast switches and the required logic using relatively standard components. Preliminary experiments verify good behavior of a DC motor driven up to 5 MHz.",

        "abstract": "Efficient calculation of the inverse dynamics of robotic mechanisms serves as a basis for a variety of control schemes. Classical algorithms for rigid multibody systems do not apply when more realistic modeling is required. The computational treatment of the emerging non-linear equations augmented by drivetrain dynamics and elasticity imposes various challenges on the algorithmic solutions. This paper presents a method for recursive calculation of the inverse dynamics of real-world robots considering elasticity and gyroscopic effects introduced by the drivetrains. A study of the equations of motion elucidates the demand for analytical derivatives of the dynamics up to a maximum order depending on the number of joints. This problem is solved for the first time by means of higher-order time derivatives of spatial operators proposed by the spatial operator algebra.",

The method is based on the randomized incremental generation of a data structure called sensor-based random tree (SRT), which represents a roadmap of the explored area with an associated safe region. Different exploration strategies may be obtained by instantiating the general method with different perception techniques. Two such techniques are discussed: the first, conservative and particularly suited to noisy sensors, results in an exploration strategy called SRT-Ball. The second perception technique is more confident, and the corresponding strategy is called SRT-Star. The two strategies are critically compared by simulations as well as by experiments on the MagellanPro robot.",

The contributions of this work include: (1) the design, analysis, and characterization of a miniature mode conversion rotary ultrasonic motor based on a piezoelectric stack transducer; this produced a static torque density of 0.37 Nm/kg, (2) a millimeter scale linear piezometer, constructed with a parallel arrangement of annular stressed unimorph piezoelectric transducers and passive latches, exhibited 0.23 N of blocked force, and (3) simulation data is presented that compares these motor concepts to commercial systems in the context of scalability. Results suggest that smaller versions of the rotary ultrasonic motor would possess a static torque density seven times that of a commercial 3-mm electromagnetic system. This technology shows promise for driving the platform.",

        "abstract": "Navigation technology is considered that enables an underwater vehicle to compute its trajectory in real-time by utilizing range measurements from a single known location. This concept is especially attractive for small underwater vehicles where more traditional navigation technology is prohibitive due to volume constraints. By assessing local observability of the underwater vehicle and available measurements about potential vehicle trajectories, we explicitly characterize those trajectories that can be asymptotically estimated. It is shown that all but a small class of trajectories can be estimated.",

Such a robot with passive wheels has quite different mechanism in locomotion from that of other locomotion systems. We have developed a snakelike robot for rescue applications. The unit composing the snakelike robot of Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA) is a module including actuating system and control system. To let the snakelike robot perform turning motion and compensate offset and orientation errors of the robot, we propose an amplitude modulation method and a phase modulation method based on analysis of the serpenoid curve. The side motion of the snakelike robot can also be generated by the amplitude modulation. The tracking control method is also proposed based on sensor information. Computer simulations and experimental tests are performed to show the validity of the proposed methods.",

The hand is based on the modular assembly of articulated fingers that adopt an original configuration of their structure, made with rigid links connected by elastic hinges that are coaxially crossed by flexible tendons. This innovative design is suitable to host distributed sensory equipment and continuous compliant cover, allowing a high level of anthropomorphism together with great structural simplification, reliability enhancement and cost reduction. Furthermore, the proposed solution is very flexible, as it can be adapted to many different hand configurations and is not dependent on a particular type of actuation, being compatible with future availability of any kind of artificial muscles.",

Automated numerical methods that can assess and record performance provide an incentive for users to participate and a means to evaluate individual and group performance. In this paper we describe \"unsupervised scoring\": a numerical approach to assessment based on clustering and response time. Like unsupervised learning, this approach is based on identifying regularities in the input rather than comparing input with desired output specified by an external supervisor. We present an algorithm for rapidly computing user scores that scales linearly with the number of users. We describe an implemented Java-based user interface incorporating this metric, an application based on the classic Twister game, and results where individual scores are compared with group performance.",

This is exactly our proposal with the current work. The main goal is to produce maps of the \"Maracajau\" Coral Reef located at Northeast of Brazil that can be used by researchers and managers to study and evaluate the actual conditions of the ecosystem face its intensive use. We use small format aerial photographs (SFAP) taken from a small aircraft. Analogical and digital methods are employed to analyze and interpret the images.",

        "abstract": "There are a number of sensor possibilities for mobile robots. Unfortunately many of these are relatively expensive (e.g., laser scanners) or only provide sparse information (e.g., sonar rings). As an alternative, vision-based navigation is very attractive because cameras are cheap these days and computer power is plentiful. The trick is to figure out how to get valuable information out of at least some fraction of the copious pixel stream. In this paper we demonstrate how environmental landmarks can be visually extracted and tracked in order to estimate the rotation of a mobile robot. This method is superior to odometry (wheel turn counting) because it would work with a wide range of environments and robot configurations. In particular, we have applied this method to a very simple motorized base in order to get it to drive in straight lines. As expected, this works far better than ballistic control. We present quantitative results of several experiments to bolster this conclusion.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a technique that uses conductive fibers as part of a wearable sensor for continuous monitoring of joint movements. Conductive fibers are incorporated into flexible fabrics that fit tightly around a joint, and resistance changes in the fibers caused by skin extension can be measured, and related to joint motion. An overview of the sensor design, including functional requirements and design parameters, are presented, as well as preliminary results from a prototype sensor design. A single-axis joint model is also presented to illustrate the implementation of an extended Kalman filter to estimate joint angle. The Kalman filter also estimates parameters associated with misalignment errors that may be created every time the subject takes off and puts on the wearable sensor, allowing a sensor to be calibrated only once, with no need for re-calibration for all future uses.",

        "abstract": "Navigating in rough terrain is a complex task that requires the robot to be considered as a holistic system. Algorithms, which don't consider the physical dimensions and capabilities of the mobile robot lead to inefficient motion and suffer from a lack of robustness. A physical model of the robot is necessary for trajectory control. In this paper, quasi-static modeling of a six-wheeled robot with a passive suspension mechanism is presented together with a method for selecting the optimal torques considering the system constraints: maximal and minimal torques, positive normal forces. The aim of this method is to limit wheel slip and to improve climbing capabilities. The modeling and the optimization are applied to the shrimp rover.",

This set is used as a framework for understanding and computing wrench-feasibility of a pose of the robot, allowing wrench-feasibility to be tested in the task space. The geometric properties of the available net wrench set are then exploited to permit simple geometric calculation of the boundaries of the wrench-feasible workspace. This workspace generation is extended to two other workspaces as well. Other design tools, including payload specification and failure analysis, are also presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a control method of vehicle cooperative behavior in an intersection and junction without infrastructures such as a signal system, a road-vehicle communication system, and so on. The vehicle cooperative behavior enables vehicles to pass through an intersection one by one or to interflow at junction one by one without vehicle collision like a weaving and zipping manner. These behaviors are achieved by generating a special-temporal pattern of a reaction diffusion system, where a mutual communication between vehicles is realized only by TVC device. The mutual communication between vehicles can be expressed in the diffusion system of a certain morphogen so that only simple broadcasting communication could be enough for vehicle communication. Van der Pol model is used as one of the reaction diffusion system. Finally, the proposed algorithm for vehicle cooperative behavior is experimentally verified using actual autonomous mobile robots.",
