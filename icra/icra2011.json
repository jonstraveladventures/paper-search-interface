        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a concept for the real-time target tracking of vibrating objects to extract vibration image regions using digital filters at all the pixels in an image, assuming that periodic changes in image intensities exist at pixels around vibrating objects. By combining vibration-based processing with color extraction as a masking process, our algorithm can prevent the latency effect on a digital filter, which may degrade its tracking performance. Digital filters at a pixel level are implemented on a 1000-fps vision system that can measure vibration distribution over a wide range of frequencies. On our target tracking system, we can track a vibrating object at the center of the camera view by controlling a 2-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) active vision system with vibration-based image features. We have verified its effectiveness by presenting several experimental results using objects vibrating at high frequencies, which cannot be observed with the naked eye.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on how to control the robot end-effector to track an object, meanwhile, to approach it with a suitable posture for grasping. We named it \"Approaching Visual Servoing\". A proposed hand & eye-vergence dual control system is used to perform Approaching Visual Servoing, aiming at quick eye-tracking and stable hand servoing and approaching. This idea stems from hammerhead shark whose eyes turn to gaze at the target prey to be suited to triangulation, enhancing the ability to measure precisely the distance to the prey for catching it. This animal's visual tracking includes motion con trol by visual servoing and triangular eye vergence. Moreover, a 3-D pose tracking method that combines \"1-Step GA (genetic algorithm)\" and hand-motion feedforword compensation is proposed. Our approach differs from known tracking methods using optimization based on Taylor expansion, for it allows the proposed method not to be annoyed by how to sneak out of local minima. A convergence in time domain whether the 3-D pose tracking error decrease to zero in a successively input images by video rate , is discussed and verified through Lyapunov method. Both Lyapunouv-stable pose tracking and Approaching Visual Servoing are confirmed by experiments using a 7-link manipulator installed with two mobile cameras.",

In order to mitigate the difficulties of using a graphical model for modeling the contextual relationships among the 3-D points, we instead propose a multi-stage inference procedure to capture these relationships. More specifically, we train this procedure to use point cloud statistics and learn relational information (e.g., tree-trunks are below vegetation) over fine (point-wise) and coarse (region-wise) scales. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, that were obtained from different sensors, and demonstrate improved performance.",

Instead of using multiple laser spots to thermally control the motion of multiple robot actuators, the paper proposes to shape the power, frequency, and duty cycle of a single laser beam focused onto the whole body of the robot. It is shown through simulations that an appropriate selection of laser parameters along with a corresponding mechanical design can generate appropriate \u201cstick and slip\u201d motions resulting in 3-DOF (planar) operation for the microrobot with nonholonomic constraints. Based on the simulation results, we anticipate that the microrobot with a thickness of a few micrometers and a width of several hundred micrometers can achieve speeds in excess of a few mm/second, comparable with more conventional electrostatically and electromagnetically actuated microrobots. Initial experiments on chevron actuators confirm that pulsed laser can effectively drive stick-slip microrobots.",

However, the freeform features of logs, few reliable textural features, large edge extraction errors, and segmentation faults caused by the barks on the surface of the logs present clear challenges for recognition and classification. To solve these problems, robust algorithms able to recognize and estimate poses of a variety of objects even under poor and partial inputs need to be developed. In this paper we focus on the most relevant task of recognizing and estimating postures of a bunch of logs located on the ground with varying orientation and distance. Experiments carried out with the help of a structured light camera demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Supervision of long-lasting extensive botanic experiments is a promising robotic application that some recent technological advances have made feasible. Plant modelling for this application has strong demands, particularly in what concerns 3D information gathering and speed. This paper shows that Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras achieve a good compromise between both demands, providing a suitable complement to color vision. A new method is proposed to segment plant images into their composite surface patches by combining hierarchical color segmentation with quadratic surface fitting using ToF depth data. Experimentation shows that the interpolated depth maps derived from the obtained surfaces fit well the original scenes. Moreover, candidate leaves to be approached by a measuring instrument are ranked, and then robot-mounted cameras move closer to them to validate their suitability to being sampled. Some ambiguities arising from leaves overlap or occlusions are cleared up in this way. The work is a proof-of-concept that dense color data combined with sparse depth as provided by a ToF camera yields a good enough 3D approximation for automated plant measuring at the high throughput imposed by the application.",

This work presents automatic on-line 3D object model acquisition assuming a robot to manipulate the object. Objects are represented with piecewise planar surfaces in a spatio-temporal graph. Planes once detected as homographies are tracked and serve as priors in subsequent images. After reconstruction of the planes the 3D motion is analyzed and initial object hypotheses are created. In case planes start moving independently a split event is triggered, the spatio-temporal object graph is traced back and visible planes as well as occluded planes are assigned to the most probable split object. The novelty of this framework is to formalize Multi-body Structure-and-Motion (MSaM), that is, to segment interest point tracks into different rigid objects and compute the multiple-view geometry of each object, with Minimal Description Length (MDL) based on model selection of planes in an incremental manner. Thus, object models are built from planes, which directly can be used for robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a low-cost automated system that is able to apply a 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) force on a human fingertip with high precision. It is designed to be used as a calibration platform for the previous proposed fingernail imaging system, and as a haptic system. The system is composed of two Novint Falcon devices linked by two universal joints and a rigid bar to provide 5-DOF motion and force, with feedback from a 6-DOF force sensor. A force controller is designed with an inner position control to meet the calibration goal and requirement. Experiment result and analysis showed that the system was capable of controlling the force with a settling time of less than 0.25 seconds. Two force trajectories are designed for fast and sufficient calibrations. A calibration experiments demonstrated that the system tracked the trajectories with an interval of 0.3 seconds, and step sizes of 0.1 N and 1 N\u00b7mm with root-mean-squared errors of 0.02 \u2013 0.04 N for forces and 0.39 N\u00b7mm for torque.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Image-based 6-DoF pose estimation of arbitrarily shaped 3D objects based on their shape is a rarely studied problem. Most existing image-based methods for pose estimation either exploit textural information in form of local features or, if shape-based, rely on the extraction of straight line segments or other primitives. Straight-forward extensions of 2D approaches are potentially more general, but in practice assume a limited range of possible view angles. The general problem is that a 3D object can potentially produce completely different 2D projections depending on its relative pose to the observing camera. One way to reduce the solution space is to exploit temporal information, i.e. perform tracking. Again, existing model-based tracking approaches rely on relatively simple object geometries. In this paper, we propose a particle filter based tracking approach that can deal with arbitrary shapes and arbitrary or even no texture, i.e. it offers a general solution to the rigid object tracking problem. As our approach can deal with occlusions, it is in particular of interest in the context of goal-directed imitation learning involving the observation of object manipulations. Results of simulation experiments as well as real-world experiments with different object types prove the practical applicability of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Pose estimation is an important capability for mobile agents. A wide variety of solutions have been proposed, but work in the literature has focused primarily on solutions for robots whose mobility is restricted to the ground plane. In this work we present a framework for 6DOF pose estimation. Normally the increased computational cost associated with this higher dimensional space makes pose estimation intractable. The approach presented here addresses the computational issues associated with the higher dimensional problem by decoupling orientation estimation from position estimation. Assuming that orientation can be estimated separately from position allows efficient methods to be used for the (unimodal) orientation estimate, while more sophisticated methods are used for the position estimate. Although similar to Rao-Blackwellization, the approach is essentially reversed. Results on real and simulated datasets and a comparison with a naive 6DOF filter are presented.",

In order to achieve the given motion, the mathematic models of the proposed manipulator with the RFTA are derived. As a prototype of an earthquake simulator, two experiments are performed. The experimental results demonstrate that the RFTA is able to supply the required double driving force and appropriate used as an actuator of a low frequency earthquake simulator. The results of the fault-tolerant experiment show the earthquake simulator with the RFTA is capable of tolerating some local faults.

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges for service robots during operation lies in the handling of unavoidable uncertainties which originate from model and sensor inaccuracies and which are characteristic for realistic application scenarios. Robustness under real world conditions can only be achieved when the dominant uncertainties are explicitly represented and purposefully managed by the robot's control system. We therefore adopt a probabilistic approach in which perception is regarded as a sequential estimation process and follow a Bayesian filtering methodology. Under these assumptions probabilistic models of the robot's perception systems are key. In this paper we shortly describe a model based object recognition and localization system. However, we do not not focus on the 6D pose estimation procedure itself, but on the method to quantify and compute the uncertainty associated with it. We construct a Gaussian approximation of the resulting pose error using the implicit function theorem. It is then used as a proposal density for importance sampling. Our goal is to sample from the measurement model describing 6D object localization based on local features in a Bayesian filtering context.",

We propose a two-level 3D data structure that allows pipelined and streaming processing of the 3D data as it arrives from a moving robot: (i) at the coarse level, the incoming 3D scans are stored in memory in a dense 3D voxel grid with a relatively large voxel size - this ensures buffering of the most recent data and the availability of sufficient 3D measurements within a specific processing volume at the next level; (ii) at the fine level, we employ a data chunking mechanism guided by the movement of the robot and a rolling dense 3D voxel grid for processing the data in the immediate vicinity of the robot, which enables reuse of previously computed features. The architecture proposed requires a very small memory footprint, minimal data copying, and allows a fast spatial access for 3D data, even at the finest resolutions. We illustrate the proposed streaming architecture on a real-time 3D structure characterization task for detecting doors and stairs in indoor environments and show qualitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a new control approach to regulation tasks for robots with elastic joints in the presence of gravity. The control law combines a term that cancels the gravity effects on the robot link dynamics with a PD-type error feedback on the motor variables. The first control component follows from the feedback equivalence principle when imposing to the link variables the same dynamic behavior as if gravity were absent. The PD component can then be designed in a rather straightforward way. Global asymptotic stability is shown via Lyapunov analysis, without the need of strictly positive lower bounds neither on the proportional control gain nor on the structural joint stiffness. The control approach is also extended to the case of robot joints with nonlinear stiffness.",

States of the system are captured in a model based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). States representing the human operator are motivated by behaviours from the psychology of the human action cycle. Hierarchical nature of these states allows the exploitation of data structures based on algebraic decision diagrams (ADD) to efficiently solve the resulting POMDP. The proposed framework is illustrated using two examples from assistive robotics; a robotic wheel chair and an intelligent walking device. Experimental results from trials conducted in an office environment with the wheelchair is used to demonstrate the proposed technique.",

The Tracking Fluoroscope System (TFS) is intended to be an orthopedic diagnostic tool that provides more accurate and detailed in vivo pre-operative and post-operative information for surgeons. This is accomplished through the ability to fluoroscope natural and uninterrupted human joint motion during level walking, step climbing, and ramp walking. This overall functionality requires independent tracking of the position and orientation of the body with respect to the robotic platform, as well as the position of the joints with respect to the body. The overall robotic system, embodied in the TFS, necessary to accurately perform real-time imaging of joints in motion is discussed. Recent subject and joint tracking experimental results are presented.",

The algorithm is implemented on a robotic eye, which includes a stiff camera cable, similar to the optic nerve, which adds a complicated non-linear stiffness to the plant. For high speed movement, our \"pulse-step\" controller operates open-loop using an internal model of the eye plant learned from past measurements. We show that the controller approaches the performance seen in the human eye, producing fast movements with little overshoot. Interestingly, the controller reproduces the main sequence relationship observed in animal eye movements.",

We show how these features can be ideally combined in the framework of sampling-based footstep planning. We apply our approach to the robot HRP-2 and are able to quickly produce smooth and dynamically stable trajectories that are solutions to a difficult problem of footstep planning.",

This problem is NP-hard, and therefore we seek good enough, but not optimal solutions. By modeling the problem as a Boolean Control Network, we can efficiently keep track of which regions are cleared, and which are not, while the input nodes of the network are used to represent the motion of the pursuers. The environment is partitioned into a set of convex regions, where each region correspond to a set of nodes in the network. The method is implemented in ANSI C, and efficiently solves complex environments containing multiple loops and requiring so-called recontamination. The provided examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in terms of computational time.",

In this paper, a 5 degree-of-freedom cable-driven upper arm exoskeleton, with control of force, is proposed. In this design, attachment points of cables on the arm are adjustable. The attachment points are optimized to achieve large workspace to perform activities of daily living.

The system consists of two independent 3-DOF Cartesian nanomanipulators based on piezo motors and piezo actuators. High-resolution optical encoders are integrated into the nanomanipulators to provide position feedback for closed-loop control. A look-then-move control system and a contact detection algorithm are implemented for horizontal and vertical nanopositioning.

Following these trends, this work presents the development of a new actuation system with embodied characteristics such as passive compliance and variable physical damping. Compared to the other existing compliant linear or rotary actuators the proposed CompAct unit has the ability to regulate the oscillations induced by the introduction of the compliance by means of a variable physical damping actuator (VPDA) unit. Apart from facilitating the control the VPDA unit can assist in managing the energy transfer from/to the compliant module. The mechatronics, model and control scheme of the CompAct are analysed. The overall system is evaluated with experimental trials performed using a prototype unit. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of regulating the impedance components (stiffness and damping) within a wide range and with good fidelity.",

        "abstract": "The space of all possible paths through a finite-dimensional configuration space is infinite-dimensional. Nevertheless, paths taken by \u201creal\u201d robotic systems often cluster on a finite-dimensional manifold that is embedded in this infinite-dimensional space and that is governed by a principle of optimality. We take advantage of this property to enable a human user to efficiently specify a desired path for a robot moving through a planar workspace with polygonal obstacles using a sequence of noisy binary inputs, as might be derived from a brain-machine interface. First, we show that the space of all such paths having length that is bounded and locally minimal is homeomorphic to the unit disk. Second, we note that any path mapped to the interior of this disk is a subset of some other path mapped to its boundary. Third, we provide an optimal communication protocol by which the user can, with vanishing error probability, select a point on this boundary. Finally, we validate our approach in preliminary experiments with human subjects.",

        "abstract": "A highly maneuverable, compact vehicle for underwater precision inspection of complex structures is presented. The vehicle will have no appendages such as rudders, screws, and other external thrusters, which might get tangled and interfere with the underwater structure in a cluttered environment. A multi-axis, integrated thruster mechanism using Coanda-effect high-speed valves for switching the direction of jets can be encapsulated in a compact, egg-shaped body. Compared to traditional screw thrusters, these valves have improved dynamic performance in switching the jet stream direction. Furthermore, the reaction forces and moments due to switching can be substantially reduced. First, the principle of Coandaeffect water jet valves is introduced, and its governing equations are obtained. Optimal dimensions and parameters producing a maximum of thrust are obtained, and are experimentally verified. Multiple Coanda-effect valves are then integrated into a tree structure to create a multi-axis thrust mechanism. A simple planar proof of concept prototype is built and tested.",

While prior work in underactuated robotic hands has primarily focused on the mechanism's ability to curl its distal degrees of freedom inward even after the proximal degrees of freedom are constrained by contact with the environment, this paper explores the mechanism's adaptability in terms of both motion and force-application capabilities in the presence of external constraints. Specifically, using four different transmissions for a novel singly-actuated linear three degree-of-freedom mechanism, this paper analyzes how the system's ability to reconfigure joints and apply new contact forces varies as a function of the transmission configuration and object geometry. We show that with more extensive re routing of a single actuator to multiple joints, the mechanism exhibits greater motion and force adaptability at the cost of decreased maximum joint travel and contact forces.",

The scenario we are considering consists of several autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), transporting packages from an input location to one of several destinations, through an unstructured warehouse environment. The AGVs are equipped with wheel encoders, laser range finders and RFID tag readers. Each package has a RFID tag encoding its destination. A map of the warehouse is provided a priori. We have developed a layered control architecture that enables fully autonomous system operation. Starting with a map of the environment, the control system generates feasible paths, assigns tasks to the vehicles and schedules task execution. At the lowest layer, waypoint tracking controllers enable task execution. The proposed architecture has been successfully tested in a simulated scenario at the IEEE Virtual Manufacturing Automation Competition (VMAC), using the USARSim simulator.",

Here we develop the first model of contact dynamics defined in both the forward and inverse directions. The contact impulse is the solution to a convex optimization problem: minimize kinetic energy in contact space subject to non-penetration and friction-cone constraints. We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization. We implemented the proposed contact solver in our new physics engine (MuJoCo). A full Newton step of trajectory optimization for a 3D walking gait takes only 160 msec, on a 12-core PC.",

We also use the decoupling between the dynamics of individual agents to assume transition independence and use this assumption to reduce the complexity of the problem.

Despite the recent development of several VIA, impedance control is not yet implemented in closed loop because of the difficulty of obtaining in real-time measurements of time-varying impedance. The estimation algorithm is proposed as an alternative approach to the standard procedures of impedance identification, to robustly tolerate the variability of the mechanical stiffness due, for example, to model uncertainties. The impedance estimator is therefore implemented on the Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS). The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is proved through simulation and experimental results.",

The game is adversarial, with multiple, potentially competing, objectives. This interplay between different factors makes the problem complex, even in the case of only two players. To make analysis tractable, previous approaches often make various limiting assumptions upon player actions. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing and solving a two-player capture-the-flag game as a zero-sum differential game. Our problem formulation allows each player to make decisions rationally based upon the current player positions, assuming only an upper bound on the movement speeds. Using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, we compute winning regions for each player as subsets of the joint configuration space and derive the corresponding winning strategies. Simulation results are presented along with implications of the work as a tool for automation-aided decision-making for humans and mixed human-robot teams.",

        "abstract": "According to Sensorimotor Contingency Theory (SCT), visual awareness in humans emerges from the specific properties of the relation between the actions an agent performs on an object and the resulting changes in sensory stimulation. The main consequence of this approach is that perception is based not only on information coming from the sensory system, but requires knowledge about the actions that caused this input. For the development of autonomous artificial agents the conclusion is that consideration of the actions, that cause changes in sensory measurements, could result in a more human-like performance in object recognition and manipulation than ever more sophisticated analyses of the sensory signal in isolation, an approach that has not been fully explored yet. We present the first results of a modeling study elucidating computational mechanisms implied by adopting SCT for robot control, and demonstrate the concept in two artificial agents. The model is given in abstract, probabilistic terms that lead to straightforward implementations on a computer, but also allow for a neurophysiological grounding. After demonstrating the emergence of object-following behavior in a computer simulation of the model, we present results on object perception in a real robot controlled by the model. We show how the model accounts for aspects of the robot's embodiment, and discuss the role of memory, behavior, and value systems with respect to SCT as a cognitive control architecture.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to account for distributed friction in needle insertion in soft tissue. As is well known, friction is a complex nonlinear phenomenon, and it appears that classical or static models are unable to capture some of the observations in systems subject to significant frictional effects. To characterize dynamic features when the needle is very flexible and friction plays an important role in bending mechanics or when a stop-and-start planning scenario is implemented at low insertion velocities, a distributed LuGre model can be adopted. Experimental results using an artificial phantom illustrate that the proposed method is capable of representing the main features of friction which is a major force component in needle-tissue interaction during percutaneous interventions.",

The common feature of the studied manipulators is that the rotation axes of the actuated arms coincide. This feature makes it possible to rotate the whole arm system an infinite number of revolutions around the center of the manipulator. The result is a large workspace in relation to the footprint. Both 2- and 3-DOF variants are presented and the suitability of this family of manipulators for kinematic analysis is demonstrated. Thus, different methods to find optimal manipulability with respect to platform positioning and rotation have been analyzed.",

Analyzing the resulting formulation we propose a closed-form approach to tackle the problem, which is proved to retrieve a first-order approximation of the actual nonlinear solution, under mild assumptions on the structure of the involved covariance matrices. The outcome of the analysis reveals several desirable properties of the proposed approach: no initial guess for optimization is needed and the technique is able to correctly estimate robot posterior also in presence of arbitrarily long loops. The approach is further validated by means of extensive simulations and real tests, and the consistency of the estimation process is also evaluated. We remark that this work is not intended to extend the already crowded literature on SLAM but is aimed at providing a consistent analytical insight, useful for efficiently attacking several open research issues, like active SLAM and exploration, for which the computational cost of simulating SLAM posterior still constitutes a troublesome bottleneck.",

In order to perform complex tasks, robots require a suitable internal representation of the task. We propose a hybrid framework for representing manipulation tasks, which combines continuous motion planning and discrete task-level planning. In addition, we use a mid-level planner to optimize individual actions according to the plan. The proposed framework incorporates biologically-inspired concepts, such as affordances and motor primitives, in order to efficiently plan for manipulation tasks. The final framework is modular, can generalize well to different situations, and is straightforward to expand. Our demonstrations also show how the use of affordances and mid-level planning can lead to improved performance.",

Treebot's body is a novel continuum maneuver structure that has high degrees of freedom and superior extension ability. Treebot also equips with a pair of omni-directional tree grippers that enable Treebot to adhere on a wide variety of trees with a wide range of gripping curvature. By combining these two novel designs, Treebot is able to reach many places on trees including branches. Treebot can maneuver on a complex tree environment, but only five actuators are used in the mechanism. As a result, Treebot can keep in compact size and lightweight. Although Treebot weighs only 600 grams, it has payload capability of 1.75 kg which is nearly three times of its own weight. On top of that, the special design of the gripper permits zero energy consumption in static gripping. Numerous experiments have been conducted on real trees. Experimental results reveal that Treebot has excellent climbing performance on a wide variety of trees.",

        "abstract": "We extend the classic control problem of the inverted pendulum by placing the pendulum on top of a quadrotor aerial vehicle. Both static and dynamic equilibria of the system are investigated to find nominal states of the system at standstill and on circular trajectories. Control laws are designed around these nominal trajectories. A yaw-independent description of quadrotor dynamics is introduced, using a \u2018Virtual Body Frame\u2019. This allows for the time-invariant description of curved trajectories. The balancing performance of the controller is demonstrated in the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena testbed. Development potential for the future is highlighted, with a focus on applying learning methodology to increase performance by eliminating systematic errors that were seen in experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, robust preoperative planning of RAMICS is formulated. The intent of the proposed planning framework is to improve surgical outcomes by contemplating the intraoperative conditions of the surgical procedure and the geometry of the patient's thoracic anatomy. This includes improvements in target reachability, instrument dexterity for critical surgical tasks, surgical task feasibility and visibility. Given the patient's preoperative computed tomography images of the chest, the planning framework aims to determine the optimal location of the access ports on the ribcage, along with the optimal pose of the robotic arms relative to the patient's anatomy. To minimize susceptibility of the results to intraoperative geometric uncertainty, the planning is formulated as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Program (GSIP) with a convex lower level problem and a multi-criteria objective function. By solving the GSIP, tolerable geometric uncertainty within the task space is increased by eliminating the likelihood of collisions and joint limit violation in a neighborhood of the surgical target.",

Designed with a simple five-linkage and one-piston mechanism, the robot has kinematics similar to a gecko's motion. Due to bionic design of gecko, the robot has an advantage of climbing fast on flat surfaces with any slope angles, even overhanging surfaces. Applied with fluid driven and fluidic vacuuming, the robot can carry twice extra weight as its bodyweight on vertical climbing. As a result of motor-less design, the robot owns a unique benefit to get almost all power from the pressure of fluid working medium like water, compressed air, oil and etc., regardless of little energy supplied by internal batteries for low-power control circuit and solenoid valves. Especially for home application, the robot can get power from the pressure of tap water to finish a high-rise glass window cleaning by water-washing. This robot has potential applications to cleaning, fire fighting, painting, and repairing.",

        "abstract": "Robotic missions require to implement various functionalities in order to link reactive functions at actuators and sensors level to deliberative functions like vision, supervision and planning at decisional level. All these functionalities must be versatile and generic enough to interact differently according to the missions while minimizing recoding effort. Moreover, deliberative functions like automated planning consume lots of memory and CPU time and usually complete in time incompatible with robotic missions' durations. Thus, we present a new generic and anytime planning concept for modular robotic architectures, which manages multiple planning requests at a time, solved in background, while allowing for reactive execution of planned actions at the same time. Different planners based on various formalisms and data structures can be plugged to the planning component without changing its behavior nor its code, facilitating reusability and validation of the component. We highlight the versatility of our concept on different use cases; then we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in terms of mission duration and success, compared with traditional plan-then-execute approaches; we finally present a search and rescue mission by an autonomous rotorcraft solved with our paradigm, that cannot be tackled by traditional approaches.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Excellence in manufacturing systems has been recognized as one of the main factors behind the success of industrial companies or production companies. New technology for manufacturing processes plays a significant role in this process. Achieving the potential of technological innovations in production, however, requires a wide range of management, as well as engineering issues related to the system. Material handling is a key component in reaching flexibility, manufacturing, dynamism and agility goals. The handling capacity of advanced materials is essential because without this ability of providing the material needed for the proper workstation at the right time and in the right amount, the whole plant will become \"bogged down\". This makes it less efficient and thus produces less profit and / or it operates at higher costs. This paper proposes a heuristic dispatching Automation Guided Vehicle (AGV) based on multiple attributes and fuzzy logic. Typically, theMaterial handling description of the rule base corresponds to all the possibilities of the connection between the input and output. The manual setting up of the rule base for a determined set of variables is not feasible when considering the efficiency the rules can offer in terms of performance during the inference process. It is also important to note that even for an expert in the field, the task of considering the quantitative value of the correct contribution where each rule affects the system becomes a difficult task. Taking this into account, this paper uses an approach to reduce the rules to a method of hierarchical fuzzy rules. As a means of evaluation, the proposed method is applied to a model based on fuzzy rules developed and used in AGV dispatching of a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS).",

        "abstract": "If we are to one day rely on robots as assistive devices they should be capable of mitigating the impact of random disturbances and avoid falling. Humans are surprisingly apt at remaining on their feet when pushed; they rely on reflexes such as bending the ankles and/or the hips, or by taking a step if the magnitude of the disturbance is relatively large. This paper presents a fall avoidance scheme that is capable of applying both ankle and hip strategies on a humanoid robot. While both strategies serve the same purpose, the hip strategy can absorb larger disturbances but has a higher energy overhead and should be avoided when it is not necessary. Our system is capable of detecting at the onset of a disturbance if an ankle or hip strategy is more appropriate. The decision is taken based on a \u201cdecision surface\u201d that is delimited by threshold values of the robot's state variables. The control is based on the intuitive Virtual Model Control (VMC) approach. The system is tested on a simulated robot developed under Gazebo. Results show successful fall avoidance with an ability to choose the optimum fall avoidance strategy",

With its advanced sensing capabilities and the potential for mass adoption, this technology represents an opportunity to dramatically increase robotic object recognition, manipulation, navigation, and interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical multi-view object dataset collected using an RGB-D camera. The dataset contains 300 objects organized into 51 categories and has been made publicly available to the research community so as to enable rapid progress based on this promising technology.

In this paper, we present the design of a novel learning-based control architecture that enables the robot to act as a social motivator by providing assistance, encouragement and celebration during the course of an activity. A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approach is used to provide the robot with the ability to: (i) learn appropriate assistive behaviors based on the structure of the activity and (ii) personalize the interaction based on the person's affective state during the activity. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed learning-based control architecture is effective in determining the optimal assistive behaviors of the robot during a memory game interaction.",

        "abstract": "We present the design of a new low-cost series-elastic robotic arm. The arm is unique in that it achieves reasonable performance for the envisioned tasks (backlash-free, sub-3mm repeatability, moves at 1.5m/s, 2kg payload) but with a significantly lower parts cost than comparable manipulators. The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth. The arm is used to demonstrate pancake cooking (pouring batter, flipping pancakes), using the intrinsic compliance of the arm to aid in interaction with objects.",

A task function to compress the conventional task space to a new one with lower dimensions increases the redundancy degree so that the original manipulator becomes a redundant one, such that we can apply redundant control laws to achieve online subtasks, such as obstacle avoidance without trajectory replanning. The four basic properties of the task function method which are necessary to ensure the good performance of the PTP control problem are presented. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the presented method.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic principles have proved successful for untethered submillimeter microrobotics, although challenges still exist in areas of propulsion and control. This paper presents the design, analysis, and performance results for a bimorph thin film magnetic microrobot utilizing the magnetostrictive principle as a secondary oscillating operation mode. The microrobot is no larger than 580 \u03bcm in its planar dimension and its total thickness is less than 5 \u03bcm. As a robot with magnetic material, it can be operated in a pushing/pulling mode in orthogonal directions for movement in a plane, while it's powered with an external magnetic field as low as 1 mT. For the secondary oscillating operation mode utilizing the magnetostrictive principle, in-plane strain is induced, resulting in bending and blocking forces on the robot. These forces are theoretically calculated to prove enough drive force can be generated in this mode. The design is further abstracted and translated into a piezoelectric cantilever FEM model to confirm the theorectical results. Microrobot fabrication and test-bed development based on this analysis is shown, which enabled us to participate in the final competition in the 2010 NIST Mobile Microrobot Challenge, with good performance in the dash and freestyle events. Finally, we discuss the testing results in various dry and fluid environments along with recommendations for future investigation and improvements. Keywords: microrobot, magnetostrictive, bimorph.",

        "abstract": "A control algorithm based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is used to guide a simulated swarm of unmanned vehicles along a pre-computed optimal trajectory. By using a fluid based control method, collision avoidance is automatically incorporated into the control. Given an initial position and goal location, it is computationally impractical to compute the optimal trajectories for a large swarm of vehicles. To overcome this, the optimal trajectory is computed for a single vehicle and the swarm is guided along this trajectory using fluid based control, in this case SPH. Importantly, this method avoids computing a potential field to guide the swarm and is easily adaptable to changing environments. Additionally, this method is intended to be used in the presence of a background flow through which the vehicles must travel. This control algorithm is found to be quite robust in the test case examined here and adding additional vehicles to the swarm has only a small impact on fuel consumption per vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Recently, laser-based people-tracking systems have received increasing attention for their ability to localize human subjects precisely in crowded situations. However, in a real environment, there exist many kinds of moving objects other than people, and previous methods have focused only on humans. To design a more sophisticated system, it is necessary to distinguish humans from observed objects and recognize their individual condition-for example, the kind and amount of belongings they are carrying. However, in previous methods using 2D laser range finders (LRFs), it proved difficult to recognize the type of target since all sensors observe a common horizontal plane and only the 2D contours of their targets. In this study, to recognize the type of target, we observe the 3D shapes of objects moving in their environment by installing LRFs with an angle of inclination. So far, in the area of 3D modeling, LRFs have been used to construct 3D models of static objects by moving the sensor and registering multiple views. In contrast, our method observes moving objects by using a static LRF network in the environment. Experimental results are shown to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "It is frequently accepted that tactile sensing must play a key role in robust manipulation and assembly. The potential exists to complement the gross shape information that vision or range sensors can provide with fine-scale information about the texture, stiffness, and shape of the object grasped. Nevertheless, no widely accepted tactile sensing technology currently exists for robot hands. Furthermore, while several proposals exist in the robotics literature regarding how to use tactile sensors to improve manipulation, there is little consensus. This paper describes the electro-mechanical design of the Robonaut 2 phalange load cell. This is a miniature load cell suitable for mounting on the phalanges of humanoid robot fingers. The important design characteristics of these load cells are the shape of the load cell spring element and the routing of small-gauge wires from the sensor onto a circuit board. The paper reports results from a stress analysis of the spring element and establishes the theoretical sensitivity of the device to loads in different directions. The paper also compares calibrated load cell data to ground truth load measurements for four different manufactured sensors. Finally, the paper analyzes the response of the load cells in the context of a flexible materials localization task.",

        "abstract": "When dealing with light-weight robots with nonrigid limbs and joints and uncertain sensory readings, configuration state representations inevitably are approximate. Due to various types of sensory readings, which are usually body-grounded in different frames of reference, these configuration states may naturally be represented modularly distributed. From a different perspective, computational models of human motor planning suggest that the brain represents current body postures, such as the state of an arm, modularly within various frames of reference. Moreover, the different information sources, such as proprioceptive, anticipatory, and visual information, are probabilistically integrated. As a basis for such a representation, we propose a modular system that maintains a distributed self-representation in interactive frames of reference. We show that the resulting representation is highly noise robust and may be used to reach goals within various frames of reference while also considering other task constraints.",

A swimming underwater robot has been developed whose movements are generated using such actuators, used for bending the backbone of the fish, which in turn causes a change on the curvature of the body. This paper focuses on how standard swimming patterns can be reproduced with the proposed design, using an actuation dynamics model identified in prior work.",

        "abstract": "Designing and constructing affective robots on schedule and within costs is especially challenging because of the qualitative, artistic nature of affective expressions. Detailed affective design principles do not exist, forcing an iterative design process. This paper describes a three step design process created for the Survivor Buddy project that engages artists in the design process and allows animation to guide physical implementation. The process combines creative design of believable agents unconstrained by costs with traditional design decision matrices. The paper provides a case study comparing the resulting design of the Survivor Buddy 2.0 robot with the original (Survivor Buddy 1.0). The multi-disciplinary methodology produced a more pleasing and expressive robot that was 50% less expensive, 78% lighter, and up to 700% faster within the same amount of design time. This methodology is expected to contribute to reducing risk in designing cost effective affective robots and robots in general.",

Multi-hypothesis topological SLAM algorithms have been developed to exploit connectivity and disambiguate such difficult task. In this paper, we propose a multi-hypothesis constraint network algorithm that tracks multiple map topologies and simultaneously keeps metric information. The map is stored as a graph consisting of poses and constraints and each constraint is associated to a loop closure hypothesis. Hypotheses are stored in a hypothesis tree that is expanded whenever possible loop closure may occur. Network poses are computed according to the most likely topological configuration, but alternative pose values are also computed for the poses that are adjacent to a hypothesis constraint to recover quickly the new configuration when required. Results provide a validation of the proposed approach.",

This particular work concerns the response to trips due to obstacles and shows that the two strategies identified in biomechanics emerge from a single controller. We first identify the parameters of a neuromuscular network model using the muscle tension data during a human walking motion. The anatomically-correct network models the somatosensory reflex of the human neuromuscular system. We use this network as the controller for a musculoskeletal human model to simulate its response to disturbances. Simulation results show that our neuromuscular controller automatically results in the appropriate trip recovery strategy with a single set of parameters, although we do not explicitly model the trip response or the condition to invoke each strategy. This result implies that an appropriately designed locomotion controller can also provide rapid responses to trips without deliberate controller selection or planning.",

We show that it is possible to navigate along a visual path without relying on the extraction, matching and tracking of geometric visual features such as keypoint. The new proposed approach relies directly on the information (entropy) contained in the image signal. We show that it is possible to build a control law directly from the maximisation of the shared information between the current image and the next key image in the visual path. The shared information between those two images are obtained using mutual information that is known to be robust to illumination variations and occlusions. Moreover the generally complex task of features extraction and matching is avoided. Both simulations and experiments on a real vehicle are presented and show the possibilities and advantages offered by the proposed method.",

As such phenomenons have been discovered and verified in many researches, we proposed a new performance index, called \u201cType Error\u201d, which could be applied to evaluate such undesirable errors. Specifically with this index, the largest translational/rotational pose error could be quantized and the worst case over the designed workspace can be predicted. A three-step method for general application is presented in details by case study of three kinds of translational PKM.",

        "abstract": "In the paper, a concept of novel self-reconfigurable robotic system made of the autonomous robotic modules has been reviewed. Each robotic module is made of simple structure and few degrees of freedom; however, a group of the modules is able to change its connective configuration by changing their local connections and has functionality of robotic system which is capable of generating complicated motions and accomplishing a large variety of tasks, such as: transportation, exploration, inspection, construction and in-situ resource utilization. Multimode locomotion and self-reconfiguration are the basic and essential abilities for the self-reconfigurable robotic system. Based on this concept, a new self-reconfiguration system, UBot robotic system that combines the advantages from the chain-based and lattice-based robots has been proposed. Each UBot module which is cubic structure based on universal joint has two rotational DOF and four connecting surfaces that can connect to or disconnect from adjacent modules. The smart structure and the reliable connecting mechanism of the modules make the robot flexible enough to complete multimode locomotion and self-reconfiguration. This paper demonstrates the design philosophy of the UBot module and a solution for multimode motions and self-reconfiguration using the UBot system. The system can complete motion in the modes of quadruped, chain and loop configuration. Besides, the system can deform from one mode to the other though self-reconfiguration. All the proposed methods have been verified though simulations and real hardware experiments.",

        "abstract": "Combining the advantages of active and passive walking robots, we have developed a novel active biped walking robot with only six DoFs. The robot is built with six 1-DoF joint modules and two wheels as the feet. It achieves locomotion in special gaits different from those of traditional biped robots. In this paper, this novel biped robot is introduced, and four walking gaits, namely turning-around gait, foot-wheel hybrid gait, side-stepping gait and turning-over gait are proposed, and their walking patterns and motion planning are presented and analyzed. Walking experiments are carried out to verify the locomotion function, the effectiveness of the presented gaits and to illustrate the features of this novel biped robot. It has been shown that biped active walking may be achieved with only a few DoFs and simple kinematic configuration.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel four-step acceleration profile is proposed for the inner mass (moving part) of a capsubot (capsule robot) system that works on the principle of the internal force-static friction. By using the acceleration profile of the inner mass the capsubot system can move in a given desired direction. Optimum selection of the different parameters of the acceleration profile is investigated considering the design constraints. Comparison of the simulation results with previous proposed profiles demonstrates its superiority. A novel encapsulated capsubot has been developed utilizing the acceleration profile in a self-contained format.",

An allocation-based formation algorithm is used to calculate particles' trajectories. Along the trajectories, particles are trapped and moved by optical tweezers. Particles can be gradually moved into a pre-defined formation array. The main contribution of this paper lies in the proposal of using multi-agent solution to address the formation problem of particles in micro environment. The proposed framework can be applied to many bio-applications, such as cell sorting, cell transportation, cell-to-cell interaction study, etc., with high throughput and precision. Experiments on micro-scaled particles, with a robot-tweezer manipulation system, are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel Movable Gripper (MovGrip) which targets on climbing non-enclosable rectangular trusses such as bridges and space stations. It is designed with a transformation mechanism which provides the features of parallel grippers, rotatory grippers, and active wheels. For truss climbing, MovGrip acts as a parallel gripper which allows the change in gripping width according to different size of trusses. Since MovGrip is equipped with active wheels, fast climbing motion can therefore be realized. Moreover, MovGrip can be transformed into a mobile platform which is suitable for the navigation on ground. It weighs only 500 grams with a climbing speed of 3 cm/s. To maintain the climbing stability, we steer the rotation axis of wheels. By this, a directional pulling force (from MovGrip to truss surface) can be distributed from the drive force of wheels which pulls MovGrip towards the truss while climbing. Experimental results show that tilting of MovGrip can be auto-adjusted based on the proposed design. Also, it is shown that the load carrying capability of MovGrip is approximately 1 kg which is 2 times of its weight.",

The device design incorporates an artificial bladder where the volume of gas generated by electrolysis is controlled by a solenoid valve, thus changing the device's buoyancy. A set of gold electrodes, separated by an IPMC film, is used as a lightweight and compact electrolysis generator. IPMC acts as stable, low power, highly efficient and environmentally friendly gas generator. Experimental results using open-loop control show that the device is capable of controlling its buoyancy efficiently with no noise and low power consumption. Applications for this technology include integration into bio-inspired, unmanned underwater vehicles.",

In this paper, we propose a novel laser-based system, which can perform the online detection of abnormal activity with an unsupervised way. The proposed system has the following key features that make it advantageous over previous ones: (1) It can cover quite a large and crowded area, such as subway station, public square, intersection and etc. (2) The overall system can vary with time period, incrementally learn the behavior pattern of pedestrians and perform the fully online detection of abnormal activity. This feature makes our system be quite suitable for the real-time applications. (3) The abnormal activity detection is carried out with a fully unsupervised way, there is no need for manual labelling and constructing the huge training datasets. We successfully applied the proposed system into the JR subway station of Tokyo, which can cover a 60\u00d735m area, track more 150 targets at the same time and simultaneously perform the robust detection of abnormal activity with no human intervention.",

In this paper, we present a novel design of a variable stiffness rotary actuator, called MESTRAN, which was especially targeted to address the limitations in terms of the amount of energy and time required to vary the stiffness of an actuated joint. We have constructed a mechanical model in simulation and a physical prototype. We conducted a series of experiments to validate the performance of the MESTRAN actuator prototype. The results from the simulation and experiments show that MESTRAN allows independent control of stiffness and position of an actuated rotary joint with a large operational range and high speed. The torque-displacement relationship is close to linear. Lastly, the MESTRAN actuator is energy-efficient since a certain stiffness level is maintained without energy input.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, techniques of force-feedback control are applied to the hydrodynamic study of a laboratory robotic fish. The experimental apparatus which allows a robotic model to accelerate from rest to a steady speed under self-propelled conditions is clearly described. In the current apparatus, the robotic fish is mounted on a servo guide rail system and the towing speed is not preset but determined by the measured force acting on the body of the fish. Such an apparatus enables the simultaneous measurement of power consumption, thrust efficiency and speed of a robotic model obtained under self-propelled conditions. The thrust efficiency of the robotic fish can be estimated based on a 2-D vortex ring force estimation method. By comparing the thrust performance of carangiform body-shaped robotic swimmer with different typical BCF (body and caudal fin ) swimming modes, i.e. anguilliform, carangiform and thunniform, we show that the robotic swimming fish with the thunniform kinematic movement not only reaches a higher steady swimming speed but is also more efficient than the other two modes However, in the start phase, using the anguilliform kinematic movement, the robotic swimmer accelerates faster among all kinematic movements. Ultimately, we found that the robotic fish always produce a double-row wake structure no matter which swimming mode used.",

        "abstract": "Normally, people always believe that the more measurement poses used in a robot calibration process, the more accurate result can be obtained. However, the accuracy improvement converges to a threshold after a number of measurement poses. Moreover, robot calibration is a time consuming process, too many poses would seriously complicate the process and consumedly increase the spending time. In this paper, an optimal measurement pose number searching method was proposed to improve the calibration method in time spending aspect. Optimal robot poses were added to an initial pose set one by one to establish a new pose set for the robot calibration. The root mean squares (RMS) of the end-effector pose errors after being calibrated by using these pose sets were calculated. The optimal number of the configuration set which correspond to the least RMS of pose error can then be obtained. This algorithm can get higher end-effector accuracy, meanwhile consume less time. The simulation on a serial robot manipulator with 24 unknown kinematic parameters shows that the end-effector pose accuracy after calibrated by the using of the optimal pose set is much better than the result before calibration, and is better than the using of a random pose set.",

        "abstract": "The strength of a haptic display may be assessed from its range of stable impedances. This paper presents a novel passive haptic display (PARM) capable of simulating a broad range of impedances. It comprises a passive constraint that can simulate both uninhibited motion through free-space and collision into a rigid obstacle. In free-space, the user feels the natural impedance of the end-effector without the added inertia and friction from a transmission or actuator. In a collision with a rigid object, haptic stiffness can be much greater than a traditional impedance haptic display. An experimental study with a 2 DoF planar manipulator illustrates the minimum and maximum impedances that are attainable for this haptic display. The inertial mass and friction in free-space are less than 0.2 kg and 12.3 Ns/m, and the stiffness against a haptic boundary is 465 N/mm. In addition, collision with a haptic object produces a more authentic experience, since there are naturally-occurring high frequency oscillations that result from the physical collision between two objects. This novel haptic display has both the minimum impedance benefits of impedance haptic displays and the maximum impedance benefits of admittance haptic displays.",

        "abstract": "Epipolar rectification greatly simplifies the stereo matching which is important for vision based robotics navigation. In this paper we propose a novel rectification algorithm for coaxial omni-directional stereo system, i.e. systems aligned on the same axis of symmetry. The essential matrix is derived and computed for an arbitrary omni-directional stereo configuration based on Taylor model firstly. Using the one-to-one corresponding relationship between epipolar curve and its tangential space, we rectify the system to the direction of the line connecting two cameras' centers. This step removes the translation misalignment. After that, the corresponding points are constraint to the radial line. Image-resample based on the essential matrix compensates the rotation misalignment and makes corresponding points lie on the same scan column. The proposed algorithm is only performed on image plane so that the computation time and error caused by multi-projections in 3D space are decreased. Finally, experimental results on simulation and real data illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Online trajectory scaling approaches represent a possible way for handling robotic systems characterized by kinematic or dynamic saturations. Scaling methods are based on the path/velocity decomposition principle: a dynamic filter is used to modify the longitudinal velocity along a planned path in order to satisfy given system constraints. The strategy here proposed enhances the results of a previous work by enlarging the number of considered constraints. In particular, still accounting for the existence of bounds on joint velocities and torques, in this paper, the presence of constraints on joint accelerations is also considered. Furthermore, the nonlinear filter, which represents the core of the scaling system, has been revised in order to devise a new and more compact implementation. Finally, some practical issues that could occur in actual implementations are discussed and solutions are proposed to overcome possible problems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel decentralized multilateral structure is proposed for the dual user systems in the presence of communication delay. The proposed structure utilizes adaptive impedance control approach in order to overcome the destructive effect of the time-delay on system desired-objectives, which is a disregarded issue in the previous studies on dual user system. The proposed control strategy, which utilizes three desired impedance surfaces defined in the paper, satisfactorily brings the system hybrid matrix close to the ideal one that guarantees the system stability and transparency. The controller is designed in a way that eliminates the necessity of the delay estimation as one of its outstanding characteristics; consequently, the unknown communication time-delay can be handled via this structure while previous studies have disregarded the issue of time delay in dual user system. Furthermore, the adaptive structure of the controller promises to overcome the uncertainties on robot's dynamics. In addition, the efficiency of the controller in guaranteeing the system stability in the presence of unknown communication delay is investigated through passivity theory and the presented analysis illustrates complete independency of the closed-loop system stability on time delay value applying the proposed controller. Experimental results performed on a delayed dual user system demonstrate validity of the proposed scheme.",

The algorithm fuses information from odometry with observations of naturally occurring static point features in the environment. A key contribution of this work is a novel approach for computing the particle weights, which does not require including the feature positions in the state vector. As a result, the computational and sample complexities of the algorithm remain low even in feature-dense environments. We validate the effectiveness of the approach extensively with both simulations as well as real-world data, and compare its performance against that of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and FastSLAM. Results from the simulation tests show that the particle filter approach is better than these competing approaches in terms of the RMS error. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that the approach is capable of achieving good localization accuracy in complex environments.",

Specifically, a procedure that alters the mechanical design of a robot arm to incorporate springs optimized to reduce the maximum motor torque, or energy, required to perform a specified maneuver is proposed. By reducing the maximum motor torque required, the reliability and utility of the motors (and by extension the entire UGV) are increased. Our joint model includes both a non-backdrivable worm gear and a static DC motor.

Using passivity based techniques, we allow the behavior of the UAVs to be as flexible as possible with arbitrary split and join decisions while guaranteeing stability of the system. Furthermore, the overall teleoperation system is also made passive and, therefore, characterized by a stable behavior both in free motion and when interacting with unknown passive obstacles. The performance of the system is validated through semi-experiments.",

Autonomous vehicle decision making is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), then extended to a QMDP framework. Based on MDP/QMDP, three kinds of uncertainties are taken into account: sensor noise, perception constraints and surrounding vehicles' behavior. In simulation, the QMDP-based reasoning framework makes the autonomous vehicle perform with differing levels of conservativeness corresponding to different perception confidence levels. Road tests also indicate that the proposed algorithm helps the vehicle in avoiding potentially unsafe situations under these uncertainties. In general, the results indicate that the proposed QMDP-based algorithm makes autonomous driving more robust to limited sensing ability and occasional sensor failures.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robot path planning problem arises in a variety of industrial application scenarios. In manufacturing automation, we often require a robot to quickly go to its home position from a given initial point while avoiding possible collisions with the environment. In hard disk drive testing, fast recovery following from a robot failure, for example, a motion stop or robot gripper sensor failure, is desired in order to reduce manual intervening and improve production efficiency. In the academic field, under the assumption that the environment dimension is completely known, the robot path planning problem has been solved theoretically using either the complete methods, or the probabilistic algorithms. However, in industrial fields, most commonly used path planning algorithms are still empirical, and are often based on human intuition. There is still a big gap between the state-of-the-art path planning techniques that are already developed in the academic field and the methods used in the industrial fields. This paper reports a practical approach for path planning with an intention to bridge the gap. This approach constructs a set of collision-free milestones iteratively, which gives rise to a partition of robot configuration space such that the collision-free portion of each cell is star-shaped. Then it is straightforward to draw a collision-free path from a point in robot configuration space to one of the collision-free milestones as well as constructing and verifying paths among these milestones.",

Such a detection system requires high accuracy and robustness considering the uncertainty in pressure-based force measurement. Our framework is thus organized into (i) identifying the dominant error force component (self-weight and driving force) using theoretical and experimental estimation and binarizing the analog external cylinder force, (ii) evaluating detection conditions to address indeterminate conditions such as stroke-end, singular posture, and impulsive or oscillatory force and redefining three-valued outputs such as on, off, or not de terminate (ND), and (iii) outputting the front load decision by combining all the cylinder decisions to improve robustness through priority analysis. Experiments were conducted using an instrumented hydraulic arm. Results indicate that our frame work adequately detects on, off, and ND outputs of the front load in various detection conditions without misidentification.",

A probabilistic quality metric estimates the probability of a reconstruction achieving a desired goal. This probabilistic model leads to the natural integration of many different factors influencing the quality of a reconstruction without relying on arbitrary weights for those factors. The specific factors addressed here are occlusions, feature matching, and feature localization. It is demonstrated how these factors impact the quality of a reconstruction and how they can be accounted for in a probabilistic manner. The developed quality metric is then used to optimize a camera network for patient tracking during tomotherapy.",

        "abstract": "While redundantly actuated PKM (RA-PKM) possess desirable kinematic and dynamic properties, their control is impeded by the occurrence of antagonistic control forces. Such forces are observed in non-linear model-based as well as in decentralized control schemes. In this paper it is outlined that such antagonistic forces are inherent to the decentralized control of RA-PKM, and also that calibration errors and finite encoder resolutions cause antagonistic control forces and excited vibrations, hence energy loss and instabilities. The effect of measurement errors and the stability of individual PD and computed torque control is analyzed. They are shown to yield asymptotically stable setpoint control. A central result of this paper is a projection method for the elimination of contradicting control commands. This method is valid independently of the actual control scheme. Experimental results are presented for a 2RRR/RR implementation. The results confirm that the proposed scheme reduces antagonistic control forces up to measurement errors and model uncertainties.",

In this paper, we provide a parametric identification method that complements the previous solution in that it can provide, after a sufficiently long learning period, a complete model of the nonlinear stiffness, which can be applied henceforth even in the absence of excitation.

This work also constructs a transformation controller for the robot which uses an accelerometer to sense its orientation. The performance analysis shows that our reconfigurable robot prototype can transform from spherical shape (dormant mode) into two interconnected hemispheres where the three leg-wheels are projected out of the shells (transformed mode) and vice versa. After the transformation into the three leg-wheel configuration, the robot can autonomously move in L-shaped and U-shaped areas as well as narrowing pathways.",

It is known that a strong ECF jet is generated under nonuniform electric field, for example, the field with a pair of needle and ring electrodes. This study introduces the ECF jet to develop a novel flexible robot hand. First, we characterize the ECF jet generator which could be a micro fluid pressure source of the robot hand, and confirm the effect of the variation of electrode parameters and the number of electrode pairs on its performance. Next, we investigate the characteristics of the robot finger which mainly consists of the ECF jet generator, a flexible rubber finger and an ECF tank. The robot finger is integrated with the pressure source (ECF jet generator) and the tank, and is successfully driven. Finally we developed a five-fingered flexible robot hand and demonstrate that the robot hand can grasp some objects with various shapes without any complex controller.

By defining a desired trajectory with respect to observable landmarks, human operators can send semi-autonomous robots into areas for which a truth map is not available. Waypoint planning is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, resulting in robot trajectories in the true environment that are qualitatively similar to those provided by the human. The algorithm is implemented both in simulation and on a mobile robot platform in several different environments. A sensitivity analysis is performed, illustrating how the method is robust to uncertainties, even large sketch distortions, and allows the robot to adapt and re-plan according to its most current perception of the world.",

In particular, the system is low cost, simple-to-deploy, and is able to provide full six-degree of-freedom relative localization for three-dimensional laser scanners with centimetre-level accuracy in translation, and half degree accuracy in orientation. This system utilizes common laser scanner hardware, and exploits the fact that retroreflective material is easily identified based on the return intensity. This enables the use of simple rectangular signs placed around the scene as landmarks. An uncertainty model is presented that accounts for the shape of the landmarks, and a batch alignment algorithm is formulated that efficiently considers the structure of the problem. Lastly, characterization of the accuracy of the system is provided through small-scale testing in an indoor lab, and examples for a large-scale setup.",

It is usually solved using various nonlinear-based control methods, which are often not easy to implement or tune and do not consider the influence of side-slope. We propose a two-tier controller that is simple and intuitive, which directly controls the curvature of the trailer's trajectory. It allows the control input to be more directly related to path specification and handles path curvature discontinuity better. A side-slope compensator is designed upon the simple controller to prevent side-slope from deteriorating tracking performance. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the capability of this new algorithm applied to a full scale autonomous vehicle and trailer system in a real field environment using minimal sensing capability. Performance comparison between the compensated and uncompensated systems is also presented. Results demonstrate good performance on modest side-slope.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a single landmark based localization algorithm for non-holonomic mobile robots. In the case of a unicycle robot model, the localization problem is equivalent to the system observability. Based on this observation, the proposed localization method consists in finding a vector function which depends on the measurement vector and its derivatives. In order to compute estimates of the successive derivatives of the measurement vector, we will use a numerical differentiation method. When the robot is able to only measure the relative angle between itself and the landmark in 2D case, the algorithm estimates the posture of the robot, under the hypothesis that control inputs are known. But, sometimes it is also useful to be able to estimate the control input (for example when the robot slips). This is possible with the proposed algorithm by using a landmark in dimension three. The simulation results will be given in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, these results are compared with those obtained by an Extended Kalman Filter in order to underline the advantages of the new algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Although recent progress in 2D mobile robot navigation has been significant, the great majority of existing work focuses only on ensuring that the robot reaches its goal. But to make autonomous navigation truly successful, the \u201cquality\u201d of planned motion is important as well. Here, we develop and analyze a pose-following kinematic control law applicable to unicycle-type robots, such that the robot can generate intuitive, fast, smooth, and comfortable trajectories. The Lyapunov-based feedback control law is derived via singular perturbation. It is made up of three components: (i) egocentric polar coordinates with respect to an observer on the vehicle, (ii) a slow subsystem which describes the position of the vehicle, where the reference heading is obtained via state feedback, and (iii) a fast subsystem which describes the steering of the vehicle, where the vehicle heading is exponentially stabilized to the obtained reference heading. The resulting path is a smooth and intuitive curve, globally converging to an arbitrary target pose without singularities, from any given initial pose. Furthermore, we present a simple path following strategy based on the proposed control law to satisfy arbitrary velocity, acceleration and jerk bounds imposed by the user. Such requirements are important to any autonomous vehicle so as to avoid actuator overload and to make the path physically realizable, and they are critical for applications like autonomous wheelchairs where passengers can be physically fragile.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a novel technique that allows visualization of the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract especially the small intestine in a comfortable, non-invasive and efficacious way. The main disadvantage of WCE is that physicians need to examine a video of over 55,000 frames which is a time-consuming and labor intensive task. To address the problem, a strategy of WCE video clip abstraction based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is proposed in this paper. We extract multiple features based on which the frame differences are measured. Then the video clips are segmented using a non-parametric key-point detection algorithm and finally the most representative frames (MRFs) are extracted based on LDA algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed strategy achieves promising performances.",

        "abstract": "Recently several systems for magnetic resonance image (MRI) guided needle placement in the prostate have been reported. In comparison to conventional ultrasound-guided needle placement in the prostate, these MRI-guided systems promise improved targeting accuracy for prostate intervention procedures including biopsy, fiducial marker insertion, injection and focal therapy. In MRI-guided needle interventions, after a needle is inserted, the needle position is often confirmed with a volumetric MRI scan. Commonly used titanium needles are not directly visible in an MR image, but they generate a susceptibility artifact in the immediate neighborhood of the needle. This paper reports the results of a quantitative study of the relation between the true position of titanium biopsy needle and the corresponding needle artifact position in MR images. The titanium needle artifact was found to be displaced 0.38 mm and 0.32 mm shift in scanner's frequency and phase encoding direction, respectively. The artifact at the tip of the titanium needle was observed to bend toward the scanner's B0 magnetic field direction.",

        "abstract": "The procedure of manually generating a 3D model of an object is very time consuming for a human operator. Next best-view (NBV) planning is an important aspect for automation of this procedure in a robotic environment. We propose a surface-based NBV approach, which creates a triangle surface from a real-time data stream and determines viewpoints similar to human intuition. Thereby, the boundaries in the surface are detected and a quadratic patch for each boundary is estimated. Then several viewpoint candidates are calculated, which look perpendicular to the surface and overlap with previous sensor data. A NBV is selected with the goal to fill areas which are occluded. This approach focuses on the completion of a 3D model of an unknown object. Thereby, the search space for the viewpoints is not restricted to a cylinder or sphere. Our NBV determination proves to be very fast, and is evaluated in an experiment on test objects, applying an industrial robot and a laser range scanner.",

As a second contribution, a planner based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), called Homotopic RRT (HRRT) is proposed to use the topological information to guide the path search in the workspace. Finally, simulated and real results with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are presented showing the feasibility of the proposal. Comparison with well-known path planning algorithms has also been included.",

        "abstract": "A new torque cancelling system (TCS) that stabilizes mechanical sway in quick-motion robots is discussed in this paper. It cancels the reaction moment generated by the motion of an object by considering the precise dynamics of the object and the body of the robot itself. The reaction moment can be obtained accurately using the parallel solution scheme of inverse dynamics, which handles the dynamics of complex robotic architectures by modeling them with finite elements. Once the reaction moment is known, it can be cancelled by applying an anti-torque to a torque generating device. In this paper, the general concepts of the TCS and the parallel solution scheme are first described. Then, some examples of torque cancelling due to accurate calculations of dynamics are demonstrated, by showing the experimental results carried out on a prototype TCS system. The objects used in the experiments include rigid and flexible, outboard and inboard links, where difficult assumptions are normally required to consider the accurate dynamics.",

If the model uncertainty is significant, a generated path or control strategy based on forward simulation of this model is potentially invalid and expensive to track (if possible). This paper explores the use of system identification/estimation to tune model parameters. Framed as an extension to rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) methods, it updates the model so that reachable actions added to the tree have more fidelity. This can be viewed as a mixture of a model predictive control (MPC) for local planning with an approximate-model global planner providing sub-goals and thus overcoming the limited lookahead caused by model uncertainty. The benefits of this approach are illustrated for a 3 DOF serial manipulator controlled by computed torque control operating under large external disturbances. In this case, the approach provides operation under intermittent feedback and disturbance observation. Tracking and actuator utilization are also improved over solutions found via conventional methods.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog or heavy rain greatly reduce the visual quality of outdoor surveillance videos. Video quality enhancement can improve the visual quality of surveillance videos providing clearer images with more details. Existing work in this area mainly focuses on quality enhancement for high resolution videos or still images, but few algorithms are developed for enhancing surveillance videos, which normally have low resolution, high noise and compression artifacts. In addition, for snow or rain conditions, the image quality of near-filed view is degraded by the obscuration of apparent snowflakes and raindrops, while the quality of far field view is degraded by the obscuration of fog-like snowflakes or raindrops. Very few video quality enhancement algorithms have been developed to handle both problems. In this paper, we propose a novel video quality enhancement algorithm for see-through snow, fog or heavy rain. The proposed algorithm has two major steps: 1. the near-field enhancement algorithm identifies obscuration pixels by snow or rain in the near-field view and removes these pixels as snowflakes or rain drops; different from state-of-the-art methods, the algorithm in this step can detect snowflakes on foreground object and background, and choose different methods to fill in the removed regions. 2. the far-field enhancement algorithm restores the image's contrast information not only to reveal more details in the far-field view but also to enhance the overall image's quality; in this step, the proposed algorithm adaptively enhances the global and local contrast, which is inspired on the human visual system, and accounts for the perceptual sensitivity to noise, compression artifacts, and the texture of image content. From our extensive testing, the proposed approach significantly improves the visual quality of surveillance videos by removing snow/fog/rain effects.",

However, most literatures on eco-driving based on traditional traffic flow models, are greatly simplified, and can not evaluate the effects on detailed driving behaviors. By referring to robot motion planning approaches, in this research a microscopic vehicle model is developed and it can represent different driving behaviors, such as aggressive or conservative driving; a collision detection algorithm is proposed that takes O(1) time to check for a trajectory's collision, enabling realtime planning; and a traffic simulation system is developed by incorporating traffic rules, so that the driving behaviors such as observing or not observing traffic rules can also be represented. Experiments are conducted on the simulation platform, and the performance of different driving behaviors on travel time, mileage, comfort and eco is studied.",

This quadrotor is equipped with a monocular camera, IMUs and a flight computer, which enables autonomous flights. Two complementary pose/motion estimation methods, respectively marker-based and optical-flow-based, are developed by considering different altitudes in a flight. To achieve smooth take-off, stable tracking and safe landing with respect to a moving ground robot and desired trajectories, appropriate controllers are designed. Additionally, data synchronization and time delay compensation are applied to improve the system performance. Real-time experiments are conducted in both indoor and outdoor environments.",

Just as small inventories of phonemes and words combine in a grammatical fashion to yield myriad valid words and utterances, a small inventory of physical parts combine in a grammatical fashion to yield myriad valid assemblies. We apply the notion of a language model from speech recognition to this visual domain to similarly improve the performance of the recognition process over what would be possible by only applying recognizers to the components. Unlike the context-free models for human language, our visual language models are context sensitive and formulated as stochastic constraint-satisfaction problems. And unlike the situation for human language where all components are observable, our methods deal with occlusion, successfully recovering object structure despite unobservable components. We demonstrate our system with an integrated robotic system for disassembling structures that performs whole-scene reconstruction consistent with a language model in the presence of noisy feature detectors.",

This new model leads to a generalised visual servoing control formalism that can be applied to any type of imaging system whether it be multi-camera, catadioptric, non-central, etc. In this paper the generalised 3D viewing cones are parameterised geometrically via Pl\u00fccker line coordinates. The new visual servoing model is tested on an a-typical stereo-camera system with non-overlapping cameras. In this case no 3D information is available from triangulation and the system is comparable to a 2D visual servoing system with non-central ray-based control law.",

The problem consists of determining the pose of the vehicle without any prior information about its location. The vehicle is supposed to be equipped with a laser scanner that allows to measure the range and bearing of the vehicle with respect to a set of anonymous landmarks. A map with the positions of all landmarks in the environment is available to the localization system. We propose a novel algorithm for AGV self-localization based on landmarks identification that can take into account also false detections, very common in industrial environments. The pose is computed with a single scan (2D), without any sensor fusion. The performance of the proposed strategy is shown both by simulations and experiments on real industrial plants.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design of the robot AILA, a mobile dual-arm robot system developed as a research platform for investigating aspects of the currently booming multidisciplinary area of mobile manipulation. The robot integrates and allows in a single platform to perform research in most of the areas involved in autonomous robotics: navigation, mobile and dual-arm manipulation planning, active compliance and force control strategies, object recognition, scene representation, and semantic perception. AILA has 32 degrees of freedom, including 7-DOF arms, 4-DOF torso, 2-DOF head, and a mobile base equipped with six wheels, each of them with two degrees of freedom. The primary design goal was to achieve a lightweight arm construction with a payload-to-weight ratio greater than one. Besides, an adjustable body should sustain the dual-arm system providing an extended workspace. In addition, mobility is provided by means of a wheel-based mobile base. As a result, AILA's arms can lift 8kg and weigh 5.5kg, thus achieving a payload-to-weight ratio of 1.45. The paper will provide an overview of the design, especially in the mechatronics area, as well as of its realization, the sensors incorporated in the system, and its control software.",

The main difficulty is that the locations of the entities and the radio connectivities between the physical locations are not known in advance. We represent the problem by a topological graph of locations with known access links but unknown radio links and develop a novel ANCHOR algorithm for a set of autonomous robots to discover radio links dynamically and self-organize a radio network to connect the given entities with the least number of robots. We show in simulation analysis the algorithm scale near-linearly with maximum number of connected hops away from the terminals.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for trajectory generation based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) treated from a control theoretical perspective. We extended the key ideas from the original DMP formalism by introducing a velocity convergence mechanism in the reformulated system. Theoretical proof is given to guarantee its validity. The new method can deal with complex paths as a whole. Based on this, we can generate smooth trajectories with automatically generated transition zones, satisfy position- and velocity boundary conditions at start and endpoint with high precision, and support multiple via-point applications. Theoretic proof of this method and experiments are presented.",

        "abstract": "Based on the framework of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), SLAM with generalized objects (GO) has an additional structure to allow motion mode learning of generalized objects, and calculates a joint posterior over the robot, stationary objects and moving objects. While the feasibility of monocular SLAM has been demonstrated and undelayed initialization has been achieved using the inverse depth parametrization, it is still challenging to achieve undelayed initialization in monocular SLAM with GO because of the delay decision of static and moving object classification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective static and moving object classification method using the velocity estimates directly from SLAM with GO. Compared to the existing approach in which the observations of a new/unclassified feature can not be used in state estimation, the proposed approach makes the uses of all observations without any delay to estimate the whole state vector of SLAM with GO. Both Monte Carlo simulations and real experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed classification algorithm and the estimates of monocular SLAM with GO.",

The dynamics features are composed of torques from knee and hip joints of both legs and implicitly include the gravity, ground reaction forces, and the pose of the remaining body parts. These features are more discriminative than the kinematics features, and they result in a low dimensional representation of a human action which preserves much information of the original high dimensional pose. This low dimensional feature allows us to achieve a good classification performance even with a relatively small training data in a simple classification framework such as HMM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on the CMU motion capture dataset with various actions.",

Vision-based localization in such a large and dynamic visual map is intrinsically ambiguous, since more than one map-locations can exhibit the same visual appearance as the current image observed by the robot. Most existing approaches are passive, i.e., they do not devise any strategy to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we present an active vision-based localization and navigation strategy that can disambiguate the true initial location among possible hypotheses by controlling the mobile observer across a sequence of highly distinctive images, while concurrently navigating towards the target image. The performance of our active localization and navigation algorithm is demonstrated experimentally on a robot moving within a large outdoor environment.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are commonly used in Oceanography due to their relative low cost and wide range of capabilities. Gliders are a type of UUV particularly suitable for long-range missions because of their large autonomy. They change their buoyancy to dive and climb describing a vertical saw tooth pattern, which produces an effective but low horizontal speed. Consequently, gliders are strongly sensitive to ocean currents, so they might have to adapt the heading to the current field. In this article we outline a novel path planning algorithm for gliders using ocean currents. It bases on the A* family of algorithms and incorporates a probabilistic framework. Our approach intends to alleviate some of the drawbacks that A* has with the problem at hand. Instead of discretizing the search space, a set of bearing angles is sampled at each surfacing point and the glider trajectory is integrated. We propose an Adaptive Bearing Sampling (ABS) procedure which reduces the computational time with low impact on the results, as shown by the tests run with ocean currents of a Regional Ocean Model.",

The primary contribution of this paper is the design of an adaptive backstepping controller coupled with a high gain observer based on a nonlinear model of a microrobot in a blood vessel. This work is motivated by the difficulty in accurately determining many biological parameters, which can result in parametric uncertainties to which model-based approaches are highly sensitive. We show that the most sensitive parameter, magnetization of the microrobot, can be measured using a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) force sensor, while the second one, the dielectric constant of blood, can be estimated on line. The efficacy of this approach is illustrated by simulation results.",

Typical teleoperation system dynamics, however, posses terms with nonlinearly parameterized (NLP) structures. Stribeck friction is an example of NLP terms in robot dynamics. If not compensated for in the control scheme, uncertainties in the NLP dynamic terms may lead to significant tracking errors. In this paper, for a bilateral teleoperation system, adaptive controllers are designed for the master and slave robots with both LP and NLP dynamic uncertainties. Next, these controllers are incorporated into the 4-channel bilateral teleoperation framework. Then, transparency of the overall teleoperation is studied via a Lyapunov function analysis. A simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive scheme.",

This problem is further aggravated by the difficulty of accurately measuring or estimating dynamic parameters such as spring and damping constants for associated models and the fact that such parameters are prone to change in time due to heavy use and associated material fatigue. In this paper, we present an on-line, model-based adaptive control method for running with a planar spring-mass hopper based on a once-per-step parameter correction scheme. Our method can be used both as a system identification tool to determine possibly time-varying spring and damping constants of a miscalibrated system, or as an adaptive controller that can eliminate steady-state tracking errors through appropriate adjustments on dynamic system parameters. We present systematic simulation studies to show that our method can successfully accomplish both of these tasks.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "There are many applications for which a robotic device is used to recreate the sense of touch for a physical or virtual environment. Transparency and stability are two major issues in controlling haptic devices. Transparency highly depends on the quality of state observation while the stability range is mainly affected by the time-delay and sampling frequency. The control force is calculated based on the model of the environment and usually is a function of the position and the velocity at the joints. Optical encoders are commonly used for position measurement because of their high resolution, robustness to noise, and high bandwidth. The velocity, however, is usually determined by differentiating the position data over time which can be noisy at high frequencies. This noise demotes the transparency and stability. Low-pass filters are widely used to filter the noise but they make the system slow and conservatively introduce time-delay which further limits the stability range. In this paper, the method of Adaptive Frequency Differentiation (AFD) is introduced, which operates at varying frequencies and effectively removes the noise caused by the error in position data. The AFD is optimized to operate at its best performance while maintaining the reliability of the differentiation. The output of the AFD is derived by logically interpreting the available data and does not involve iterative loops, which improves the processing time. An extension to this method allows to compute low-delay and noiseless acceleration directly from the position data. The claims of this paper are supported by simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, adaptive fuzzy control is investigated for nonlinear teleoperators with time-delays, which ensures synchronization of positions and velocities of the master and slave manipulators, and does not rely on the use of the scattering transformation. Compared with previous passivity framework, the communication delays are assumed to be stochastic time varying. By feedback linearization, the nonlinear dynamics of the tele-operation system is transformed into two sub systems: local master/slave position control with unmodelled dynamics and delayed motion synchronization. Then, based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and Markov jump linear systems, adaptive fuzzy control strategies are developed for the nonlinear teleoperators with time-delay, modeling uncertainties and external disturbances by using the approximation property of the fuzzy logic systems. It is proven that the master-slave tele operation system is stochastically stable in mean square under specific LMI conditions, and all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded.",

Moreover, the road appearance is often affected by a number of factors in challenging conditions. In this paper, we present an adaptive non-planar road detection and tracking approach which overcomes these difficulties by a piecewise planar road model as well as a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based alternating optimization using belief propagation (BP) on segmented images and a hard conditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to achieve adaptability and optimality. The proposed framework incorporates image evidence, geometry information, and temporal support such that the graph we build and the well-defined energy minimization formulation can exploit the essence of the roads that is invariant in challenging environments. Experimental results in various real challenging traffic scenes show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new adaptive algorithm to generate reactionless motion for a space manipulator during and after capturing an unknown tumbling target. The intended application scenario is on-orbit servicing whereby the service spacecraft/manipulator system must dock to, or get a hold of the target satellite in order to conduct the required operations. In the course of these missions, it is important to maintain the base attitude of the servicer unchanged. However, the changes in the dynamics parameters of the system, as a result of capturing an unknown target, degrade the performance of the attitude stabilization system. To overcome this problem in the post capture scenario, the adaptive reactionless control algorithm to produce the arm motions with minimum disturbance to the base, without knowledge of target dynamics, is proposed in this study. This algorithm is intended for use in the transition phase from the instant of capture till the unknown parameters are identified and/or the available stabilization methods can be applied properly. The proposed approach is developed based on the momentum conservation of the system, while recursive least squares algorithm is employed for parameter adaptation. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed concept, MSC Adams simulation platform is employed to implement a planar base-manipulator-target model. Two basic scenarios are considered: one where the initial (prior to capture) angular momentum of the target is zero and the second where the target is spinning. The numerical results show that the space manipulator is able to perform reactionless motion after capturing an unknown spinning target.",

        "abstract": "Accurate estimation of orientation based on data from small low-cost strapdown inertial and magnetic sensors is often inaccurate during highly dynamic motion or when trying to track movements that include two or more periods characterized by significantly different frequencies. This paper presents a complementary filtering algorithm for estimating orientation based on inertial/magnetic sensor measurements. The algorithm takes advantage of the complementary nature of the information offered by high-frequency angular rate sensor data and low frequency accelerometers and magnetometers. The filtering algorithm utilizes a single gain that can be adaptively adjusted to achieve satisfactory performance while tracking two or more different types of motion. An additional feature of our approach involves the simple estimation of the gyro bias during periods exhibiting low dynamics and its subsequent use to correct the instantaneous gyro measurements. Simulation and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the algorithm during slow or nearly static movements, as well as, those which are highly dynamic. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm is able to track pitch and roll during dynamic motion with an RMS error of less than two degrees. This is believed to be superior to current proprietary commercial algorithms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Finding paths in high-dimensional spaces becomes difficult when we wish to optimize the cost of a path in addition to obeying feasibility constraints. Recently the T-RRT algorithm was presented as a method to plan in high-dimensional cost-spaces and it was shown to perform well across a variety of problems. However, since the T-RRT relies solely on sampling to explore the space, it has difficulty navigating cost-space chasms-narrow low-cost regions surrounded by increasing cost. Such chasms are particularly common in planning for manipulators because many useful cost functions induce narrow or lower-dimensional low-cost areas. This paper presents the GradienT-RRT algorithm, which combines the T-RRT with a local gradient method to bias the search toward lower-cost regions. GradienT-RRT is effective at navigating chasms because it explores low-cost regions that are too narrow to explore by sampling alone. We compare the performance of T-RRT and GradienT-RRT on planning problems involving cost functions defined in workspace, task space, and C-space. We find that GradienT-RRT outperforms T-RRT in terms of the cost of the final path while maintaining better or comparable computation time. We also find that the cost of paths generated by GradienT-RRT is far less sensitive to changes in a key parameter, making it easier to tune the algorithm. Finally, we conclude with a demonstration of GradienT-RRT on a planning-with-uncertainty task on the physical HERB robot.",

For autonomous robot operations, localization has typically been calculated using GPS, external camera arrays, or onboard range or vision sensing. In cluttered indoor or outdoor environments, onboard sensing is the only viable option. In this paper we present an appearance-based approach to visual SLAM on a flying MAV using only low quality vision. Our approach consists of a visual place recognition algorithm that operates on 1000 pixel images, a lightweight visual odometry algorithm, and a visual expectation algorithm that improves the recall of place sequences and the precision with which they are recalled as the robot flies along a similar path. Using data gathered from outdoor datasets, we show that the system is able to perform visual recognition with low quality, intermittent visual sensory data. By combining the visual algorithms with the RatSLAM system, we also demonstrate how the algorithms enable successful SLAM.",

For the outdoor robots, they can use GPS to get the path information. But in a GPS-denied environment, the robots cannot get the support from satellites. We design an air-ground robot team to provide a solution to this problem. It consists of a micro aerial vehicle with a vertical camera and a horizontal camera, and two micro ground vehicle with an ultrasonic sensor and a colour sensor. Experimental results are presented demonstrating this air-ground robot team's ability to operate successfully in indoor environments.",

However, for robotic insertion to be a viable option for PEA's, an understanding of the statistical variability of their characteristics is essential. This paper investigates the kinematics of PEA's, their shape variability, and their expected performance during robotic insertion. An investigation of the required number of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and the workspace is presented. A study of shape variability is carried out for characterizing shape repeatability across different insertion trials using the same electrode array. Also a study of shape variability is carried out between different electrode arrays. We simulate and evaluate the expected performance of three and four DoF robotic instruments for PEA insertion. The results support our proposed algorithm for coordinated insertion of the electrode array body and pulling of the stylet. They show that existing commerical perimodiolar arrays provide good shape repeatability. These results also point to the need for designing robotic insertion tools with at least four DoF. We believe that these results provide guidelines for future robotic instrument design for cochlear implant PEA's.",

These procedures require that the robot approach specified target sites while navigating and operating within an anatomically constrained work space. The availability of preoperative imaging makes our approach particularly suited for neurosurgery, and we illustrate the method with the example of endoscopic choroid plexus ablation. A novel parameterization of the robot characteristics is used in conjunction with a global pattern search optimization method. The formulation returns the design of the least-complex robot capable of reaching single or multiple target points in a confined space with constrained optimization metrics. A particular advantage of this approach is that it identifies the need for either fixed-curvature versus variable-curvature sections. We demonstrate the performance of the method in four clinically relevant examples.",

        "abstract": "The tasks of region or object segmentation and environment change detection in a 3D context are investigated and tested on an autonomous skid steer loader. This is achieved through a technique analogous to background subtraction utilising 3D scan data which is first aligned before a voxel sub traction operation against a prior map. We highlight the close relationships between the scan-to-map alignment, background subtraction and 3D scan-to-map matching problems. The presented approaches take advantage of previous work on the multi-resolution occupied voxels list (MROL) representations for 3D spatial maps. This prior work is augmented to provide a mechanism for fast local 6DOF alignment with the same data structures (MROL) that have previously been shown to allow efficient global localisation. The new approach is then compared to an iterative closest point (ICP) implementation and was found to execute in a similar amount of time, but was more robust and accurate. The local alignment algorithm is inherently more amenable to the MROL representation with an associated reduction in implementation complexity and negligible parameter tuning. The hash value basis of MROL results in a map representation that can be both updated and queried in constant time regardless of mapped volume. The approach described was tested on an autonomous skid steer loader as part of the dig-planning process by segmenting piles of material and detecting humans in the scene.",

To this end, modeling of an unstructured environment including the humans is an indispensable part of the online control schemes deployed in such robots. In this regard, a new approach is proposed for generating an efficient model of the human body. This model takes advantage of superquadric functions to represent the human body more realistically than using primitive shapes, while offering minimal computational complexity and simplicity of further computations in comparison to the existing articulated models. This approach is also capable of incorporating various body postures and arbitrary arm configurations in the model. In addition, a new and intelligent sensory system, called floor mat, is introduced which can significantly contribute to generation of the proposed model, in a timely manner. The integration of the floor mat in a multi-sensory system for obtaining all required data for rendering the real-time 3D human model is then discussed. The use of superquadric-based human model in conjunction with the proposed sensing techniques provides an accurate, yet computationally efficient solution for safe human-robot interactions (HRI).",

From these data, rock properties can be inferred. A supervised classification scheme is usually used to map MWD data inputs to rock type outputs given some labeled training data. However, the geology has no definite ground truth that can allow a reliable labeling of the training data, nor is there a clear input-output pair connection between the MWD data and the rock types. In this paper, an adaptive unsupervised approach is proposed to estimate the rock types in a data driven way by minimizing the entropy gradient of the characterizing measure \"Optimized Adjusted Penetration Rate\" (OAPR). Neither data labeling nor fixed model parameters are required because of the data driven nature of the algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our solution.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a dynamic model of a knee joint interacting with a two-link exoskeleton for investigating the effects of different exoskeleton designs on internal joint forces. The closed kinematic chain of the leg and exoskeleton has a significant effect on the joint forces in the knee. A bio-joint model is used to capture this effect by relaxing a commonly made assumption that approximates a knee joint as a perfect engineering pin-joint in exoskeleton design. Based on the knowledge of a knee-joint kinematics, an adaptive knee-joint exoskeleton has been designed by incorporating different kinematic components (such as a pin, slider and cam profile). This design potentially eliminates the negative effects associated with the closed leg/exoskeleton kinematic chain on a human knee. An investigation in the flexion motion of an artificial human knee joint is presented to compare performances of five exoskeleton designs against the case with no exoskeletons. Analytical results that estimate internal forces using the dynamic model (based on the properties of a knee joint) agree well with the experiments. These studies lead to an adaptive mechanism with a slider/cam as an alternative to pin joints for the exoskeleton, and illustrate the application of the model for designing an adaptive mechanism that minimizes internal joint forces due to a human-exoskeleton interaction.",

        "abstract": "A persistent-if less glamorous\u2014challenge in hospitals lies in the day-to-day work of moving and lifting patients with impaired mobility. This is a challenge intensified by our burgeoning aging population, the obesity epidemic, and our aging healthcare workforce. During manual patient handling, the predominant risk of staff injury is excessive back and shoulder loading. A mobile robotic nurse assistant (RoNA) is highly desired to enhance the efficacy and quality of care that nurses and their paraprofessional staff can provide. Such an assistant could improve a nurse's working conditions by off-loading some of his or her most physically demanding duties, thereby reducing the potential for self-injury or injury to the patient. Hstar Technologies is developing a revolutionary RoNA system that provides physical assistance to nurses in a hospital ward. The design of RoNA is a safe and robust system that works effectively in a hospital environment under direct and telepresence control by a nurse or physician. RoNA has a humanoid design featuring bimanual dexterous manipulators that employ a series-elastic-actuation (SEA) system. These electric actuators provide manipulator compliance, safety, flexibility and the strength to lift patients weighing up to 300lbs. RoNA also features an innovative humanoid upper torso, a unique mobile platform with holonomic drive and posture stability enhancement, intelligent navigation control with 3D sensing and perception capability, an intuitive and innovative human-robot interaction control interface, and a highly integrated plan for healthcare system assembly. We anticipate that robotic maneuvering assistants would increase job satisfaction, reduce lifting-related injuries, and extend the years of effective service nurses could render in hospitals. These effects would reduce hospital costs and ameliorate problems posed by the shortage of nursing staff.",

        "abstract": "Catadioptric imaging systems are important in many computer vision and robotics applications. This work addresses the issue of optimally setting the focal distance of a lens based camera in a catadioptric imaging system in order to acquire a best focused image. To this end, understanding the spatial distribution of virtual feature formed by mirror reflection is important. It is known that the virtual features of infinite range of scene depth are limited to a finite depth extent, which is named a caustic volume. In this work we further find that for a variety of quadric mirror based catadioptric systems, when the objects are located at a certain distance to the system, the corresponding virtual features can be considered to be located on the caustic volume boundary. We verify this property with real catadioptric images. Based on this property, an analytical solution is derived for the optimal focal distance setting, which can only be calculated by software simulation or numerical approaches in previous work. This solution is compared with a numerical solution of previous method and is also verified by a simulation of the optical process.",

The behavior of a person among its peers is governed by a number of unspoken social rules, e.g. maintaining an appropriate distance. The primary contribution of this paper is a navigation scheme that is anthropomorphic, i.e. that emulates human behaviors and seeks to adhere to these social rules. Unlike previous works in this area, the focus herein is on dynamic scenarios. The navigation scheme proposed explicitly reasons on the future behavior of the people involved so as to produce better socially acceptable trajectories (not to mention safer trajectories as well). The navigation scheme relies upon a novel cost function called the social costmap that captures in a unified way the different social rules imposed by the people populating the robot's workspace.",

The system can be used as a generic platform for testing MIMO controllers. This paper presents a robust control approach to stabilize the TRMS in a desired posture based on the dynamic model provided by the manufacturer. It is well known that the model is too complex in structure to be used for controller design. In the robust control approach proposed in the paper, it is approximated by a simplified model and the approximation error is compensated by a sliding mode control. In addition, the effect of the quality of the system state feedback on the controller's performance is discussed and a way to improve it is implemented. Experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an ultra-tightly coupled approach to data fusion of optical and inertial measurements. The two redundant sensor systems complement each other well, with the cameras providing absolute positions and the inertial measurements giving low latency information of derivatives. The targeted application is the tracking of handheld input devices for robotic surgery, where landmarks are not always visible to all cameras. Especially when bi-manual operation is considered, where one hand can move between the other hand and a camera, occlusions occur frequently. The ultra-tighly coupled data fusion uses 2D-camera measurements to correct pose estimations in an extended Kalman filter without an explicit 3D-reconstruction. Therefore marker measurements are used to support the pose estimation, even if the marker is only visible in one camera. Experiments were done with an inertial measurement unit and rectified stereo cameras that show the advantage of the approach for the application.",

        "abstract": "The geometry, kinematics, and mechanical development of a symmetric and adjustable arm suspension mechanism for an actively stabilized single-legged hopping robot are presented. This mechanism is a key enabling design feature of a recently developed two-armed reaction wheel stabilized monopod, that is capable of conventional wheeled roving, continuous hopping, and self-uprighting. The mechanism is shown to behave essentially as a digressive-rate torsional spring placed between the two arms, in series with a weaker progressive rate torsional spring tied to the leg/central body. This makes it well-suited to recovering substantial energy from hopping motion, whilst presenting negligible resistance to antisymmetric motions used to maintain side-to-side stability. Furthermore, by storing energy purely in tension, the problem of buckling encountered with compression springs is avoided, and, the effective torsional spring constant may be varied by adjusting the spring pretension. Finally, the mechanism is self-latching near maximum deflection, allowing the vehicle to fold into a compact roving configuration, and enabling \"running jumps\" via the release of this gradually accumulated spring energy.",

        "abstract": "Teleoperation tasks are performed at cartesian level when the robot and the haptic device have dissimilar kinematics. If the size of the workspaces is also dissimilar, as it is usually the case, the mapping between workspaces must be handled with care in order to let the user teleoperate the robot in a natural and precise way. This paper formulates the mapping of workspaces based on the re-synchronization method and proposes an assisted system that lightens the user from the tedious part of the method, by guiding him/her towards the best re-synchronization position, thus minimizing the number of jumps. The proposal is part of a teleoperated guiding system being developed by the authors.",

Using the KUKA light-weighted robotic arms and the DLR/HIT robotic hands, two scientific aspects are shown in this video: stable grasping of fragile objects and manipulation of cream-like mass using a time-of-flight camera. Impedance control are intensively used both by grasping and manipulation. The video shows an autonomous service robot scenario beyond simple fetch-and-carry chores.",

        "abstract": "Tasks such as street mapping and security surveillance seek a route that traverses a given space to perform a function. These task functions may involve mapping the space for accurate modeling, sensing the space for unusual activity, or searching the space for an object. In many cases, the use of multiple robots can greatly improve the performance of these tasks. We assume a prior map is available, but it may be inaccurate due to factors such as occlusion, age, dynamic objects, and resolution limitations. In this work, we address the NP-hard problem of environmental coverage with incomplete prior map information using k robots. To utilize related algorithms in graph theory, we represent the environment as a graph and model the coverage problem as a k-Rural Postman Problem. Using this representation, we present a graph coverage approach for plan generation that can handle graph changes online. Our approach proposes two improvements to an existing heuristic algorithm for the coverage problem. Our improvements seek to equalize the length of the k paths by minimizing the length of the maximum tour. We evaluate our approach on a set of comparison tests in simulation.",

We developed the quadruped robot model on the simulator and compared simulated joint torques and powers with hardware experiments during walking which takes four different walking postures. The results suggest that the direct acquisitions of simulated joint torques include a large latency in our application but this defect is avoidable by using joint force information. Careful parameter settings and tunings permit the simulator to match hardware experimental data with sufficient accuracy.",

Once extended, the knee remains locked without energy consumption, while unlocking it only costs a small amount of energy. Tests showed that the robot walks robustly and that the energy consumption of the new system is low.",

The proposed solution comprises two different aspects: the mechanical design and a system-on-chip control system. As many other differentially steered mobile robots, the vehicle has two coaxial driving wheels and a passive castor wheel. This freely moving unconstrained wheel is equipped with additional rotary encoders, while the wheel angular speeds are accurately determined by a hardware timer based measurement. Thus, improved vehicle speed estimation is achieved, including the detection and quantification of possible slip on the actuated wheels. These measurements are sufficiently accurate to derive of a simple case specific empirical tire model, based only on odometry data.",

The strain gages are embedded in silicone under different configurations like corpuscle in humans skin. Both static displacement and dynamic excitations are applied in arbitrary positions, with different magnitudes and frequencies. The responses are observed by measuring the output signals from strain gages. Comparison with FEM simulation of static displacement shows intuitive agreement. The responses to dynamic excitation in typical frequency range of human somatosensors are obtained both experimentally and with simulation of dynamic modeling. We found that each configuration has advantages and disadvantages. This paper shows how strain gages embedded in silicone will behave in response to both static and dynamic excitations, and suggests modeling and fundamental concepts to design a bio-inspired artificial skin sensor.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel closed loop elastic structure which can generate snap-through buckling with bending and distortion. The proposed mechanical closed loop structure consists of two rotary shafts and a belt-shaped elastic material which two ends are connected to one active rotary shaft and one free joint type shaft, respectively. Driving the active rotary shaft continuously, we can obtain impulsive motion by using snap-through buckling repeatedly. The change of the driving torque and the angular momentum generated snap-through buckling are shown by numerical simulations. From these results, it is shown that an offset parameter of the proposed structure is useful for generating impulsive turning motions of the compact swimming robot. The proposed mechanism is applied to a compact swimming robot which can turn impulsively at a maximum rate of 135 deg/s underwater.",

        "abstract": "Most commercially-available robots are either aimed at the research community, or are designed with a single purpose in mind. The extensive hobbyist community has tended to focus on the hardware and the low-level software aspects. We claim that there is a need for a low-cost, general-purpose robot, accessible to the hobbyist community, with sufficient computation and sensing to run \u201cresearch-grade\u201d software. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of such a robot. We explicitly outline our design goals, and show how a capable robot can be assembled from off-the-shelf parts, for a modest cost, by a single person with only a few tools. We also show how the robot can be used as a low-cost telepresence platform, giving the system a concrete purpose beyond being a low-cost development platform.",

        "abstract": "The endoscopic guidance system for minimally invasive surgery presented here autonomously aligns the laparoscopic camera with the end-effectors of the surgeon's instruments. It collects information on the movements of the instruments from former interventions and can therefore predict them for autonomous guidance of the endoscopic camera. Knowledge is extracted by trajectory clustering, maximum likelihood classification and a Markov model to predict states. Alternative movements in an ongoing intervention are modeled. A first prototype of a robotic platform for minimally invasive surgery is described, which has two instrument arms, an autonomous robotic camera assistant and two haptic devices to control the instrument arms. The approach of long-term prediction and optimal camera positioning was tested in a phantom experiment with a hit rate of over 89% for predicting the movement of the end-effectors. Including this prediction for computing the camera position, leads to 29.2% less movements and to an improved visibility of the instruments.",

        "abstract": "Pneumatic, non-contact end effectors for robotic pick-and-place applications use compressed air to provide an adhesion force based on the Bernoulli principle, which creates a low pressure region near the surface of the end effector. However, consideration of the influence of the Bernoulli principle alone gives an inadequate account of the performance of some end effector designs. In fact, end effector geometry can be constructed in such a way that the Bernoulli principle provides only a small contribution to the overall adhesion force. This paper investigates the role of viscous flow entrainment in improving adhesion efficiency. Both simulation and experimental results show a significant improvement of adhesion force by nearly five times over a commercially available Bernoulli gripper, which makes the improved adhesion mechanism suitable for more demanding wall climbing robotic applications.",

The results show that nearly 80% of the time the house maid used just six grasps and the machinist used nine. This data, in conjunction with established grasp taxonomies, will enable a better understanding of how people utilize different grasps to accomplish tasks throughout the day, as well as inform the design of robotic and prosthetic hands.",

The goal is to provide the ROV operator with an approximated seafloor's visual map relatively rough. In order to have that map, it is important to get an accurate estimate of the location of the visual landmarks and, in particular, a correct data association when a visual landmark is re-visited by the vehicle. The proposed approach uses the combination of a set of local mosaics constructed in the proximity of the SLAM visual landmarks instead of using a global mosaic. The algorithm was tested using a batch of experimental data in typical operating conditions and the results show the effectiveness of the approach.",

The system is designed to provide high frequency pose estimates in unknown, GPS-denied indoor environments. It requires a minimal set of sensors including a planar laser range-finder and an IMU sensor. The code is optimized to run entirely onboard, so no wireless link and ground station are explicitly needed. A major focus in our work is modularity, allowing each component to be benchmarked individually, or swapped out for a different implementation, without change to the rest of the system. We demonstrate how the pose estimation can be used for 2D SLAM or 3D mapping experiments. All the software and hardware which we have developed, as well as extensive documentation and test data, is available online.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach for processing sequential data in the presence of outliers. The outlier-robust Kalman filter we propose is a discrete-time model for sequential data corrupted with non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise. We present efficient filtering and smoothing algorithms which are straightforward modifications of the standard Kalman filter Rauch-Tung-Striebel recursions and yet are much more robust to outliers and anomalous observations. Additionally, we present an algorithm for learning all of the parameters of our outlier-robust Kalman filter in a completely unsupervised manner. The potential of our approach is borne out in experiments with synthetic and real data.",

Due to the space of the deposited glass box is limited, the distance between the two substrates is very small, this requires the sag amount of the robot fork must be controlled within a certain range. The traditional design is completed only in robot manufacturing stage by adding a shim to compensate for this distortion, but this method can only make the fork be compensated at a determined location, deformation at other locations may not be considered. A new solution to the dynamic compensation for the robot fork is proposed. By establishing the robot FEA model and mechanism accuracy model respectively, the synthetic dynamic error is then obtained. One can just change the mechanism accuracy through rational allocation of design tolerances of the robot links to minimize the dynamic error.",

A dynamic model is established in this paper. Locomotion of the line-walking robot is discussed in detail and the line-walking cycle of the designed mechanism is composed of a single-support phase and a double-support phase. Finally, a PD+ gravity compensation method is introduced for the controller design in the single-support phase and a complaint controller with estimated force is implemented during the double-support phase. The feasibility of this concept is then confirmed by performing experiments with a simulated line environment.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A flexure-based parallel manipulator (FPM) is a closed-loop compliant mechanism in which the moving platform is connected to the base through a number of flexural legs. Utilizing parallel-kinematics configurations and flexure joints, the FPMs can achieve extremely high motion resolution and accuracy. In this work, we focus on the analysis and design of a 3-DOF (\u03b8x - \u03b8y - Z) zero-torsion FPM for nano-alignment applications. Among various possible zero-torsion parallel kinematics configurations, it is identified that the 3-legged Prismatic-Prismatic-Spherical (3PPS) is a suitable candidate. Based on the concept of instantaneous rotation, the critical kinematic design issues, such as displacement and workspace analyses, are addressed. With these analysis algorithms, the major kinematic parameters are readily determined to meet the task requirements. To achieve a large workspace, beam-based flexure joints are employed in the FPM design. As the beam based Universal (U) flexure joints are able to accommodate the required passive prismatic and spherical motions, each flexure PPS leg can be replaced by a simple flexure PU leg. A research prototype of the 3-DOF 3PU FPM has been developed, which achieves position and orientation resolutions of 20 nm and 0.05 arcsecond throughout a workspace of 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5 mm, respectively.",

A system including series elastic elements shows vibrational responses in the velocity space, and our concept is to use the velocity peak of the system for motions that need explosive power. By tuning parameters, we can obtain instantaneously higher velocity than without any spring. We constructed a mathematical model of a 1-Joint SMCS (including motor electrical properties) and confirmed the velocity increasing effect on SMCS by numerical analyses and real experiments. And we discovered existence of the most effective inertia balance between the motor shaft and the robot link, and proposed the optimum spring constant with consideration of the moveable range of the link. We confirmed the validity and the limitation of the criteria by the real experiments.",

The proposed method determines critically damped PD control trajectories that precisely obtain target position and velocity constraints for arbitrary initial conditions. An analytic solution provides the PD control parameters, thereby determining the required impedance. The resulting controller precisely interpolates the target state by solving the full boundary-value problem. Control parameters are time-invariant, and need only be recomputed if the system diverges from the computed trajectory due to unexpected forces or noise. The resulting method provides control with automatically determined compliance, yielding natural response to perturbation.",

Theta* assumes that cost of each cell, cell-cost, is uniform, but non-uniform costs are effective ways to represent traversability on grid maps. Theta* does not work on non-uniform costmaps. In this paper, we generalize Theta* toward non-uniform costmaps. To extend Theta*, we propose two kinds of cost functions considering non-uniform cell-costs. The first function adopts the arithmetic mean under the assumption that all cells contribute equally to the overall cost. The second function uses the weighted mean by considering the true traversal length on each cell. We applied the proposed methods to two types of maps: synthetic and real maps. An experiment on synthetic maps quantifies performance of the two methods in terms of accuracy and computing time. The other experiment on real maps presents the effectiveness of Theta* with the proposed methods. The generalized Theta* generated the least-cost path compared with the original Theta* and A* on non-uniform costmaps.",

        "abstract": "The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, based on incremental sampling, efficiently computes motion plans. Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor \"anytime\" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods. We also demonstrate experimental results for an outdoor wheeled robotic vehicle.",

These controllers, which also include an adaptive version, effectively exploit the passivity property satisfied by a suitably defined input and output for the system in con junction with an approximate model of the payload-dominated dynamics. Simulations as well as hardware implementation on an experimental flexible gantry robot demonstrate the efficacy of the schemes, which combine end-point tracking of prescribed trajectories together with active vibrations suppression.",

        "abstract": "Many envisioned applications of multi-robot swarms involve the detection, production or maintenance of global structures through only local means. This paper introduces a scalable, distributed algorithm to approximately characterize important global geometric and topological properties. For a given spatial arrangement of robots, the algorithm estimates the longest network (geodesic) distance in any direction as well as the average Euclidean distance only using locally sensed information. In so doing, the robots need only to communicate with and sense (range and bearing) nearby robots. The algorithm uses a greedy method to approximate both distance metrics via parallel one-way message traversals. We provide a bound for the number of such traversals, showing a global characterization is produced in a running time that is sublinear in the total number of robots. Along with this analysis, we conduct simulations with hundreds of robots to validate the algorithm.",

We describe a new visual fiducial system that uses a 2D bar code style \"tag\", allowing full 6 DOF localization of features from a single image. Our system improves upon previous systems, incorporating a fast and robust line detection system, a stronger digital coding system, and greater robustness to occlusion, warping, and lens distortion. While similar in concept to the ARTag system, our method is fully open and the algorithms are documented in detail.",

This paper expands on the mechanical design of a previous robot with a high mobility-to-size ratio. To accomplish high mobility the robot uses tumbling as its form of locomotion. By actively involving the body of the robot in the locomotion it can scale larger obstacles and will not get stuck in compliant terrain like similar sized wheeled robots. To accommodate real-world environments the new design has been waterproofed and moreover can be completely submerged in water to operate on a lake or stream floor. Additionally, this robot is equipped with a buoyancy control unit which will allow the robot to either sink or float in water, offering many unique applications in environmental monitoring and surveillance. This paper describes a first generation, radio controlled prototype of the design.",

We present a novel set of permanent magnet modules that are under 1 mm in all dimensions, called Mag-\u00b5Mods, for use in a reconfigurable micro-system. The modules are actuated by oscillating external magnetic fields of several mT in strength, and are capable of locomoting on a 2-D surface. Multiple modules are controlled using an electrostatic anchoring surface, which selectively prevents specific modules from being driven by the external field, while allowing others to move freely. We model the processes of both assembling and disassembling two modules by analyzing the forces the modules experience, and experimentally verify the accuracy of the models. For disassembly, we employ electrostatic anchoring and externally applied magnetic torques to successfully separate the modules.",

On top of that, a moving robot is also vulnerable to its loud fan noise that changes its orientation relative to the moving limbs where the microphones are mounted on. To tackle the non-stationary ego-motion noise and the direction changes of fan noise, we propose an estimation method based on instantaneous prediction of ego noise using parameterized templates. We verify the ego noise suppression capability of the proposed estimation method on a humanoid robot by evaluating it on two important applications in the framework of robot audition: (1) automatic speech recognition and (2) sound source localization. We demonstrate that our method improves recognition and localization performance during both head and arm motions considerably.",

The study is performed on a two-dimensional kneed bipedal simulator developed with Open Dynamics Engine, which includes realistic configuration of weight allocation, link length, inertia distribution and impacts. The controllers are model-based driven from an analytic 2D kneed biped. Several controllers from the Computed Torque (CT) family together with a Passivity Based controller (PBC) are compared based on their energy efficiency and robustness. The previous controllers are used in their original form, with minor adjustment to handle hybrid systems such as the kneed biped case. PBC proved not suitable for real implementation however a combined strategy between PBC and a soft PD control has shown promising results. PD Computed Torque control also offered high tolerance to disturbances with reasonable energy consumption. Furthermore, the performance of all the controllers showed high dependency on the parameters of the robot.",

For individuals with paralysis of the lower limb who have also lost the ability to extend the elbow, many motions become difficult to perform in daily life, for example, independently operating a wheelchair or pushing open doors. In the future, wearable assist robots are expected to be incorporated into daily life. In order to be wearable, the assist robot must not limit the user's range of motion while being carried or used, and must be suitable for a wide range of situations. In this study, we developed an assist robot for upper limb movement which can assist wheelchair operation. To achieve this, we constructed a model of the upper limb during wheelchair operation with a manipulating force ellipsoid, and we developed an assistance control method for the upper limb using the device to apply force vectors. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated experimentally.",

        "abstract": "As mobile remote presence (MRP) systems become more pervasive in everyday environments such as office spaces, it is important for operators to navigate through remote locations without running into obstacles. Human-populated environments frequently change (e.g., doors open and close, furniture is moved around) and mobile remote presence systems must be able to adapt to such changes and to avoid running into obstacles. As such, we implemented an assisted teleoperation feature for a MRP system and evaluated its effectiveness with a controlled user study, focusing on both the system-oriented dimensions (e.g., autonomous assistance vs. no assistance) and human-oriented dimensions (e.g., gaming experience, locus of control, and spatial cognitive abilities) (N=24). In a systems-only analysis, we found that the assisted teleoperation helped people avoid obstacles. However, assisted teleoperation also increased time to complete an obstacle course. When human-oriented dimensions were evaluated, gaming experience and locus of control affected speed of completing the course. Implications for future research and design are discussed.",

The control algorithm relies on a robust and computationally efficient sensory feedback, based on a complementary filter fusing data from different Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The almost global stability of the attitude estimator guarantees convergency and robustness to noise and parameters uncertainties, showing good performance of the vehicle in steering plane maneuvering. First, the controller was implemented to do point-to-point tracking of a desired roll angle while the robot was tethered. It was then implemented in a freely swimming robot to do trajectory tracking of a desired sinusoidal roll angle. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined roll/yaw coupling on the maneuveribility of the robot, the freely swimming robot was controlled to perform banked turns to circle the tank in loops.",

In this paper, the independent metering architecture that is considered uses five Electro-Hydraulic Poppet Valves (EHPV's). The proposed control method is applied to four of these valves, arranged in a Wheatstone bridge configuration, to regulate the flow of hydraulic oil coming into and out of an actuator. For simplicity, the fifth valve is operated via open-loop to control the supply pressure. Experimental data presented herein demonstrate that the control method learns the valve's conductance characteristics (i.e. the inverse input-state dynamic map of the valve) while simultaneously controlling the motion of the hydraulic actuator.",

Manually pipetting embryos into wells is tedious and time consuming. This paper reports a prototype cooperative robotic system capable of transferring zebrafish embryos in parallel and depositing a single embryo per well in a 96-well microplate. A cell holding device was developed to trap multiple embryos in a regular pattern. The cell holding device and a microplate are positioned and aligned along multiple axes by the system. Embryo release strategies were systematically studied and compared. Experiments demonstrated that out of the 1,056 zebrafish embryos used in experiments (i.e., 44 times parallel transfer into 11 96-well plates), 996 wells were successfully filled with one and only one zebrafish embryo, representing a success rate of 94.3%. Further experiments confirmed that the transferred embryos were able to develop into zebrafish with 100% survival rate.",

        "abstract": "This paper is the first report of robotic ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection). ICSI is a clinical procedure performed worldwide in fertility clinics, requiring pick-up of a single sperm and insert it into oocyte (i.e., an egg cell). Since its invention 20 years ago, ICSI has been conducted manually by a handful of highly skilled embryologists; however, success rates vary significantly among clinics due to poor reproducibility and inconsistency across operators. We leverage our work in robotic cell injection to realize robotic ICSI and aim ultimately, to standardize how clinical ICSI is performed. This paper presents some of the technical aspects of our robotic ICSI system, including a cell holding device and motion control and computer vision algorithms. The system performs visual tracking of single sperm, robotic immobilization of sperm, aspiration of sperm with pico-liter volume, and insertion of sperm into an oocyte with a high degree of reproducibility. The system requires minimal human involvement (requiring only a few computer mouse clicking), and is human operator skill independent. Using the hamster oocyte-human sperm model in preliminary trials, the robotic system demonstrated a high success rate of 90.0% and survival rate of 90.7% (n=120).",

The use of autonomous vehicles equipped with LADAR systems to conduct fully automatic surveys of terrain, infrastructures, or just to navigate safely in unknown environments, motivates the research on increasingly precise LADAR data acquisition and processing algorithms, for which the determination of the correct installation matrix is critical. The proposed methods rely on the minimization of the errors between several acquired data sets, by comparing each measured data set and a surface representation of the others. This error functional is minimized resorting to optimization tools for Riemannian manifolds enabling direct estimation of the installation matrix on the group of special orthogonal matrices SO(3). The proposed technique is extensively tested using simulated LADAR data sets under realistic acquisition conditions.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of autonomously flying Miniature Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in indoor environments such as home and office buildings. The primary long range sensor in these MAVs is a miniature camera. While previous approaches first try to build a 3D model in order to do planning and control, our method neither attempts to build nor requires a 3D model. Instead, our method first classifies the type of indoor environment the MAV is in, and then uses vision algorithms based on perspective cues to estimate the desired direction to fly. We test our method on two MAV platforms: a co-axial miniature helicopter and a toy quadrotor. Our experiments show that our vision algorithms are quite reliable, and they enable our MAVs to fly in a variety of corridors and staircases.",

We derive an information gain based variant of the next best view algorithm in order to determine how the manipulator should move the object in front of the camera. By considering occlusions caused by the robot manipulator, our technique also determines when and how the robot should re-grasp the object in order to build a complete model.",

        "abstract": "Although mobile robots are increasingly being used in real-world applications, the ability to robustly sense and interact with the environment is still missing. A key requirement for the widespread deployment of mobile robots is the ability to operate autonomously by learning desired environmental models and revising the learned models in response to environmental changes. This paper presents an approach that enables a mobile robot to autonomously learn layered models for environmental objects using temporal, local and global visual cues. A temporal assessment of image gradient features is used to detect candidate objects, which are then modeled using color distribution statistics and a spatial representation of gradient features. The robot incrementally revises the learned models and uses them for object recognition and tracking based on a matching scheme comprising a spatial similarity measure and second order distribution statistics. All algorithms are implemented and tested on a wheeled robot platform in dynamic indoor environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The movement of autonomous agents in natural environments is restricted by potentially large numbers of constraints. To generate behavior that fulfills all given constraints simultaneously, the attractor dynamics approach to movement generation represents each constraint by a dynamical system with attractors or repellors at desired or undesired values of a relevant variable. These dynamical systems are transformed into vector fields over the control variables of a robotic agent that force the state of the whole system in directions beneficial to the satisfaction of the behavioral constraint. The attractor dynamics approach was recently successfully applied to the generation of manipulator motion trajectories avoiding collision with obstacles [1] and constraints on gripper orientation during reaching and grasping movements [2]. Continuing that body of work, this paper proposes a system which generates movements satisfying both obstacle avoidance and gripper orientation constraints simultaneously. As an extension, the additional constraint of avoiding hardware limits for joint angles is included. Properties of the resulting system are demonstrated by a systematic study generating movements with a large number of constraints in different scene setups. Specific characteristics are highlighted by several showcase example movements.",

Aerial vehicles offer mobility and perspective advantages over ground platforms and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are particularly applicable to buildings with multiple floors where stairwells can be an obstacle to ground vehicles.

For these reasons, in this work we focus on autonomous navigation in buildings with multiple floors without requiring an external source of localization or prior knowledge of the environment. To ensure that the robot is fully autonomous, we require all computation to occur on the robot without need for external infrastructure, communication, or human interaction beyond high-level commands.

The fittings of pipelines such as elbows and branches can be used as the landmarks. In this paper, we introduce a noise tolerant landmark detection method using a line laser beam projected on the internal surface of the pipeline. Once the line laser is projected on the surface of landmarks, a unique line pattern is generated. By using this line pattern, the robot can easily detect and distinguish these landmarks while recognizing the direction of the pipeline path. Simultaneously, the robot's pose information from the orientation sensor and the driving motor's encoder is continuously recorded and used to reconstruct a map of the pipelines. By using this map and a specific navigation strategy, the robot can navigate in the 3D pipeline autonomously. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments using the in-pipe robot called MRINSPECT V.",

A motorized unit can prevent the sensor from washing ashore or heading into dangerous areas, expanding the mission regions in which they can be feasibly operated. In this article, we present a control frame work and describe the physically realized system used to prove its effectiveness. The controller uses two minimum-time-to-reach (MTTR) functions-one giving the time to reach the center of the river and one giving the time to reach the shoreline. The MTTR functions are constructed from solutions to Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) Equations. Contours along these functions are used to define the state transition thresholds for an on-off controller. The first MTTR function is also used to construct the optimal bearing to travel back to the center of the river. We investigate the effectiveness of the controller using a software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulator. Using prototypes built at UC Berkeley, results from a field operational test in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta are then presented to validate the simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Exploring planetary surfaces typically involves traversing challenging and unknown terrain and acquiring insitu measurements at designated locations using arm-mounted instruments. We present field results for a new implementation of an autonomous capability that enables a rover to traverse and precisely place an arm-mounted instrument on remote targets. Using point-and-click mouse commands, a scientist designates targets in the initial imagery acquired from the rover's mast cameras. The rover then autonomously traverses the rocky terrain for a distance of 10 - 15 m, tracks the target(s) of interest during the traverse, positions itself for approaching the target, and then precisely places an arm-mounted instrument within 2-3 cm from the originally designated target. The rover proceeds to acquire science measurements with the instrument. This work advances what has been previously developed and integrated on the Mars Exploration Rovers by using algorithms that are capable of traversing more rock-dense terrains, enabling tight thread-the-needle maneuvers. We integrated these algorithms on the newly refurbished Athena Mars research rover and fielded them in the JPL Mars Yard. We conducted 43 runs with targets at distances ranging from 5 m to 15 m and achieved a success rate of 93% for placement of the instrument within 2-3 cm.",

In particular, we describe a system by which a SLAM-generated map of an office environment can be annotated with text labels such as room numbers and the names of office occupants. These labels are acquired automatically from signs posted on walls throughout a building. Deploying such a system using current text recognition systems, however, is difficult since even state-of-the-art systems have difficulty reading text from non-document images. Despite these difficulties we present a series of additions to the typical mapping pipeline that nevertheless allow us to create highly usable results. In fact, we show how our text detection and recognition system, combined with several other ingredients, allows us to generate an annotated map that enables our robot to recognize named locations specified by a user in 84% of cases.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS) is an actuator which can independently control equilibrium position and stiffness by two motors. The first motor controls the equilibrium position while the second motor regulates the compliance. This paper describes the design and development of AwAS-II which is an improved version of the original realization. AwAS tuned the stiffness by controlling the location of the springs and adjusting its arm, length. Instead AwAS-II regulates the compliance by implementing a force amplifier based on a lever mechanism on which a pivot point can adjust the force amplification ratio from zero to infinitive. As in the first implementation, the actuator which is responsible for adjusting the stiffness in AwAS II is not working against the spring forces. Its displacement is perpendicular to the force generated by springs which makes changing the stiffness energetically efficient. As the force amplification ratio can theoretically change from zero to infinitive consequently the level of stiffness can tune from very soft to completely rigid. Because this range does not depends on the spring's rate and length of the lever, thus soft springs and small lever can be used which result in a lighter and more compact setup. Furthermore as the lever arm is shorter the time required for the stiffness regulation is smaller.",

        "abstract": "Evidence grids are a popular representation for fused data from multiple sensors. Previous attempts at back-ground subtraction within evidence grids either do so prior to sensor fusion or do so naively, simply ignoring any cells with a high background occupancy probability. A key weakness of these approaches is that they cannot reason about interiors of objects or other unobserved regions. Recognizing and removing solid object interiors is important for any application that must be able to differentiate between occupied and unknown space after background subtraction. In this paper, we propose accessibility analysis as a method for the removal of interior regions. We then present and compare two approaches for performing background subtraction with accessibility analysis in evidence grids. Performance is measured using a 3D evidence grid in a test bed for a sensing system designed for use in safety monitoring of an automated assembly workcell. Within the parameters of the present study, both techniques allow for precise detection of foreground objects while fully removing background objects. Subtraction runs in near real-time, even for large grids.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a novel framework for multimodal categorization using Bag of multimodal LDA models is proposed. The main issue, which is tackled in this paper, is granularity of categories. The categories are not fixed but varied according to context. Selective attention is the key to model this granularity of categories. This fact motivates us to introduce various sets of weights to the perceptual information. Obviously, as the weights change, the categories vary. In the proposed model, various sets of weights and model structures are assumed. Then the multimodal LDA-based categorization is carried out many times that results in a variety of models. In order to make the categories (concepts) useful for inference, significant models should be selected. The selection process is carried out through the interaction between the robot and the user. These selected models enable the robot to infer unobserved properties of the object. For example, the robot can infer audio information only from its appearance. Furthermore, the robot can describe appearance of any objects using some suitable words, thanks to the connection between words and perceptual information. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a robot platform and preliminary experiment is carried out to validate the proposed algorithm.",

We first present the motorcycle dynamics with an accurate steering mechanism model with consideration of lateral movement of the tire/ground contact point. A nonlinear balance controller is then designed. We estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of motorcycle dynamics under which the stationary motorcycle can be stabilized by steering. For a typical motorcycle/bicycle configuration, we find that the DOA is relatively small and thus balancing control by only steering at stationary is challenging. The balance control and DOA estimation schemes are validated by experiments conducted on the Rutgers autonomous motorcycle. The attitudes of the motorcycle platform are obtained by a novel estimation scheme that fuses measurements from global positioning systems (GPS) and inertial measurement units (IMU). We also present the experiments of the GPS/IMU-based attitude estimation scheme in the paper.",

The control framework consists of two primary components: a balance controller and a footstep planner. The balance controller is responsible for the balance of the whole system and combines a state-feedback controller designed by pole assignment with an observer to estimate the system's current state. A wheeled linear inverted pendulum is used as a simplified model of the robot in the controller design. Taking the output of the balance controller, namely the ideal center of pressure of the biped robot on the ball, as the input, the footstep planner computes the foot placements for the robot to track the ideal center of pressure and avoid a fall from the rolling ball. Simulation results show that the proposed controller can enable a biped robot to stably walk on balls of different sizes and rotate a ball to desired positions at desired speeds.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of outliers in a batch alignment problem (given heterogeneous measurements and sparse features) is considered. The conventional approach from the field of computer vision, pairwise RANSAC, is shown to be inappropriate for this scenario, which motivates the need for a new method. To address this problem, the heterogeneous measurements are compared in a common currency using their respective scaled measurement innovations. Furthermore, a family of three algorithms for classifying outliers given a hypothesis model are presented, each having its own balance between speed and accuracy. These classification criteria are then incorporated through iterative reclassification in a batch alignment framework, providing a robust estimate for localization and mapping. Lastly, statistical validation is obtained through a large set of simulated trials.",

        "abstract": "When it comes to AGVs (Automated Guide Vehicles) working in intelligent warehouse systems it is necessary to take into account that the use of batteries may impact the performance of the overall system. They need to be recharged or changed, and the time required to execute these operations might interfere in the AGV availability. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a battery management procedure to ensure that the batteries have sufficient charges to perform the desired tasks. This paper describes a method based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the Batteries State of Charge (SOC). The estimated consumption is compared with the SOC obtained by the EKF. A series of experiments using mini-robotic forklifts were performed to evaluate the method. The experimental results have shown its effectiveness using resistive loads. This methodology allowed estimating the battery consumption for a certain route of the mini-robotic forklift in the warehouse and verifying the load capacity available for the mini-robotic forklift to accomplish a task assigned by the warehouse routing system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel self-supervised on-line learning method to discover driving behaviors from data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera. Both sensors where mounted in a car that was driven by a human through a typical city environment with intersections, pedestrian crossings and traffic lights. The presented system extracts motion segments from the IMU data and relates them to visual cues obtained from camera data. It employs a Bayesian on-line estimation method to discover the motion segments based on change-point detection and uses a Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM) model to represent the visual features extracted from the camera images. By incorporating these visual cues into the on-line estimation process, labels are computed that are equal for similar motion segments. As a result, typical traffic situations such as braking maneuvers in front of a red light can be identified automatically. Furthermore, appropriate actions in form of observed motion changes are associated to the discovered traffic situations. The approach is evaluated on a real data set acquired in the center of Zurich.",

        "abstract": "Nonlinear estimation problems, such as bearingonly tracking, are often addressed using linearized estimators, e.g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF). These estimators generally suffer from linearization errors as well as the inability to track multimodal probability density functions (pdfs). In this paper, we propose a bank of batch maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators as a general estimation framework that provides relinearization of the entire state history, multi-hypothesis tracking, and an efficient hypothesis generation scheme. Each estimator in the bank is initialized using a locally optimal state estimate for the current time step. Every time a new measurement becomes available, we convert the nonlinear cost function corresponding to this relaxed one-step subproblem into polynomial form, allowing to analytically and efficiently compute all stationary points. This local optimization generates highly probable hypotheses for the target trajectory and greatly improves the quality of the overall MAP estimate. Additionally, pruning and marginalization are employed to control the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the EKF, the standard batch MAP estimator, and the particle filter (PF), in terms of accuracy and consistency.",

Through these researches, several soft rubber actuators driven pneumatically have been developed. The typical one is FMA (Flexible Microactuator), which realizes continuous bending motions like a human finger. In addition, we are recently interested in several novel functions appeared on soft mechanism surfaces such as repellency, hydrophily, friction, structural color, and adhesiveness, which are realized with micro scale soft structures fabricated on the surfaces. We believe novel additional functions can be realized by utilizing the deformability of the soft structures. In this paper, micro grating structures made from silicone rubber are reported. Because of its elastic property, it can realize changing structural color. The experimental results show that beautiful color change can be observed. We fabricate a soft micro grating structure on FMA and confirm the appearance of structural color, which changes in following FMA's motion. This color change indicates distributed information of the strain of FMA, which may be used for servo control of FMA in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract-In this paper, we propose an automatic behavior recognition algorithm for laboratory mice to determine their typical model behaviors and hence detect the degrees of diseases via animal testings for behavioral pharmacology. The algorithm can quantify several model behaviors of mice by detecting the repetitive motions of fore or hind limbs at several hertz; these motions, too rapid for the naked eye and the NTSC cameras, are captured on a high-frame-rate video. Even when a mouse changes its position and orientation, the algorithm can always detect these repetitive motions as periodic frame differential image features on four segmented regions-head, left side, right side, and tail-because the silhouette image of a mouse is converted in the polar coordinate system as its shift and rotation-invariant shape by detecting the positions of its head and tail. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated for six typical model behaviors, including scratching and grooming, by analyzing the experimental results for several laboratory mice, obtained by capturing long-term videos at 240 fps. We have provided the detection/correction ratios and compared the time durations of the model behaviors of these mice.",

Previous works have employed different filtering and data association techniques for this purpose that typically rely on a set of generic assumptions on target behavior and detector characteristics. In this paper, we focus on these assumptions rather than the tracking approach itself and show that with informed models, people tracking can be made substantially more accurate without compromising efficiency. Concretely, we present better, human-specific models for the occurrence of new tracks, false alarms, track occlusions, and track deletions. In the experiments with a large-scale outdoor data set collected with a laser range finder, the models and combinations thereof are experimentally compared using a multi-hypothesis baseline tracker and the CLEAR MOT metrics. The results show how some models selectively improve tracking performance at the expense of other measures. The final combination is then able to resolve the trade-offs, leading to a reduction of data association errors by more than a factor of two at the same cost.",

In the frequency domain, passivity of a linear time invariant approximation of the system can be designed for a considered set of operating conditions. Non-linear control structures have been proposed that enforce passivity of the system in the time domain. In this paper, extensions are proposed that increase the complimentarity of the frequency- and time domain approaches. The combination of both approaches allows a guaranteed measure of transparency to be designed in the frequency domain for a desired set of operating conditions. For operating conditions outside the desired set, stable interaction is guaranteed by the non-linear passivity enforcing control structure. Simulation results of the combined approach are presented that show that the stability properties of the bilateral controller designed in the frequency domain are improved and the transparency properties are improved with respect to those of the standard passivity-enforcing algorithm in the time domain.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on biomimetic sensory motor control of a robotic arm. We have developed a command circuit that was mathematically deduced from physical and mathematical constraints describing the function of cerebellar pathways. The control circuit contains an internal predictive model of the direct biomechanical function of the limb placed in a closed loop, so that the circuit computes an approximate inverse function. The structure of the model resembles the anatomic connectivity of the cerebellar pathways. In this paper, we present an application of this model to the control of a 2-link robotic arm actuated by four single-joint McKibben muscles and report the results obtained by simulation and real-time learning of 2 degrees of freedom pointing movements.",

By examining local patterns of optical flow, we make predictions on an object's trajectory with respect to a stationary observer, and its time-to-contact with the observer's (assumed planar) body. Such a cue may serve as inputs to motor responses for reactive threat avoidance, or object interception (such as catching a ball). The presented approach is based on the observed behaviour of neurons in the F4 region of the pre-motor cortex of primates and it is part of a larger project which aims at modelling multi-sensory neurons and their contribution to reaching behaviour on the iCub humanoid platform. We present preliminary experimental results of a computation model of F4's visual responses using real image sequences acquired from the robot, and demonstrate their application in a real-time threat detection/prediction system.",

We first discuss a method for simulating tactile feedback using a soft finger contact model in Grasplt!, which is a robotic grasping simulator [10]. Using this simulation technique, we compute tactile contacts of thousands of grasps with a robotic hand using the Columbia Grasp Database [6]. The tactile contacts along with the hand kinematic data are then input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is trained to estimate the stability of a given grasp based on this tactile feedback and also the robotic hand kinematics. Experimental results indicate that the tactile feedback along with the hand kinematic data carry meaningful information for the prediction of the stability of a blind robotic grasp.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel method for visual loop-closure detection in autonomous robot navigation. Our method, which we refer to as bag-of-raw-features or BoRF, uses scale-invariant visual features (such as SIFT) directly, rather than their vector-quantized representation or bag-of-words (BoW), which is popular in recent studies of the problem. BoRF avoids the offline process of vocabulary construction, and does not suffer from the perceptual aliasing problem of BoW, thereby significantly improving the recall performance. To reduce the computational cost of direct feature matching, we exploit the fact that images in the case of robot navigation are acquired sequentially, and that feature matching repeatability with respect to scale can be learned and used to reduce the number of the features considered for matching. The proposed method is tested experimentally using indoor visual SLAM image sequences.",

The system is composed by four robotic limbs with anthropomorphic kinematics and has a total of 22 independently actuated degrees of freedom. The leg locomotion and the force servo-amplification allow operations in environments that are hardly accessible by the conventional handling systems preserving the force sensibility during the manipulative tasks. Possible applications are handling of military materials in narrow spaces, rescuing of victims in natural and human provoked disasters and handling of heavy parts in the manufacturing of large products. The paper reports the system specifications taken as a reference for the design, the criteria and verification methods, the architectural solutions used for the implementation of mechanics, electronic and control components and the results of the preliminary experimental assessment.",

        "abstract": "Recently, several image gradient and edge based features have been introduced. In unison, they all discovered that object shape is a strong cue for recognition and tracking. Generally their basic feature extraction relies on pixel-wise gradient or edge computation using discrete filter masks, while scale invariance is later achieved by higher level operations like accumulating histograms or abstracting edgels to line segments. In this paper we show a novel and fast way to compute region based gradient features which are scale invariant themselves. We developed specialized, quick learnable weak classifiers that are integrated into our adaptively boosted observation model for particle filter based tracking. With an ensemble of region based gradient features this observation model is able to reliably capture the shape of the tracked object. The observation model is adapted to new object and background appearances while tracking. Thus we developed advanced methods to decide when to update the model, or in other words, if the filter is on target or not. We evaluated our approach using the BoBoT1 as well as the PROST2 datasets.",

This class of models is simple, yet general enough to represent the main phenomena of three representative sensors (field sampler, camera, and range-finder), apparently very different from one another. It also allows a bootstrapping algorithm based on Hebbian learning, and a simple bioplausible control strategy. The convergence properties of learning and control are demonstrated with extensive simulations and by analytical arguments.",

We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) for estimating the identity of the article and tracking the article's configuration throughout a specific sequence of manipulations and observations. At the end of this sequence, the article's configuration is known, though not necessarily desired. The estimated identity and configuration of the article are then used to plan a second sequence of manipulations that brings the article into the desired configuration. We propose a relaxation of a strain limiting finite element model for cloth simulation that can be solved via convex optimization; this serves as the basis of the transition and observation models of the HMM. The observation model uses simple perceptual cues consisting of the height of the article when held by a single gripper and the silhouette of the article when held by two grippers. The model accurately estimates the identity and configuration of clothing articles, enabling our procedure to autonomously bring a variety of articles into desired configurations that are useful for other tasks, such as folding.",

These two heterogeneous types of line features were developed as independent SLAM features and combined to represent the environment in a more complete fashion.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the behavior design and multimodal locomotion control of a biomimetic amphibious robot based on a bio-inspired CPG (central pattern generator). A set of four key parameters are introduced serving as external stimuli to shape the CPG rhythmic activities where necessary speed and orientation modulation as well as 3-D locomotion can be obtained. In terms of the built parameter set, a library of movement primitives based on finite state machine is established to facilitate rapid and smooth gait transitions. To enhance adaptive behaviors, well-integrated sensory feedback by means of two liquid-level detectors enables the gait transition between ground and water autonomously. Simulations and experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of a behavior-based control architecture governed by CPGs.",

        "abstract": "Maximal clearance is an important property that is highly desirable in multi-agent motion planning. However, it is also inherently difficult to attain. We propose a novel approach to achieve maximal clearance by exploiting the ability of evenly distributing a set of points by a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT). We adapt the CVT framework to multi agent motion planning by adding an extra time dimension and optimize the trajectories of the agents in the augmented domain. As an optimization framework, our method can work naturally on complex regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in achieving maximal clearance in motion planning with some examples.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a technique for calibration of an eye-to-hand system. The target of the hand-eye calibration is to estimate the geometric transformation between the hand and the eye. This calibration method further considers camera intrinsic parameters and geometric relations of a working plane in space at the same time. A laser pointer casually mounted on the hand is utilized. By manipulating the robot and projecting the laser beam on a plane of unknown orientations, a batch of related image positions of light-spots are extracted from images of the camera. Since the laser is rigidly mounted and the plane is fixed at each orientation, the geometric parameters and measurement data must obey a certain nonlinear constraints and the solutions of parameters can be estimated accordingly. A close-form solution is developed by decoupling the nonlinear equations into linear forms to compute all of the initial values. As a result, the calibration method does not need any manual initial guess of the unknown parameters. To achieve a higher accuracy, a nonlinear optimization method is implemented to refine the estimation. The advantage of using laser pointer is that this technique can be used for the case when the eye does not see the hand. Experimental results of simulations and real data are presented to show the validity and the simple requirements of the proposed algorithm.",

Locomotion movements of robot chains are generated by the local interaction of CPG running inside each module. Hormone messages are used to propagate sensory feedback information to the CPG thus providing a way to define general motor primitives regardless of the specific role of a module and the configuration of the robotic structure. An example set of motor primitives is defined using the hybrid approach and tested in a simulated environment. Our results showed that the integration of the motor primitives using the hybrid strategy allows the robot to travel through an obstacle-filled uneven terrain.",

        "abstract": "Robotic exoskeletons can apply forces distributed on the limbs of the subject they are connected to. This offers a great potential in the field of neurorehabilitation, to address the impairment of interjoint coordination in hemiparetic stroke patients. In these patients, the normal flexible joint rotation synergies are replaced by pathological fixed patterns of rotation. In this paper, we investigate how the concept of synergy can be exploited in the control of an upper limb exoskeleton. The long term goal is to develop a device capable of changing the joint synchronization of a patient performing exercises during rehabilitation. The paper presents a controller able of generating joint viscous torques in such a way that constraints on joint velocities can be imposed to the subject without constraining the hand motion. On another hand, the same formalism is used to describe synergies observed on the arm joint motion of subjects realizing pointing tasks. This approach is experimented on a 4 Degrees Of Freedom (DoF) upper arm exoskeleton with subjects performing pointing 3-dimensional tasks. Results exhibit the basic properties of the controller and show its capacity to impose an arbitrary chosen synergy without affecting the hand motion.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel oscillating nano knife for single cell cutting at its native state was proposed. The nano knife with a small edge angle 5\u00b0 was fabricated from a commercial AFM cantilever by focused ion beam (FIB) etching. The spring constant of the nano knife was calibrated by nanorobotic manipulation method. A piezo actuator was employed to generate the vibration of the nano knife. The oscillating amplitude response to the applied voltage was calculated based on the realtime image observation. Single yeast cell (W303) cutting using oscillating nano knife was performed based on the nanorobotic manipulation system inside an environment-SEM. The maximum cutting forces and the slices angle were measured from the deformation of the nano knife beam and the single cell. The result showed the oscillating nano knife was capable and effective for single cell cutting task.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about the autonomous acquisition of detailed 3D maps of a-priori unknown environments using a stereo camera - it is about choosing where to go. Our approach hinges upon a boundary value constrained partial differential equation (PDE) - the solution of which provides a scalar field guaranteed to have no local minima. This scalar field is trivially transformed into a vector field in which following lines of max flow causes provably complete exploration of the environment in full 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF). We use a SLAM system to infer the position of a stereo pair in real time and fused stereo depth maps to generate the boundary conditions which drive exploration. Our exploration algorithm is parameter free, is as applicable to 3D laser data as it is to stereo, is real time and is guaranteed to deliver complete exploration. We show empirically that it performs better than oft-used frontier based approaches and demonstrate our system working with real and simulated data.",

Using only visual sensors, the robot identifies and extracts items sequentially from the pile. When an item has been removed and isolated, a model is captured of the shape and appearance of the object, which is then compared against a database of known items. The classification procedure relies upon silhouettes, edges, and other low-level image measurements of the articles of clothing. The contributions of this paper are a novel method for extracting articles of clothing from a pile of laundry and a novel method of classifying clothing using interactive perception. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the system to efficiently classify and label into one of six categories (pants, shorts, short-sleeve shirt, long-sleeve shirt, socks, or underwear). These results show that, on average, classification rates using robot interaction are 59% higher than those that do not use interaction.",

        "abstract": "We explore the problem where a group of robots with different velocities search for a target in an unbounded unknown environment. The target position is un known, hence, an online search algorithm is developed. The H-MRSTM algorithm (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Search Time Multiplication), launches a group of n robots from a common starting location to search for the target. The robots are assigned to search inside a series of concentric discs with increasing radii. Each robot is assigned to search inside a disc and when completing the search inside this disc without finding the target, the robot is assigned to search in the next unoccupied disc. We prove that every algorithm that solves this search problem must have at least a quadratic time competitive complexity and prove that the H-MRSTM algorithm's complexity is also quadratic. Hence, we obtain both an upper and lower bound on the time competitive complexity of the search problem. Consequently, H-MRSTM is proved to be optimal. Simulations in various environments show that the average case performance of H-MRSTM is superior to that of homogeneous multi-robot and single robot algorithms. In depth simulation analyses evaluated the effect of several other parameters such as the initial disc search time, the distribution of the velocities, the number of robots and the position of the target.",

Our approach represents a compact linear and multirate solution for estimating complementary information to regular essential matrix computation, namely the scale of the problem.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of data fusion when the adopted sensors are a monocular camera and inertial sensors (i.e. one tri-axial accelerometer and one tri-axial gyrometer). The investigation starts by performing an observability analysis to analytically derive all the observable modes, i.e. all the physical quantities that the information contained in the sensor data allows us to estimate. They are the position of the features in the camera frame, the vehicle speed in the same local frame and the absolute roll and pitch angles. The main contribution of the paper is a new algorithm to simultaneously estimate all the previous physical quantities. In particular, the algorithm is based on a closed-form solution which analytically expresses the vehicle speed and attitude in terms of the sensor measurements. In this algorithm the camera only needs to observe four times a single point feature in the environment. This allows performing the overall estimation in a very short time interval and without the need of any initialization or a priori knowledge. This is a key advantage since allows eliminating the drift on the scale factor and on the vehicle orientation. In addition, the algorithm can be easily extended in order to deal with biased inertial measurements and to deal with multiple features, in which case only three distinct camera poses are required (instead of four). Specifically, with three camera poses and two features, the vehicle speed and attitude together with the scale factor can be determined. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations and by using real data.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of motion planning for linear, Gaussian systems, and extends existing chance constrained optimal control solutions [1], [2] by incorporating the closed-loop uncertainty of the system and by reducing the conservativeness in the constraints. Due to the imperfect knowledge of the system state caused by motion uncertainty and sensor noise, the constraints cannot be guaranteed to be satisfied and consequently must be considered probabilistically. In this work, they are formulated as convex constraints on a univariate Gaussian random variable, with the violation probability of all the constraints guaranteed to be below a threshold. This threshold is a tuning parameter which trades off the performance of the system and the conservativeness of the solution. In contrast to similar methods, the proposed work considers the specific estimator and controller used in the closed-loop system in order to directly characterize the a priori distribution of the closed-loop system state. Using this distribution, a convex optimization program is formulated to solve for the optimal solution for the closed-loop system. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated through several examples.",

        "abstract": "Functional muscle tissue holds promise as a practical actuator for use in engineering applications. Previously, functional live-cell muscle actuators used for robotics have not scaled greater than about 10 \u03bcm, the size of a single monolayer of cells. We present a method to produce larger scale muscle actuators fully integrated into a mechanical structure. We use manufacturing techniques including printing a mold, pouring a molded part, and deposition of cell suspension. Our method allows for co-fabrication of actuator and mechanism through muscle self-assembly. We incorporate muscle construct technologies such that the muscle is fully 3D, anchored, and aligned, yielding a 10 mm long and 0.5 mm thick aligned muscle actuator. By co-fabricating the mechanism and actuators, the muscles are produced and used in the same environmental conditions, the process is more robust and repeatable, and evaluation of performance is under identical conditions to those in which the actuator is used. By using the presented method, variable geometry and multiple degrees of freedom can all be incorporated in a single mechanical structure.",

        "abstract": "Grasp planning based on perceived sensor data of an object can be performed in different ways, depending on the chosen semantic interpretation of the sensed data. For example, if the object can be recognized and a complete 3D model is available, a different planning tool can be selected compared to the situation in which only the raw sensed data, such as a single point cloud, is available. Instead of choosing between these options, we present a framework that combines them, aiming to find consensus on how the object should be grasped by using the information from each object representation according to their confidence levels. We show that this method is robust to common errors in perception, such as incorrect object recognition, while also taking into account potential grasp execution errors due to imperfect robot calibration. We illustrate this method on the PR2 robot by grasping objects common in human environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents methodologies to accelerate the registration of 3D point cloud segments by using hue data from the associated imagery. The proposed variant of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm combines both normalized point range data and weighted hue value calculated from RGB data of an image registered 3D point cloud. A k-d tree based nearest neighbor search is used to associated common points in {x, y, z, hue} 4D space. The unknown rigid translation and rotation matrix required for registration is iteratively solved using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. A mobile robot mounted scanner was used to generate color point cloud segments over a large area. The 4D ICP registration has been compared with typical 3D ICP and numerical results on the generated map segments shows that the 4D method resolves ambiguity in registration and converges faster than the 3D ICP.",

To improve existing procedures for 3D data acquisition this paper proposes a novel method for sensor combination on a stereo and a Time-of-Flight camera system. By calibrating the two sensor systems to each other, valid measurements from the 2.5D Time-of-Flight sensor are converted to disparity guesses within the stereo system. The disparity guesses from the Time-of-Flight data constrain the correspondence search results from the stereo matching algorithm. It is empirically shown, that the proposed method effectively enhance the results from stereo vision, especially in structureless areas where stereo correspondence search fails. The method is evaluated on the camera system of the service robot Care-O-bot\u00ae 3.",

        "abstract": "A humanoid neck design with low motion noise yields a cable-driven parallel manipulator to imitate two axis rotational motion of a human neck. The fixed base and moving platform of the manipulator are connected by four cables and a column compression spring. The four cables are actuated separately, while the spring can support weight on the moving platform. Although similar manipulators exist in literature, the analysis for them is scarce. The difficulty is that while traditional parallel manipulator usually has a rigid kinematic chain as the spine, this manipulator has a flexible spring. With the spring's lateral bending motion, new approach must be adopted to solve the kinematics. In this paper, we propose a method which combines the kinematics with the statics to solve them simultaneously. We parameterize the posture of the moving platform with four parameters and consider one of them as parasitic motion. Using the spring bending equation, we can obtain the parasitic motion and solve the inverse position problem. The analysis in this paper provides a novel way to analyze parallel manipulator with a spring spine, and it can be applied to other manipulators with flexible spines.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a formal framework that combines high-level representation and causality-based reasoning with low-level geometric reasoning and motion planning. The frame-work features bilateral interaction between task and motion planning, and embeds geometric reasoning in causal reasoning, thanks to several advantages inherited from its underlying components. In particular, our choice of using a causality-based high-level formalism for describing action domains allows us to represent ramifications and state/transition constraints, and embed in such formal domain descriptions externally defined functions implemented in some programming language (e.g., C++). Moreover, given such a domain description, the causal reasoner based on this formalism (i.e., the Causal Calculator) allows us to compute optimal solutions (e.g., shortest plans) for elaborate planning/prediction problems with temporal constraints. Utilizing these features of high-level representation and reasoning, we can combine causal reasoning, motion planning and geometric planning to find feasible kinematic solutions to task-level problems. In our framework, the causal reasoner guides the motion planner by finding an optimal task-plan; if there is no feasible kinematic solution for that task-plan then the motion planner guides the causal reasoner by modifying the planning problem with new temporal constraints. Furthermore, while computing a task-plan, the causal reasoner takes into account geometric models and kinematic relations by means of external predicates implemented for geometric reasoning (e.g., to check some collisions); in that sense the geometric reasoner guides the causal reasoner to find feasible kinematic solutions. We illustrate an application of this framework to robotic manipulation, with two pantograph robots on a complex assembly task that requires concurrent execution of actions. A short video of this application accompanies the paper.",

To make the direct comparison between a VR and real robots possible, the same designed robots in both VR and real are used in the experiment. For evaluating the robots on a psychological basis, we focused on six basic dimensions (Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness) that ordinary people generally use to perceive robots. Sixty-one participants observed and evaluated a real and VR humanoid robots using a psychological scale. Results show that the real robot was evaluated to have higher scores for Utility, Possibility of communication, and Objective hardness and lower ones for Controllability as compared to a VR robot. The Vulnerability scores of the real robot and the VR robot were not significantly different. The usability of a VR robot is discussed in the paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel assistive device (AD) control strategy that provides intermittent assistance and is capable of encouraging user effort during AD use. The assistance regulation controller (ARC) presented here is designed to regulate joint torque and can be used for arbitrary joint and limb motions without requiring any a priori information about the user's intended motion. Data from eight healthy subjects who performed a forearm tracking experiment using a single degree-of-freedom powered orthosis demonstrate that the ARC is capable of encouraging user effort. On average, subjects generated 40% more joint torque when performing the tracking experiment with the ARC instead of a conventional torque-amplifying controller. The results also demonstrate that the ARC is safe to use for dynamic orthosis-assisted joint motions which require several transitions into and out of the assistance and no assistance states of the controller. As such, the results also confirm that the ARC is an effective assist-as-needed control strategy suitable for use with ADs.",

The actual operation and control of a remote machine must be supported by an interface which provides enough information through visualization from a remote location to complete a task. This can be achieved with a Mixed Reality (MR) environment. The concept is to combine information from the real world and a virtual world. An experiment was conducted to assess the differences between two platforms and to determine interface features required to maximize operator performance and satisfaction. The result indicates that both mixed reality environments tested were suitable for teleoperation where sufficient information to perform the task could be modeled in the virtual world. However, one of the environments turned out to be superior where the task required information in the video but not modeled in the virtual environment. The preferred environment provided overlays on the video that were updated live as the model was manipulated where the other environment updated video overlays on completion of the manipulation.",

Although reduced by mechanical stabilisers, residual tissue motion makes surgery still difficult and time consuming. Compensation for this motion is therefore highly desirable. Motion can be captured by tracking natural landmarks on the heart surface viewed by a video endoscope. The proposed motion compensation scenario uses tracked motion information on the beating heart to stabilise image motion at the surgeon's display and to move his instruments accordingly, i.e. synchronously to the surface of the beating heart. The setup uses a specially designed heart motion simulator to display real heart motion and employs a particular prediction strategy to overcome latencies, which is required to achieve synchronous motion of robot instruments and the heart surface. Results show that the proposed methods are suitable to achieve the desired compensation of heart motion.",

        "abstract": "This research investigates and seeks to mitigate the undesirable effects of biodynamic feedthrough in backhoe operation. Biodynamic feedthrough occurs when motion of the controlled machine excites motion of the human operator, which is fed back into the control input device. This unwanted input can cause significant performance degradation, which can include limit cycles or even instability. Backhoe user interface designers indicate that this is a problem in many conventional machines, and it has also proved to degrade performance in this testbed. A particular backhoe control system, including the biodynamic feedthrough, is modeled and simulated. Cab vibration control is selected as a means to mitigate the biodynamic feedthrough effect. Two controller based methods are developed based on these models and presented, both of which use the working implement itself to reduce the cab motion. In this case, the backhoe arm has dual functionality, to perform excavation operations and to cancel cab vibration. Results show that significant reductions in cab motion can be obtained with minimal tracking performance degradation, without additional actuators.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an accurate and robust 6D SLAM method that uses multiple 2D sensors, i.e. perspective cameras and planar laser scanners. We have investigated strengths and weaknesses of those two sensors for 6D SLAM by conducting specifically designed experiments, and found that the sensors can complement each other. In order to take full advantages of each approach, we fuse correspondences of those two sensors, rather than individually estimated motions. Correspondences obtained by the two sensors have different characteristics, but can be expressed in a common 2D-3D relation form. We use the correspondences in a single structure-from-motion framework. In the initial motion estimation step, we propose a RANSAC-based method to generate and test multiple motion hypotheses by using multiple pools of correspondences, aiming to avoid potential bias of each sensor data. In the later motion refinement step, we introduce a variant of bundle adjustment to consider different types of constraints from the two sensors. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated both quantitatively by experiments on closed-loop sequences and qualitatively by large-scale experiments with DGPS trajectory. The proposed method successfully closes a loop of 320 meters in twenty thousand frames by incremental process only.",

        "abstract": "Novel minimally invasive surgical paradigms accessing deep surgical sites present a new challenge of safe instrument insertion and navigation. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a new framework for compliant motion control of multi-backbone continuum robots subject to whole-arm contacts. This control framework does not rely on knowledge of contact locations along the length of a continuum robot. Instead, the forces at joint level are applied as controller inputs to generate compliant motion. The paper first presents a new mapping of the external wrenches to a generalized force in the configuration space of a single-stage multi-backbone continuum robot. A closed-form analytic expression for the passive stiffness of a multi-backbone continuum robot segment is also presented. A controller, robust to uncertainties of the system model, is proposed to provide compliant motion of the continuum robot segment by using the generalized force and stiffness definitions. Stability, convergence, and controller properties are shown through experimental validation. The presented framework defines a method for providing compliant motion to continuum robots without explicit knowledge of the environment. We believe this work enables new control algorithms for rapidly deployable surgical robots and supports novel surgical paradigms by increasing safety during unstructured interaction with flexible anatomy.",

For the six wheeled CRAB rover, this paper presents the composite control design with torque control and adaptive Kriging control to improve the terrainability, somewhat related to minimizing wheel slip. As CRAB is moving slowly, the torque control is processed by minimizing the variance of the required friction coefficient based on the static model. Adaptive Kriging control is used to track the commanded velocity. The system uncertainty is compensated by Kriging estimation based on the velocity dynamics. Experiment results with two different tires show the effectiveness of the control scheme.",

        "abstract": "Modern and future robotic applications will have to integrate many software components. Inevitably, the components will be provided by different vendors, and will not be designed together, and in many cases also not implemented from the same source code repository. This paper presents a discussion on how to deal with this multi-component, multi vendor situation. This situation includes the least optimal case when most or all of the components are \"legacy\", in the sense that they have to be integrated as binary pieces of code, without the possibility to change the components for the sole purpose of facilitating system-level integration. The presented approach is illustrated by an application that integrates (i) two KUKA Light-Weight Robot FRI control components, (ii) a set of ROS components to control a Willow Garage PR2 robot, (iii) a Blender component for on-line visualization, and (iv) a set of Orocos/RTT components that take care of the data flow communication and some simple coordination between all components.",

        "abstract": "Abstract-A robot scrub nurse (RSN) is an example of a robotic assistant for surgical environments. Ideally, by taking over management of instruments, it would lower costs of an operation and cut down on mistakes. Of vital importance for such robots is how they interface with the environment. A scrub nurse robot requires the ability to sense the human operators before it can assist. Computer vision offers here a number of advantages over other sensing modalities. In this paper we examine a visual tracking system for a robot scrub nurse. The system works by estimating the hand position and orientation of the main surgeon. This information is needed to guide the robot in delivering instruments directly to the surgeon. Our work outlines the entire visual tracking process and evaluates robustness and accuracy. The end result is a re-implementable and working application, suitable for surgical environments, that also offers a degree of operation robustness.",

        "abstract": "Kinematic models that account for deformation due to applied loads have recently been developed for a variety of continuum robots. In these cases, a set of nonlinear differential equations with boundary conditions must often be solved to obtain the robot shape. Thus, computing manipulator Jacobians and compliance matrices efficiently is not straight forward. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining an arc length parametrized Jacobian and compliance matrix. Our approach involves obtaining an augmented Jacobian by propagating the necessary partial derivatives through the model equations, resulting in a new set of differential equations. These equations can be solved as an initial value problem, via a single numerical integration. Our method can be generally applied to various continuum robot architectures, regardless of the specific actuation system used. We provide a specific case study using this method to obtain the Jacobian for a concentric-tube robot.",

These strategies are then used to compute a schedule and task assignment for all agents. We improve the graph construction from previous work and for the first time present a method that computes a schedule to minimize the execution time. For this we consider travel times of agents determined by a path planner on the height map. We demonstrate the entire system in a real environment with an area of 700,000m2 in which eight human agents search for two intruders using mobile computing devices (iPads). To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a search system applied to such a large environment.",

        "abstract": "A robotic instrument which synergistically cooperates with the surgeon for opening the skull in neurosurgery is proposed. To reduce frequent complications of this intervention, tear of the dura mater and bad reintegration of the skull bone a soft tissue preserving saw is combined with automatic depth regulation on the basis of a priori acquired medical imaging data (CT/MRI). By fusing the individual capabilities of the surgeon and a robotic device, it is possible to design an instrument which is significantly smaller than a fully autonomous system. The acceptance is enhanced by the integration of the surgeon into the process with direct control over the procedure. During the intervention, the instrument is manually guided by the surgeon on a freely defined trajectory. To be able to control this instrument, a method for real-time depth regulation, medical imaging data pre-processing and reduction as well as appropriate interfaces for the surgeon have been developed. In an experimental setup with phantom skull caps the system has been evaluated and has shown promising results, with a mean error of 0.62mm. Future work will include a detailed analysis of the persisting errors, integration of different sensors to control the instrument and preclinical trials.",

This paper proposes a quite simple approach for concurrent set-point regulation of position and orientation of a redundant manipulator using the virtual spring-damper hypothesis, which offers human-like movements without solving the inverse dynamics. For orientation, quaternion representation is applied to give singularity-free orientation control. Augmenting quaternion feedback to the state vector of the system, the stability is analytically proved, and dynamic simulation is conducted for validation of the method. Competition between position and orientation control is also briefly discussed based on the simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Multi-segment continuum robots offer enhanced safety during surgery due to their inherent passive compliance. However, they suffer poor position tracking performance due to flexibility of their actuation lines, structural compliance, and actuation coupling effects between segments. The need for control methods addressing accurate tracking for multi segment continuum robots is magnified by increased precision requirements of surgical procedures employing these structures. To address this need, this paper proposes a tiered controller that uses both extrinsic and intrinsic sensory information for improved performance of multi-segment continuum robots. The higher tier of this controller uses configuration space feedback while the lower tier uses joint space feedback and a feed-forward term obtained with actuation compensation techniques. We prove the stability of this controller using Lyapunov's direct method and experimentally evaluate its performance on a three-segment multi-backbone continuum robot. Results demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing regulation and tracking performance. It is shown that the controller mitigates the effects of actuation coupling between robot's sub-segments and decreases phase lag. These results suggest that this tiered controller will enhance telemanipulation performance of multi-segment continuum robots.",

        "abstract": "Six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) haptic rendering for fine manipulation in narrow space is a challenging topic because of frequent constraint changes caused by small tool movement and the requirement to preserve the feel of fine-features of objects. In this paper, we introduce a configuration-based constrained optimization method for solving this rendering problem. The six-dimensional configuration (position and orientation) of the graphic tool is defined as the solution variable of the optimization problem. Contact constraints are obtained based on identifying principal contacts between the graphic avatar of the haptic tool, called the graphic tool, and the virtual task environment. In order to maintain stability during contact switch, a hybrid method combining collision detection, local search and parallel optimization is introduced. Based on parallel optimization and selection of local solution, we can maintain the local solution of the optimization model. Our method has been validated in experiments of moving a convex tool to probe a narrow cavity with or without bulges. Force rendering is stable even when the free space is very small and involves fine features of objects. Non-penetration between the tool and the object forming the cavity are maintained under frequent contact switches. Update rate of the simulation loop including the optimization and constraint identification is maintained at about 1kHz.",

        "abstract": "Considerable research effort has gone into the design of variable passive stiffness actuators (VSAs). A number of different mechanical designs have been proposed, aimed at either a biomorphic (i.e., antagonistic) design, compactness, or simplified modelling and control. In this paper, we propose a (model-based) unified control methodology that is able to exploit the benefits of variable stiffness independent of the specifics of the mechanical design. Our approach is based on forming constraints on commands sent to the VSA to ensure that the equilibrium position and stiffness of the VSA are tracked to the desired values. We outline how our approach can be used for tracking stiffness and equilibrium position both in joint and task space, and how it may be used in the context of constrained local optimal control. In our experiments we illustrate the utility of our approach in the context of online teleoperation, to transfer compliant human behaviour to a variable stiffness device.",

        "abstract": "Here we present an environmentally robust mechano-bionic system using insect dorsal vessel tissues. Although mechano-bionic systems using mammalian heart muscle cells were reported previously, these mechano-bionic systems require precise environmental control to keep the heart muscle cells contracting spontaneously. To overcome this problem, our group focused on insect dorsal vessel tissues as a novel driving source of mechano-bionic system. We have shown so far that insect dorsal vessel can be utilized as driving source that is robust over culture conditions. In this paper, as a mechano-bionic system that is robust over its operating environment, we propose a micro-actuated system that consists of insect dorsal vessel and mechanical structure fabricated by micro fabrication technology. By photolithographic technique, the components of the machine were fabricated. The excised dorsal vessel was attached to the microstructure by tweezers under the stereomicroscope. The micro-mechanical components with dorsal vessel was incubated at 25\u00b0C, and after several hours of culture, it was actuated by contraction of dorsal vessel. Using image analysis, its maximum open-end displacement and operating frequency was measured around 27\u03bcm and 0.5Hz, respectively. We successfully demonstrated in constructing the mechano-bionic system that is robust over its operating environment.",

This technology involves multiple ejectors that stream jets of compressed air onto an object from various directions.

As the first step of this research, in this paper, we discuss technological challenges for this method. Next we provide a preliminary investigation with one degree-of-freedom planar experimental system using a continuous and a PWM air jet ejection method.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel probabilistic approach to incorporating odometric information into appearance-based SLAM systems, without performing metric map construction or calculating relative feature geometry. The proposed system, dubbed Continuous Appearance-based Trajectory SLAM (CAT-SLAM), represents location as a probability distribution along a trajectory, and represents appearance continuously over the trajectory rather than at discrete locations. The distribution is evaluated using a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter, which weights particles based on local appearance and odometric similarity and explicitly models both the likelihood of revisiting previous locations and visiting new locations. A modified resampling scheme counters particle deprivation and allows loop closure updates to be performed in constant time regardless of map size. We compare the performance of CAT-SLAM to FAB-MAP (an appearance-only SLAM algorithm) in an outdoor environment, demonstrating a threefold increase in the number of correct loop closures detected by CAT-SLAM.",

In order to reduce the congestion or the risk of accidents, it is required to control swarm flows of pedestrian. This paper proposes an implicit control method of the crossing pedestrian flows. Pedestrian flow is modeled with the continuum fluid model and its congestion degree is calculated as the fluid density. From a simulation of the crossing flows with the continuum model, it is verified that diagonal stripe pattern of the congestion degree emerges. Moreover, the authors propose an implicit control method to improve average flow velocity by moving guides. Focusing on periodic phenomenon of the crossing flows, we investigate the relationship between its temporal and spatial frequency and a periodic motion of guides. From this relationship, a control method based on the temporal and spatial frequency is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Dynamics and control of a space robotic system with flexible members during an object manipulation task is studied here. Flexible members such as solar panels of space free flying robotic systems and their flexible joints during a manoeuvre may get stimulated and vibrate. Therefore, such vibrations will cause some oscillatory disturbance forces on the moving base and manipulated object, which in turn produces error in the position and speed of the manipulating end effectors. These flexible members are classified into active and passive elements, to study the ways of controlling the vibration effects of such members. In this paper, considering a multiple arm space robotic system with flexible joints and flexible solar panels, the system dynamics is partitioned into two rigid and flexible bodies' motion, and a practical model for control implementations on compounded rigid-flexible multi-body systems is developed. Then, based on a designated path/trajectory for a space robotic system, the multiple impedance control is extended to perform an object manipulation task by such complicated rigid-flexible multi body systems. Finally, a space free flying robotic system is simulated which contains two 2-DOF planar manipulators with flexible joints, and a rotating antenna and a camera as its third and fourth arm, appended with two solar panels. Obtained results reveal the merits of proposed controller to successfully perform the manipulation task and effectively suppress the vibration of flexible elements which will be discussed.",

We investigate sets of Mag-\u00b5Bots that are geometrically and magnetically designed to respond uniquely to the same magnetic fields. The responses of geometrically dissimilar Mag-\u00b5Bots with similar magnetization and a group of identically-fabricated Mag-\u00b5Bots are investigated. By controlling the magnetic field waveforms, individual and subgroups of Mag-\u00b5Bots are able to locomote in a parallel but dissimilar fashion. Specifically, the pulsing frequency of the imposed driving magnetic fields is used as a selection method among the Mag-\u00b5Bots. This method for accomplishing motion discrimination is discussed, modeled, and tested. Independent global positioning of two and three robots is demonstrated in two-dimensional space. While individual Mag-\u00b5Bot velocities can be as high as 7 mm/s, the effective velocities during multi-robot control are found to be up to 2 mm/s. As this control method is accomplished without the use of a specialized surface, it has potential applications in areas such as micro-fluidic systems and bio-manipulation",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of extracting the fundamental frequency of an arbitrary periodic or quasi-periodic signal for application in robotic tasks. We focus on controlling periodic robotic movement by extracting the frequency of human movement by using surface electromyography (EMG), a technique by which muscle action potentials are gathered by electrodes placed on the skin. However, since the EMG signal is quasi-periodic with a lot of frequency components and noise, it is difficult to determine the frequency and phase of the measured limb motion. We propose to use nonlinear dynamical systems capable of extracting the frequency and the phase from an unknown periodic signal with an arbitrary waveform. The method uses a whole Fourier series representation in a feedback loop. It is capable of extracting the frequency and the phase of an unknown periodic signal in real-time, without any additional signal processing or preprocessing. Combining this method with an output dynamic system based on dynamic movement primitives, which generate the desired trajectory, allows synchronization between human muscles actions and some other system actions like robot motion or electrical neuromuscular stimulator activation.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing the user motion intention plays an important role in the study of power-assist robots. An intention-guided control strategy is proposed for the upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton. A force sensor system comprised of force sensing resistors (FSRs) is designed to online estimate the motion intention of user upper limb. A new concept called \"intentional reaching direction (IRD)\" is proposed to quantitatively describe this intention. Both the state model and the observation model of IRD are obtained by enumerating the upper limb behavior modes and analyzing the relationship between the measured force signals and the motion intention. Based on these two models, the IRD can be online inferred by applying filtering technology. Guided by the estimated IRD, an admittance control strategy is assumed to control the motions of three DC motors in the joints of the robotic arm. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is finally confirmed by the experiments on a 3-DOF robotic exoskeleton.",

In this paper, we address the cooperative control of two autonomous surface vehicles for oil skimming and cleanings. We model the skimmer as a flexible, floating rope of constant length as well as discrete segmented model. We derive the equations governing the rope dynamics from first principles and demonstrate their application through simulations. We have performed field experiments with two autonomous surface vehicles that substantiate the proposed model and provides estimates of constants underlying the model. We propose a method for controlling the shape of the rope, and derive the conditions that maximize skimming efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Mapping is regarded as one of the most fundamental tasks for mobile robots. In this work, we present an approach that enables multiple resource-limited mobile robots to cooperatively build an image-based map of the environment and to afterwards localize in it. To achieve this, we deploy a hierarchical team of mobile robots. A parent robot possesses state-of-the-art sensors, computation power and acts as a leader. It teleoperates small child robots within its line-of-sight. In contrast to other approaches and due to the cooperation among the robots, we can relax the requirement that every robot must be able to self-localize to take part in multi-robot mapping. Additionally, our algorithm ensures the mapping of the entire area in an efficient way, i.e., it fulfills the requirements of area coverage. To test our approach, extensive experiments have been performed both in simulation and real-world. In the latter case, a team of four heterogeneous mobile robots was deployed. Besides the successful cooperation in the robot team, localization results are presented to validate the applicability of the proposed mapping procedure.",

        "abstract": "Distributed algorithms for (re)configuring mobile sensors to cover a given area are important for autonomous multi-robot operations in application areas such as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Depending on the assumptions about the choice of the environment, the sensor models, the coverage metric, and the motion models of sensor nodes, there are different versions of the problem that have been formulated and studied. In this paper, we consider a system of holonomic mobile robots equipped with anisotropic sensors (e.g., limited field of view cameras) that are required to cover a polygonal region with polygonal obstacles to detect interesting events. We assume a given probability distribution of the events over a region. Motivated by scenarios where the sensing performance not only depends on the resolution of sensing but also on the relative orientation between the sensing axis and the event, we assume that the probability of detection of an event depends on both sensing parameters and the orientation of observation. We present a distributed gradient-ascent algorithm for reconfiguring the system of mobile robots so that the joint probability of detection of events over the whole region is maximized (i.e., positioning the mobile robots and determining their sensor parameters). As an example case study, we use a system of mobile robots equipped with limited field of view cameras with pan and zoom capabilities. We present simulation results demonstrating the performance of our algorithm.",

A potential function based motion controller is synthesized in motion control layer to disperse a team of mobile agents while avoiding any inter-agent collisions. The proposed hybrid coverage enhancement system can reconfigure an initially compact multi-agent system to achieve a certain level of coverage with guaranteed connectivity and collision avoidance.

Achieving such system, requires strong perception method to efficiently update the frequently changing environment. We propose a method for mapping a household environment using multiple stereo and depth cameras located on the humanoid head and the environment. The method relies on colored 3D point cloud data computed from the sensors. We achieve robot localization by matching the point clouds from the robot sensor data directly with the environment sensor data. Object detection is performed using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with a database of known point cloud models. In order to guarantee accurate object detection results, objects are only detected within the robot sensor data. Furthermore, we utilize the environment sensor data to map out of the obstacles as bounding convex hulls. We show experimental results creating a household environment map with known object labels and estimate the robot position in this map.",

        "abstract": "In urban environments, moving obstacles detection and free space determination are key issues for driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. When using lidar sensors scanning in front of the vehicle, uncertainty arises from ignorance and errors. Ignorance is due to the perception of new areas and errors come from imprecise pose estimation and noisy measurements. Complexity is also increased when the lidar provides multi-echo and multi-layer information. This paper presents an occupancy grid framework that has been designed to manage these different sources of uncertainty. A way to address this problem is to use grids projected onto the road surface in global and local frames. The global one generates the mapping and the local one is used to deal with moving objects. A credibilist approach is used to model the sensor information and to do a global fusion with the world-fixed map. Outdoor experimental results carried out with a precise positioning system show that such a perception strategy increases significantly the performance compared to a standard approach.",

To this end, the mechanical design of modular robots has to be flexible and robust enough for various complex configurations. The major contributions of the design of this Cross-Ball robots include: 1) it provides several flexible 3D reconfiguration capabilities, such as rotating, parallel, and diagonal movements; (2) a flexible and robust hardware platform for modular robots using more complex self-reconfiguration algorithms; and (3) the mobility of each individual module. Furthermore, a skeleton-based approach is proposed for the motion control of the modules, where the module movements can be conducted in groups to improve the system reconfiguration efficiency. Some simulation results have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed module design and the corresponding controller by reconfiguring the robots to various complex configurations.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of cross-dataset facial expression recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been formally addressed in the literature. Conventional facial expression recognition methods assume expression images in the training and testing sets are collected under the same condition such that they are independent and identically distributed. In many real applications, this assumption may not hold as the testing data are usually collected online and generally more uncontrollable than the training data, and hence, they are likely different from the training data. This problem is referred to as cross-dataset facial expression recognition in this paper as the training and testing data are considered to be collected from different datasets due to different acquisition conditions. To address this, we propose a new transfer subspace learning approach to learn a feature space which transfers the knowledge gained from the training set to the target (testing) data to improve the recognition performance under cross-dataset scenarios. Experimental results for facial expression recognition tasks on different datasets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Robust water detection is a critical perception requirement for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous navigation. This is particularly true in wide-open areas where water can collect in naturally occurring terrain depressions during periods of heavy precipitation and form large water bodies. One of the properties of water useful for detecting it is that its surface acts as a horizontal mirror at large incidence angles. Water bodies can be indirectly detected by detecting reflections of the sky below the horizon in color imagery. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has implemented a water detector based on sky reflections that geometrically locates the pixel in the sky that is reflecting on a candidate water pixel on the ground and predicts if the ground pixel is water based on color similarity and local terrain features. This software detects water bodies in wide-open areas on cross-country terrain at mid- to far-range using imagery acquired from a forward-looking stereo pair of color cameras mounted on a terrestrial UGV. In three test sequences approaching a pond under a clear, overcast, and cloudy sky, the true positive detection rate was 100% when the UGV was beyond 7 meters of the water's leading edge and the largest false positive detection rate was 0.58%. The sky reflection based water detector has been integrated on an experimental unmanned vehicle and field tested at Ft. Indiantown Gap, PA, USA.",

        "abstract": "It is an important ability for any mobile robot to be able to estimate its posture and to gauge the distance it travelled. The information can be obtained from various sources. In this work, we have addressed this problem in a dynamic quadruped robot. We have designed and implemented a navigation algorithm for full body state (position, velocity, and attitude) estimation that does not use any external reference (such as GPS, or visual landmarks). Extended Kalman Filter was used to provide error estimation and data fusion from two independent sources of information: Inertial Navigation System mechanization algorithm processing raw inertial data, and legged odometry, which provided velocity aiding. We present a novel data-driven architecture for legged odometry that relies on a combination of joint sensor signals and pressure sensors. Our navigation system ensures precise tracking of a running robot's posture (roll and pitch), and satisfactory tracking of its position over medium time intervals. We have shown our method to work for two different dynamic turning gaits and on two terrains with significantly different friction. We have also successfully demonstrated how our method generalizes to different velocities.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed algorithm for performing joint localisation of a team of robots. The mobile robots have heterogeneous sensing capabilities, with some having high quality inertial and exteroceptive sensing, while others have only low quality sensing or none at all. By sharing information, a combined estimate of all robot poses is obtained. Inter-robot range-bearing measurements provide the mechanism for transferring pose information from well-localised vehicles to those less capable. In our proposed formulation, high frequency egocentric data (e.g., odometry, IMU, GPS) is fused locally on each platform. This is the distributed part of the algorithm. Inter-robot measurements, and accompanying state estimates, are communicated to a central server, which generates an optimal minimum mean-squared estimate of all robot poses. This server is easily duplicated for full redundant decentralisation. Communication and computation are efficient due to the sparseness properties of the information-form Gaussian representation. A team of three indoor mobile robots equipped with lasers, odometry and inertial sensing provides experimental verification of the algorithms effectiveness in combining location information.",

This paper describes a technique that allows a decentralized classification system to be built in a systematic way, once the hybrid models describing the behavior of the different species are given. This technique is based on a decentralized identification mechanism, by which every agent classifies its neighbors using only local information. By endowing every agent with such a local classifier, the overall system is enhanced with the ability to run behaviors involving individuals of the same species as well as of different ones. The mechanism can also be used to measure the level of cooperativeness of neighbors and to discover possible intruders among them. General applicability of the proposed solution is shown through examples of multi-agent systems from Biology and from Robotics.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of planning paths for multi-agent systems operating in complex environments. The algorithm developed, Decentralized Multi-Agent Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (DMA-RRT), is an extension of the Closed-loop RRT (CL-RRT) algorithm to the multi-agent case, retaining its ability to plan quickly even with complex constraints. Moreover, a merit-based token passing coordination strategy is developed to dynamically update the planning order based on a measure of each agent's incentive to replan, derived from the CL-RRT. Agents with a greater incentive plan sooner, yielding a greater reduction of the global cost and greater improvement in the team's overall performance. An extended version of the algorithm, Cooperative DMA-RRT, allows agents to modify others' plans in order to select paths that reduce their combined cost and thus further improve global performance. The paths generated by both algorithms are proven to satisfy inter-agent constraints, such as collision avoidance, and a set of simulation and experimental results verify performance.",

The main contribution of this work concerns the decentralization of a control framework for multiple mission execution in order to enhance the robustness of the system, and the application of the latter to a heterogeneous robotic network. The proposed approach is based on the Matrix-based Discrete Event Framework (MDEF). This formalism is adapted to networks of heterogeneous robots, i.e., robots with different capabilities, and to the decentralized control of mission execution using a consensus-based approach which guarantees the agreement among robots on executed actions and their consequences.",

Each tracker is equipped with short range communication hardware and a low resolution sensor that can detect the presence of targets, but not their precise locations, their identities, nor even the number of targets within the sensing range. We present methods for set-membership-based filtering that exploit specific structures in the information space for this problem. We also describe an active algorithm that allows the tracker team to follow the targets in a coordinated way, in spite of the incomplete information and intermittent communication links. A simulation of this algorithm shows that the passive filtering algorithm maintains an accurate representation of each tracker's knowledge, and that the active tracking algorithm is able to leverage this information to achieve accurate, robust target tracking.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a decoupled control method based on kinematic models of an amphibious reconfigurable robot called ePaddle-based quadruped robot (eQuad). The locomotion mechanism of eQuad is a novel eccentric paddle mechanism (ePaddle) that can perform wheeled, legged and paddling actions in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. We first introduce five terrestrial and aquatic gaits. A duty factor of up to 1.0 can be achieved for the legged walking. Therefore, the proposed robot eQuad can walk with a unique gait by eliminating the swing phase of the legs, and it has a large stable margin because all its legs are in contact with ground during walking. Kinematic models of this robot suggest that with this unique gait the reconfigurable ePaddle mechanism has the potential to achieve both legged and wheeled locomotion with the aid of a simple controller. A decoupled controller adapted from the wheeled robot is then built to evaluate this idea. Finally, simulations are performed to verify our proposed decoupled control and gait sequence planning methods.",

Robots can exploit exploration strategies to autonomously move around the environment. Most of the strategies proposed in literature are based on the idea of evaluating a number of candidate locations according to ad hoc utility functions that combine different criteria. In this paper, we show some of the advantages of using a more theoretically-grounded approach, based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), to define exploration strategies for robots employed in search and rescue applications. We implemented our MCDM-based exploration strategies within an existing robot controller and we evaluated their performance in a simulated environment.",

But humans also continually adjust impedance during contact and throughout manipulation tasks. We examine the value and effect of continual impedance variation on quasi-static manipulation. We approach this challenge from the perspective of telerobotics where the operator can explicitly modulate the robotic impedance. Using a three degree of freedom planar teleoperation system we explore two quasi-static tasks: inserting a rigid peg into a tight hole and throwing a switch without overshoot. The work finds that no single impedance can optimally accomplish both tasks. Instead user-controlled impedance variations achieve the desired results, demonstrating the benefits of variable impedance to quasi-static applications in telerobotics.",

To many types of fish schools, we can observe another very interesting behavior, Group Escape Behavior which shows that all fish change their moving directions rapidly and cooperatively without global broadcasting communications while some fish sense a predator. In this study, we proposed a distributed algorithm to perform Group Escape Behavior without inter-robot communication by mimicking behaviors of fish schools. It provides an alternate method for robot teams to achieve some emergency tasks while inter-robot communication is restricted. In this paper, the proposed control mechanism for achieving group escape behavior is introduced, and the characteristics of escape motion mode transition in the swarm are discussed. Some simulation results and experimental results are provided for illustrating the validity of the proposed algorithm, and for analyzing performance of the group escape behavior implemented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a compliant and tetherless magnetic capsule endoscopic robot. The proposed capsule robot has two key features. First, it has one extra degree of freedom axial contraction capability to perform additional tasks such as a drug releasing, a drug injection, or a biopsy. Also, design features of the magnetically deformed capsule robot are introduced. Its characteristic deformation curve, which was measured using an indentation setup, presents not only the deformation behavior of the magnetic capsule robot but also considerations in the capsule design process. Next, by implementing a magnetically actuated rolling locomotion scheme, the capsule can be controlled externally using a permanent magnet. The proposed magnetic capsule robot is anchored on a tissue wall by the magnetic attraction and rotated by a magnetic torque. This behavior allows a stable locomotion of the magnetic capsule robot and its orientation is controllable during locomotion. To verify the feasibility of proposed locomotion method and the compliant capsule's shape deformation, the magnetic capsule robot was actuated in a synthetic stomach model. The experimental results show that locomotion behavior of the capsule is stable and a successful tracking performance of the proposed magnetic actuation method; average distance gap between the capsule and the external magnet was only 20% of the capsule's body length. Such a soft and tetherless capsule robot can potentially enable minimally invasive diagnostic and treatment applications for stomach diseases.",

        "abstract": "In order to further understand what physiological characteristics make a human hand irreplaceable for many dexterous tasks, it is necessary to develop artificial joints that are anatomically correct while sharing similar dynamic features. In this paper, we address the problem of designing a two degree of freedom metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of an index finger. The artificial MCP joint is composed of a ball joint, crocheted ligaments, and a silicon rubber sleeve which as a whole provides the functions required of a human finger joint. We quantitatively validate the efficacy of the artificial joint by comparing its dynamic characteristics with that of two human subjects' index fingers by analyzing their impulse response with linear regression. Design parameters of the artificial joint are varied to highlight their effect on the joint's dynamics. A modified, second-order model is fit which accounts for non-linear stiffness and damping, and a higher order model is considered. Good fits are observed both in the human (R2 = 0.97) and the artificial joint of the index finger (R2 = 0.95). Parameter estimates of stiffness and damping for the artificial joint are found to be similar to those in the literature, indicating our new joint is a good approximation for an index finger's MCP joint.",

The robot can effectively serve as a substitute for a worker who would otherwise be exposed to a hazardous environment. The designed robot is composed of two equally spaced modules, which are joined by connecting bars to form a closed hexagonal body to clasp the cable. To prevent the robot deviate off the cable, anti deviation device is set on the two modules. Climbing experiments in lab verified the robot can climb on random inclined cables stably. Combined with an application case-the vision inspection system based on CCD cameras, the robot's operating modes and the control methods are introduced in detail. The application indicates that such low-cost robot systems can improve the efficiency of the inspection operation and meet the requirements of a real cable's inspection.",

By virtue of the hybrid propulsion capability in the tail plus the caudal fin and the maneuverability in accessory fins, a novel, synthesized propulsion scheme composed of multiple artificial control surfaces is proposed, involving the tail plus the caudal fin, pectoral fins, pelvic fin, and dorsal fin. Multimodal locomotion is then accomplished by manipulation of control surfaces, separately or cooperatively, allowing the robot to maneuver more diversely and agilely. In particular, bio inspired Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) based locomotion control is adopted for online swimming gait generation. Aquatic testing has been carried out to demonstrate the improved maneuverability and stability of the robotic fish underwater as well as the effectiveness of the conceived multi-fin mechatronic design.",

Control of the robot's joint motions incorporates open-loop damping into the actuation and uses a stance/swing gain scheduler in the joint position controller. The inclusion of these two attributes enables stable and robust joint-level control while attenuating the undesirable oscillatory modes that are commonly associated with pneumatically actuated walking robots. Joint motion trajectories that permit stable walking are developed and implemented in the robot. The combination of these features and techniques is experimentally shown to enable stable walking locomotion of the robot that is not inhibited by unwanted oscillations of significant magnitude.",

While intrinsic neutral buoyancy of a microrobot per se simplifies propulsion in the liquid environments, softness makes it compliant with delicate environments, such as the human body, thus guaranteeing a safe interaction with soft structures. With this aim, two groups of soft microrobots with paramagnetic and ferromagnetic behaviors were designed, fabricated and their features were experimentally analyzed. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, in the performed trials the ferromagnetic microrobots showed orientation capabilities in response to the magnetic field that could not be achieved by the paramagnetic one. Moreover, it was observed that the ferromagnetic microrobot could reach higher speed values (maximum value of 0.73 body length/s) than the paramagnetic prototype.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is superior to other imaging modalities such as Ultrasound and Computed Tomography and is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, current breast biopsy procedures based on MR images obtained apriori, use a blind targeting approach, which can be long and painful. Current approaches, due to possible patient motion, can lead to tool tip positioning errors thereby affecting diagnostic accuracy and causing significant patient discomfort, if repeated procedures are required. Hence, it is desired to develop a MRI-compatible robot for breast biopsy procedures without removing the patient from the MRI bore. This approach could potentially avoid multiple biopsy needle insertions and minimize sampling errors. Due to the working principle of MRI, material, actuation, and sensing techniques are limited as the MR images must not be affected significantly during the procedure. In addition, the limited space of the MRI bore requires the robot to be compact. This paper presents a four degrees of freedom robot with a compact parallel mechanism of which three degrees of freedom are pneumatically actuated while the needle driver mechanism is actuated by a piezo motor. Fiber-optic force sensor is also designed, developed, and mounted on the top mobile platform of the parallel mechanism to sense the needle and tissue interaction forces. Position control of the pneumatic cylinders is implemented using PI control with a modified integration term to achieve a slow and smooth motion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of selectable sound separation functions on the telepresence system \"Texai\" using the robot audition software \"HARK.\" An operator of Texai can \"walk\" around a faraway office to attend a meeting or talk with people through video-conference instead of meeting in person. With a normal microphone, the operator has difficulty recognizing the auditory scene of the Texai, e.g., he/she cannot know the number and the locations of sounds. To solve this problem, we design selectable sound separation functions with 8 microphones in two modes, overview and filter modes, and implement them using HARK's sound source localization and separation. The overview mode visualizes the direction-of-arrival of surrounding sounds, while the filter mode provides sounds that originate from the range of directions he/she specifies. The functions enable the operator to be aware of a sound even if it comes from behind the Texai, and to concentrate on a particular sound. The design and implementation was completed in five days due to the portability of HARK. Experimental evaluations with actual and simulated data show that the resulting system localizes sound sources with a tolerance of 5 degrees.",

The clutch is developed as a practical prototype for potential industrial applications in the low to mid torque range. Conventional servo motors have been shown to lack the necessary properties to deliver intrinsically safe actuation for physical interaction with humans. Several human safe actuation paradigms have been proposed, however, tend to increase mechanical complexity as well as require more sophisticated control strategies. Furthermore, many of the proposed solutions have failed to demonstrate a practical implementation that provides the necessary performance capabilities required for practical applications in automation, as well as more general servo control applications. MR clutch devices have been shown to provide favorable characteristics for such tasks, however have focused primarily on haptic systems or low torque applications. The developed prototype MR clutch is capable of transmitting up to 75 Nm, and has a control bandwidth of approximately 30 Hz.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new type of decoupled 2-DOF translational parallel micro-positioning stage is designed to realize the 2-DOF ultra-precision linear motion. The stage consists of two piezoelectric actuators (PZTs) and a monolithic compliant mechanism. The monolithic compliant mechanism adopts two types of compound double parallel four-leaf flexures and a mirror symmetric structure to reduce the input and output cross coupling and parasitic motion. Based on the stiffness matrix method and screw theory, a mathematical model is constructed to analyze the compliant mechanism. The optimal design is performed in view of performance constraints. The design results show good static and dynamic performances of the stage, which are well validated by the simulation of finite-element-analysis (FEA) and experimental results. The experimental results show that the proposed stage has a full range of 40\u00b5m \u00d7 40\u00b5m when the full voltage(100V) is applied on the two PZTs. Besides, the stage only has the maximum cross coupling of -50dB between the two axes, low enough to utilize single-input-single-out(SISO) control strategies for positioning and tracking.",

        "abstract": "In contrast to a fully actuated system, an under-actuated system cannot execute all joint trajectories. However, under-actuation may be unavoidable at times, such as during joint failure. In recent literature, an under-actuated open-chain planar manipulator with revolute joints has been shown to be feedback linearizable with specific choices of mass and inertia distribution. It has been shown that the dynamic model of an n-joint manipulator with center of mass located at joint 2 and with only one actuator is static feedback linearizable if and only if the input is at the first or the last joint [1]. In our pursuit for novel designs of under-actuated arms, which are both controllable and feedback linearizable, we investigate the feasibility of designing a 3R planar under-actuated manipulator which has a different distribution of compliance [1]. This study shows that this new architecture of 3R planar under-actuated manipulator with one input at the second joint can still be designed to be differentially flat. With this design, a simple stabilizing controller in the flat output space enables the system to perform point-to-point motion and mitigate initial errors.",

In this work, we present the design of a robot arm and data from experiments to characterize the accuracy and resolution of the force sensing. We describe a force-following manipulation experiment using two robots. The experiment measures strain on a rigid bar between two robots. The data shows the feasibility of using SEAs for force sensing to reduce the strain in the bar.

Biologically inspired visual sensors based on optical flow show great promise due to the small size of the image sensors needed to capture visual data, but the high computational cost is a limiting factor. Current optical flow sensors are either small with very low resolution, or high resolution with large computing requirements, making them unsuitable for the primary sensor for MAVs. This paper presents an optical flow sensor specifically de signed for the needs of MAVs, combining very small size with adequate resolution and the capability of processing many image sensors in a single FPGA. Initial results indicate that per formance is sufficient for MAVs, and optical flow calculations can be performed in real-time with image sensors operating at 320\u00d7240 resolution at up to 120 FPS. FPGA resource usage estimates indicate that a 15\u00d715 mm FPGA can calculate 2D optical flow for up to 11 image sensors simultaneously.",

The manipulator is designed for surgical applications with a preliminary focus on the removal of osteolysis formed behind the acetabular shell of primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs). The manipulator is constructed from two nested superelastic nitinol tubes enabling lengthwise channels for drive cables. Notches in the nested assembly provide reliable bending under applied cable tension producing kinematics that can be effectively modeled as a series of rigid vertebrae connected using pin joints. The manipulator is controlled in plane with two independently actuated cables in a pull-pull configuration. For the purpose of the procedure, the manipulator is mounted on a Z-\u03b8 stage adding a translational and rotational degree of freedom (DOF) along the axis of the manipulator. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the initial modeling and control of the manipulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a design for a knee-ankle prosthesis which ultimately controls two linear hydraulic actuators using a single pump. The design takes advantage of the fact that the knee and ankle never produce large positive powers simultaneously during stair-climbing, and that the ankle produces more positive power than the knee during walking. This makes the prosthesis lighter and smaller. During walking, the ankle joint adds forward propulsive power similar to that of an intact ankle. During stair climbing, the knee joint provides assistance like that of an intact knee. The hydraulic nature of the prosthetic allows it to function in a semi-active mode, where it behaves similar to a microcontroller controlled passive transfemoral prosthesis.",

        "abstract": "Force regulation is a challenging task of forceps used for robot-assisted surgical manipulation. To avoid excessive force applied on soft tissues, sophisticated sensors with computerized precise control are often required. Without using additional electronic elements, this paper presents a passive mechanism to maintain a constant contact force between forceps jaw tips and tissues given a pre-specified force magnitude. The mechanism consists of symmetric flexible structures specifically designed to generate a constant torque regardless of input rotation. The constant torque is converted to a constant force through an adjustable lever arm. When the force is further transmitted to jaw tips, it keeps a nearly constant contact force regardless of tissue stiffness and size. After a formulation to find the optimal mechanism configuration, the design is verified by comparing experiment and simulation results. A prototype of the adjustable constant-force forceps is finally illustrated and discussed. The novel forceps is expected to serve as a reliable alternative for robot-assisted surgeries.",

Our approach is based on abstracting the swarm to an advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation model, which we solve numerically using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a meshfree technique that is suitable for advection-dominated systems. The parameters of the macroscopic model are mapped onto the deterministic and random components of individual robot motion and the probabilities that determine stochastic robot task transitions. For very large swarms that are prohibitively expensive to simulate, the macroscopic model, which is independent of the population size, is a useful tool for synthesizing robot control policies with guarantees on performance in a top-down fashion. We illustrate our methodology by formulating a model of rabbiteye blueberry pollination by a swarm of robotic bees and using the macroscopic model to select control policies for efficient pollination.",

In this research, we propose a concept for a handling device for picking up small round parts. In this concept, the handling device cages an object without letting the object escape from its tips before closing them completely and then grasps the object robustly at a unique position of the tips. Using this caging and self-alignment concept, the handling device can pick up objects robustly and agilely. In this paper, we focus on a method for designing the shape of the device's tips using the concept of caging and self-alignment of objects.

Interface design is crucial to the development of hand-held medical instruments. Surgeons may not use medical devices owing to their poor usability, regardless of their performance. In addition, most surgeons do not have the time to learn the use of robotic instruments. We have listed all possible input mechanisms based on the motions of the fingers, and we have designed sample interfaces consisting of effective input mechanisms. The usability of the designed interfaces was evaluated by surgeons via experiments performed using the sample interfaces and a simulator. In summary, we propose a method for designing the most intuitive user interface for hand-held multi-DOF forceps.",

The unconstrained ball travels up to 1m horizontally, reaching an apex height of 1.1m between impacts. Using a perturbation analysis, we show that the ball trajectory is locally stable without feedback. The pendulum consists of a four-bar linkage, optimized to keep the paddle perpendicular to the impact velocity of the ball. We verify the stability in experiments with a prototype of the Pendulum Juggler, demonstrating sustained juggling at amplitudes of up to 25\u00b0.",

Traditional modeling can not predict its dynamic performance precisely. There is not enough documented information on design and optimization. A coupled 3D model has been built in this work. Modal and harmonic analysis has been performed to investigate mechanical and electrical behaviors. Identical experimental conditions were simulated by finite element method modeling to investigate size effect and optimize the transducer. Experiment has been set up to validate the model. The good agreement between the simulated and experimental results shows that the model in design procedure provides an optimal tool to construct an acoustic transducer used in Near Field Acoustic Levitation.",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots are a novel continuum robot technology that is well suited to minimally invasive surgeries inside small body cavities such as the heart. These robots are constructed of concentrically combined pre-curved elastic tubes to form 3D curves. Each telescopic section of the robot is either of fixed or variable curvature. One advantage of this approach is that the component tube curvatures, lengths and stiffnesses can easily be fabricated to be procedure and patient-specific. This paper proposes an optimization framework for solving the robot design problem given a 3D description of the constraining anatomy, the number of fixed and variable curvature robot sections and a tip workspace description, the algorithm solves for the robot design that possesses the desired workspace, remains inside the anatomical constraints and minimizes the curvature and length of all sections. The approach is illustrated in the context of beating heart closure of atrial septal defects.",

Therefore how to obtain the required resolution is a basic issue to design a parallel manipulator. This paper presents a method to solve the problem. Firstly, the mathematical definition of the position/orientation resolution is given. Then we discuss how to calculate them using Rayleigh quotient. And the design optimization problem is formulated. Fundamental concepts of the method are illustrated through a 3-RRR planar parallel manipulator. The design process to achieve an optimized task space of the required pose resolution is also demonstrated in the example.",

Its motion analysis, kinematics modeling and controllability analysis are presented. Two typical motion simulations show that the unevenness of ground has big influence on the open-loop trajectory tracking of the robot.

The robot is being developed in the framework of the HydroNet European project [1] aiming at realizing a new multi-robot system for monitoring the quality of coastal waters, rivers and lagoons. One main innovation of the robot is the capability to measure heavy metals concentrations directly onboard using sensors ad hoc developed by the consortium. This enables the system to provide real-time measurements of heavy metals concentrations potentially changing the current water monitoring methodology in which the samples are collected by a dedicated boat and analyzed in laboratory. The robot is designed for long range missions and for lodging the onboard water analysis system. Some severe constraints imposed by the addressed scenarios are considered in the design: reduced length and limited weight for ease of transportability and deployment; low draft and protected propellers to enable the ASV to move safely in shallow waters with likely floating obstacles such as plastic bags.",

        "abstract": "Modeling of low severity soft-tissue injury due to unwanted collisions of a robot in collaborative settings is an important aspect to be treated in safe physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). Up to now, safety evaluations for pHRI were mainly conducted by using safety criteria related with impact forces and head accelerations. These indicate severe injury in the robotics context and leave out low severity injury such as contusions and lacerations. However, for the design of an intrinsically safer robot arm, a reliable evaluation of the collision between a human and a robot that is based on skin injury criteria is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel human-robot collision model with and without covering, which is based on the impact stress distribution. The reliability of the proposed collision model is verified by a comparison with various cadaver experiments taken from existing biomechanical literature. Since the stress characteristics acting on the human head can be analyzed with this new collision model, the occurrence of certain soft-tissue injury can be estimated. Furthermore, the method serves for selecting the appropriate covering parameters, as e.g. elastic modulus and thickness, by evaluating the chosen skin injury indices.",

        "abstract": "Most of the computer and robot-vision algorithms are designed mainly for opaque objects and non-opaque objects have received less attention, in spite of them being omnipresent in man-made environments. With an increasing usage of such objects, especially those made of glass, plastic etc., it becomes necessarily important to detect this class of objects while building a robot navigation system. Obstacle avoidance forms a primary yet challenging task in mobile robot navigation. The main objective of this paper is to present an algorithm to detect and avoid obstacles that are made of semi-transparent materials, such as plastic or glass. The algorithm makes use of a technique called the collective-reward based approach to detect such objects from single images captured by an uncalibrated camera in a live video stream. Random selection techniques are incorporated in the method to make the algorithm run in real-time. A mobile robot then uses the information after detection to perform an obstacle avoidance maneuver. Experiments were conducted on a real robot to test the efficacy of the algorithm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This work is motivated by the need to develop new perception and modeling capabilities to support a fully autonomous, remotely operated mine. The application differs from most existing robotics research in that it requires a detailed world model of the sub-surface geological structure. This in-ground geological information is then used to drive many of the planning and control decisions made on a mine site. This paper formulates a method for automatically detecting in-ground geological boundaries using geophysical logging sensors and a supervised learning algorithm. The algorithm uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) and a single length scale squared exponential covariance function. The approach is demonstrated on data from a producing iron-ore mine in Australia. Our results show that two separate distinctive geological boundaries can be automatically identified with an accuracy of over 99 percent. The alternative approach to automatic detection involves manual examination of these data.",

In particular, we focus on solving minimal problems where the unknown 6-degree of-freedom transformation between two robots is determined based on the minimum number of measurements necessary for finding a discrete set of solutions. In our previous work [1], we have shown that only 14 base systems need to be solved, and provided closed-form solutions for three of them. This paper considers the remaining systems and provides closed-form solutions to most of them, while for some of the most challenging problems, we introduce efficient symbolic-numerical solution methods. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed solvers through extensive simulations.",

        "abstract": "One of the important tasks for bridge maintenance is bridge deck crack inspection. Traditionally, a human inspector detects cracks using his/her eyes and finds the location of cracks manually. Thus the accuracy of the inspection result is low due to the subjective nature of human judgement. We propose a system that uses a mobile robot to conduct the inspection, where the robot collects bridge deck images with a high resolution camera. In this method, the Laplacian of Gaussian algorithm is used to detect cracks and the global crack map is obtained through camera calibration and robot localization. To ensure that the robot collects all the images on the bridge deck, we develop a complete coverage path planning algorithm for the mobile robot. We compare it with other path planning strategies. Finally, we validate our proposed system through experiments and simulation.",

The system, which is mathematically modeled and simulated, consists of an electro-hydraulic servo valve, double vane rotary actuator, manipulator and a controller. Based on the simulation results, hydraulic actuators were sized for optimal performance. A prototype of the proposed manipulator was built and tested. The test results show that the proposed actuator is capable of reaching torques of up to 860 Nm. The end effector of the manipulator is capable of reaching average velocities in excess of 2.7 ms-1 with a payload capability of 5.3 kg. Comparable performance is not feasible with contemporary SCARA type robots with electric motors.",

There are tendon based manipulators with nonlinear springs as a manipulator for the requirement. Tension distribution which converts from joint space to tendon space are necessary to control such tendon mechanisms. A conventional tension distribution method using pseudo inverse matrix or inverse matrix of jacobian can not consider tension limits. On the other hand, advantages of structures utilizing bilogical extremities attract much attention. In this paper, we focus on an advantage of musculoskeletal model which contributes to simple algebraic calculation when deriving tension commands. And we develop a tension distribution method which can consider tension limits for musculoskeletal model of biological extremities. Its effectiveness as a part of whole control system is verified by simulations.",

The target for the surgery is prenatal temporary tracheal occlusion which enlarges the fetal lungs, and this procedure is promising for severe cases. A balloon is supposed to be inserted for tracheal occlusion using the manipulator. We propose a novel robotic manipulator for intrauterine fetal surgery for tracheal occlusion. In this study, a prototype of the robotic manipulator using a wire-driven mechanism has been developed. The manipulator is thin in structure and has multiple degrees of freedom to avoid damage to the fragile cells of the fetus. Specifically, we describe our development of the 3-unit robotic manipulator with ball joint-shaped arthroses and shaft diameter of 2.4 mm. The mechanism of the robotic manipulator was designed for providing the bending motion and controlling the contact force at its tip by the tension of the driven wires. Results of the experiment suggested that the contact force was controlled to under 0.04 N to insert the manipulator through the mouth of the fetus into the trachea without causing damage to the fetal tissues or changing the fetal attitude in the uterus.",

The modular snake robot is formed into a helical shape which can be described by various parameters such as the helical pitch angle, the radius and the pitch distance. The torque in each axis of rotation is affected by the helical pitch angle parameter. Five grasping configurations with different helical pitch angle were tested on the 18 degree of freedoms, 7 modules wheeled snake robot. The experimental result showed that the torque around yaw axis transferred to the pitch axis when the helical pitch angle was increasing. The profile of torque magnitude along the robot's body resulted in parabolic shape due to the unbalanced grasping force of the discrete points of contact between the robot and the pole.",

Normally, the swallowing is affected by food bolus properties such as hardness, stickiness and rheological characteristics, and dietary modifications can prevent swallowing disorder patients from suffering dysphagia (aspiration), as well as promote good nutrition. Based on these facts, our goal is to find foods which do not cause dysphagia, and develop food for swallowing disorder patients accordingly. Therefore, we are proposing an in-vitro Dynamic VFSS (Video Fluorographic Swallowing Study) simulation system which uses advanced robotics technology to mimic the dynamic process of swallowing and monitors the status and movement of the food bolus inside the system, for objective evaluation of the swallowing process. The dynamic VFSS simulation system consists of a head, mandible, neck, tongue, pharynx, and larynx which reproduce human anatomy. It is driven by 16 actuators with wire driving mechanisms. In this paper, we will present the dynamic VFSS simulation unit in detail. In addition, we will detail a set of the experiments carried out to determine whether food bolus properties can affect dysphagia or not. To observe the movement of the food bolus, we use a Video Fluoroscopy (VF) unit. The results of the experiments show that thickened boluses have a tendency to leave residue in the epiglottic vallecula. In contrast, liquids cause less residue, and increase the risk of dysphagia (aspiration). Moreover, this study shows that the frontal image, as well as the lateral image, is important for evaluating residual food in the oral- pharyngeal space.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots using ball(s) as spherical wheels have the advantage of omnidirectional motion. Some of these robots use only a single ball as their wheel and dynamically balance on it. However, driving a ball wheel is not straightforward. These robots usually use one or more motor-driven rollers or wheels in frictional contact with the ball wheel. Some slippage can occur with these schemes, so it is important to measure the actual rotation of the ball wheel for good control. This paper proposes one method for measuring the three dimensional rotation of a sphere, which is applicable to the case of a ball wheel. The system measures surface speed by using two or more optical mouse sensors and transforms them into the angular velocity vector of the ball, followed by integration to give the rotational angle. Experiments showed the correctness of this method, yielding an error of approximately 1%, with a 10 ms response.",

The requirement to negotiate bends, T-joints and steep inclinations pose another set of strict design constraints. The proposed robot consists of a modular design (7 modules) with a relatively low number of active degrees of freedom. The system is using a novel clamping mechanism with a series-elastic drive. The design of this mechanism has resulted in a high spreading factor allowing the system to operate in a wide diameter range (63 mm to 125 mm outer diameter). In this paper the mechanical design requirements and control system will be discussed. Preliminary test results will be given.",

However, some individuals with a disability can not satisfactorily enjoy such activities because of involuntary movement or spasms. In this study, we developed a drawing assist system for patients with cerebral palsy of the tension athetosis type, who experience spasticity that makes it difficult for the assist system to distinguish involuntary movement from voluntary movement. We designed a variable filter to attenuate involuntary movement on the basis of the behavioral characteristics of the velocity component with respect to in voluntary movement. Our system enabled drawing based on the participant's own senses and motor control, even when experiencing involuntary movement.",

This system controls the attitude of an object, thus reducing the burden on the operator and allowing direct manipulation. In our previous research, a power-assisted control system for an overhead crane was proposed. Operators could move a heavy object freely in horizontal and vertical directions and adjust one-degree-of freedom (1-DOF) attitude by inputting a slight force grasping the object directly, that meant the operator did not feel any sensors. Our newly proposed equipment consists of an overhead crane and two linear cylinders. A power-assisted 2-DOF attitude control algorithm that controls the length of the cylinders and hoisting motion of the crane synchronously is proposed, and the effectiveness of the system is demonstrated in some experiments.",

        "abstract": "In recent years advanced robotic technology has seen more use in the medical field to assist in the development of efficient training systems. Such training systems must fulfill the following criteria: they must provide quantitative information, must simulate the real-world conditions of the task, and assure training effectiveness. We developed Waseda Kyotokagaku Airway series to fulfill all of those requirements. The WKA series we had developed does not consider external appearance such as patient skin, or internal appearance such as the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Moreover, the tongue mechanism of the previous system can not precisely measure the force applied by medical devices and cannot simulate muscle stiffness. In addition, the mandible mechanism of the previous system could not adequately reproduce various airway difficulties or apply force control. For these reasons, we propose the WKA-4, which has high-fidelity simulated human anatomy, and we have improved the mechanism over the previous system. We have also attached a lung to the proposed system to improve simulation of the real-world conditions of the task. In this paper, we present how to design several organs with various embedded sensors and actuators, for a conventional patient model with high-fidelity simulated human anatomy. We also present the control system for the WKA-4. Finally, we present a set of experiments carried out using doctors as subjects, and they gave their valuable opinions about our system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we show that it is possible to design underactuated robot hands capable of performing dexterous manipulation tasks, despite the fact that the motion of an underactuated hand is not fully constrained by its actuators. If a robot has elastic elements at its joints, then the velocity of the actuators can be mapped onto the velocity of the grasped object using elastic averaging. This mapping can be used to compute classical measures of manipulability for an underactuated hand. We also demonstrate that holonomically constrained grasps can be analyzed to determine the manifold of stable object configurations that can be reached from some initial grasp. This is especially useful for planar manipulation operations, such as twisting a knob or precision positioning. A prototype two-fingered planar underactuated hand is introduced, having the ability to stably grasp and manipulate objects within the hand.",

        "abstract": "In our recent work, we have demonstrated effectiveness of the concept of multi-probe microassembly for manipulating and inserting microscale, sub-millimeter, parts to create three-dimensional microstructures. However, the approach has been based on trial-and-error manual teaching of grasp points to ensure a stable grasp during motion. As a result, the part orientation is restricted (nearly aligned with the world reference frame and lying flat) to ensure successful grasping and manipulation. In this paper, we developed a kinematics based hybrid motion and force control based only on vision feedback. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the bending of the probes while they are in contact with the part, to estimate the grasp force based on the vision feedback of the probe configuration. A Jacobian based controller is then used for position manipulation while maintaining the desired squeeze force. Experimental results with two probes and two camera are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller to move the part to specified position and orientation while maintaining sufficient squeeze force to prevent part slippage.",

        "abstract": "Background subtraction is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications, such as robotics and automated surveillance systems. The performance of high-level visions tasks such as object detection and tracking is dependent on effective foreground detection techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel background modeling algorithm that represents the background as a linear combination of dictionary atoms and the foreground as a sparse error, when one uses the respective set of dictionary atoms as basis elements to linearly approximate/reconstruct a new image. The dictionary atoms represent variations of the background model, and are learned from the training frames. The sparse foreground estimation during the training and performance phases is formulated as a Lasso [1] problem, while the dictionary update step in the training phase is motivated from the K-SVD algorithm [2]. Our proposed method works well in the presence of foreground in the training frames, and also gives the foreground masks for the training frames as a by-product of the batch training phase. Experimental validation is provided on standard datasets with ground truth information, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shown.",

Microrobots based on active material were designed to perform micromanipulation tasks in various environments such as microrobotic stations or electronic microscopes (SEM, TEM). These active materials are used to generate proportional actuation, but show some drawbacks we want to avoid (non linearity, integration of sensors, ...). In this paper we propose a new type of microrobot, called digital microrobot. It is based on the use of bistable modules (Fig. 1), and generates a discrete workspace. This microrobot can be used in open-loop mode and gets rid of bulky and expensive instruments and sensor integration. Moreover, no external energy is required to maintain the microrobot in a given position. The study presented in this paper is dedicated to the design of the robotic structure in order to generate a desired workspace.",

Unlike existing control methods which rely on separate sensing systems, this direct approach utilizes magnetic field measurements for feedback and eliminates the complicated multi-DOF orientation detection in closed-loop control which may cause time-delay and affect system sampling rate. By capitalizing on the rotor magnetic field implicit dependence on orientation, the control law derivation and torque coefficient estimation can be obtained simultaneously and directly from field measurements without explicit determination of the rotor orientation, thereby improving computational efficiency and eliminating error accumulation. The control method is simulated in 2-DOF motion with a CAD model of a spherical actuator.",

It is fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) process. The nano-scale size is important for minimal damage to biological specimen. The Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is used as a target biological specimen, which is one of the important model organism for diseases analysis.

        "abstract": "DisCoverage is a distributed strategy for frontier-based multi-robot exploration. The robots coordinate by a partition of the environment, and choose their target points by optimizing a locally decomposable objective function. In [9] DisCoverage for convex regions was proposed. In this work, we extend DisCoverage to support arbitrary non-convex real-world environments with obstacles. Therefore, we introduce a transformation of non-convex environments to robot centric star-shaped domains. This results in a general solution with broader applications for exploration and path planning. Simulations as well as experiments with real robots demonstrate the exploration progress.",

In such a sparse network, a robot may not always have the latest odometry and measurements from other robots. Our approach allows robots to obtain a temporary (localization and map) estimate at the current timestep using information available locally, but we also ensure that the centralized-equivalent estimate can always be recovered by all robots at a later time; we do not require a robot to keep track of what other robots know when it applies the Markov property to discard past information. Our method is validated through a hardware SLAM experiment where we distribute data association hypotheses amongst a team of robots. Estimate errors are shown to validate the performance of our approach. We also discuss the trade-offs and show comparisons between our distributed approach versus a non-distributed one.",

A fully distributed team planning algorithm is proposed that utilizes limited shared information as it becomes available, and data fusion techniques are introduced for merging estimates of the target's position from vehicles that regain contact after long periods of time. The proposed data fusion techniques are shown to avoid overcounting information, which ensures that combining data from different vehicles will not decrease the performance of the search. Motivated by the underwater search domain, a realistic underwater acoustic communication channel is used to determine the probability of successful data transfer between two locations. The channel model is integrated into a simulation of multiple autonomous vehicles in both open ocean and harbor search scenarios. The simulated experiments demonstrate that distributed coordination with limited communication significantly improves team performance versus prior techniques that continually maintain connectivity.",

        "abstract": "Data association mistakes, estimation and measurement errors are some of the factors that can contribute to incorrect observations in robotic sensor networks. In order to act reliably, a robotic network must be able to fuse and correct its perception of the world by discarding any outlier information. This is a difficult task if the network is to be deployed remotely and the robots do not have access to ground-truth sites or manual calibration. In this paper, we present a novel, distributed scheme for robust data fusion in autonomous robotic networks. The proposed method adapts the RANSAC algorithm to exploit measurement redundancy, and enables robots determine an inlier observation with local communications. Different hypotheses are generated and voted for using a dynamic consensus algorithm. As the hypotheses are computed, the robots can change their opinion making the voting process dynamic. Assuming that at least one hypothesis is initialized with only inliers, we show that the method converges to the maximum likelihood of all the inlier observations in a general instance. Several simulations exhibit the good performance of the algorithm, which also gives acceptable results in situations where the conditions to guarantee convergence do not hold.",

Current work further refines the learned system, often to perform the task better than the human could. However, the underlying assumption is that the demonstrations are successful, and are appropriate to reproduce. We, instead, consider the possibility that the human has failed in their attempt, and their demonstration is an example of what not to do. Thus, instead of maximizing the similarity of generated behaviors to those of the demonstrators, we examine two methods that deliberately avoid repeating the human's mistakes.",

But due to the hysteresis nonlinearity with input saturation, it is challenging to design an ultrafast output feedback controller with large region of closed-loop stability. To address this problem, we developed a dual-mode nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method, in which an optimal input profile found by solving an open-loop optimal control problem drives the nonlinear system state into the terminal invariant set; afterwards a linear output-feedback controller steers the state to the origin asymptotically. In contrast to the classical output-feedback controller, the settling time is effectively decreased and the closed-loop stable region is substantially increased by the present NMPC with almost no loss of the nanopositioning accuracy. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed switching control method are examined by extensive experiments on a Physik Instrumente P-563.3CL triple-axis nanopositioning stage.",

The architecture, navigation and localization systems are described along with the results achieved in different urban sites. In particular, a localization approach based on optical beacons was used and guaranteed position errors sufficient for a safe robot navigation. We report also the first results of a long-term experimentation of the DustCart robot in Peccioli, a small town of Tuscany (Italy).

        "abstract": "Computing the Minkowski sums of rotating ob jects has always been done naively by re-computing every Minkowski sum from scratch. The correspondences between the Minkowski sums are typically completely ignored. We propose a method, called DYMSUM, that can efficiently update the Minkowski sums of rotating convex polyhedra. We show that DYMSUM is significantly more efficient than the traditional approach, in particular when the size of the input polyhedra are large and when the rotation is small between frames. From our experimental results, we show that the computation time of the proposed method grows slowly with respect to the size of the input comparing to the naive approach.",

Our computational solutions are complementary to passive and compliant hardware. We focus on the case where human motion can be predicted. In these cases, the robot can select optimal motions in response to human actions and maximize safety. By representing the domain as a Markov Game, we enable the robot to not only react to the human but also to construct an infinite horizon optimal policy of actions and responses. Experimentally, we apply our model to simulated robot sword defense. Our approach enables a simulated 7-DOF robot arm to block known attacks in any sequence. We generate optimized blocks and apply game theoretic tools to choose the best action for the defender in the presence of an intelligent adversary.",

        "abstract": "Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of the inverse dynamic model, which is linear with respect to the dynamic parameters. This model is calculated with torque and position sampled data while the robot is tracking reference trajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear least-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. This method requires the joint force/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity and acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high sampling rates. A new method called DIDIM (Direct and Inverse Dynamic Identification Models) has been proposed and validated on a 2 degree-of freedom robot [1]. DIDIM method requires only the joint force/torque measurement. It is based on a closed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same structure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the actual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of the error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. A validation experiment on a 6 dof Staubli TX40 robot shows that DIDIM method is very efficient on industrial robots.",

Considering that the thrust of fish mainly results from the force of trailing vortex, added lateral pressure, and leading-edge suction force, the dynamic equations of the swimming fish have been derived by summing up the longitudinal force, lateral force, and yaw moment on each propulsive component in the framework of Lagrangian mechanics. Furthermore, using the bio-inspired Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) as the swimming data generator, the overall dynamic propulsive characteristics of the swimming robot are estimated in a mathematical environment (i.e., Mathematica). As a case study, the created dynamic model offers a good guide to seeking pragmatic backward swimming patterns for a carangiform robotic fish, which exemplifies the validity of the CPG-coupled dynamic model.",

        "abstract": "Biomorphic structures for robotic manipulation based on tendon-driven mechanisms have been considered in robotic design for several decades, since they provide lightweight end-effectors with high dynamics. Following this trend, many new robot designs have being proposed based on tendon driven systems. Quite noticeably, the most advanced ones include also higher kinematic pairs and unilateral types of constraints. In this paper, we present a general framework for modeling the above class of mechanical systems for robotic manipulation. Such systems, including biomorphically designed devices, consist of articulated limbs with redundant tendinous actuation and unilateral rolling constraints. Methods based on convex analysis are applied to attack this broader class of mechanisms, and are shown to provide a basis for the dynamic control of co-contraction and internal forces that guarantee the correct operation of the system, despite limited friction between contacting surfaces or object fragility. An algorithm is described and tested that integrates a computed torque law, and allows to control tendon actuators to \"optimally\" comply with the prescribed constraints.",

Additionally, the visibility constraint problem is solved for this type of approach by using any visual sensor obeying a central projection model.

        "abstract": "Shared control is a common used method for human and wheelchair cooperation. However, most of the previous shared control methods didn't think much of the effect caused by the difference in the user's control ability. The control weight of a user in these methods is irrelevant to the user's capability or the driving conditions. In this paper, a dynamic shared control method is proposed to adapt wheelchair's assistance to the variations of user performance and the environmental changes. Three evaluation indices including safety, comfort and obedience are designed to evaluate wheelchair performance in real time. A minimax multi-objective optimization algorithm is adopted to calculate the user's control weight. The results of lab experiments and elderly home field tests show that this method can adapt the degree of wheelchair's autonomy to the user's control ability and it makes driving wheelchair much easier for elder people.",

In the proposed method, the negative feedback to the image moments is used to control the vertical motion and rotation around the roll axis. On the other hand, the negative feedback cannot be used to control the horizontal motion due to under-actuation of a quadrotor. Thus, a novel control method is introduced to control the horizontal motion. Simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.",

This work overcomes the static configuration problems by using visual localization to track multiple wireless microphones in the environment with enough accuracy to combine their auditory streams in a traditional localization algorithm. In this manner, microphones can move or be moved about the environment, and still be combined with existing on-robot microphones to extend array baselines and effective listening ranges without having to re-measure inter-microphone distances.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose the concept of dynamics-based visual inspection for the verification of structural dynamic properties of a vibrating object; the inspection method involves the analysis of the vibration distribution of the object by using a high-frame-rate video. Under unknown ambient excitation, modal parameters of an excited object are simultaneously estimated to determine its input-invariant dynamic properties by using a fast output-only modal analysis algorithm, SSI-CPAST. The algorithm was implemented on a 2000-fps vision platform, and it facilitates non-destructive monitoring of the structure of beam-shaped objects vibrating at dozens of hertz; the algorithm detects small changes in the dynamic properties of the objects caused by internal defects such as fatigue cracks. The modal parameters resonant frequency and mode shape were actually estimated for beam-shaped objects excited by human finger tapping to verify the performance of 2000-fps real-time dynamics-based visual inspection.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, research on visual SLAM has produced robust algorithms providing, in real time at 30 Hz, both the 3D model of the observed rigid scene and the 3D camera motion using as only input the gathered image sequence. These algorithms have been extensively validated in rigid human-made environments -indoor and outdoor- showing robust performance in dealing with clutter, occlusions or sudden motions. Medical endoscopic sequences naturally pose a monocular SLAM problem: an unknown camera motion in an unknown environment. The corresponding map would be useful in providing 3D information to assist surgeons, to support augmented reality insertions or to be exploited by medical robots. In this paper we propose the combination EKF Monocular SLAM + 1-Point RANSAC + Randomised List Relocalization to process laparoscopic sequences -abdominal cavity images-. The sequences are challenging due to: 1) cluttering produced by tools; 2) sudden motions of the camera; 3) laparoscope frequently goes in and out of abdominal cavity; 4) tissue deformation caused by respiration, heartbeats and/or surgical tools. Real medical image sequences provide experimental validation.",

Both a conservative reduced-order running model and one with a simple motor and friction model are used to simulate running with a rolling foot. We find that having a larger foot radius implies smoother peak vertical ground reaction forces. Increased foot radius also yields, up to a point, a larger region of stable gaits for the conservative system, and more stable, fast, and efficient gaits for the actuated version. These results motivate the design of a new set of legs to test these findings on a dynamic running platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an on-line nonlinear least squares algorithm for multi-sensor autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. The approach integrates the global constraints of range to and GPS position of a surface vehicle or buoy communicated via acoustic modems and relative pose constraints arising from targets detected in side-scan sonar images. The approach utilizes an efficient optimization algorithm, iSAM, which allows for consistent on-line estimation of the entire set of trajectory constraints. The optimized trajectory can then be used to more accurately navigate the AUV, to extend mission duration, and to avoid GPS surfacing. As iSAM provides efficient access to the marginal covariances of previously observed features, automatic data association is greatly simplified - particularly in sparse marine environments. A key feature of our approach is its intended scalability to single surface sensor (a vehicle or buoy) broadcasting its GPS position and simultaneous one-way travel time range (OWTT) to multiple AUVs. We discuss why our approach is scalable as well as robust to modem transmission failure. Results are provided for an ocean experiment using a Hydroid REMUS 100 AUV co-operating with one of two craft: an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a manned support vessel. During these experiments the ranging portion of the algorithm ran online on-board the AUV. Extension of the paradigm to multiple missions via the optimization of successive survey missions (and the resultant sonar mosaics) is also demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate how to find high-quality motion plans for high-dimensional holonomic systems efficiently using dynamic programming in a learned subspace of vastly reduced dimension. Our approach (SLASHDP) learns the low dimensional cost structure of an optimal control problem via an efficient spectral method. This structure results in a symmetric value function that serves as a an efficiently-computable surrogate for the true value function. High-quality feedback motion plans can then be obtained from the symmetric value function. Experimental results show that SLASHDP yields higher-quality plans than can be obtained by post-processing plans generated by a sampling-based motion planner, and with less computational effort for very high-dimensional problems. We demonstrate high-quality dynamic programming plans for an arm planning problem of up to 144 dimensions without using any domain-specific knowledge aside from that learned automatically by SLASHDP. Positive results are also shown for a high-dimensional deformable robot planning problem.",

The problem of planning using dense data during large-scale map deformation is addressed by using a hybrid metric-topological planner that maintains locally consistent policies. These policies are cached, providing efficiency gains relative to alternate planning approaches that are characterized using complexity analysis. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach in handling notable map deformation while achieving good efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Given an image and an aligned depth map of an object, our goal is to estimate the full 7-dimensional gripper configuration\u2014its 3D location, 3D orientation and the gripper opening width. Recently, learning algorithms have been successfully applied to grasp novel objects\u2014ones not seen by the robot before. While these approaches use low-dimensional representations such as a \u2018grasping point\u2019 or a \u2018pair of points\u2019 that are perhaps easier to learn, they only partly represent the gripper configuration and hence are sub-optimal. We propose to learn a new \u2018grasping rectangle\u2019 representation: an oriented rectangle in the image plane. It takes into account the location, the orientation as well as the gripper opening width. However, inference with such a representation is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a two step process in which the first step prunes the search space efficiently using certain features that are fast to compute. For the remaining few cases, the second step uses advanced features to accurately select a good grasp. In our extensive experiments, we show that our robot successfully uses our algorithm to pick up a variety of novel objects.",

This is motived by requirements to have high utilisation of resources and through-put of product. Current approaches used to solve the planning and scheduling problem, particularly with multiple vehicles have often been too limited in scope to address and attempt to optimise solutions. The approach presented here outlines a solution developed by INRO Technologies Limited using a shared Coordinated Path Planner and Scheduler module for all automated vehicles, observing non-holonomic constraints.

The current state of the art is to use Gaussian process latent variable models (GP-LVM). This method works well, but relies on a signature uniqueness assumption which limits its applicability to only signal-rich environments. Moreover, it does not scale computationally to large sets of data, requiring O (N3) operations per iteration. We present a GraphSLAM-like algorithm for signal strength SLAM. Our algorithm shares many of the benefits of Gaussian processes, yet is viable for a broader range of environments since it makes no signature uniqueness assumptions. It is also more tractable to larger map sizes, requiring O (N2) operations per iteration. We compare our algorithm to a laser-SLAM ground truth, showing it produces excellent results in practice.",

        "abstract": "The multi-finger robot hand (IRA-Hand I) is specially designed for massage applications. Surface electromyographic (SEMG) evaluation of therapeutic massage effects using multi-finger robot hand are presented in this paper. After an isometric 50% MVC (maximum voluntary contraction) of human back muscles is performed for 90 seconds, SEMG signals of the subject show a muscular fatigue. A grasp-kneading massage by the robot hand is applied on the subject's shoulder for recovering from muscular fatigue. To evaluate the therapeutic effects of massage, the SEMG signals measured from the trapezius muscles before and after the massage therapy are analyzed. Electrical activity (EA) and median frequency (MF) of the SEMG signals are calculated as indexes of the muscle physiological states. The experimental results show that EA increases from the occurrence of fatigue, while MF shifts towards lower frequency in the spectral distribution. After massage, a decrease in EA and an increase in MF are observed which demonstrate the effectiveness of recovery through the grasp-kneading massage by the robot hand. In addition, the joint analysis of EMG spectrum and amplitude (JASA), which considers the changes in time domain and in frequency domain simultaneously, verifies that the therapeutic massage recovers the trapezius muscle from fatigue effectively. For comparison, the experiments with a massage specialist performing the massage therapy are conducted with the same procedures. It is evidenced that the robot hand massage has even better effectiveness than the human hand in most cases.",

        "abstract": "For battery-powered mobile robots to operate for long periods of time, it is critical to optimize their motion so as to minimize energy consumption. The driving motors are a major source of power consumption. In this paper, we study the problem of finding velocity profiles for car-like robots so as to minimize the energy consumed while traveling along a given path. We start with an established model for energy consumption of DC motors. We present closed form solutions for the unconstrained case and for the case where there is a bound on maximum velocity. We also study a general problem where the robot's path is composed of segments (e.g. circular arcs and line segments). We are given a velocity bound for each segment. For this problem, we present a dynamic programming solution which uses the solution for the single-constraint case as a subroutine. In addition, we present a calibration method to find model parameters. Finally, we present results from experiments conducted on a custom-built robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for floor obstacle segmentation in omnidirectional images which rests upon the fusion of multiple classification generated from heterogeneous segmentation schemes. The individual naive Bayes classifiers rely on different features and cues to determine a pixel's class label. Ground truth data for training and testing the classifiers is obtained from the superposition of 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device camera. The classification is supported by edge detection which indicate the presence of obstacles and sonar range data. The complementary expert decisions are aggregated by stacked generalization, behavior knowledge space or voting combination. The combined floor classifier achieves a classification accuracy of up to 0.96 true positive rate with only 0.03 false positive rate. A robust robot navigation is accomplished by arbitration among a reactive obstacle avoidance and a corridor following behavior using the robots local free space as perception.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we address a robust matching technique based on coded structured lighting (SL) to achieve real-time 3-D reconstructions. To that purpose, most existing approaches involve color or grey levels coding but they are well-known to be sensitive to spectral properties and texture of the viewed surfaces. Therefore, the overall robustness of the proposed technique comes first from the geometrical features used in conjunction with the SL neighbourhood scheme to carry out pattern coding. Second, a desired minimum Hamming distance between features' codewords drives the pattern design. This is suited for autonomous navigation in unknown environments as this parameter enables codewords correction capabilities during the decoding stage in real-time. Furthermore, we take advantage of the known epipolar geometry by including projective invariants between corresponding epipolar lines directly in the pattern components. Thus, the final pattern displays relocated and reoriented (cuneiform) features along the epipolar lines. This grouping also contributes to reduce the search space more and results in a significantly less constrained coding. Finally, we show how this coding and this non-grid based pattern offer efficient and fast correction of mislabeled features due to blurring, spectral harmful effects and surfaces discontinuities prior to the 3-D reconstruction of real scenes.",

The equivalent model is obtained through the characterization of the module, graph theory and geometric modeling of robots. After the transformation, the resulting kinematic and dynamic parameters are similar to the traditional model of a single configuration robot. Once the equivalent model is obtained, it can be used within different robot applications.",

For the cable-driven robot, the flexibility of the cable makes the robot have good compliance and meet safety requirements; however, it brings a greater influence on the movement accuracy of the mechanism. Thus, kinematic calibration alone cannot accurately establish the error model. In view of the error analysis and flexibility compensation of the cable-driven robot, this paper analyzes the effect of flexible rope on kinematic movement accuracy by introducing a flexibility compensation weighting factor. A kind of comprehensive error analysis model of the cable-driven robot was established. By using kinematic calibration algorithm, it organically merges together the kinematic errors caused by the geometric parameters errors and that caused by flexibility of cable. With shoulder joint of the cable-driven humanoid-arm manipulator as the experimental object, the results showed that the algorithm has a better convergence, and it can effectively improve the accuracy of the robot motion control.",

The first approach that is presented combines filtered dynamic equations with a recursive least squares estimation algorithm to provide a smoothened force signal, which is useful in the (common) case of noisy torque measurements. The second approach, which uses a generalized momentum based disturbance observer, is mainly discussed to compare it to the first approach. Although very different in appearance, it is shown that a close connection exists between both approaches. Simulation results for both algorithms are shown, and experimental results derived from a sensorless admittance controller that was implemented using the algorithms are presented.",

The antibody binding technique is developed and used to attach bacteria to liposome's surface for enhancing liposome mobility. Bacteria and liposome are strongly combined through antibody. Consequently, the effect of antibody when bacteria attached to liposome is studied experimentally. The stochastic nature of bacterial propulsion of liposome is investigated experimentally and analytically. It is shown that antibody plays an important role in attaching bacteria to liposome and the liposome with bacteria moved broader compared to the liposome without bacteria. Statistical calculation matches well with experimental data.",

Three supporting manners of the pinching force are evaluated by switching a fingertip part of the exoskeleton. One is that the assistive force is applied to the wearer's finger so that the force could be sensible by the wearer. Another case is that the assistive force is directly delivered to a grasping object without a wearer's fingertip. The other is that a part of the force directly affects the object and the rest affects the wearer's finger. Through pilot experiments, transitions of the accuracy through training in these cases are compared each other.",

        "abstract": "Microinjection is the highly efficient delivery method of exogenous materials into cells, and it has been widely used in biomedical research areas such as transgenics and genomics. However, this direct injection task is time consuming and laborious, resulting in low throughput and poor reproducibility. This paper describes a telerobotic shared control (TSC) framework for the microinjection with high manipulation efficiencies, in which a micromanipulator is controlled by the shared motion commands of both the human operator (direct manipulation) and the autonomous controller. To determine the optimal gains between the operator and the controller, we proposed a quantitative evaluation method using Fitts' and steering laws. The results showed that a 40%-60% weighting on the human operator produced better performance for both speed and accuracy of task completion, and suggested that some level of automation or human involvement is important for microinjection tasks.",

        "abstract": "The Kalman filter is widely used but the tedious and time-consuming tunings of the filter parameters must be unavoidably carried out before use, and frustratingly, after every reconfiguration on the sensors. In this paper, we formulated the measurement residual in a performance index, and utilised an evolutionary method to automatically and efficiently calibrate the parameters of the sigma-point Kalman filter. Without analytically resolving the nonlinear and multivariate process and measurement models in the filter, the proposed method implicitly solves for the filter parameters in a gradient-free manner through a series of strategies including the selection, crossover and shuffling mutation. Furthermore, to demonstrate the superior performance of the method, we applied this method to a highly nonlinear and coupled state estimation problem on an unmanned helicopter which experiences a GNSS outage. The empirical results showed that the proposed method not only automated and significantly accelerated the exhausting tweaking of the filter parameters, but also yielded a high quality tuning result that strikingly outperformed an earlier, painstakingly handcrafted calibration.",

The problem is on the usage of the overconfident optimal proposal distribution caused by perfect map assumption, so that predictive robot poses are sampled from the underestimated error covariance in the particle filtering process. The proposed solution computes more precise error covariance of the robot which contains uncertainties of the robot, map, and measurement noise. Experimental results using the benchmark dataset confirmed that the covariance of the proposed method is always larger than that of the conventional method while inducing slower increasing rate of the weight variance with less resamplings.",

First, because of the benefit that the vanishing point provides knowledge for clear path detection, we apply an example-based method to estimate initial vanishing point candidates. Then, instead of building a pre-trained clear path model over the limited training set, we propose an example-based global image matching method to get an approximate idea of clear path candidate regions, and use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for local image patch modeling to further improve the clear path detection. Finally, we develop an iterative probabilistic refinement to improve performance of both components. Experimental results of real road scenes are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

It has been recently shown that multiple different physical robot kinematic designs can be obtained from (essentially) a single Jacobian that has desirable fault tolerant properties. Fault tolerance in this case is defined as the post-failure Jacobian possessing the largest possible minimum singular value over all possible locked-joint failures. In this work, a mathematical analysis that describes the number of possible planar robot designs for optimally fault-tolerant Jacobians is presented. Two examples, one that is optimal to a single joint failure and the second that is optimal to two joint failures, are discussed. The paper concludes by illustrating some of the large variability in the global kinematic properties of these designs, despite being generated from the same Jacobian.",

In order to maximize their versatility the design and preliminary testing is shown of an exoskeletal spine mechanism, called \"exo-spine\", that allows the wearer to move all degrees of freedom of his spine and shoulder girdle. Based on the primary forces to be supported during lifting, identified as gravity forces from loads lifted in front of the wearer, as well as functional degrees of freedom, which is a control strategy used by our central nervous system, this mechanism can be actuated using only one motor to provide the required support. Experiments indicate a substantial, although not problematic amount of friction as well as further requirements for the control of the assisting force. Besides improving exoskeletons its basic structure and design principles may be successfully applied to rehabilitation as well.",

        "abstract": "Biomechanical studies suggest that animals' abilities to tune their effective leg compliance in response to changing terrain conditions plays an important role in their agile, robust locomotion. However, despite growing interest in leg compliance within the robotics literature, little experimental work has been reported on tunable passive leg compliance in running machines. In this paper we present an empirical study into the role of leg compliance using a composite tunable leg design implemented on our dynamic hexapod, EduBot, with gaits optimized for running speed using a range of leg stiffnesses, on two different surface stiffnesses, and with two different payload configurations (0 kg and 0.91 kg). We found that leg stiffness, surface compliance, and payload had a significant impact on the robot's final optimized speed and efficiency. These results document the value and efficacy of what we believe is the first autonomous dynamic legged robot capable of runtime leg stiffness adjustment.",

The balancer can be configured as a flywheel mode or a balancer mode by shifting the center of gravity of the balancer. This balancer configuration is changed according to the situation of the bicycle system, which corresponds to the change of the dimension of the system. The balancer is configured as a flywheel, when disturbances to the system are large, and it will switch to the balancer when the position of the center of the gravity should be shifted. Stabilizing bicycle with the flywheel has better performance than the balancer but it cannot control to shift the bicycle angle to track the desired value, unlike the balancer which can do this motion. The balancing controller is derived based on an output-zeroing controller. Numerical simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",

By combining the smooth and efficient motion of wheels on the flat ground with the great mobility of legs on rough terrains, the design of the robot aims for agile and versatile yet efficient locomotion in both natural and artificial environments. Compared to most hybrid platforms, which have separate mechanisms of wheels and legs, this robot is implemented with a transformation mechanism that directly changes the morphology of wheels (i.e., a full circle) into half-circle legs, each with 2 active degrees-of-freedom (i.e., combining two half circles as a leg ). The experimental testing includes flat terrain driving and turning in the wheeled mode, leg-wheel mode switching, and step crossing, bar crossing, natural rough terrain walking, and stair climbing in the legged mode.",

Starting with individual exploration, the robots switch to cooperative exploration only when they are not able to locate the field minimum based on the information collected individually. In order to test and demonstrate the switching strategy in real-world environment, we implement the switching strategy on a multi-robot test-bed. The behaviors of a group of robots are compared when different parameters for exploration are adopted. Especially, we observe the effect of memory lengths on the switching behaviors as predicted by theoretical results. The experimental results also justify the effects of different formation sizes and noise attenuation levels on the performance of the cooperative H\u221e filter that are utilized in the cooperative exploration phase.",

The main purpose is to validate existing simulated, i.e. claimed, findings demonstrating the advantages of kinematic redundancy in terms of singularity avoidance and, therefore, accuracy and precision. Exemplarily, the kinematically redundant prototype of the Institute at Mechatronic Systems is introduced. It is based on the well known planar 3RRR mechanism. In order to achieve kinematic redundancy, a prismatic actuator is added to the structure allowing one base joint to move linearly. As a result, the mechanism is able to reconfigure, i.e. optimize, its geometry according to different performance criteria and motion strategies. While performing a geometrical reconfiguration and following several desired (optimized) trajectories the pose of the end-effector is determined using an external measurement device. Hence, in addition to the encoder data of the actuators the performance can be analyzed without using any (uncertain) kinematic models. This allows for a meaningful comparative evaluation of the performance of kinematically redundant mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In repetitive trajectories, adaptable compliance actuators can minimize energy consumption thanks to their ability to adjust the level of stiffness which allows the exploitation of the natural dynamics of their link based on the desired motion's frequency. However for most of these actuators in case of a variable frequency motion, it is not energetically beneficial to exploit the natural dynamics in the real time due to the considerably high amount of energy needed to change the stiffness. AwAS (Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness) achieves the stiffness regulation not through the control of the spring pretension (as in most of the existing variable stiffness joints) but by controlling the location of the spring elements. An important consequence of this mechanism is that the displacement needed to change the stiffness is perpendicular to the forces generated by the springs which in turn helps to minimize the energy/power required to regulate the stiffness. It is experimentally shown that AwAS is capable of minimizing energy consumption through exploiting the natural dynamics in real time for both fixed and variable frequency motions.",

Prior information can be obtained for many environments in many different ways. However, this information can be incomplete, out-of-date, or presented in a different form than that used by the robot. Therefore, we argue that prior information is most naturally modelled as sets of potential constraints that act between landmarks. We present an extension of GraphSLAM that incorporates these constraints. We illustrate the results in an experiment with a 3D laser scanner and demonstrate a significant improvement in performance.",

        "abstract": "A drilling task requires a mechanism with five degrees of freedom, in order to achieve the correct position and orientation of the drilling tool. When performed with a standard 6-axes industrial robot, this task leaves an extra degree of freedom that can be exploited in order to achieve any additional criterion. Unfortunately, typical industrial robotic control architectures do not allow the user to modify the inverse kinematics algorithm, and thus to solve task redundancy following any specified criterion. In this paper a method to enforce an arbitrary redundancy resolution criterion on top of an industrial robot controller is discussed and applied to the execution of a drilling task. The extra degree of freedom is used to perform a torque-effective drilling. Experimental results achieved on the ABB IRB 140 industrial robot are presented.",

To this end, we design a damping that incorporates the configuration dependance of the robot. For a maximum level of safety, an additional emergency brake strategy based on kinetic energy considerations is introduced for situations in which self-collisions are not avoidable by the controller.

Exterior-rotor brushless motors seem better suited for these tasks than conventional interior rotor brushless motors. Models of these two motor types were used to calculate benchmarks and evaluate motor performance in simulated tasks for different motor geometries. Exterior rotor motors had higher motor constants and efficiency, but lower rated power compared with interior-rotor motors. They required less energy to perform typical robotic tasks. Four exterior-rotor motors were fabricated and compared with manufacturing data from the best existing brushless DC motors. The exterior-rotor motors had more than a 250% increase in stall torque density compared with the best known brushless DC motor (RoboDrive) and more than a 740% increase in stall torque density compared with more common motors such as those produced by MicroMo and Maxon. These exterior-rotor motors appear promising for robotic applications.",

Muscle synergies hypothesis is a prominent suggestion for this problem. In this paper, we investigated the muscle synergies extracted from human subjects in a producing-force task to explore the mechanism of the human's skillful hand-movement at producing force while manipulating objects. We observed a high correlation estimation of the muscle synergies with the hand force, and derived a role division of muscle synergies in generating the hand force as well. These results give an optimal but simple way to control robots so as to make the robots' movement as skillful as human's. To verify this idea, we proposed \"synergy based control\" method using the characteristics of human's muscle synergies observed, and tested it on a pneumatic-driven arm robot whose structure assumes the human arm's. The program is in its first stage to control the robot.",

To obtain the tangent plane to the surface at a point, the traditional approach applies total least squares to its small neighborhood. However, least squares becomes computationally very expensive when applied to the millions of measurements per second that current range sensors can generate. We reformulate the traditional least squares solution to allow the fast computation of surface normals, and propose a new approach that obtains the normals by calculating the derivatives of the surface from a spherical range image. Furthermore, we show that the traditional least squares problem is very sensitive to range noise and must be normalized to obtain accurate results. Experimental results with synthetic and real data demonstrate that our proposed method is not only more efficient by up to two orders of magnitude, but provides better accuracy than the traditional least squares for practical neighborhood sizes.",

        "abstract": "In many scenarios, domestic robot will regularly encounter unknown objects. In such cases, top-down knowledge about the object for detection, recognition, and classification cannot be used. To learn about the object, or to be able to grasp it, bottom-up object segmentation is an important competence for the robot. Also when there is top-down knowledge, prior segmentation of the object can improve recognition and classification. In this paper, we focus on the problem of bottom-up detection and segmentation of unknown objects. Gestalt psychology studies the same phenomenon in human vision. We propose the utilization of a number of Gestalt principles. Our method starts by generating a set of hypotheses about the location of objects using symmetry. These hypotheses are then used to initialize the segmentation process. The main focus of the paper is on the evaluation of the resulting object segments using Gestalt principles to select segments with high figural goodness. The results show that the Gestalt principles can be successfully used for detection and segmentation of unknown objects. The results furthermore indicate that the Gestalt measures for the goodness of a segment correspond well with the objective quality of the segment. We exploit this to improve the overall segmentation performance.",

        "abstract": "This article deals with a simple and flexible extrinsic calibration method, for non-overlapping camera rig. The cameras do not see the same area at the same time. They are rigidly linked and can be moved. The most representative application is the mobile robotics domain. The calibration procedure consists in maneuvering the system while each camera observes a static scene. A linear solution derived from hand eye calibration scheme is proposed to compute an initial estimate of the extrinsic parameters. The main contribution is a specific bundle adjustment which refines both the scene geometry and the extrinsic parameters. Finally, an efficient implementation of the specific bundle adjustment step is defined for online calibration purpose. The proposed approach is validated with both synthetic and real data.",

        "abstract": "Realizing automatic object search by robots in an indoor environment is one of the most important and challenging topics in mobile robot research. If the target object does not exist in a nearby area, the obvious strategy is to go to the area in which it was last observed. We have developed a robot system that collects 3D-scene data in an indoor environment during automatic routine crawling, and also detects objects quickly through a global search of the collected 3D-scene data. The 3D-scene data can be obtained automatically by transforming color images and range images into a set of color voxel data using self-location information. To detect an object, the system moves the bounding box of the target object by a certain step in the color voxel data, extracts 3D features in each box region, and computes the similarity between these features and the target object's features, using an appropriate feature projection learned beforehand. Taking advantage of the additive property of our 3D features, both feature extraction and similarity calculation are considerably accelerated. In the object learning process, the system obtains the feature-projection matrix by weighting unique features of the target object rather than its common features, resulting in reducing object detection errors.",

        "abstract": "The servomotors used in the joints of a manipulator or wheels of a rover in high risk applications, such as space applications, should be capable of continued functional operation even if insulation failure or open-circuit of a winding occur. This paper presents a fault-tolerant (FT) torque con troller for brushless motors that can maintain accurate torque production with minimum power dissipation subject to current limitations even if one of motor phases fails. The controller is developed based on the Fourier series model of the motor back-EMF waveform and the cogging torque. The faulty phase is detected from the covariance of the estimation error of a voltage observer. Subsequently, the phase currents of the remaining phases are optimally reshaped so that the motor accurately generates torque as requested while minimizing power loss subject to maximum current limitation of the current amplifiers. A closed-form solution to the optimization programming problem is found by using the Kuhn-Tucker theorem; rendering the control approach suitable for real-time implementation. Experimental results illustrate the capability of the FT controller to achieve ripple-free torque performance during a phase failure at the expenses of increasing the mean power loss by 28%.",

In particular, it focuses on fault-tolerant formation control. In our prior work, symmetries in the system were exploited to simplify the nonlinear Lyapunov stability analysis for symmetric systems. The type of symmetry considered is a discrete symmetry where the system is composed of many repeated instances of interacting identical agents. The results are based on Lyapunov methods, and hence are of general applicability and specifically these results are applicable to both distributed as well as non-distributed coordination methods. This paper considers the same types of systems and extends the stability results to the cases of robustness of formation stability under failure of individual agents.",

It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring to make any changes to the inner workings of any classifier, and therefore make the perception for a robot better. We have recently proposed a generic model (Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Model) that enables us to easily take state-of-art classifiers as black-boxes and improve performance. In this video, we show that we can use our FeCCM model to quickly combine existing classifiers for various sub-tasks, and build a shoe finder robot in a day. The video shows our robot using FeCCM to find a shoe on request.",

        "abstract": "Localization and mapping are fundamental tasks in mobile robotics. State-of-the-arts often rely on the static world assumption using the occupancy grids. However, the real environment is typically dynamic. We propose the feasibility grids to facilitate the representation of both the static scene and the moving objects. The dual sensor models are introduced to discriminate between stationary and moving objects in mobile robot localization. Instead of estimating the occupancy states, the feasibility grids maintain the stochastic estimates of the feasibility (crossability) states of the environment. Given that an observation can be decomposed into stationary objects and moving objects, incorporating the feasibility grids in localization yields performance improvements over the occupancy grids, particularly in highly dynamic environments. Our approach is extensively evaluated using real data acquired with a planar laser range finder. The experimental results show that the feasibility grid is capable of rapid convergence and robust performance in mobile robot localization by taking into account moving object information. A root mean squares accuracy of within 50 cm is achieved, without the aid of GPS, which is sufficient for autonomous navigation in crowded urban scenes. The empirical results suggest that the performance of localization can be improved when handling the changing environment explicitly. I.",

This filter framework efficiently incorporates measurements from hundreds of opportunistic visual features to constrain the motion estimate, while allowing navigating and sustained tracking with respect to a few persistent features. In addition, vertical features in the environment are opportunistically used to provide global attitude references. Accurate pose estimation is demonstrated on a sequence including fast traversing, where visual features enter and exit the fleld-of-view quickly, as well as hover and ingress maneuvers where drift free navigation is achieved with respect to the environment.",

As the objective function to be optimized contains discontinuities, it can not be solved by standard gradient based approaches and thus a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based method is applied. Matching of laser scans acquired from relatively far apart robot poses is achieved by applying GA on top of the Iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The new SLAM formulation and the use of a global optimization algorithm successfully avoid the convergence to local minimum for both the scan matching and the SLAM problem. Both simulated and experimental data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",

        "abstract": "Falcon-III is a robotic personal vehicle that has been designed for uneven terrain usage. It has a two-degree-of-freedom suspension mechanism that allows the passenger's seat orientation (pitch and roll) to be controlled by actively adjusting the height of its wheels. This paper discusses the motion control of such a vehicle on rough terrain. In particular, we show that a feedback control law that measures the vehicle seat attitude and acts to correct it, aiming at maintaining the horizontal seat posture during the traversing of uneven terrain, is by itself insufficient to provide satisfactory performance on certain types of terrain. Therefore, we propose a predictive motion control strategy, in addition to the feedback control law, that dynamically controls the vehicle suspension in order to facilitate the negotiation of obstacles - the motion executed is somewhat similar to that performed by a cyclist when overcoming a step-like obstacle. When tall step-like obstacles have to be negotiated, it may be necessary to dynamically lift one of the wheels from the ground, in which case a gait pattern emerges.",

        "abstract": "One of the key challenges in mobile robot teleoperation is master-slave kinematic dissimilarity: master device (e.g., joystick) has a bounded workspace, while slave mobile robot can/should cover an unbounded workspace. A direct master-position/slave-velocity coupling has been frequently used for this, which, yet, in general, violates passivity of the closed-loop system, since the master system with position output cannot be passive. In this paper, we propose a new notion of feedback r-passivity of general multi-dimensional Lagrangian systems, which allows us to achieve such master-position/slave-velocity coupling while enforcing passivity. Its applications to tele-driving of dynamic and kinematic WMRs with constant communication delay are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Progress in machine vision algorithms has led to widespread adoption of these techniques to automate several industrial assembly tasks. Nevertheless, shiny or specular objects which are common in industrial environments still present a great challenge for vision systems. In this paper, we take a step towards this problem under the context of vision-aided robotic assembly. We show that when the illumination source moves, the specular highlights remain in a region whose radius is inversely proportional to the surface curvature. This allows us to extract regions of the object that have high surface curvature. These points of high curvature can be used as features for specular objects. Further, an inexpensive multi-flash camera (MFC) design can be used to reliably extract these features. We show that one can use multiple views of the object using the MFC in order to triangulate and obtain the 3D location and pose of the shiny objects. Finally, we show a system consisting of a robot arm with an MFC that can perform automated detection and pose estimation of shiny screws within a cluttered bin, achieving position and orientation errors less than 0.5 mm and 0.8\u00b0 respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method to compute enveloping grasps with a multi-fingered robotic hand. The method is guided by the idea that a good grasp should maximize the contact surface between the held object and the hand's palmar surface. Starting from a given hand pregrasp configuration, the proposed method finds the hand poses that maximize this surface similarity. We use a surface descriptor that is based on a geodesic measure and on a continuous representation of the surfaces, unlike previous shape matching methods that rely on the Euclidean distance and/or discrete representation (e.g. random point set). Using geodesic contours to describe local surfaces enables us to detect details such as a handle or a thin part. Once the surface matching returns a set of hand poses, sorted by similarity, a second step is performed to adjust the hand configuration with the purpose of eliminating penetration of the object. Lastly, the grasp stability is tested in order to definitely validate the candidate grasps.",

        "abstract": "For robot mapping occupancy grid maps are the most common representation of the environment. However, most existing algorithms for creating such maps assume a fixed resolution of the grid cells. In this paper we present a novel mapping technique that chooses the resolution of each cell adaptively by merging and splitting cells depending on the measurements. The splitting of the cells is based on a statistical measure that we derive in this paper. In contrast to other approaches the adaption of the resolution is done online during the mapping process itself. Additionally, we introduce the Nd-Tree, a generalization of quadtrees and octrees that allows to subdivide any d-dimensional volume recursively with Nd children per node. Using this data structure our approach can be implemented in a very generic way and allows the creation of 2D, 3D and even higher dimensional maps using the same algorithm. Finally, we show results of our proposed method for 2D and 3D mapping using different kinds of range sensors.",

The proposed sensor can simulate the physical interaction between a human fingertip and an object in order to measure surface thermal information correctly. Furthermore, because the proposed sensor can be easily integrated with our vision-based force sensor, a comprehensive measurement device for measuring haptic information can be realized.

        "abstract": "We extend model-predictive control so as to make it applicable to robotic tasks such as legged locomotion, hand manipulation and ball bouncing. The online optimal control problem is defined in a first-exit rather than the usual finite-horizon setting. The exit manifold corresponds to changes in contact state. In this way the need for online optimization through dynamic discontinuities is avoided. Instead the effects of discontinuities are incorporated in a final cost which is tuned offline. The new method is demonstrated on the task of 3D ball bouncing. Even though our robot is mechanically limited, it bounces one ball robustly and recovers from a wide range of disturbances, and can also bounce two balls with the same paddle. This is possible due to intelligent responses computed online, without relying on pre-existing plans.",

        "abstract": "Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have gained a significant amount of research lately, with a number of universities and industry sponsors paving the way with micro flying robots to perform Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Missions. However, much of the work done in flapping wing MAVs till date has not shown performance improvements over their Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL), rotary-wing counterparts. Research and development over the years has shown that insects and birds have unmatched flying capabilities in the Low Reynolds Number Regime. Their phenomenal flight performance is attributed to among others the highly energy efficient actuation systems and their power to weight ratios. The paper proposes and illustrates new and energy-efficient actuation mechanisms and incorporating them into MAVs. The paper begins by elaborating on the background of our research and the need for energy efficiency in MAVs; followed by showcasing resonant, elastic / restorative actuation mechanisms and their control methodology to reduce flight-actuation energy requirements. In conclusion, the paper contrasts and compares all the actuation systems for power intake, scalability and mechanical complexity.",

        "abstract": "A paired robot system is developed for a class of tasks where two end-effectors work together; one placed inside and the other outside a confined box. The work was motivated by practical needs for aircraft wing box manufacturing and maintenance. Two robots, each carrying an end-effector, are engaged using strong magnets attracting each other and thereby supporting each body against gravity. The robots must move across the surface of the box, while avoiding interference with obstacles fixed to the surface. A novel paired robot with magnetic feet is presented that can flip and go over an obstacle while tightly holding each body against gravity. Furthermore, the paired robots can automatically be loaded and unloaded from the confined box through a small entry hole by flipping and sliding on the box surface. First the task conditions and functional requirements are described, and then the design concept of the flip-and-slide magnetic paired robots is presented. Kinematic and static models of the system are obtained, and the conditions for successful flipping and sliding are analyzed. Control algorithms for detaching as well as engaging magnetic feet are obtained. A prototype flip-and-slide paired robot system is designed and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated.",

A tour-taking robot autonomously follows a human guide through an environment, interpreting the guide's spoken utterances and the shared spatiotemporal context in order to acquire a spatially segmented and semantically labeled metrical-topological representation of the environment. The described tour-taking capability enables scalable deployment of mobile robots into human-occupied environments, and natural human-robot interaction for commanded mobility. Our primary contributions are an efficient, socially acceptable autonomous tour-following behavior and a tour interpretation algorithm that partitions a map into spaces labeled according to the guide's utterances. The tour-taking behavior is demonstrated in a multi-floor office building and evaluated by assessing the comfort of the tour guides, and by comparing the robot's map partitions to those produced by humans.",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in cardiac catheter technology promise to allow physicians to perform most cardiac interventions without stopping the heart or opening the chest. However, current cardiac devices, including newly developed catheter robots, are unable to accurately track and interact with the fast moving cardiac tissue without applying potentially damaging forces. This paper examines the challenges of implementing force control on a flexible robotic catheter. In particular, catheter friction and backlash must be compensated when controlling tissue interaction forces. Force controller designs are introduced and evaluated experimentally in a number of configurations. The controllers are based on the inner position loop force control approach where the position trajectory is adjusted to achieve a desired force on the target. Friction and backlash compensation improved force tracking up to 86% with residual RMS errors of 0.11 N while following a prerecorded cardiac tissue trajectory with accelerations of up to 3800 mm/s2. This performance provides sufficient accuracy to enable a wide range of beating heart surgical procedures.",

        "abstract": "Modern industrial robots are fast and have very good repetitional accuracy, which have made them indispensable in many manufacturing applications. However, they are usually programmed to follow desired trajectories and only get feedback from position sensors. This works fine as long as the environment is very well structured, but does not give good robustness to objects not being positioned or gripped accurately. A solution is to use additional sensing, such as force sensors and vision. How to combine the data from the different sensors and use it in a good way to control the robot is still an area of research. This paper describes an assembly scenario where a switch should be snapped into place in a box. Force sensing is used to resolve the uncertain position of the parts and detect the snap at the end of the operation. During the assembly an uncertain distance is estimated to improve the performance. By performing the assembly several times, learning is used to generate feed-forward data, which is used to speed up the assembly.",

A way to handle these difficulties is using force control. An experimental case where a semi-compliant rib is aligned to multiple surfaces is used as an example to show this. The constraint-based task specification framework is used for the modelling and control, and the search and alignment sequence required for the assembly is modeled with a state machine.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we developed a novel dynamic mobile platform capable of transforming between four wheel rapid driving mode with ZMP stabilization and two wheel balancing mode. Usually, the four wheel mobile platforms have low acceleration due to the high center of mass. Using the feed-forward ZMP stabilization method, we achieved high acceleration performance with maintaining stable ZMP. We use a LQR controller for two wheel balancing mode. In the two wheel balancing mode, there are two different driving modes, self-balancing mode, human-riding mode. The transformation between four wheel and two wheel mode is made possible by swing up and swing down control method. We prove the dynamic performance of mobile platform by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Flapping-flight micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) pose an ongoing design problem to the scientific community, requiring careful consideration of both body structure and force production. Here, we examine a flapping MAV prototype with a passively rotating wing design. While at the current scale the lift force produced is not enough for liftoff, observing its performance under roll and pitch control can lead to insights on both the body design and the eventual free-flight implementation. As the production of roll and pitch torques are primarily uncoupled for this design, PID control is implemented in the roll and pitch directions individually on a custom designed single degree of freedom rig. By doing so, we show that the body structure is capable of sustaining independent wing amplitudes and that actuator input voltage bias shifting is successful experimentally on a dynamically driven wing. Through force compensation, the experimentally tested controller is mapped to a 1/2 scale simulated system, theoretically capable of free-flight. Though initial simulation results suggest high sensitivity to feedback noise, simulations show that decoupled roll and pitch controllers have potential as a minimal computational means for hovering and translational motion.",

In particular, the friction effects acting at joint level have been rendered by means of a LuGre-like model and a procedure for the identification of the friction model parameters is described. With the aim of providing an online estimation of the effects due to the interaction of the robotic hand with the environment, a controller able to evaluate the overall external torque acting on the finger joints and to discern between friction and torques generated by the external interaction force without using direct measures of the contact forces is proposed. The identification and control tests are carried over on an experimental setup composed by a single finger phalanx, manufactured with the same material and techniques of the hand itself.",

The superposition of a horizontal vibration at the interface between the robot and work floor and an active variation of friction force, obtained by the vertical vibration of the base, makes the robot to move on the substrate. Periodic solutions obtained from the harmonic balance method can predict the contribution of the friction coefficient on the average velocity of the slider. Unlike traditional analytical techniques and in agreement with both numerical simulations and experiments reported in the literature, results show that the maximum average velocity occurs at a phase shift that varies with respect to system's configuration parameters. We have shown that the velocity of the device increases linearly with the relative amplitude of vibrations, whereas the step efficiency of motion, as a performance criterion, can be independently controlled by the driving frequency.",

Frictionless kinematic and quasistatic force models for this class of robots have been developed that incorporate bending and twisting of the tubes. Experimental evaluation of these models has revealed, however, a directional dependence of tube rotation on robot shape that is not predicted by these models. To explain this behavior, this paper models the contributions of friction arising from two sources: the distributed forces of contact between the tubes along their length and the concentrated bending moments generated at discontinuities in curvature and at the boundaries. It is shown that while friction due to distributed forces is insufficient to explain the experimentally observed tube twisting, a simple model of frictional torque arising from concentrated moments provides a good match with the experimental data.",

We recover a nearly-spherical dense depth panorama (360\u00b0\u00d7153\u00b0) by fusing depth from optical flow and stereo. We observe that for motion in a horizontal plane, optical flow and stereo generate nearly complementary distributions of depth resolution. While optical flow provides strong depth cues in the periphery and near the poles of the view-sphere, stereo generates reliable depth in a narrow band about the equator. We exploit this principle by modeling the depth resolution of optical flow and stereo in order to fuse them probabilistically in a spherical panorama. To aid the designer in achieving a desired field-of-view and resolution, we derive a linearized model of the rig in terms of three parameters (radii of the two mirrors plus axial separation from their centers). We analyze the error due to the violation of the Single Viewpoint (SVP) constraint and formulate additional constraints on the design to minimize the error. Performance is evaluated through simulation and with a real prototype by computing dense spherical panoramas in cluttered indoor settings.",

This work explores dynamic jumping with the planar biped prototype KURMET, which employs unidirectional series-elastic actuation at each of its joints. While this actuation scheme enables the performance of high-power dynamic movements like the jump, its presence complicates the jumping control problem and has prevented previous researchers from obtaining precise jump control in systems of reasonable complexity. To manage this problem, this paper develops a layered fuzzy control system for KURMET that realizes repeated dynamic hopping and accurate control of both torso height and velocity at each top of flight. An effective two-stage training approach is used for the fuzzy controller to learn the required, yet highly nonlinear, relationships between its inputs and outputs. Finally, the state machine employed at the lowest-level of control is used to achieve a maximal normalized jump height that outperforms most humans and can be sequenced with the hopping movement.",

        "abstract": "Many popular problems in robotics and computer vision including various types of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment (BA) can be phrased as least squares optimization of an error function that can be represented by a graph. This paper describes the general structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. Our system has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be specified in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while being general g2o offers a performance comparable to implementations of state of-the-art approaches for the specific problems.",

Historically, unconstrained robotic manipulation in board games has often proven to be more challenging than the underlying game reasoning, making it an ideal testbed for small-scale manipulation. The Gambit system includes a low-cost Kinect-style visual sensor, a custom manipulator, and state-of-the-art learning algorithms for automatic detection and recognition of the board and objects on it. As a use-case, we describe playing chess quickly and accurately with arbitrary, uninstrumented boards and pieces, demonstrating that Gambit's engineering and design represent a new state-of-the-art in fast, robust tabletop manipulation.",

A good representation has to account for two requirements: it should allow uncertain sensory fusion in a probabilistic way and it should serve as a basis for efficient grasp and motion generation. We consider Gaussian process implicit surface potentials as object shape representations. Sensory observations condition the Gaussian process such that its posterior mean defines an implicit surface which becomes an estimate of the object shape. Uncertain visual, haptic and laser data can equally be fused in the same Gaussian process shape estimate. The resulting implicit surface potential can then be used directly as a basis for a reach and grasp controller, serving as an attractor for the grasp end-effectors and steering the orientation of contact points. Our proposed controller results in a smooth reach and grasp trajectory without strict separation of phases. We validate the shape estimation using Gaussian processes in a simulation on randomly sampled shapes and the grasp controller on a real robot with 7DoF arm and 7DoF hand.",

        "abstract": "Face recognition in surveillance situations usually requires high resolution face images to be captured from remote active cameras. Since the recognition accuracy is typically a function of the face direction - with frontal faces more likely to lead to reliable recognition - we propose a system which optimises the capturing of such images by using coarse gaze estimates from a static camera. By considering the potential information gain from observing each target, our system automatically sets the pan, tilt and zoom values (i.e. the field of view) of multiple cameras observing different tracked targets in order to maximise the likelihood of correct identification. The expected gain in information is influenced by the controllable field of view, and by the false positive and negative rates of the identification process, which are in turn a function of the gaze angle. We validate the approach using a combination of simulated situations and real tracking output to demonstrate superior performance over alternative approaches, notably using no gaze information, or using gaze inferred from direction of travel (i.e. assuming each person is always looking directly ahead).We also show results from a live implementation with a static camera and two pan-tilt-zoom devices, involving real-time tracking, processing and control.",

The approach directly provides the feasible controls that each individual robot has to execute in order for the team to maintain the formation based on the controls of a reference agent, either a real leader-robot or a virtual one. In order to directly satisfy the non-holonomic constraints, the geometric reasoning takes place in curvilinear coordinates, defined by the curvature of the reference trajectory, instead of the typical rectilinear coordinates. The generality of the approach lies on the ability to define dynamic formations so as to smoothly switch between static ones, where the robots can change both of their relative coordinates as they move, and the ability to acquire a desired formation given an initial random configuration. Furthermore, it is possible to correct errors in the achieved configuration of the vehicles on the fly. Simulated experiments are presented to verify the correctness of the provided derivations.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of singularities is a central aspect in the design of robotic manipulators. Such analyses are usually based on the use of geometric parameters like DH parameters. However, the manipulator kinematics is naturally described using the concept of screws and twists, associated to Lie groups and algebras. These give rise to general and coordinate-invariant singularity conditions on the manipulator geometry. In this setting no restrictions are imposed onto the type of joints, as it is the case when using DH parameters. In this paper a single closed-form equation is presented that gives a complete description of the singularity locus of an arbitrary regional manipulator in terms of two joint variables and all design parameters, expressed by joint screw coordinates, together with the coordinates for the wrist centre. Some examples are reported, and it is shown that the expression can be used to analyse bifurcations in the singularity locus. The simple form of the condition should make it useful for practical design as well as for a deeper understanding of singularities.",

        "abstract": "Many programming by demonstration methods encode demonstrations into sequences of predefined symbols and then build a generalized task structure such as a topological graph. The longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm is one of the potential techniques to help build generalized task structures from multiple sequences. However the LCS problem is NP hard, so a couple of suboptimal LCS approaches have been adopted in the past, involving a pair-wise comparison of sequences or a search for the common symbols within a small window. This paper argues that an LCS of multiple sequences results in a better generalization than pairwise comparison, and in many practical situations it is feasible to find an LCS of multiple sequences. So a novel LCS finding algorithm is presented for applications in the programming by demonstration domain. The algorithm has been extensively tested for sequences of random symbols and its application in a path planning example is presented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a solution to compute full-dynamic motions for a humanoid robot, accounting for various kinds of constraints such as dynamic balance or joint limits. As a first step, we propose a unification of task-based control schemes, in inverse kinematics or inverse dynamics. Based on this unification, we generalize the cascade of quadratic programs that were developed for inverse kinematics only. Then, we apply the solution to generate, in simulation, whole-body motions for a humanoid robot in unilateral contact with the ground, while ensuring the dynamic balance on a non horizontal surface.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a novel panoramic stereoscopic system consisting of a fisheye lens camera and a hyperbolic mirror with co-axis installation. From the overlapping field of view captured through the fisheye lens and the reflection of the mirror, position of an object point in 3D Euclidean space can be reconstructed once the system geometry is calibrated. To deal with the non-single viewpoint issue in the catadioptric image, a generic radial distortion model is used to describe the imaging process with a series of viewing cones. The parameters of the viewing cones are estimated using a homography based method with observations of an LCD panel at a few unknown positions. Following this, a closed form solution for 3D reconstruction is used with a non-linear optimization to obtain an optimal calibration. A prototype of the proposed design is constructed. Quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the calibration result in terms of 3D reconstruction precision. With the calibration result, we also present potential robotic applications of the proposed system such as 3D environment reconstruction in a 360 degree horizontal field of view.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based topological maps for mobile robot localization traditionally consist of a set of images captured along a path, with a query image then compared to every individual map image. This paper introduces a new approach to topological mapping, whereby the map consists of a set of landmarks that are detected across multiple images, spanning the continuous space between nodal images. Matches are then made to landmarks, rather than to individual images, enabling a topological map of far greater density than traditionally possible, without sacrificing computational speed. Furthermore, by treating each landmark independently, a probabilistic approach to localization can be employed by taking into account the learned discriminative properties of each landmark. An optimization stage is then used to adjust the map according to speed and localization accuracy requirements. Results for global localization show a greater positive location identification rate compared to the traditional topological map, together with enabling a greater localization resolution in the denser topological map, without requiring a decrease in frame rate.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to estimate the camera's pose by directly solving the corresponding least-squares problem algebraically. Specifically, the optimality conditions of the least-squares problem form a system of polynomial equations, which we efficiently solve through the eigendecomposition of a so-called multiplication matrix. Contrary to existing methods, the proposed algorithm (i) is guaranteed to find the globally optimal estimate in the least-squares sense, (ii) does not require initialization, and (iii) has computational cost only linear in the number of measurements. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to previous approaches is demonstrated through extensive simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method that enables a robot to learn not only the existence of affordances provided by objects, but also the behavioral parameters required to actualize them, and the prediction of effects generated on the objects in an unsupervised way. In a previous study, it was shown that through self-interaction and self-observation, analogous to an infant, an anthropomorphic robot can learn object affordances in a completely unsupervised way, and use this knowledge to make plans in its perceptual space. This paper extends the affordances model proposed in that study by using parametric behaviors and including the behavior parameters into affordance learning and goal-oriented plan generation. Furthermore, for handling complex behaviors and complex objects (such as execution of precision grasp on a mug), the perceptual processing is improved by using a combination of local and global features. Finally, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to discover the affordances in non-homogenous feature space. In short, object affordances for object manipulation are discovered together with behavior parameters based on the monitored effects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Previously we modeled the undulatory subsurface locomotion of the sandfish lizard with a sand-swimming robot which displayed performance comparable to the organism. In this work we control the lift forces on the robot by varying its head shape and demonstrate that these granular forces predict the vertical motion of the robot. Inspired by the tapered head of the sandfish lizard, we drag a wedge shaped object horizontally and parallel to its lower face through a granular medium and show that by varying the angle of the upper leading surface of the wedge, \u03b1, the lift force can be varied from positive to negative. Testing the robot with these wedges as heads results in vertical motion in the same direction as the lift force in the drag experiments. As the robot moves forward, the force on its head normal to the body plane results in a net torque imbalance which pitches the robot causing it to rise or sink within the medium. Since repeatedly varying \u03b1 for a wedge head to achieve a desired lift is impractical, we test robot heads that approximate a wedge head inclined at varying angles by changing the angle of the bottom and top surfaces of the wedge, and show that similar lift control is achieved. Our results provide principles for the construction of robots that will be able to follow arbitrary trajectories within complex substrates like sand, and also lend support to hypotheses that morphological adaptations of desert-dwelling organisms aid in their subsurface locomotion.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of distributed cooperative navigation. A new graph-based method is developed for on-demand calculation of the required correlation terms, considering a general multi-robot measurement model. These correlation terms are necessary for the consistent EKF-based data fusion when several statistically-dependent sources of information are used. The measurement model relates between the navigation information transmitted by any number of robots and the actual readings taken by the available onboard sensors. The transmitted information is not necessarily of the current time instant, but may actually belong to some time instant from the past. Experiment results and a theoretical example of the developed method are presented considering a three-view measurement, formulated upon receiving three images of the same scene, captured by different robots at different a priori unknown time instances.",

For this purpose, we introduce the Graspability. It is a measure describing the quality of a pose in Cartesian space for grasping or placing an object. The graspability considers kinematic reachability for a grasping robot and available grasps for the object. It is based on the assumption, that in manipulation tasks, objects tend to be located on a planar surfaces and have to be graspable from that plane, based on that assumption, we develop a discrete map of the environment which enables the use of the graspability in an autonomous planning system for complex manipulation tasks with multiple objects. Generated manipulation actions are evaluated on a real robot.",

The archetypical aerial manipulation task \u2014 grasping objects during flight \u2014 is difficult due to the unstable dynamics of rotorcraft and coupled object-aircraft motion. In this paper, we analyze key challenges encountered when lifting a grasped object and transitioning into laden free-flight. We demonstrate that dynamic load disturbances introduced by the load mass will be rejected by a helicopter with PID flight control. We determine stability bounds in which the changing mass-inertia parameters of the system due to the grasped object will not destabilize this flight controller. The conditions under which transient partial contact mechanics of objects resting on a surface will not induce instability are identified. We demonstrate grasping and retrieval of a variety of objects while hovering, without touching the ground, using the Yale Aerial Manipulator testbed.",

Our approach requires as input only the raw depth data obtained from a single frame of a 3D sensor. Additionally, our approach uses no explicit models of the objects and does not require a training phase. We use the grasping capability to demonstrate the application of a robot as an autonomous checkout clerk. To perform this task, the robot must identify how to grasp an object, locate the barcode on the object and read the numeric code. We evaluate our grasping algorithm in experiments where the robot was required to autonomously grasp unknown objects. The robot achieved a success of 91.6%in grasping novel objects. We performed two sets of experiments to evaluate the checkout robot application. In the first set, the objects were placed in many orientations in front of the robot one at a time. In the second set, the objects were placed several at a time with varying amounts of clutter. The robot was able to autonomously grasp and scan the objects in 49/50 of the single-object trials and 46/50 of the cluttered trials.",

        "abstract": "Rheological object, such as clay, various food products, biological organs and tissues, has both elastic and plastic properties. Modeling of such objects has not been studied intensively comparing with elastic objects. Previous rheological models were mostly based on linear constitutive law of stress and strain, which is limited to small deformation. In this paper, finite element (FE) model of rheological objects based on linear Cauchy strain tensor was summarized at first. Nonlinear FE model formulated with Green strain tensor was then presented for simulating large deformation and deformation with rotation motion. Instead of constant and symmetrical connection matrices in the linear model, nonlinear model yields non-constant and unsymmetrical connection matrices, which vary with displacements of nodal points. Simulation results with both linear and nonlinear FE models were presented to show the differences. We found that the nonlinear model formulated with Green strain tensor demonstrates more natural simulation behaviors.",

        "abstract": "In mobile multi-agent networks, connectivity is a crucial factor for network-wide collaborations. However, such connectivity can be easily sabotaged by a single or multiple simultaneous agent failure(s). To handle this problem, in this paper, a hybrid connectivity restoration framework, namely HERO, is developed. By integrating a distributed connectivity restoration algorithm with a potential function based motion controller, HERO can restore the connectivity of the disconnected networks subjected to a single or multiple simultaneous agent failure(s). In the mean time, inter-agent collisions and further partitions of the underlying networks can also be effectively avoided.",

Many algorithms have been proposed for it, but they almost apply the L2 optimization, which is usually in the form of nonlinear optimization. In this paper, we propose new hand-eye calibration algorithms using convex optimization, and it can be solved in the form of a global linear optimization without starting values. Experiments with both simulated and real data are performed to test our algorithms. The experimental results show the robustness and validity of our algorithms. Considering both the computing errors and the time consuming, our algorithm based on quaternions is a good option for real applications.",

Robotic aid combined with filtering techniques that suppress tremor frequency bands increases performance; however, if knowledge of the operator's goals is available, virtual fixtures have been shown to greatly improve micromanipulator precision. In this paper, we derive a control law for position-based virtual fixtures within the framework of an active handheld micromanipulator, where the fixtures are generated in real-time from microscope video. Additionally, we develop motion scaling behavior centered on virtual fixtures as a simple and direct extension to our formulation. We demonstrate that hard and soft (motion scaled) virtual fixtures outperform state-of-the-art tremor cancellation performance on a set of artificial but medically relevant tasks: holding, move-and-hold, curve tracing, and volume restriction.",

In our approach, a perforated metal, one of the recent popular architectural materials, is utilized as a ceiling plate and the robot hooks and hangs the sequential holes of the ceiling plate by mechanical constraint. To realize the robot, the authors developed three key mechanisms, (1) ceiling hanging mechanism for the perforated metal, (2) horizontal locomotion mechanism like an inchworm, and (3) pantograph mechanism for smoothing horizontal locomotion speed and for load balancing. A unit testing of the ceiling hanging mechanism and the integration horizontal locomotion experiments confirmed the good performance of each mechanisms and the feasibility of mechanically constrained ceiling mobile robot. However, it was revealed that higher power motors and a stiffer body structure should be installed to sustain an extremely large payload like a human.",

Firstly, through elaborate pattern projection strategy and camera-projector synchronization, pattern-illuminated images of the subject and the corresponding scene-texture image are captured under imperceptible patterned illumination. 3D positions of the key facial feature points are then derived by a combined use of (1) the 2D facial feature points in the scene-texture image that are localized by AAM, and (2) the point cloud generated by structured light sensing. Eventually, the head orientation and translation are estimated by SVD of a correlation matrix that is generated from the 3D corresponding feature point pairs over the various image frames. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective, accurate, and fast in 6-DOF head pose estimation, making it suitable for use in real-time applications.",

One is based on linear predictive control, which uses a mathematical model to predict the system behavior.

The interface has a male and a female face and allows docking in 90-degree steps. The developed concept guarantees a secure connecting and disconnecting in rough environments with fine dust as existing on celestial bodies such as Mars and Moon. A short introduction into the project RIMRES is given with focus on the modularity of the system. After providing the design considerations for the interface, experimental results with the hardware are presented. The experiments show that the interface is capable of operating mechanically with heavy loads of up to 40 kg. The proposed latch mechanism tolerates layers of dust of up to 2 mm. Thus, an electrical as well as mechanical connection in dusty environments is realized.",

        "abstract": "Understanding and analysing video data from static or mobile surveillance cameras often requires knowledge of the scene and the camera placement. In this article, we provide a way to simplify the user's task of understanding the scene by rendering the camera view as if observed from the user's perspective by estimating his position using a real-time visual SLAM system. Augmenting the view is referred to as hidden view synthesis. Compared to previous work, the current approach improves by simplifying the setup and requiring minimal user input. This is achieved by building a map of the environment using a visual SLAM system and then registering the surveillance camera in this map. By exploiting the map, a different moving camera can render hidden views in real-time at 30Hz. We discuss some of the challenges remaining for full automation. Results are shown in an indoor environment for surveillance applications and outdoors with application to improved safety in transport.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a precision positioning technique that can be applied to vehicles or mobile robots in urban or leafy environments. Currently, the availability of satellite positioning is anticipated to improve because of the presence of various positioning satellites such as GPS of the U.S., GLONASS of Russia and GALILEO of Europe. However, because of the serious impact of multipath on their positioning accuracy in urban or leafy areas, such improvements in the availability of satellite positioning do not necessarily also facilitate high precision positioning. Our proposed technique mitigates GPS and GLONASS multipath by means of an omnidirectional infrared (IR) camera that can eliminate the need for invisible satellites by using IR images. With an IR camera, the sky appears distinctively dark. This facilitates the detection of the borderline between the sky and the surrounding buildings, which are captured in white, because of the difference in the atmospheric transmittance rates between visible light and IR rays. The proposed technique can automatically and robustly mitigate GPS and GLONASS multipath by excluding the invisible satellites. Positioning evaluation was carried out only with visible satellites that have less multipath errors and without using invisible satellites. The evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the feasibility of its highly accurate positioning.",

Generally, in a pan/tilt camera, the gaze is controlled mechanically by rotational actuators. However, because pan/tilt cameras will be expected to use high-speed image processing (\u2265 1000 fps), sufficiently high-speed performance of the gaze controller, comparable to the high frame rate, cannot be obtained with the usual method. In our system, the camera itself was fixed, and an external Saccade Mirror subsystem was used for optical gaze control. An arbitrary gaze direction within \u00b130 deg could be achieved in less than 3.5 ms.",

        "abstract": "This paper is focused on the design of a control strategy for the path tracking of off-road mobile robots acting at high speed. In order to achieve high accuracy in such a context, uncertain and fast dynamics have to be explicitly taken into account. Since these phenomena (grip conditions, delays due to inertial and low-level control properties) are hardly measurable directly, the proposed approach relies on predictive and observer-based adaptive control techniques. In particular, the adaptive part is based on an observer loop, taking advantage of both kinematic and dynamic vehicle models. This multi-model based adaptive approach permits to adapt on-line the grip conditions (represented by cornering stiffnesses), enabling highly reactive sideslip angles observation and then accurate path tracking. The relevance of this approach is investigated through full scale experiments.",

We assume that a laser range finder senses points sampled from a regular surface and we utilize an improved likelihood function that accounts for two phenomena affecting the laser measurements that are often neglected: the conic shape of the laser beam and the incidence angle. To solve the entire problem we apply an optimization procedure that jointly adjusts the position of all the robot poses and all points in the scans. As a result, we obtain highly accurate maps. We evaluated our approach using simulated and real-world data and we show that utilizing the estimated maps greatly improves the localization accuracy of robots. The results furthermore suggest that the accuracy of the resulting map can exceed the resolution of the laser sensors used.",

This was achieved by using the high-frequency vibration component generated in the process of slipping of the gripped object in order to distinguish between slipping of the object and changes in the normal force. In this paper, we design a slip detection sensor for a multi-fingered robot hand and examine the influence of noise caused by the operation of such a hand. Finally, we describe an experiment focusing on the adjustment of the gripping force of a multi-fingered robot hand equipped with the developed sensors",

Underlying our approach is the principle that an autonomous system must be motivated to act to gather new knowledge, and to validate and correct existing knowledge. This principle is embodied in Dora, a mobile robot which features the aforementioned techniques: shared representations, non-monotonic reasoning, and goal generation and management. To demonstrate how well this collection of techniques work in real-world situations we present a comprehensive analysis of the Dora system's performance over multiple tours in an in door environment. In this analysis Dora successfully completed 18 of 21 attempted runs, with all but 3 of these successes requiring one or more of the integrated techniques to recover from problems.",

In our framework, the perception system consists of a calibrated flying camera looking downward to the mobile robots. The robots are assumed to undergo planar motion considering nonholonomic constraints. The goal of the task is to control the multi-robot system to a desired configuration relying solely on visual information given by the flying camera. The desired multi-robot configuration is defined with an image of the set of robots in that configuration. Then, any arbitrary configuration can be easily defined by this image without any additional information. As contribution, a new image-based control scheme is presented relying on the homography induced by the multi-robot system to lead the robots to the desired configuration. The stability of the control law is analyzed and simulations are provided to illustrate the proposal.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When the UAV goes to high altitudes such that the observed surface of the earth becomes planar, the structure and motion recovery of the earth's moving plane becomes ambiguous. This planar degeneracy has been pointed out very often in the literature; therefore, current navigation methods either completely fail or give many confusing solutions in such scenario. Interestingly, the horizon line in planar scenes is straight and distinctive; hence, easily detected. Therefore, we show in this paper that the horizon line provides two degrees of freedom that control the relative orientation between the camera coordinate system and the local surface of earth. The recovered degrees of freedom help linearize and disambiguate the planar flow, and therefore we obtain a unique solution for the UAV motion estimation. Unlike previous work which used the horizon to provide the roll angle and the pitch percentage and only employed them for flight stability, we extract the exact angles and directly use them to estimate the ego motion. Additionally, we propose a novel horizon detector based on the maximum a posteriori estimation of both motion and appearance features which outperforms the other detectors in planar scenarios. We thoroughly experimented on the proposed method against information from GPS and gyroscopes, and obtained promising results.",

        "abstract": "While the arctic possesses significant information of scientific value, surprisingly little work has focused on developing robotic systems to collect this data. For arctic robotic data collection to be a viable solution, a method for navigating in the arctic, and thus of assessing glacial terrain, must be developed. Segmenting the ground plane from the rest of the image is one common aspect of a visual hazard detection system. However, the properties of glacial images, namely low contrast, overcast sky, and cloud, mountain, and snow sharing common colors, pose difficulties for most visual algorithms. A horizon line detection scheme is presented which uses multiple visual cues to rank candidate horizon segments, then constructs a horizon line consistent with those cues. Weak cues serve to reinforce a selected path, while strong cues have the ability to redirect it. Further, the system infers the horizon location in areas that are visually ambiguous. The performance of the proposed system has been tested on multiple data sets collected on two different glaciers in Alaska, and compares favorably, both in terms of time and classification performance, to representative segmentation algorithms from several different classes.",

The chromatic art gallery problem, introduced in [7], asks for the minimum number of colors required to color any guard set (not necessarily a minimal guard set) of P. We study two related problems. First, given a polygon P and a guard set S of P, can the members of S be efficiently and optimally colored so that no two members of S that have overlapping visibility regions have the same color? Second, given a polygon P and a set of candidate guard locations N, is it possible to efficiently and optimally choose the guard set S \u2286 N that requires the minimum number of colors? We provide an algorithm that solves the first question in polynomial time, and demonstrate the NP-hardness of the second question. Both questions are motivated by common robot tasks such as mapping and surveillance.",

Different kinds of trajectories are automatically discovered, and each of them is described by its semantic context. In a first step, the system clusters trajectories in observations of human everyday activities based on their shapes, and then learns the relation between these trajectories and the contexts in which they are used. The resulting models can be used for robots to select a trajectory to use in a given context. They can also serve as powerful prediction models for human motions to improve human-robot interaction. Experiments on the TUM kitchen data set show that the method is capable of discovering meaningful clusters in real-world observations of everyday activities like setting a table.",

        "abstract": "Modeling and predicting human behavior is indispensable when industrial robots interacting with human operators are to be manipulated safely and efficiently. One challenge is that human operators tend to follow different motion patterns, depending on their intention and the structure of the environment. This precludes the use of classical estimation techniques based on kinematic or dynamic models, especially for the purpose of long-term prediction. In this paper, we propose a method based on Hidden Markov Models to predict the region of the workspace that is possibly occupied by the human within a prediction horizon. In contrast to predictions in the form of single points such as most likely human positions as obtained from previous approaches, the regions obtained here may serve as safety constraints when the robot motion is planned or optimized. This way one avoids collisions with a probability not less than a predefined threshold. The practicability of our method is demonstrated by successfully and accurately predicting the motion of a human arm in two scenarios involving multiple motion patterns.",

        "abstract": "In the future of surgery, tele-operated robotic assistants will offer the possibility of performing certain commonly occurring tasks autonomously. Using a natural division of tasks into subtasks, we propose a novel surgical Human-Machine Collaborative (HMC) system in which portions of a surgical task are performed autonomously under complete surgeon's control, and other portions manually. Our system automatically identifies the completion of a manual subtask, seamlessly executes the next automated task, and then returns control back to the surgeon. Our approach is based on learning from demonstration. It uses Hidden Markov Models for the recognition of task completion and temporal curve averaging for learning the executed motions. We demonstrate our approach using a da Vinci tele-surgical robot. We show on two illustrative tasks where such human-machine collaboration is intuitive that automated control improves the usage of the master manipulator workspace. Because such a system does not limit the traditional use of the robot, but merely enhances its capabilities while leaving full control to the surgeon, it provides a safe and acceptable solution for surgical performance enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots possess the capability of stepping over or onto objects, which distinguishes them from wheeled robots. When planning paths for humanoids, one therefore should consider an intelligent placement of footsteps instead of choosing detours around obstacles. In this paper, we present an approach to optimal footstep planning for humanoid robots. Since changes in the environment may appear and a humanoid may deviate from its originally planned path due to imprecise motion execution or slippage on the ground, the robot might be forced to dynamically revise its plans. Thus, efficient methods for planning and replanning are needed to quickly adapt the footstep paths to new situations. We formulate the problem of footstep planning so that it can be solved with the incremental heuristic search method D* Lite and present our extensions, including continuous footstep locations and efficient collision checking for footsteps. In experiments in simulation and with a real Nao humanoid, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the footstep plans computed and revised by our method. Additionally, we evaluate different footstep sets and heuristics to identify the ones leading to the best performance in terms of path quality and planning time. Our D* Lite algorithm for footstep planning is available as open source implementation.",

In the proposed methodology, a Kalman filter is used for the data fusion between the model and the measurement. The tuning and implementation of the filter are discussed in the specific context of the camera measurement.

The system is consisted of hybrid map building, localization, path planning and trajectory following. The hybrid map includes a series of small probabilistic grid maps (PGM) and a global topological map (GTM). They are built simultaneously and easily using the human-guided method. Then on the hybrid map, the localization and the real-time path planning algorithms are realized smartly and effectively. The experiments and applications results show that the human-guided method integrates both the computer's modeling ability and the human's sensory perception to the environment. The hybrid map is easy to solve the loop-closure and doorway problems that enhances the robustness against uncertainty of sensors. It also can improve the efficiency in large-scale SLAM. Further more, at an elderly home we did the activities of daily living (ADL) testing and at Shanghai Expo 2010 we demonstrated the wheelchair system by offering trial rides to visitors.",

        "abstract": "The modeling and vibration analysis of a flexible manipulator considering a nonlinearity and effect from the gravity imply a singular problem. In order to avoid the singularity, the dynamic equation is decomposed into two subsystems, including flexible dynamic subsystem and rigid dynamic subsystem. A combined feed-forward and feedback control scheme is presented to design the controller of the flexible manipulator. In the combined control, an optimization is applied to obtain the desired trajectory based on the flexible dynamic subsystem. As we know, the optimization is dependent on the accuracy of model but there are inevitably errors of model and external disturbances. The feedback control is expected with high robustness and fast convergence to overcome the problem. In order to improve the performance of control, a hybrid sliding mode control (HySMC) is proposed to track the desired trajectory and further suppress the residual vibration. This paper presents the theoretical derivation and experimental verification of the proposed controller.",

The model, called spatial affordance map, is a non-homogeneous spatial Poisson process that relates space, time and occurrence probability of activity events. We describe how learning and inference is made and present a novel planning algorithm that produces paths which maximize the probability to encounter a person. We show that the problem is a special class of the orienteering problem that can be solved as a finite horizon Markov decision process. We develop a simulator of populated office environments to validate the model and the planning algorithm. The simulated agents follow activity patterns learned by administering a questionnaire to 27 colleagues over two weeks. The experiments shows that the model is statistically valid with respect to both the Anderson-Darling test and the expected waiting time estimation. They further show that the proposed algorithm is able to find optimal paths.",

At close range, accurate pose tracking from image features is hard because feature projections do not only drift in the face of rotation but also in the face of translation. Large, unknown feature drifts may impede real-time feature tracking and subsequent pose estimation\u2014especially with concurrent operation of other 3-D sensors on the same computer. The problem is solved in Ref. [1] by the partial integration of readings from a backing inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work we avoid using an IMU by improved feature matching: full utilization of the current state estimation (including structure) during feature matching enables decisive modifications of the matching parameters for more efficient tracking\u2014we hereby follow the Active Matching paradigm.",

Specially, the initial velocity is created by an instant impulse given to the ball. The external impulse exerted on a ball by a kicking robot is a function of the robot's geometry and dynamic parameters. Here, the coefficient of restitution (COR) is an important parameter to calculate the impulse applied to the ball when the collision is occurred. Usually, COR has been assumed a constant value. We derive an analytical model of COR for the pendulum model colliding with a soccer ball, and show that COR varies according to the velocity. The drag force is taken into account in the COR model. The velocity-dependent characteristic of COR is applied to simulation of a soccer ball traveling a long distance. It is shown that the velocity-dependent COR considerably affects the traveling distance of the flying ball.",

The algorithm combines concepts from two existing approaches to pose tracking, Bayesian estimation methods and measurement inversion techniques, to achieve in real-time a feasible, smooth estimate of the relative pose between a robotic platform and a tumbling target. It is assumed that no a priori information about the target is available, and that only a monocular camera is available for measuring the relative motion of the target with respect to the robotic platform. The rationale for a hybrid approach is explained, and an algorithm is presented. A specific implementation using a modified Rao-Blackwellised particle filter is described and tested. Results from both numerical simulations and field experiments are included which demonstrate the performance and viability of the hybrid approach. The hybrid approach to pose estimation described here is applicable regardless of the method by which the map/reconstruction is estimated.",

        "abstract": "To assist human motion in the fields of rehabilitation and sports training, we propose a passive motion support system consisting of wires with servo brakes and a control method to guide the human hand. However, passive systems sometimes cannot generate enough force to guide the human hand along the desired path because the servo brakes cannot generate a driving force and the system does not have enough brake units to generate the desired force. In this paper, we theoretically consider the feasible braking force region of a passive system with multiple brake units and discuss the number of brake units required to generate the desired force appropriately. We also develop a system based on our analysis of the feasible braking force and conduct path-following experiments. The experimental results illustrate the validity of a passive motion support system consisting of wires with servo brakes.",

        "abstract": "Our research is related to the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot which reproduced the human organs involved during the saxophone playing. This research approach aims in understanding the human motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication between humans and robots in musical terms. In a previous research, we have presented the Waseda Saxophonist Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which improved the design of the lip and finger mechanisms. In addition, a feed-forward air pressure with dead-time compensation and an overblowing correction controller were implemented. However, the range of pressure was too limited to reproduce dynamic effects of the sound (i.e. decrescendo, etc.), a delay on the response of the finger mechanism was detected (due to the use of a wire-driven mechanism) and deviations on the pitch during the saxophone playing were observed. Therefore; in this paper, we present the Waseda Saxophonist Robot No. 2 Refined (WAS-2R). In particular the shape of the oral cavity has been re-designed to increase the sound pressure range and potentiometers were embedded on the fingers to reduce the dynamic delay response of the wire-driven mechanism. In addition, a Pressure-Pitch Controller has been implemented to reduce the deviation of the sound pitch by implementing a feedback error learning algorithm for a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system. A set of experiments were proposed to verify the effectiveness of the re-designed mechanisms and the improved control strategy. From the experimental results, we could confirm the improvements to extend the sound pressure range to reproduce the decrescendo effect, to reduce the response delay from the finger mechanism as well as the deviations on the sound pitch.",

Palpation-based needle insertion had a smaller error, suggesting that this procedure is a safe, effective alternative to traditional methods of breast needle insertion.",

Endurance is defined as the ability of the robot to exert itself for a long period of time. The immune-inspired framework provides such capability by monitoring the behavior of the robot to ensure continuous and safe behavior. The immune-inspired framework combines innate and adaptive immune inspired algorithms. Innate uses a dendritic cell based innate immune algorithm, and adaptive uses an instance based B-cell approach. Results presented in this paper shows that when the robot is implemented with the immune-inspired framework, health and survivability of a robot is improved, therefore increasing its endurance.",

However, because of sensor range limitations, the GVG control law will fail when the robot moves into a large open area. This paper discusses an extended GVG approach to topological navigation and mapping: the saturated generalized Voronoi graph (S-GVG), for which the robot employs an additional wall-following behavior to navigate along obstacles at the range limit of the sensor. In this paper, we build upon previous work related to the S-GVG and provide two important contributions: 1) a rigorous discussion of the control laws and algorithm modifications that are necessary for incremental construction of the S-GVG with a mobile robot, and 2) a method for incorporating the S-GVG into a novel multi-hypothesis SLAM algorithm for loop-closing and localization. Experiments with a wheeled mobile robot in an office-like environment validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Machine learning techniques are less sensitive to these problems and therefore an interesting alternative for modeling robot dynamics. We propose a learning method that combines a least squares algorithm with a non-linear feature mapping and an efficient update rule. Using data from five different robots, we show that the method can accurately model manipulator dynamics, either when trained in batch or incrementally. Furthermore, the update time and memory usage of the method are bounded, therefore allowing use in real-time control loops.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping by combining visual loop-closure detection with metrical information given by the robot odometry. The proposed algorithm builds in real-time topo-metric maps of an unknown environment, with a monocular or omnidirectional camera and odometry gathered by motors encoders. A dedicated improved version of our previous work on purely appearance-based loop-closure detection [1] is used to extract potential loop-closure locations. Potential locations are then verified and classified using a new validation stage. The main contributions we bring are the generalization of the validation method for the use of monocular and omnidirectional camera with the removal of the camera calibration stage, the inclusion of an odometry-based evolution model in the Bayesian filter which improves accuracy and responsiveness, and the addition of a consistent metric position estimation. This new SLAM method does not require any calibration or learning stage (i.e. no a priori information about environment). It is therefore fully incremental and generates maps usable for global localization and planned navigation. This algorithm is moreover well suited for remote processing and can be used on toy robots with very small computational power.",

Our system uses a static posture data, a palmar side photo and marker positions captured simultaneously by MoCap, to reduce extra time and effort demanded for each subject to build a model. From this modeling scan, several hand dimensions and marker positions are obtained. Joint centers are estimated based on regression analysis about joint centers, marker positions and some hand dimensions derived from magnetic resonance (MR) images of eight subjects. The skin surface is built by scaling a generic hand model so that it satisfies the measured dimensions. The proposed system will be validated through an experiment to build four subjects' hand models.",

        "abstract": "User localization is one of the key technologies for mobile robots to successfully interact with humans. Among various localization methods using radio frequency (RF) signals, time of arrival (TOA) based localization is popular since the target coordinates can be directly calculated from the accurate range measurements. In complex indoor environment, however, RF ranging-based localization is quite challenging since the range measurements suffer not only from signal noise but also from signal blockages and reflections. A set of range measurements taken in complex indoor environment verifies that almost all measurements are non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ranges which have striking difference to the line-of-sight (LOS) distances. These NLOS range measurements make severe degradation in the accuracy of trilateration based localizations if used without any compensation. In this paper we propose a particle filter-based localization algorithm which utilizes indoor geometry from a given map to estimate the NLOS signal path and compensates for the range measurements. The algorithm is verified with experiments performed in real indoor environments.",

In this study, we propose an indoor monitoring system based on wireless and pyroelectric infrared (WPIR) sensory fusion system. Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) system alone for localization provides less accurate information of human location and suffers from multiple targets localization. Furthermore, radio frequency (RF) localization system alone is also constrained by its limited accuracy. We develop a sensor network based localization method called WPIR inference algorithm. This algorithm determine the fused position from both PIR localization system and radio frequency signal localization system which utilizes received signal strength (RSS) model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a WPIR sensory fusion system which can be applied in localizing targets, such as human and robot. With the proper localization mechanism in the indoor environment, the provision of appropriate services for people can be realized with less expensive cost.",

However, different sources of uncertainty may be present like, for instance, the friction model used in grasp planning, indetermination of the friction coefficients, and errors in the model of the object that affect the positions of the boundary points as well as the direction normal to the object surface. These sources have not been previously considered in the computation of the Independent Contact Regions. This paper discusses how to take into account these factors when computing the Independent Contact Regions for discretized objects, i.e. objects described with a cloud or a mesh of points.

        "abstract": "A new synchronization-based control is proposed for a robotic suit which is designed for walking assistance. Neural oscillators are connected to each joint of the robotic suit to synchronize suit's movement with human user's movement (outer-synchronization). At the same time, mutual inhibition is incorporated between neural oscillators at each left and right joint of the suit to help to maintain a human-gait-like anti-phase relationship (inner-inhibition). We have developed a 2-DOF robotic suit, which consists of two actuators fixed to the places where the human hip joints are. Each actuator has a built-in torque sensor, which helps to measure the mutual joint torque generated by once there is any difference between the movement of a user and that of the suit. The mutual joint torque is used as input to neural oscillators, which control each actuator of the robotic suit through outer-synchronization with the mutual joint torque and inner-inhibition. The inhibitory weight, used to adjust the inhibitory strength between neural oscillators, is designed properly using series of simulations. We have conducted walking experiments to show the validity of our proposal for walking assistance of the robotic suit with mutual inhibition between neural oscillators.",

The system is based on the principle of performing a lightning sweeping with static imagining system, which causes shadows surrounding defects when merging consecutive images, coined as defect augmentation phenomena. As a result, we can detect millimetric defects of 0.3mm diameter or greater with different shapes which were very hard to detect with existing technology without that phenomena. The project has generated two PTC patents, the first one protects the defect augmentation phenomena, while the second protects the industrial system itself. The main innovation of this industrial project is the development of a system that improves in almost 100% the human inspection. As a consequences, it reduces the number of invalid vehicles, energy consumption, saving painting which also implies a significant cost reduction. It also improves working conditions for workers by reducing ocular fatigues.",

We show how the uncertainty in grasp execution posterior to grasp planning can be dealt with using tactile sensing and machine learning techniques. The majority of the state-of-the art grasp planners demonstrate impressive results in simulation. However, these results are mostly based on perfect scene/object knowledge allowing for analytical measures to be employed. It is questionable how well these measures can be used in realistic scenarios where the information about the object and robot hand may be incomplete and/or uncertain. Thus, tactile and force-torque sensory information is necessary for successful online grasp stability assessment. We show how a grasp planner can be integrated with a probabilistic technique for grasp stability assessment in order to improve the hypotheses about suitable grasps on different types of objects. Experimental evaluation with a three-fingered robot hand equipped with tactile array sensors shows the feasibility and strength of the integrated approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new image-based approach to the control of a robotic system equipped with an ultrasound imaging device. For diagnostic applications, the proposed method makes it possible to position an ultrasound probe on a desired organ section and to track it by compensating for rigid motions of the organ. Both in-plane and out-of-plane motions of the probe are controlled by the proposed method. The main contribution of this work is the direct use of the ultrasound image as visual feature which spares any segmentation or image processing time consuming step. Simulation and robotic experiments are performed on a realistic abdominal phantom and validate this ultrasound intensity-based visual servoing approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new framework of online hybrid control for virtual characters, which combines multi-objective control and motion capture techniques. At each time step, the motions of the operator are captured and sent to the character. These captured motions help the character understand what task the operator wants it to perform. Then, the character decides by itself how to execute proper actions while maintaining its balance, in a virtual environment which is different from the real world. Given a manipulation task, the desired virtual task wrench is computed thanks to a force control approach. The control system takes these task wrenches into consideration and solves a constrained quadratic problem for joint torques, which are then used to drive the virtual character. The whole control problem is solved online so that the virtual character can interact in real-time with the virtual environment as well as the operator. Examples using this control framework are presented as results from simulation.",

        "abstract": "Many perception problems in robotics such as object recognition, scene understanding, and mapping are tackled using scale-invariant interest points extracted from intensity images. Since interest points describe only local portions of objects and scenes, they offer robustness to clutter, occlusions, and intra-class variation. In this paper, we present an efficient approximate algorithm to extract surface normal interest points (SNIPs) in corners and blob-like surface regions from depth images. The interest points are detected on characteristic scales that indicate their spatial extent. Our method is able to cope with irregularly sampled, noisy measurements which are typical to depth imaging devices. It also offers a trade-off between computational speed and accuracy which allows our approach to be applicable in a wide range of problem sets. We evaluate our approach on depth images of basic geometric shapes, more complex objects, and indoor scenes.",

This paper discusses the transition issue among multiple tasks on how the transition can be effectively and smoothly achieved. The proposed approach is to compose intermediate desired values to smooth the transitions rather than to modify control laws.

Due to their continuously changing product lines, reprogramming costs exceed installation costs by a large margin. In addition, traditional programming methods for industrial robots is too complex for an inexperienced robot programmer, thus external assistance is often needed. In this paper a new incremental multimodal language, which uses augmented reality (AR) environment, is presented. The proposed language architecture makes it possible to manipulate, pick or place the objects in the scene. This approach shifts the focus of industrial robot programming from coordinate based programming paradigm, to object based programming scheme. This makes it possible for non-experts to program the robot in an intuitive way, without going through rigorous training in robot programming.",

However legged robots such as humanoids are inherently different as they are underactuated and subject to switching external contact constraints. Recently several methods have been proposed to create inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers for these robots. In an attempt to compare these different approaches, we develop a general framework for inverse dynamics control and show that these methods lead to very similar controllers. We are then able to greatly simplify recent whole-body controllers based on operational space approaches using kinematic projections, bringing them closer to efficient practical implementations. We also generalize these controllers such that they can be optimal under an arbitrary quadratic cost in the commands.",

        "abstract": "Inverse dynamics controllers deal with nonlinear terms in the robot dynamics in a way that, in the ideal case, the closed-loop system becomes linear and decoupled. Consequently, the performance of the closed-loop systems will be easy to study. Due to such an advantage, inverse dynamics-based adaptive control has been applied to motion control of an uncertain robot in free motion in the literature. However, so far there has been no attempt at simultaneous motion and force control in a master-slave haptic teleoperation system using an adaptive inverse dynamics approach. In this paper, for multi-degree-of-freedom teleoperation systems with nonlinear and uncertain dynamics, adaptive inverse dynamics controllers are incorporated into Lawrence's 4-channel bilateral teleoperation control framework. The resulting high-fidelity control system does not need exact knowledge of the dynamics of the master or the slave. A Lyapunov function is presented to analyze the transparency of the teleoperation system. A simulation study is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.",

Firstly, the existence of a unique solution to the Lagrange equation of motion of the robot, whose end-point motion is coincident with a given desired end-point trajectory described in Cartesian coordinate system, is shown theoretically. Second, the iterative learning control signal that enables the robot end-point to trace a desired trajectory specified on an arbitrary smooth surface with fulfilling a desired contact force is designed. Next, a numerical simulation for the iterative learning scheme is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, and its result is compared to a theoretically derived desired joint angle trajectory. This comparison shows that there exists a unique solution of the desired joint angle trajectory when an initial pose of the manipulator and a desired end-point trajectory on the constraint surface are given, even under the existence of holonomic constraint and joint redundancy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new control scheme of JAIST Active Robotic Walker (JARoW) developed to provide elderly people with sufficient ambulatory capability. Toward its practical use, our focus is placed on how to allow easier and reliable maneuverability by creating a natural user interface. Specifically, our challenge lies in providing a well-functioning controller by detecting what the user wants to do or their intentions. A Kalman filter based tracking scheme is realized to estimate and predict the locations of the user's legs and body in real time. The feedback control can then adjust the motions of JARoW corresponding to the actual user's walking behaviors. Our experiments confirm that JARoW can autonomously adjust its motion direction and velocity without requiring any additional control inputs.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Electric motors clearly constitute the most common drive principle in robotics and mechatronics. Smart materials, however, offer considerably higher power-to-mass ratios than electric motors. If mechanical energy instead of electrical energy can be distributed through a system, highly dynamic and efficient torque transmission elements based on smart materials, e.g. piezoceramics, can be used to transmit torque from an input to an output element. Just like electric motors, they can thus provide position, velocity, and force-torque control of the output element. This paper introduces machine components, called adaptronic couplers, which can transmit variable torques highly dynamically from an input element to an output element employing static and/or dynamic friction. In the long run, systems (e.g. robots) based on these machine components are envisaged to compete with systems based on classic drive principles - especially electric motors - w.r.t. dynamics and power-to-mass-ratio. Apart from the concept itself, this paper addresses different control approaches and discusses their influence on energy consumption and wear. Moreover, various experimental results proving the basic concept are presented.",

Next generation manipulators are expected to resemble a human-like behaviour at kinematic level, in order to avoid any unease or discomfort (like fear or shock) to the nearby humans. In this work, a kinematic experimental approach to study and synthesize the motion of the human arm is presented. In particular, the proposed scenario will be used to study how humans exploit the kinematic redundancy of their arms, for a future use in a robotic controller. A simple, yet accurate, method for human-like redundancy resolution in robotic manipulators is developed and verified.",

This mechanism enhances the range of feasible grasps of the underactuated hand without significantly increasing its complexity. Two architectures are investigated: one is purely planar while the other uses a spherical mechanism in conjunction with a planar linkage. The analysis of the planar mechanism between the index finger and the third finger is first assessed, in which the parameters are determined in order to satisfy the constraints on the motion ranges while minimizing the coordination error. Then, the study of the mechanism joining the third finger and the little finger is summarized, followed by the analysis of the spherical mechanism. Finally, prototypes of the fingers' abduction systems using the two proposed architectures are presented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we incorporate a randomized kinodynamic path planning approach with image-based control for a robotic arm equipped with an in-hand camera in a servoing task. The proposed approach yields C2-smooth camera trajectories by taking camera dynamics into account while accounting for a critical set of image and physical constraints. The proposed planner explores the camera state space (i.e., a space of camera poses and velocities) for permissible trajectories by iteratively extending a search tree in this space and simultaneously tracking these trajectories in the robot configuration space (i.e., joint space). The planned camera trajectories are then projected into the image space to obtain desired feature trajectories. In the execution stage an image-based visual servoing scheme is then adopted to track the feature trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been experimentally demonstrated on a robotic arm with an in-hand camera executing servoing tasks in complex environments.",

        "abstract": "FastSLAM is one of the state-of-the-art approaches to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. In this paper, a new SLAM method is proposed, called L-SLAM, which is a low dimension version of the FastSLAM family algorithms. Dimensionality reduction of the particle filter is proposed, achieving better accuracy with less or the same number of particles. Dimensionality reduction of this problem renders the algorithm suitable for high dimensionality problems, like 3-D SLAM where the L-SLAM can produce better results in less time. Unlike the FastSLAM algorithms that uses Extended Kalman Filters (EKF), the L-SLAM algorithm updates the particles using Kalman filters. A methodology of linearizing a planar SLAM problem of a rear drive car-like robot is presented. Experimental results based on real case scenarios using the Car Park datasets and simulated environment are presented . The advantages of the proposed method in comparison with the FastSLAM 1.0 and 2.0 methods in the planar SLAM problem are discussed.",

For the first time, we bring together the so-called Partitioned Particle filter, an improvement of the traditional Particle filter, and the linear-parabolic lane model which alleviates many shortcomings of traditional lane models. The former improves the traditional Particle filter by subdividing the whole state space of particles into several subspaces and estimating those subspaces in a hierarchical structure, such that the number of particles for each subspace is flexible and the robustness of the whole system is increased. Furthermore, we introduce a new statistical observation model, an important part of the Particle filter, where we use multi-kernel density to model the probability distribution of lane parameters. Our observation model considers not only color and position information as image cues, but also the image gradient. Our experimental results illustrate the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm even when confronted with challenging scenes.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based planners have been shown to be effective in searching unexplored parts of a system's state space. Their desirable properties, however, depend on the availability of an appropriate metric, which is often difficult to be defined for some robots, such as non-holonomic and under-actuated ones. This paper investigates a methodology to approximate optimum cost-to-go metrics by employing an offline learning phase in an obstacle-free workspace. The proposed method densely samples a graph that approximates the connectivity properties of the state space. This graph can be used online to compute approximate distances between states using nearest neighbor queries and standard graph search algorithms, such as A*. Unfortunately, this process significantly increases the online cost of a sampling-based planner. This work then investigates ways for the computationally efficient utilization of the learned metric during the planner's online operation. One idea is to map the sampled states into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space through multi-dimensional scaling that retains the relative distances represented by the sampled graph. Simulations on a first-order car and on an illustrative example of an asymmetric state space indicate that the approach has merit and can lead into more effective planning.",

Our method consists of low level controllers that perform simple, biomechanically motivated push recovery actions and a high level controller that combines the low level controllers according to proprioceptive and inertial sensory signals and the current robot state. Reinforcement learning is used to optimize the parameters of the controllers in order to maximize the stability of the robot over a broad range of external disturbances. The controllers are learned on a physical simulation and implemented on the Darwin-HP humanoid robot platform, and the resulting experiments demonstrate effective full body push recovery behaviors during dynamic walking.",

This paper presents a methodology to allow a robot to navigate in a complex environment by observing pedestrian positional traces. A continuous probabilistic function is determined using Gaussian process learning and used to infer the direction a robot should take in different parts of the environment. The approach learns and filters noise in the data producing a smooth underlying function that yields more natural movements. Our method combines prior conventional planning strategies with most probable trajectories followed by people in a principled statistical manner, and adapts itself online as more observations become available. The use of learning methods are automatic and require minimal tuning as compared to potential fields or spline function regression. This approach is demonstrated testing in cluttered office and open forum environments using laser and vision sensing modalities. It yields paths that are similar to the expected human behaviour without any a priori knowledge of the environment or explicit programming.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach that enables robots to learn motion primitives that are robust towards state estimation uncertainties. During reaching and preshaping, the robot learns to use line manipulation strategies to maneuver the object into a pose at which closing the hand to perform the grasp is more likely to succeed. In contrast, common assumptions in grasp planning and motion planning for reaching are that these tasks can be performed independently, and that the robot has perfect knowledge of the pose of the objects in the environment. We implement our approach using Dynamic Movement Primitives and the probabilistic model-free reinforcement learning algorithm Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2 ). The cost function that PI2 optimizes is a simple boolean that penalizes failed grasps. The key to acquiring robust motion primitives is to sample the actual pose of the object from a distribution that represents the state estimation uncertainty. During learning, the robot will thus optimize the chance of grasping an object from this distribution, rather than at one specific pose. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate how the motion primitives become more robust when grasping simple cylindrical objects, as well as more complex, non-convex objects. We also investigate how well the learned motion primitives generalize towards new object positions and other state estimation uncertainty distributions.",

        "abstract": "An important problem in robotic manipulation is the ability to predict how objects behave under manipulative actions. This ability is necessary to allow planning of object manipulations. Physics simulators can be used to do this, but they model many kinds of object interaction poorly. An alternative is to learn a motion model for objects by interacting with them. In this paper we address the problem of learning to predict the interactions of rigid bodies in a probabilistic framework, and demonstrate the results in the domain of robotic push manipulation. A robot arm applies random pushes to various objects and observes the resulting motion with a vision system. The relationship between push actions and object motions is learned, and enables the robot to predict the motions that will result from new pushes. The learning does not make explicit use of physics knowledge, or any pre-coded physical constraints, nor is it even restricted to domains which obey any particular rules of physics. We use regression to learn efficiently how to predict the gross motion of a particular object. We further show how different density functions can encode different kinds of information about the behaviour of interacting objects. By combining these as a product of densities, we show how learned predictors can cope with a degree of generalisation to previously unencountered object shapes, subjected to previously unencountered push directions. Performance is evaluated through a combination of virtual experiments in a physics simulator, and real experiments with a 5-axis arm equipped with a simple, rigid finger.",

UKF is widely applied to nonlinear systems. However, the disadvantage of traditional UKF is the high computational cost caused by the unscented transformation step. The computational cost is proportional to the number of the constructed sigma-points. Therefore a reduced simplex sigma-point selection is proposed to be practically applied for the sensor fusion on the unmanned helicopter. The simulation and experimental results verify the computational load reduction.",

The network lifetime problem is formulated as a nonlinear non-convex optimization problem, which is solved distributively by a series of convex approximations and a novel saddle-point computation algorithm. The convergence of the proposed method is guaranteed. Computer simulations showed quick convergence to the optimal solution in most cases, and verified the use of mobility for energy efficiency by showing its significant improvement to the network lifetime and relatively low cost in mobility.",

We then analyze the gait efficiency with respect to the change of the desired settling time. Furthermore, several extensions, comparison with walking gait and running up slopes, are discussed.",

        "abstract": "We develop a localization method enabling a team of mobile robots to search for multiple unknown transient radio sources. Due to signal source anonymity, short transmission durations, and dynamic transmission patterns, robots cannot treat the radio sources as continuous radio beacons. Moreover, robots do not know the source transmission power and have limited sensing ranges. To cope with these challenges, we pair up robots and develop a sensing model using the signal strength ratio from the paired robots. We formally prove that the sensed conditional joint posterior probability of source locations for the m-robot team can be obtained by combining the pairwise joint posterior probabilities, which can be derived from signal strength ratios. Moreover, we propose a pairwise ridge walking algorithm (PRWA) to coordinate the robot pairs based on the clustering of high probability regions and the minimization of local Shannon entropy. We have implemented and validated the algorithm under hardware-driven simulation.",

Small and low-accuracy sensors (GPS which cannot output vertical velocity, low-accuracy accelerometers, and barometer) are used for navigation and control. Firstly, INS/GPS/Barometer navigation system is designed to obtain high-accuracy position and velocity of the helicopter. Secondly, 3-dimensional guidance control system is designed by using optimal control theory and quaternion kinematics. Lastly, whole systems designed in this research are validated by the flight experiments.",

        "abstract": "Bundle adjustment (BA) which produces highly accurate results for visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) could not be used for Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with limited processing power because of its O(N3) complexity. We observed that a consistent ground plane often exists for MAVs flying in both the indoor and outdoor urban environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a visual SLAM algorithm that make use of the plane constraint to reduce the complexity of BA. The reduction of complexity is achieved by refining only the current camera pose and most recent map points with BA that minimizes the reprojection errors and perpendicular distances between the most recent map points and the best fit plane with all the pre-existing map points. As a result, our algorithm is approximately constant time since the number of current camera pose and most recent map points remain approximately constant. In addition, the minimization of the perpendicular distances between the plane and map points would enforce consistency between the reconstructed map points and the actual ground plane.",

Since Internet is noisy and performance of telerobotic systems strongly depends on communication conditions, control strategies which could be used to distribute computation and communication resource properly and require less data transmission are required. Motion description language (MDL) is an appropriate solution. In this paper, comparison study between MDL-based and the traditional direct control method under randomly varying time-delay condition has been pursued which show that the MDL-based method has the ability to guarantee the stability of the whole telerobotic system under randomly varying time-delay condition. Furthermore, MDL-based method provides an uniform mathematical description on discrete control on the master site and continuous execution on the slave site. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is promising for Networked Manufacturing development.",

To realize such promising applications, there is strong demand for a LOS detection system that does not restrict users' activities and inflicts no mental stress. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable LOS detection system, featuring minimum disturbance to users, both physically and mentally, via the use of dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. These latter are transparent and generate voltage according to the incident light intensity. Arraying the devices on wearable eyeglasses, this system detects the difference in the reflection light from the pupil and the white of the eye and hence determines the position of the pupil. It is wearable as eyeglasses, meaning it does not disturb users' activities or eyesight. More importantly, it involves minimal physical and psychological stress. We fabricated the photovoltaic device and demonstrated their feasibility to determine the location of the pupil. We improved the accuracy of pupil location detection by arraying the micro-patterned devises using MEMS technology. The pupil location and the line-of-sight was successfully detected using the developed eyeglass type system.",

        "abstract": "A wired miniature surgical camera robot with a novel Magnetic Levitation System (MLS) was modeled, designed and fabricated. A simple analysis and a theoretical model were developed in order to describe and predict basic behavior for different structural parameters of the system. The robot is composed of two main parts (head and tail) linked by a thin elastic flexible joint. The tail module embeds two magnets for anchoring and manual rough translation. The head module incorporates two motorized donut-shaped magnets and a miniaturized vision system at the tip. The MLS can exploit the external magnetic field to induce a smooth bending of the robotic head, guaranteeing a high span tilt motion of the point of view (0\u00b0-80\u00b0). The device is 100 mm long and 12.7 mm in diameter. Use of such a robot in single port or standard multiport laparoscopy could enable reduction of number/size of ancillary trocars, and/or increase the number of working devices that can be deployed, thus paving the way for multiple point of view laparoscopy.",

In particular, our late studies presented herein aim to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating appropriate computational tools to achieve the volumetric image guidance for minimally invasive surgeries in the beating heart. We conceive of the system as practicable for in vitro experiments upon the completion of the first physical prototype, which may pave the way for expansion of the approach for other complex surgeries as well.",

Human-like goal configurations are found using a criterion from ergonomics research.

These algorithms allow the simultaneous formation of multiple different shapes from a single block of host material. The resulting shapes are allowed to intertwine in arbitrarily complex ways. We also present a proof that the algorithms operate correctly to form the desired shapes. Finally, we show experimental results from close to 100 trials using both the Robot Pebbles hardware and a unique software simulator. Multiple trials of several different experiments demonstrate the algorithms operating correctly.",

        "abstract": "Goal sets are omnipresent in manipulation: picking up objects, placing them on counters or in bins, handing them off - all of these tasks encompass continuous sets of goals. This paper describes how to design optimal trajectories that exploit goal sets. We extend CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning), a recent trajectory optimizer that has proven effective on high-dimensional problems, to handle trajectory-wide constraints, and relate the solution to the intuition of taking unconstrained steps and subsequently projecting them onto the constraints. We then show how this projection simplifies for goal sets (i.e. constraints that affect only the end-point). Finally, we present experiments on a personal robotics platform that show the importance of exploiting goal sets in trajectory optimization for day-to-day manipulation tasks.",

The approach begins with a mapping step where information from sensor data about previously unknown dangers is extracted into an occupancy grid and eventually converted into a polygonal 3D world model. This continuously updating map is used by a path planner that generates and updates a 3D trajectory guiding the vehicle through safe passages around the detected objects. The algorithms are generic but optimized for unmanned aircraft and a stereo camera as the environmental sensor. Computation is fully executed on board so that a ground control station is only needed for supervision. With successful obstacle detection and avoidance flight tests, the paper shows the qualification of the presented method under real operational conditions.",

        "abstract": "Surgical procedures are traditionally performed by two or more surgeons along with staff nurses. One surgeon serves as the primary surgeon and the other serves as his/her assistant. Surgical robotics have redefined the dynamics in which the two surgeons interact with each other and with the surgical site. Raven IV is a new generation of the surgical robot system having four articulated robotic arms in a spherical configuration, each holding an articulated surgical tool. The system allows two surgeons to teleoperate the Raven IV collaboratively from two remote sites. The current research effort aims to configure the link architecture of each robotic arm, along with the position (port placement) and orientation of the Raven IV with respect to the patient, in order to optimize the common workspace reachable by all four robotic arms. The simulation results indicate that tilting the base of the robotic arms in the range of -20 to 20 deg while moving the ports closer together up to 50 mm apart leads to a preferred circular shape of the common workspace with an isotropy value of 0.5. A carefully configured system with multiple surgical robotic arms will enhance the interactive performance of the two surgeons.",

With the conventional detectors as strain gauges, poor S/N (signal to noise) ratio has been the limitation of torque sensor sensitivity. Torque Encoder uses a linear encoder as a detector and significantly enhanced the S/N ratio, and realized stiff and sensitive torque sensor. However, the crosstalk in torque measurement was still an open problem as in other sensing methods. In this paper, we analyzed the cause of the crosstalk and proposed the mechanism to suppress the crosstalk using selectively compliant suspension mechanism. Design methodology, implementation to minimize crosstalk with minimal sensitivity loss are presented. Evaluation on a prototype of the mechanism is carried out to show the effectiveness of the mechanism.",

Contrarily to Stewart platforms, an industrial manipulator offers several advantages when used as motion simulator: larger motion envelope, higher dexterity, and possibility to realize any end-effector posture within the workspace. In addition to this, the new actuated cabin acts as an additional joint and provides the needed kinematic redundancy to cope with the robot actuator and joint range constraints, which in general can significantly deteriorate the desired motion cues the robot is reproducing. In particular, we will show that, by suitably exploiting the redundancy better results can be obtained in reproducing sustained acceleration cues, a relevant problem when implementing vehicle simulators.",

A novel hand-held, lightweight and ergonomic mechatronic instrument is presented in this paper. The instrument has a 3-DOF roll-pitch-roll end-effector controlled using an easy to use handle that provides the surgeon with a 6-DOF movement, including a distal circular movement which resembles the circular movement of stitching. The design of the instrument is based on a global study involving control, dexterity and ergonomic aspects, with the aim of developing an instrument that enhances the dexterity of the surgeon while having an intuitive and ergonomic interface. A proof of concept prototype was built and tested in vitro and in vivo.",

A caterpillar's proleg makes this possible by using a retractor muscle that opens and closes the proleg, and a planta that gives compliance to the proleg. We implement these components with shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators and flexure joints. The gripper is fabricated using composite links and flexure joints. This method replaces metal-based joints and links with flexure joints and composite-based rigid links. The composite-based design provides a simple, light weight, and compact structure that enables the gripper to be applied to small-scale robots. Modeling and experiments are used to analyze the gripping force. The results show how the gripping force changes depending on the length of the flexure joint. A prototype was built to demonstrate reliable gripping on a rough-surfaced block using an adaptive mechanism.",

In this paper, this approach is applied to develop a robotic technique for closing abnormal communication between the atria of the heart. The goal is to achieve the efficacy of surgical closure as performed on a stopped, open heart with the reduced risk and trauma of a beating-heart catheter-based procedure. In the proposed approach, a concentric tube robot is used to percutaneously access the right atrium and deploy a tissue approximation device. The device is constructed using a metal MEMS fabrication process and is designed to both fit the manipulation capabilities of the robot as well as to reproduce the beneficial features of surgical closure by suture. Experimental results demonstrate device efficacy through manual in-vivo deployment and bench-top robotic deployment.",

The UPS method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the light-source direction or the light-source intensity, is employed to recover surface normals and albedos from the captured micro-images. For resolving the inherent generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity of the UPS, we present a GBR disambiguation method based on a framework of entropy minimization, and extend it using a graph cuts energy minimization to decrease the influence of noise and further refine the recovered surface normal. The proposed MPS method has been tested on synthetic as well as real images and very encouraging results have been obtained.",

With respect to conventional solutions for force sensing, like strain-gauge or Bragg-grating based force sensors, this sensor presents several advantages, mainly in terms of compactness, simplicity of the implementation and conditioning electronics. The proposed sensor exploits the properties of optoelectronic components with a narrow angle of view to measure the very small deformation of a compliant frame caused by the tendon tension. The sensor can be placed at the tendon ends as such as in any position along the tendon. The paper reports the basic working principle and a simplified procedure for the design of the sensor frame together with the results of an experimental testbench where a couple of the proposed sensors are use for the feedback control of a tendon-driven robotic joint.",

        "abstract": "Sampling based techniques for robot motion planning have become more widespread during the last decade. The algorithms however, still struggle with for example narrow passages in the configuration space and suffer from high number of necessary samples, especially in higher dimensions. A widely used method is Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT's). One problem with this method is the nearest neighbour search time, which grows significantly when adding a large number of vertices. We propose an algorithm which decreases the computation time, such that more vertices can be added in the same amount of time to generate better trajectories. The algorithm is based on subdividing the configuration space into boxes, where only specific boxes needs to be searched to find the nearest neighbour. It is shown that the computational complexity is lowered from a theoretical point of view. The result is an algorithm that can provide better trajectories within a given time period, or alternatively compute trajectories faster. In simulation the algorithm is verified for a simple RRT implementation and in a more specific case where a robot has to plan a path through a human inhabited environment.",

In such settings, it is necessary to allow for significant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justified for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5\u201310 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.",

        "abstract": "A ubiquitous problem in robotics is determining policies that move robots with uncertain process and observation models (partially-observed state systems) to a goal configuration while avoiding collision. We propose a new method to solve this minimum uncertainty navigation problem. We use a continuous partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model and optimize an objective function that considers both probability of collision and uncertainty at the goal position. By using information-theoretic heuristics, we are able to find policies that are effective for both minimizing collisions and stopping near the goal configuration. We additionally introduce a filtering algorithm that tracks collision free trajectories and estimates the probability of collision.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers mission design strategies for mobile robots whose task is to perform spatial sampling of a static environmental field, in the framework of compressive sensing. According to this theory, we can reconstruct compressible fields using O(log n) nonadaptive measurements (where n is the number of sites of the spatial domain), in a basis that is \"in coherent\" to the representation basis [1]; random uncorrelated measurements satisfy this incoherence requirement. Because an autonomous vehicle is kinematically constrained and has finite energy and communication resources, it is an open question how to best design missions for CS reconstruction. We compare a two-dimensional random walk, a TSP approximation to pass through random points, and a randomized boustrophedon (lawnmower) strategy. Not unexpectedly, all three approaches can yield comparable reconstruction performance if the planning horizons are long enough; if planning occurs only over short time scales, the random walk will have an advantage.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of a task motion multigraph, a data structure that can be used to reveal a difficulty specific to mobile manipulation: the possibility of planning in different state spaces in order to achieve the same goal. The different options reflect the mobile manipulator's ability to use different hardware components to perform a required task. For instance, a humanoid robot can open a door with its left arm or with its right arm. Thus, motion planning can be performed in the left arm's state space or in the right arm's state space. Given the specification of a task, it is shown how to encode the available motion planning options in a task motion multigraph. An algorithm that computes sequences of motion plans for mobile manipulators using the newly introduced notion is presented and evaluated. The algorithm makes use of information from the task motion multigraph to prioritize the spaces for which motion plans are computed. Experimental results show that reduced planning times can be obtained when considering the available planning options.",

A generalized, highly flexible and reconfigurable cooperative robot control platform called Mobile-R has been developed. Mobile-R consists of a mobile agent-based robot control system and a mission-based rapid deployment system.

        "abstract": "In recent years, gait robots have become increasingly common for gait rehabilitation in non-ambulatory stroke patients. Cardiovascular treadmill training, which has been shown to provide great benefit to stroke survivors, cannot be performed with non-ambulatory patients. We therefore integrated cardiovascular training in robot-assisted gait therapy to combine the benefits of both training modi. We developed a model of human heart rate as a function of exercise parameters during robot-assisted gait training and applied it for automatic control purposes. This structural model of the physiological processes describes the change in heart rate caused by treadmill speed and the power exchanged between robot and subject. We performed physiological parameter estimation for each tested individual and designed a model-based feedback controller to guide heart rate to a desired time profile. Five healthy subjects and eight stroke patients were recorded for model parameter identification, which was successfully used for heart rate control of three healthy subjects. We showed that a model-based control approach can take into account patient-specific limitations of treadmill speed as well as individual power expenditure.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric hysteresis usually relies on the frequency of the input signal. Most of the existing rate-dependent models use a lot of parameters to capture the rate-dependent hysteresis. In this paper, a simple rate-dependent hysteresis model is proposed to describe the frequency dependency effect of a micropositioning stage driven by piezoelectric actuators. This model is extended from an enhanced Coleman-Hodgdon (C-H) model. It has only 9 parameters and exhibits an accuracy better than 97%. The dependencies of the model parameters on the input rate are derived based on open-loop experimental tests. As inverse rate-dependent C-H model is established to construct a feedforward compensation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the rate-dependent model over the traditional rate-independent one. The feedforward in conjunction with a PID feedback control is constructed to further attenuate the modeling errors and creep effects. Results show that the combined control scheme suppresses the tracking error by more than 8 times compared to the stand-alone PID control. It provides a sound base of practical control of the micropositioning system for micro/nano scale manipulation.",

To study possible applications of supercapacitors, a terminal model describing the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors is required. In this paper, a simple electrical equivalent circuit model (ECM) is proposed based on the conventional supercapacitor RC branches model. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization algorithm is presented to identify the model parameters. The proposed modeling and identification method was validated with supercapacitor experimental results. The proposed method can be used to simulate and predict the dynamic performance of a supercapacitor, assess its energy storage capability. It can also be used in the design of energy management system of many supercapacitor applications, such as, capacitive deionization (CDI), hybrid/electric vehicles.",

Contact mechanics models were introduced to simulate elastic contacts between various profiles of flat surface, sphere and cylinder for different types of nano samples and nano grippers. Analyses and evaluation instances indicate that friction forces, commonly used in macro grasping to overcome the gravity, at nanoscale is often not enough to overcome relatively strong adhesion forces to pick up the nano sample deposited on a substrate due to tiny contact area of the grasping. Two-finger grippers are proposed for the stable nanoscale grasping and a nonparallel gripper with a 'V' configuration was demonstrated with better grasping capabilities than a parallel one. To achieve the robotic nanoscale grasping, a nano gripper constructed from two individually actuated and sensed tips is presented. Pick-and-place manipulation of silicon nanowires validate the theoretical analyses and capabilities of the proposed nano gripper.",

An important application of these tasks lies in the area of medical robotics, where robotic surgical assistants have the potential to greatly reduce surgeon fatigue and human error by improving the accuracy, speed, and robustness of surgical tasks such as suturing. However, different types of DOOs exhibit a variety of bending and twisting behaviors that are highly dependent on material properties. This paper proposes an approach for fitting simulation models of DOOs to observed data. Our approach learns an energy function such that observed DOO configurations lie in local energy minima. Our experiments on a variety of DOOs show that models fitted to different types of DOOs using our approach enable accurate prediction of future configurations. Additionally, we explore the application of our learned model to the perception of DOOs.",

Further tests, including investigation of complex aerodynamics effects and hardware-specified limitations, have been done using X-Plane\u00ae software package.

This paper presents a novel approach for joining of several dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based on a modification of the original formulation for DMPs. The new method produces smooth and natural transitions in position as well as velocity space. The properties of the method are demonstrated by applying it to simulated handwriting generation implemented on a robot, where an adaptive algorithm is used to learn trajectories from human demonstration. These results demonstrate that the new method is a feasible alternative for trajectory learning and generation and its accuracy and modular character has potential for various robotics applications.",

        "abstract": "The study of human sensorimotor control and learning through robotic devices requires systems that possess bio-mimetic characteristics which allow them to interact with the world in a similar fashion dynamically (this includes backdrivability, high bandwidth, implementability of complex control algorithms, force feedback, low friction, low inertia, robustness, autonomy, appropriate strength to weight ratio in the case of locomotion, safety, among others). Traditionally, engineered systems have evolved based upon industrial requirements, which are quite different. From the context of studying and mimicking the way humans perform control of their bodies, we state that there are specific groups of characteristics that are essential for use in researching sensorimotor control and learning. Designing robotic systems from this perspective necessitates solving new constrained design challenges that integrate with, adapt, and improve upon known approaches. A new design for a bio-mimetic backdrivable modular robot finger which addresses these challenges is presented. Results are presented demonstrating its effectiveness. The novelty of this robot is not only in the integrative design approach, which meets all the constraints presented without compromise, but also as the first bio-mimetic robot to integrate modularity, and it is highly compact. Additionally, the system has the capacity and bandwidth to run real-time control algorithms that can eventually model human behavior and perform complex manipulation tasks.",

In this paper, a new approach consisting of a number of modular neural networks is proposed to recognize multiple classes of objects for a robotic system. The population of the modular neural networks depends on the class number of the objects to be recognized and each modular network only focuses on learning one object class. For each modular neural network, both the bottom-up (sensory-driven) and top-down (expectation-driven) pathways are fused together, and a supervised learning algorithm is applied to update corresponding weights of both pathways. Furthermore, two different training strategies are evaluated: positive-only training and positive-and-negative training. Experiments on visual image recognition demonstrate the efficiencies of the proposed approach and the corresponding training strategies.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents MORSE, a new open-source robotics simulator. MORSE provides several features of interest to robotics projects: it relies on a component-based architecture to simulate sensors, actuators and robots; it is flexible, able to specify simulations at variable levels of abstraction according to the systems being tested; it is capable of representing a large variety of heterogeneous robots and full 3D environments (aerial, ground, maritime); and it is designed to allow simulations of multiple robots systems. MORSE uses a \u201cSoftware-in-the-Loop\u201d philosophy, i.e. it gives the possibility to evaluate the algorithms embedded in the software architecture of the robot within which they are to be integrated. Still, MORSE is independent of any robot architecture or communication framework (middleware). MORSE is built on top of Blender, using its powerful features and extending its functionality through Python scripts. Simulations are executed on Blender's Game Engine mode, which provides a realistic graphical display of the simulated environments and allows exploiting the reputed Bullet physics engine. This paper presents the conception principles of the simulator and some use-case illustrations.",

The image-based measurements are detailed, through the minimization of a new functional, deeply rooted on optical characteristics of the lens system, namely the point spread function. This work complements an inexpensive single pan and tilt camera-based indoor positioning and tracking system, resorting to complementary filters for depth estimation. A motivation example is provided, where the target dimensions are assumed as known. Then, an extension corresponding to an higher-order filter is presented, that tackles the problem at hand. To assess the performance of the proposed system, a series of indoor experimental tests for a range of operation of up to ten meter were carried out. A centimetric accuracy was obtained under realistic conditions.",

The designed algorithm can cope with cluttered color images, complex lighting conditions as well as partial occlusion of the leading vehicle and is able to detect and track a vehicle even within unstructured offroad environments. Thanks to the used 3D model which describes the characteristic vehicle geometry and appearance in terms of vertexes, edges and colored surfaces, no special visual markers are required. The knowledge of vehicle's geometry and appearance gained from the model are used within a particle filter to estimate the 6DoF position relative to the ego vehicle, thereby fusing edge as well as color information. We successfully use the proposed algorithm for pure vision based autonomous offroad convoy driving.",

        "abstract": "Regular inspection for corrosion of the pipes used in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) processing facilities is critical for safety. We argue that a visual perception system equipped on a pipe crawling robot can improve on existing techniques (Magnetic Flux Leakage, radiography, ultrasound) by producing high resolution registered appearance maps of the internal surface. To achieve this capability, it is necessary to estimate the pose of sensors as the robot traverses the pipes. We have explored two monocular visual odometry algorithms (dense and sparse) that can be used to estimate sensor pose. Both algorithms use a single easily made measurement of the scene structure to resolve the monocular scale ambiguity in their visual odometry estimates. We have obtained pose estimates using these algorithms with image sequences captured from cameras mounted on different robots as they moved through two pipes having diameters of 152mm (6\") and 406mm (16\"), and lengths of 6 and 4 meters respectively. Accurate pose estimates were obtained whose errors were consistently less than 1 percent for distance traveled down the pipe.",

Learning a task model allows the robot to anticipate the partner's intentions and adapt its motion according to perceived forces. As the human represents a highly complex contact environment, direct reproduction of the learned model may lead to sub-optimal results. To compensate for unmodelled uncertainties, in addition to learning we propose an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the impedance parameters, so as to ensure accurate reproduction. To facilitate the illustration of the concepts introduced in this paper and provide a systematic evaluation, we present experimental results obtained with simulation of a dyad of two planar 2-DOF robots.",

        "abstract": "Commanding an autonomous system through complex motions at a low level can be tedious or impractical for systems with many degrees of freedom. Allowing an operator to demonstrate the desired motions directly can often enable more intuitive and efficient interaction. Two challenges in the field of learning from demonstration include (1) how to best represent learned motions to accurately reflect a human's intentions, and (2) how to enable learned motions to be easily applicable in new situations. This paper introduces a novel representation of continuous actions called probabilistic flow tubes that can provide flexibility during execution while robustly encoding a human's intended motions. Our approach also automatically determines certain qualitative characteristics of a motion so that these characteristics can be preserved when autonomously executing the motion in a new situation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our motion learning approach both in a simulated two-dimensional environment and on the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) robot performing object manipulation tasks.",

As one example, we examine dynamic folding of a cloth with two high-speed multifingered hands mounted on two sliders. First, dynamic folding by a human subject is analyzed in order to extract the necessary motions for realizing this task. Second, a model of a sheet-like flexible object is proposed by extending a linear flexible object model (algebraic equation) that takes advantage of high-speed robot motion. Third, motion planning of the robot system is performed by using the proposed model, and the simulation results are shown. Finally, an experiment was conducted with the robot motion obtained by the simulation.",

        "abstract": "The motors or engines of an autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) have torque and power limitations, which limit their abilities to climb steep hills, which are defined to be hills that have high grade sections in which the vehicle is forced to decelerate. Traversal of a steep hill requires the vehicle to have sufficient momentum before entering the hill. This problem is part of a larger class of momentum-based motion planning problems such as the problem of lifting heavy objects with manipulators. Hence, solutions to the steep hill climbing problem have much wider applicability. The motion planning here is accomplished using a dynamic model of the skid-steered AGV used in the experiments along with Sampling Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC), a recently developed input sampling planning algorithm that may be viewed as a generalization of LPA* to the direct use of kinodynamic models. The motion planning is demonstrated experimentally using two scenarios, one in which the robot starts at rest at the bottom of a hill and one in which the robot starts at rest a distance from the hill. The first scenario requires the AGV to first reverse direction so that the vehicle can gather enough momentum before reaching the hill. This corresponds to having the vehicle begin at a local minimum, which results in a problem that many traditional model predictive control methods cannot solve. It is seen that, whereas open loop trajectories can lead to vehicle immobilization, SBMPC successfully uses the information provided by the dynamic model to ensure that the AGV has the requisite momentum.",

This work is motivated by the Axel tethered robotic rover designed to provide access to extreme extra-planetary terrains. Motion planning for this type of rover is very different from traditional planning problems because the tether geometry under high loading must be considered during the planning process. Furthermore, only round-trip paths that avoid tether entanglement are viable solutions to the problem. We present an algorithm for tethered robot motion planning on steep terrain that reduces the likelihood that the tether will become entangled during descent and ascent of steep slopes. The algorithm builds upon the notion of the shortest homotopic tether path and its associated sleeve. We provide a simple example for purposes of illustration.",

The algorithm processes measurements from proprioceptive (e.g., odometry, inertial measurement unit) and exteroceptive (e.g., camera, laser scanner) sensors, in order to estimate the trajectory of the vehicle. Smoothing is carried out in the information-filtering framework, and utilizes iterative minimization, which renders the method well-suited for applications where the effects of the measurements' nonlinearity are significant. The algorithm attains bounded computational complexity by marginalizing out older states. The key contribution of this work is a detailed analysis of the effects of the marginalization process on the consistency properties of the estimator. Based on this analysis, a linearization scheme that results in substantially improved accuracy, compared to the standard linearization approach, is proposed. Both simulation and real-world experimental results are presented, which demonstrate that the proposed method attains localization accuracy superior to that of competing approaches.",

We applied a learning algorithm based on central pattern generators and optimization method as a way for the robot to acquire its crawling motion.

The novelty of our work is the explicit formulation of the gradient for the target search problem that significantly enhances the efficiency in gradient evaluation and robustness for the gradient-based optimization algorithm. We present results by firstly showing the computational advantage and robustness of this explicit gradient model against the finite differencing approach and further demonstrate its application in simulation by coordinating multiple UAVs searching a large scale environment in a decentralized network.",

Each agent is capable of measuring the relative position and orientation of its neighboring agents, however these measurements are not exact but they are corrupted with noises. The goal is to compute the pose of each agent relative to an anchor node. We present a strategy where, first of all, the agents compute their orientations relative to the anchor. After that, they update the relative position measurements according to these orientations, to finally compute their positions. As contribution we discuss the proposed strategy, that has the interesting property that can be executed in a distributed fashion. The distributed implementation allows each agent to recover its pose using exclusively local information and local interactions with its neighbors. This algorithm has a low memory load, since it only requires each node to maintain an estimate of its own orientation and position.",

Standard colour and texture descriptors are extracted on a frame by frame basis to build a representation of appearance, which is probabilistically classified by a novel multi-class generalisation of the Gaussian Process (GP) developed for this work. A GP approach was selected for probabilistic outputs, and the ability to automatically determine the relevance of each input dimension to each of the C classes in the problem. When learning hyperparameters from N training examples, the new formulation scales at O(N ), rather than O(CN3) for the standard one-vs-all approach. The novel classification framework is trained and validated on a set of manual labels, and then queried to visualise a map of vegetation type under the UAV flight path. Mapping results are presented for a region of farmland in Northern Queensland, Australia that is infested with two invasive introduced tree species.",

The broad range of applications of this generic algorithm includes legged locomotion planning, whole-body manipulation planning, dexterous manipulation planning, as well as any multi-contact-based motion planning problem that might combine several of these sub-problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our planner through example scenarios taken from the aforementioned classes of problems in virtual environments.",

        "abstract": "A new algorithm for solving multi-goal planning problems in the presence of obstacles is introduced. We extend ant colony optimization (ACO) from its well-known application, the traveling salesman problem (TSP), to that of multi-goal feasible path planning for inspection and surveillance applications. Specifically, the ant colony framework is combined with a sampling-based point-to-point planning algorithm; this is compared with two successful sampling-based multi-goal planning algorithms in an obstacle-filled two-dimensional environment. Total mission time, a function of computational cost and the duration of the planned mission, is used as a basis for comparison. In our application of interest, autonomous underwater inspections, the ACO algorithm is found to be the best-equipped for planning in minimum mission time, offering an interior point in the tradeoff between computational complexity and optimality.",

This method allows for a large set of potential materials, with a wide range of material properties, to be used in combination to create mechanisms with highly tailored mechanical properties. These multi-material compliant mechanisms have minimum feature sizes of approximately 100 \u00b5m and have demonstrated long lifetimes, easily surviving 100,000 bending cycles. We also present the first use of these compliant mechanisms in a 2.5cm \u00d7 2.5cm \u00d7 7.5cm, 6g hexapod. This hexapod has been demonstrated moving at speeds up to 6 cm/s, with a predicted maximum speed of up to 17 cm/s.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present task allocation (assignment) algorithms for a multi-robot system where the tasks are divided into disjoint groups and there are precedence constraints between the task groups. Existing auction-based algorithms assume the task independence and hence can not be used directly to solve the class of multi-robot task assignment problems that we consider. In our model, each robot can do a fixed number of tasks and obtains a benefit (or incurs a cost) for each task. The tasks are divided into groups and each robot can do only one task from each group. These constraints arise when the robots have to do a set of tasks that have precedence constraints and each task takes the same time to be completed. We extend the auction algorithm to provide an almost optimal solution to the task assignment problem with set precedence constraints (the theoretical guarantees are the same as that of the original auction algorithm for unconstrained tasks). In other words, we guarantee that we will get a solution within a factor of O(nte) of the optimal solution, where nt is the total number of tasks and \u03b5 is a parameter that we choose. We first present our algorithm using a shared memory model and then indicate how consensus algorithms can be used to make the algorithm totally distributed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a multi-human detection system with a team of robots basically in an indoor environment. To start with, we propose a hybrid approach to resolve the problem of human leg detection using Laser Range Finder (LRF) for each robot, that returns not only \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d type of answer but also a probability. Specifically, the set of measurement data obtained from the laser range finder mounted on a robot is further decomposed into several sectors using an appropriate segmentation technique. Then, we apply a probabilistic model to compare these sectors with leg patterns to check if any of them belongs to the set of human leg patterns or not. Next, we examine the promising leg sectors with a modified Inscribe Angle Variance (IAV) method in order to confirm if these sectors are from human leg's arc feature or not. Moreover, we also use motion detector to check if these objects move or not as an enhancement of the detection. For the entire multi-human detection system, each robot of the team delivers the detected human information to our central control computer through the Inter-Process Communication (IPC). With prior map information of the residing environment and supposing each robot in the team has a localization module, we can then map these results of human detection from every robot into their global coordinates after process of data association. But in order to reduce the computational complexity while doing the data association among these robots in a team, we introduce a set of appropriate rules. Finally, we apply a particle filter based tracking algorithm to keep accurate track of people being detected and to improve the robustness of the detection outcome. This work has been evaluated through several experiments with a number of mobile robots and humans in an indoor environment, and promising performance has been observed.",

For this purpose, a manipulation strategy of multiple mobile robots, that enables a system to continue operating even if a working robot undergoes preventive maintenance or fails and undergoes corrective maintenance, is implemented. In addition, a robot failure and a maintenance policy for preventive and corrective maintenance activities are mathematically modeled on the basis of reliability engineering. Thus, working robots are allowed to undergo preventive maintenance at an optimal interval and corrective maintenance each time they fail.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to adoptively learn the dynamics of a robotic system. The methodology is based on maximizing the information gain from new observations while modeling the dynamics with a Multiple Output Gaussian Process (MOGP). High-dimensional state action spaces with unknown dependencies between inputs and outputs can be highly computationally expensive to learn. Gaussian process modeling is a Bayesian technique that naturally overcomes one of the most difficult problems in machine learning known as over-fitting. This makes it very appealing for on-line problems where testing multiple hypothesis is difficult. The computational cost of the learning task is reduced by having a smaller dataset of informative training points. Therefore we introduce a learning strategy capable of determining the most informative training set for the MOGP. This method can be implemented for learning the behavior of dynamic systems where due to their complexity and disturbances are infeasible to be analytically defined. The benefits of our approach are verified in two experiments: learning the dynamics of a cart pole system in simulation and the dynamics of a robotic blimp.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports an algorithm for the registration of images with low overlap and low visual feature density- a typical characteristic of down-looking underwater imagery. Our algorithm exploits locally accurate temporal motion-priors and pairwise image correspondences to aggregate semi-rigid sets of sequential images. These sets are then used to search for visual correspondences across sets instead of between individual pairs of images. By simultaneously searching over multiple views, we increase the physical area seen by more than one image, effectively increasing the \"field of view\" of the image correspondence search. This increases the probability that the area viewed by both sets will contain enough visual features to register the sets. Our algorithm systematically reduces the uncertainty in the motion prior between the two sets resulting in a refined motion prior that is used to geometrically constrain the correspondence search between sets. This geometric constraint allows us to confidently identify local correspondences that would not be possible globally, further increasing our ability to register images in feature poor environments. We present results using a real-world ship hull inspection data set collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle.",

The simultaneous intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of central cameras rig, using different models for each camera, is developed. The presented approach is suitable for the calibration of rigs composed by N cameras modelled by N different models. Calibration results, compared with state of the art approaches, and a 3D plane estimation application, allowed by the calibration, show the effectiveness of the approach.

Coplanar line pairs are extracted from intersecting line pairs and matched between two views, and their correspondences act as geometric primitives for 3D planar patch extraction. Each correspondence generates a plane hypothesis by estimating planar homography using the compatibility constraint with the fundamental matrix. These candidates are merged into disjoint planar regions using a greedy graph-clustering algorithm. In a graph, each candidate consists of a node and is connected to the others by edges weighted by transfer errors of the corresponding convex hulls. Compared to previous approaches, we do not assume known camera geometry or scene structures such as piece-wise planarity or the presence of rectilinear structure. In addition, uncertainty modeling for coplanar line pairs is incorporated into matching and reconstruction for accurate computation of the transfer errors reflecting 3D plane geometry.",

The passive mode is realized by the position controller given the desired motion trajectory. The assisted mode is implemented in the customized positions by switching between the active and passive modes according to the predefined action procedure. The experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method, and the results show that the different rehabilitation motion are successfully accomplished and the maximum joint position error is less than 1.2 degree, which satisfies the requirement in hand rehabilitation application.

In this paper, this problem is dealt with by utilizing the redundant degrees of freedom (DOF) of a given task and the tool attachment optimization. For example, in a vision-based inspection where a camera is held by a manipulator, the extra DOF can be brought about by allowing the camera to be translated along its approach axis or rotated about this axis when capturing images. Furthermore, the manipulator end-effector position and orientation is optimized by designing an additional linkage at the manipulator end-effector which is called a tool attachment. A 7-DOF manipulator system is used in the simulations to verify the proposed approach. Results showed that this approach can minimize the task completion time by about 17% compared to conducting only motion coordination.",

        "abstract": "Impedance control is well-suited to robot manipulation applications because it gives the designer a measure of control over how the manipulator to conforms to the environment. However, in the context of end-effector impedance control when the robot manipulator is redundant with respect to end-effector configuration, the question arises regarding how to control the impedance of the redundant joints. This paper considers multi-priority impedance control where a second-priority joint space impedance operates in the null space of a first-priority Cartesian impedance at the end-effector. A control law is proposed that realizes both impedances while observing the priority constraint such that a weighted quadratic error function is optimized. This control law is shown to be a generalization of several motion and impedance control laws found in the literature. The paper makes explicit two forms of the control law. In the first, parametrization by passive inertia values allows the control law to be implemented without requiring end-effector force measurements. In the second, a class of parametrizations is introduced that makes the null space impedance independent of end-effector forces. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulation.",

The algorithm we present is appropriate when the target detection sensor trades off accuracy versus covered area, e.g., when a UAV can fly and sense at different elevations. A structure based on quadtrees is used to propagate a posterior about the target location using a variable resolution representation that is dynamically refined in regions associated with higher probability of target presence. Probabilities are updated using a Bayesian approach accounting for erroneous sensor readings in the form of false positives and missed detections. The model we propose is coupled with a search and decision algorithm that determines where to sense next and with which accuracy. The search algorithm is based on an objective function accounting for both probability of detection and motion costs, thus aiming to minimize traveled distances while trying to localize the target. The paper is concluded with simulation results showing our approach outperforms commonly used methods based on uniform resolution grids.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in modeling with BNs is learning the structure from both discrete and multivariate continuous data. A common approach in such situations is to discretize continuous data before structure learning. However efficient methods to discretize high-dimensional variables are largely lacking. This paper presents a novel method specifically aiming at discretization of high-dimensional, high-correlated data. The method consists of two integrated steps: non-linear dimensionality reduction using sparse Gaussian process latent variable models, and discretization by application of a mixture model. The model is fully probabilistic and capable to facilitate structure learning from discretized data, while at the same time retain the continuous representation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method in the domain of robot grasping. Compared with traditional discretization schemes, our model excels both in task classification and prediction of hand grasp configurations. Further, being a fully probabilistic model it handles uncertainty in the data and can easily be integrated into other frameworks in a principled manner.",

        "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is effective to restore movement in spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. Unfortunately, muscle fatigue constrains the application of FES so that output torque feedback is interesting for fatigue compensation. Whereas, inadequacy of torque sensors is another challenge for FES control. Torque estimation is thereby essential in fatigue tracking task for practical FES employment. In this work, the Hammstein cascade with electromyography (EMG) as input is applied to model the myoelectrical mechanical behavior of the stimulated muscle. Kalman filter with forgetting factor is presented to estimate the muscle model and track fatigue. Fatigue inducing protocol was conducted on three SCI subjects through surface electrical stimulation. Assessment in simulation and with experimental data reveals that the muscle model properly fits the muscle behavior well. Moreover, the time-varying parameters tracking performance in simulation is efficient such that real time tracking is feasible with Kalman filter. The fatigue tracking with experimental data further demonstrates that the proposed method is suitable for fatigue tracking as well as adaptive torque prediction at different prediction horizons.",

        "abstract": "In the past, the music community conducted research on what makes music more musical or expressive. Much of this work has focused on the manipulation of phrasing, articulation and rubato to make music more expressive. However, it has been difficult to study neuromuscular control used by experts to create such musical music. This paper took a first step toward this effort by using the Anatomically Correct Testbed (ACT) Robotic Hand to mimic the way expert humans play when they are instructed to perform \"musically\" or \"robotically.\" Results from 22 human subjects showed that musical expression contained a larger range of dynamics and different articulation than robotic expression, while there was no difference in the use of rubato. The ACT Hand was controlled to the level of precision that allowed the replication of expert expressive performance. Its performance was then rated by 17 human listeners against music played by a human expert to show that the ACT Hand could play as musically as an expert human. Furthermore, articulation, phrasing, and rubato were tested in isolation to determine the importance of articulation over phrasing and rubato. This type of study will lead to understanding how to implement future robots to perform musically without pre-programming them, finding ways to teach novice pianists strategies in controlling their muscles to become expressive musicians more quickly, and understanding why humans feel expressiveness or even emotion in music.",

A double-shell link structure allows for a comfortable human-robot interaction, while a 4-DOF passive mechanism gives a perfect kinematic compatibility with the user. Moreover, NEUROExos is powered by a variable impedance antagonistic actuator, which provides the exoskeleton with a software-controllable passive compliance. We present the main characteristics of the exoskeleton, with a focus on the actuation and control of the platform. Additionally, results on a healthy subject show the relevance of this design during a prototypical rehabilitation task",

        "abstract": "Highly accurate localization of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with respect to a scene is important for a wide range of applications, in particular surveillance and inspection. Most existing approaches to visual localization focus on indoor environments, while such tasks require outdoor navigation. Within this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for monocular visual localization for MAVs based on the concept of virtual views in 3D space. Under the assumption that significant parts of the scene do not alter their geometry and serve as natural landmarks, the accuracy of our visual approach outperforms consumer grade GPS systems. In an experimental setup we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm and evaluate the performance by geometric validation from an observer's view. As our method directly allows global registration, it is neither prone to drift nor bias. This makes it well suited for long-term autonomous navigation.",

The topological graph is built on top of a graph SLAM system, which can be efficiently optimized even for very large environments. The novel feature of our system is that it navigates locally using local metric maps, while the overall plan is formed on the topological graph. Unlike many current SLAM methods, we never reconstruct a full occupancy grid of the environment for localization or path planning. We show that our method generates near-optimal plans, and deals gracefully with changes to the map.",

The system is based on estimating how much help the person needs at each situation and providing just the correct amount. This is achieved by combining robot and human control commands in a reactive fashion after weighting them by their respective local efficiency. Thus, the better the person drives, the more control he/she is awarded with. In order to predict how much help users may need in advance rather than waiting for them to decrease in efficiency, their skills to deal with each situation are estimated with respect to a baseline driver profile to increase assistance when needed. Situations are characterized at reactive level to keep a reduced set. This profile has been extracted from real traces of more than 70 inpatients presenting different physical and cognitive skills via clustering. The approach has been successfully tested at Fondazione Santa Lucia (FSL) in Rome.",

Because of the high degree of dynamics in populated and real-world environments, often artificial landmarks are used to achieve the desired accuracy in localization. In this paper we consider the problem of optimally placing landmarks for robots navigating frequently on similar trajectories. Our method maximizes conditional mutual information of the states of the robot given the landmark observations. It uses a greedy algorithm which approximates the solution of the NP-hard maximization problem. For this algorithm, we derive a tight constant-factor bound on the approximation error. We furthermore evaluate the selected landmark sets in extensive experiments carried out both in simulation and with a real robot.",

Moreover, local breast mechanical parameters required for a heterogeneous finite element simulation, are extracted from the DBT data. The proposed approach computes a 3D local breast glandularity estimation used for Young's modulus determination. This planning method, using a heterogeneous model, reduces the tool positioning error meanly by 75%. In addition, the results show that a breast heterogeneous model has the potential to improve planning accuracy.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Usually, the joint transmission friction model for robots is composed of a viscous friction force and of a constant dry sliding friction force. However, according to the Coulomb law, the dry friction force depends linearly on the load driven by the transmission, which has to be taken into account for robots working with large variation of the payload or inertial and gravity forces. Moreover, for robots actuating at low velocity, the Stribeck effect must be taken into account. This paper proposes a new inverse dynamic identification model for n degrees of freedom (dof) serial robot, where the dry sliding friction force is a linear function of both the dynamic and the external forces, with a velocity-dependent coefficient. A new sequential identification procedure is carried out. At a first step, the friction model parameters are identified for each joint (1 dof), moving one joint at a time (this step has been validated in). At a second step, these values are fixed in the n dof dynamic model for the identification of all robot inertial and gravity parameters. For the two steps, the identification concatenates all the joint data collected while the robot is tracking planned trajectories with different payloads to get a global least squares estimation of inertial and new friction parameters. An experimental validation is carried out with an industrial 3 dof robot.",

By using these indices, a uniform metric can be founded to represent the closeness to singularities for all types of parallel robots.",

This paper proposes an innovative approach where the external force is adaptively calibrated based on the deformation of object so that we can evaluate the internal stiffness parameters more accurately than that of conventional approaches. It is shown that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of force application with even 100% at an extreme case.",

        "abstract": "A mathematical model for a complex system such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) requires estimation of aerodynamic, inertial and structural properties of the many elements of the platform. This physical modeling approach is labor intensive and requires coarse approximations to be made in calculations. Similarly, models constructed through flight tests are only applicable to a narrow flight envelope and classical system identification approaches require prior knowledge of the model structure, which in some instance may only be partially known. To tackle these problems, we introduce a novel aircraft system identification method based on dependent Gaussian processes. The approach allows high fidelity non linear flight dynamic models to be constructed through flight testing. The proposed algorithm learns the system parameters as well as captures any dependencies between them. The method is demonstrated by generating a model of the force and moment coefficients for the Brumby Mklll UAV from real flight data. The learnt dynamic model identifies coupling between flight modes, provides an estimate of uncertainty, and is applicable to a broader range of the flight envelope.",

We present an improved solution that computes paths through two-dimensional waypoints, that are shorter than those produced by one of the most used techniques in the literature. We initially present an optimization cost function that proves to be better suited for the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicles that are the focus of this work. We also propose an improvement for the Alternating Algorithm, used to determinate the orientation angles on the calculation of the Dubins' Path through the waypoints. Finally, we use a recently developed optimization meta-heuristic, called Continuous-GRASP (C-GRASP), to generate a path that is shorter than paths obtained with classical techniques. Our results show significant improvements on the search for optimal paths for the case of nonholonomic vehicles. Our methodology was thoroughly evaluated and validated in simulation, and the results have shown a decrease on path's length of 28% on average, compared with the classic technique found in literature. In some cases a reduction of approximately 50% was obtained.",

We have found that the object's deformation generated by dynamic effects can drastically contribute to a fast and stable object rotation. We introduce a new simulation model for a sheet-like object, where the object is constructed of multiple nodes connected by three DOFs viscoelastic joint units. We apply the model to real food after the viscoelastic parameters are estimated. Then, simulation analysis is used to show how the object's rotation behavior changes with respect to the plate's motion frequency, similar to the motion of human legs sliding, walking, and running. Finally we obtain an optimum plate motion leading to the maximal angular velocity of the object. We also reveal that an appropriate angular acceleration of the plate is essential for a dynamically stable and fast object rotation.",

The resulting animated system is able to maintain nonverbal and verbal bidirectional communication, enhancing the interaction with the avatar and making it more natural for the users.",

        "abstract": "The ability to form and recognize object categories is fundamental to human intelligence. This paper proposes a behavior-grounded relational classification model that allows a robot to recognize the categories of household objects. In the proposed approach, the robot initially explores the objects by applying five exploratory behaviors (lift, shake, drop, crush and push) on them while recording the proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback produced by each interaction. The sensorimotor data is used to estimate multiple measures of similarity between the objects, each corresponding to a specific coupling between an exploratory behavior and a sensory modality. A graph-based recognition model is trained by extracting features from the estimated similarity relations, allowing the robot to recognize the category memberships of a novel object based on the object's similarity to the set of familiar objects. The framework was evaluated on an upper-torso humanoid robot with two large sets of household objects. The results show that the robot's model is able to recognize complex object categories (e.g., metal objects, empty bottles, etc.) significantly better than chance.",

        "abstract": "For tasks requiring robot-environment interaction, compliant motion is important to ensure stable contact and operational safety. The compliant actuators such as a series elastic actuator and a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) are expected to be one of the promising solutions to provide a compliant motion. In this paper, we propose a gripper actuated by the hybrid variable stiffness actuator developed in our previous work to show how the VSA can improve the ability of grasping. The gripper, which is equipped with two symmetric 4-bar linkages, can conduct the position and stiffness control simultaneously, and the grasping force can be calculated by the estimated torque of the HVSA. The HVSA-actuated gripper is able to grasp fragile objects with compliant motion and the relatively heavy object with stiff motion. Furthermore, the features of the variable stiffness provide operational safety by adjusting the stiffness according to the task. In this study, the relationships between the joint torque and the grasping force, and between the joint stiffness and the Cartesian stiffness are analyzed to control the grasping force. From a series of experiments, it is shown that the gripper can grasp fragile objects such as an egg and a wine glass, as well as relatively heavy object without any soft cover and force/torque sensor.",

Our approach makes extensive use of sequential state estimation techniques from the mobile robotics literature, whereby we view the object recognition problem as one of estimating a consistent location within a set of object maps. We examine and test approaches based on both traditional particle filtering and histogram filtering. We demonstrate both the mapping and recognition / localization techniques on a set of raised letter shapes using real tactile sensor data.",

        "abstract": "Many applications for robotics require that the robot know its current position in the environment. While there exist several solutions for localizing a robot, even in a previously unknown environment, they often require an estimate of the robot's motion. However, in many situations, a robot may not have motion encoders, or its encoders may be highly inaccurate. We have developed an algorithm for tracking the position of a robot, based on a rangefinder device, that is robust to temporary errors in the range scan. By aligning each scan to an occupancy grid of prior scan data, we can find the robot's position more accurately than current techniques which only align to the previous scan. In addition, our solution can track the position of the robot based on three dimensional scan data, instead of requiring that the range sensor be fixed in a level plane.",

We pose the problem of generating navigation summaries as a sampling problem. The goal is to select a few samples from the set of all observations, which are characteristic of the environment, and capture its mean properties and surprises. We define the surprise score of an observation as its distance to the closest sample in the summary. Hence, an ideal summary is defined to have a low mean and a low max surprise score, measured over all the observations. We present three different strategies for solving this sampling problem. Of these, we show that the kCover sampling algorithm produces summaries with low mean and max surprise scores; even in the presence of noise. These results are demonstrated on datasets acquired in different robotics context.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a robust and efficient method to build dense 3D maps, using only the images grabbed by an omnidirectional camera. The map contains exhaustive information about both the structure and the appearance of the environment and it is well suited also for large scale environments. We start from the assumption that the surrounding environment (the scene) forms a piecewise smooth surface represented by a triangle mesh. Our system is able to infer, without any odometry information, the structure of the environment along with the ego-motion of the camera by performing a robust tracking of the projection of this surface in the omnidirectional image. The key idea is to use a guess of the triangle mesh subdivision based on a constrained Delaunay triangulation built according to a set of point features and edgelet features extracted from the image. In such a way, we take into account both the corners and the edges of the scene imaged by the camera, constrained by the topology of the triangulation in order to improve the stability of the tracking process. Both motion and structure parameters are estimated using a direct method inside an optimization framework, taking into account the topology of the subdivision in a robust and efficient way. We successfully tested our system in a challenging urban scenario along a large loop using an omnidirectional camera mounted on the roof of a car.",

        "abstract": "Computing the \"average\" orientation of lines and rotations is non-trivial due to the need to account for the periodicity of rotation. For example, the average of +10 and +350 degrees is 0 (or 360) degrees, not 180. This problem arises in many disciplines, particularly those in which empirically collected data is processed or filtered. In this paper, we review a common but sub-optimal method for computing average orientation and provide a new geometric interpretation. We also propose a new method which provides additional insights into the geometry of the problem. Our new method also produces significantly more accurate results in the regime of operation usually encountered in robotics applications. We characterize this regime and provide guidance regarding which method to use, and when.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Performance of exploration strategies strongly depends on the process of determination of a next robot goal. Current approaches define different utility functions how to evaluate and select possible next goal candidates. One of the mostly used evaluation criteria is the distance cost that prefers candidates close to the current robot position. If this is the only criterion, simply the nearest candidate is chosen as the next goal. Although this criterion is simple to implement and gives feasible results there are situations where the criterion leads to wrong decisions. This paper presents the distance cost that reflects traveling through all goal candidates. The cost is determined as a solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem using the Chained Lin-Kernighan heuristic. The cost can be used as a stand-alone criterion as well as it can be integrated into complex decision systems. Experimental results for open-space and office-like experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the standard one in the length of the traversed trajectory during the exploration while the computational burden is not significantly increased.",

Different kinds of continuous curvature paths have been defined in order to solve problems with different complexity. The type of paths that we have generated get the benefits of higher comfort and safety. Generated paths take into account lower and upper bounds of sharpness and curvature simultaneously, while it is not the case of other continuous curvature paths such as Elementary and BiElementary paths. Wheeled mobile robots following a path with continuous curvature may also get benefit on wheels slippage reduction and low odometry errors, since transitions are softer with constant curvature rates.",

This work concentrates on evaluating three common variations of the 3D-NDT in terms of accuracy of representing sampled semi-structured environments. In a novel approach to spatial representation quality measurement, the 3D geometrical modeling task is formulated as a classification problem and its accuracy is evaluated with standard machine learning performance metrics. In this manner the accuracy of the 3D-NDT variations is shown to be comparable to, and in some cases to outperform that of the standard occupancy grid mapping model.",

Closed-loop identification is performed with a direct method, where a PD controller, which stabilizes the system without knowledge about its parameters, closes the loop. It is shown that when the perturbation signal is absent, exponential convergence can be claimed, making the identification algorithm robust. However, when there exists a perturbation signal it can be established a region where the parameter estimates belong to, and it is shown how this region is affected by the PD controller gains.",

        "abstract": "Coupling the human upper limbs with robotic devices is gaining increasing attention in the last decade, due to the emerging applications in orthotics, prosthetics and rehabilitation devices. In the cases of every-day life tasks, force exertion and generally interaction with the environment is absolutely critical. Therefore, the decoding of the user's force exertion intention is important for the robust control of orthotic robots (e.g. arm exoskeletons). In this paper, the human arm manipulability is analyzed and its effect on the recruitment of the musculo-skeletal system is explored. It was found that the recruitment and activation of muscles is strongly affected by arm manipulability. Based on this finding, a decoding method is built in order to estimate force exerted in the three-dimensional (3D) task space from surface ElectroMyoGraphic (EMG) signals, recorded from muscles of the arm. The method is using the manipulability information for the given force task. Experimental results were verified in various arm configurations with two subjects.",

In this paper we present a control scheme for the MIT-Skywalker, which is based on an artificial potential field applied at the foot workspace. It is used to improve sensory feedback to the patient, as well as to increase to normal the range of motion of the paretic leg. Simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed controller.",

Prior ground extraction is empirically shown to significantly improve segmentation performance. Segmentation of sparse 3D data (e.g. Velodyne scans) is addressed using ground models of non-constant resolution either providing a continuous probabilistic surface or a terrain mesh built from the structure of a range image, both representations providing close to real-time performance. All the algorithms are tested on several hand labeled data sets using two novel metrics for segmentation evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional slices of robot singularity loci contain, in general, cusps. This kind of points are important because their presence indicates the possibility of planning assembly-changing motions that do not meet any singularity. The critical points where the number of cusps changes, as the slice is swept, permit one to decompose a singularity locus into domains where the obtained slices share common topological properties. In this paper, it is shown how Catastrophe Theory provides a solid framework to classify these critical points up to certain types of equivalence giving precise local models to describe them. It is also shown how only three possible types of these critical points exist for generic robots. The presented results are exemplified on a serial 3R robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper analyses and compares two passivity-based approaches that allow to include a-priori knowledge on the dynamic range of the human operator and/or the environment. This can lead to less conservative teleoperation systems compared to systems designed to be purely passive or absolutely stable. The first approach under investigation is a method where the absolute stability is analysed of a teleoperation system augmented with shunt impedances in series and/or parallel with the teleoperation system. It is shown that the traditional interpretation of the use of shunt impedances is not valid and a more accurate description of how to use this method is presented. The second approach under investigation is the bounded environment (operator) method. It is shown that the original idea to restrict the analysis to the so-called worst-case scenarios of a pure mass and a pure stiffness as environment can be too simplistic. Illustrative examples with mass-spring-damper systems fixed to the ground and floating objects as environments are made to demonstrate this in detail. In conclusion, this paper shows that embedding environment knowledge into the controller analysis/design is not straightforward and further research should be dedicated to determine which bounds should be used to obtain practically stable systems for different applications.",

Using this drive method, the enucleation process was conducted by dual-arm MMT. Permanent magnets are used to supply the driving power to the MMT allowing sufficient positioning accuracy to cut oocytes precisely. The nucleus was cut within 10s, and the removed area was less than 25% of the original oocyte.",

We previously proposed a method to fabricate and assemble the microstructures within a microfluidic channel. Micro objects with arbitrary shape are fabricated by illumination of patterned UV-ray through the mask. The arbitrary shape objects are made of the photo-crosslinkable resin on the microfluidic device under a microscope and these objects are manipulated by optical tweezers. In this paper, we report a method of hybrid-microstructures fabrication which improves the trapping efficiency by optical tweezers. The hybrid-microstructure is composed of the photo-crosslinkable resin and polystyrene beads. The manipulation speed of the hybrid-microstructure increases when the optical tweezers trap the polystyrene beads. This is because the trapping efficiency of spherical configuration is higher than that of planar shape. We fabricate this hybrid-microstructure and evaluate the trapping efficiency compared with normal microstructure.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, on-chip particle loading and dispensing modules are presented with their results for the automation of a single particle retrieving from a microfluidic channel. Our proposed microfluidic chip has several modules. Each one of them has important functions as (a) loading micro-particles singly to main microfluidic flow by the aid of magnetically driven microtools (MMT); (b) finding particle position in a microfluidic channel by micro-capacitance sensors; (c) adjusting micro-channel height locally by pneumatic pressure valve; (d) dispensing particles out from the microfluidic chip to incubation environment. Novelty of this paper is summarized as follows: (1) Multi-photoresist combination technique for the pneumatic pressure valve; (2) Automatic on-chip particle dispensing with micro-capacitance sensors. We showed feasibility of automatic dispensing of a single polystyrene bead (about 100 \u03bcm) from the chip to atmosphere. The performances of each module (hybrid structure, sensor and dispensing parts) were evaluated individually. We succeeded in determination of the movement of micro-particles (about 50-100 \u03bcm) with the velocity of over 6 mm/sec. by the micro-capacitance sensors. The advantages of the proposed system are that composed of the reusable drive system such as xy motorized stage, pumps and a disposable microfluidic chip.",

As MAVs are highly agile, it is not sufficient to directly use the visual input for position control at the framerates that can be achieved with small onboard computers. Our contributions in this work are twofold. First, we present a solution to overcome the issue of having a low frequent onboard visual pose update versus the high agility of an MAV. This is solved by filtering visual information with inputs from inertial sensors. Second, as our system is based on monocular vision, we present a solution to estimate the metric visual scale aid of an air pressure sensor. All computation is running onboard and is tightly integrated on the MAV to avoid jitter and latencies. This framework enables stable flights indoors and outdoors even under windy conditions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an online generation method of a torso height trajectory as a part of walking pattern generation. Torso height trajectories should be designed carefully in order to meet the constraints that are given by the existence of the inverse kinematics solution and limitations of the leg joint angle velocity. Limitations of the height in the future are evaluated and taken into consideration for deciding the height of the torso at a moment. In this manner a trajectory that satisfies the limitations and given maximum acceleration and velocity is generated. The proposed method is implemented as a part of online walking control system of full-size Humanoid HRP-2. Its performance is confirmed through the pattern generation in the walking control system.",

The GFO problem is cast in a convex optimization problem, considering also torque joint constraints. The proposed formulation allows to simplify the computational complexity of the problem by dynamically reducing the number of active torque constraints. Moreover, differently from other approaches, it does not require the evaluation of a new initial point at the beginning of each iteration. The effectiveness and the performance of the proposed method have been tested in a simulation case study where the hand manipulates a load with time-varying mass.",

We use quintic B\u00e9zier splines to specify position and orientation of the holonomic robot for every point in time. To fully exploit the capabilities of the holonomic robot we propose a novel path representation. It allows for continuous variation of path shapes in the spectrum between straight-line paths with turns on the spot and smooth paths with independent rotations and translations. Using this representation our method optimizes trajectories according to a user-defined cost function, considering the constraints of the platform. This way, it generates fast and efficient trajectories in an anytime fashion. The experiments carried out on an industrial robot show that our approach generates highly efficient and smooth motion trajectories that can be tracked with high precision and predictability. Furthermore, the system operates in real-world environments containing unmapped obstacles and narrow passages.",

One way to assist drivers is to provide a set of predefined trajectories that can be used repeatedly in the process. In recent years much effort has been directed to the design of control strategies and task planning as part of this solution. However, commercialization of such automatic schemes requires the installation of various sensing devices, computers and most of all a redesign of the machine itself, which is currently undesired by manufacturers. Here we present an approach of implementing predefined trajectories in an open-loop fashion, which avoids the complexity of sensor and computer integration. The experimental results are carried out on a commercial hydraulic crane to demonstrate that this solution is feasible in practice.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the Reflexxes Motion Libraries and describes, how they open doors for next generation robot motion controllers. When robots become capable to perform sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motions, there is no predefined path anymore, and motions have to be calculated on-line, that is, during the motion. The Reflexxes Motion Libraries calculate jerk-limited motions within one control cycle only (typically 1ms or less). This way, robots can instantaneously react to unforeseen sensor events, which opens the door to a huge number of new robot capabilities and fundamentally new motion control features. For instance: unforeseen switchings of coordinate frames, unforeseen switchings of control state spaces, deterministic and instantaneous reactions to sensor signals, safe and stable reactions to sensor failures, simple visual servo control, and stable switched-system control. All these features are important for the execution of sensor-based robot motions and to realize new applications as will be outlined in this paper.",

In this framework, the ROBOCAST system is an optically controlled multi-robot chain aimed at enhancing the accuracy of surgical probe insertion during keyhole neurosurgery procedures. The system is composed by three robots, connected as a multiple kinematic chain (serial, parallel and linear) totaling 13 degrees of freedom (DoFs) and is it is used to automatically align the probe onto the desired trajectory. This paper presents an iterative approach for aligning the surgical probe with the planned target pose, reducing both the translation and the rotation errors. An experimental protocol was designed, in order to assess the system performances in terms of residual targeting errors and convergence ratio. The proposed targeting procedures allows obtaining (0.06 \u00b1 0.02) mm and (0.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10-3 rad as residual median errors, thus satisfying the operational requirements (1 mm). The performances proved to be independent upon the robots calibration accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are compact and have high force-to-weight ratios, making them strong candidates to actuate robots, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. To optimize speed and energy consumption, SMA actuators have been embedded in an NxN vascular network that can deliver electric and thermofluidic energy to the each actuator. The scalable architecture of the vascular network allows for 2N control devices (valves, transistors) to be shared amongst N2 actuators, so that as the number of actuators increases, the number of required control devices scales at a smaller rate. This Network Array Architecture (NAA) allows for each actuator to be controlled individually or in discrete subarrays. However, not all combinations of actuators can be activated simultaneously; therefore in general, a sequence of control commands will be need to be executed in order to achieve the desired actuation. By treating each actuator as having a binary state, the combined states of the actuator array can be represented by graph theory, where states are nodes and the transitions between states are graph edges. By properly weighting the costs of the transitions, graph search techniques can be used to find optimal sets of control commands for desired state changes. This paper formulates the control of NAA actuators systems as a graph theory problem, and characterizes the ability of search algorithms to optimize a weighted combination of speed and energy usage, while minimizing computational cost.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The design of locally optimal fault-tolerant manipulators has been previously addressed via adding constraints on the bases of a desired null space to the design constraints of the manipulators. Then by algebraic or numeric solution of the design equations, the optimal Jacobian matrix is obtained. In this study, an optimal fault-tolerant Jacobian matrix generator is introduced from geometric properties instead of the null space properties. The proposed generator provides equally fault-tolerant Jacobian matrices in R3 that are optimally fault tolerant for one or two locked joint failures. It is shown that the proposed optimal Jacobian matrices are directly obtained via regular pyramids. The geometric approach and zonotopes are used as a novel tool for determining relative manipulability in the context of fault-tolerant robotics and for bringing geometric insight into the design of optimal fault-tolerant manipulators.",

The leg angle of a hopping robot is an example of an impact control because it can influence when the impact occurs and the direction of the impulse. This paper provides a method for computing an explicit expression for the first derivative of a cost function encoding a desired trajectory. The first derivative can be used with standard optimization algorithms to find the optimal impact controls for motion planning of hybrid dynamical systems with impacts. The resulting derivation is implemented for a simplified model of a dynamic climbing robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Worldwide, there has been increasing interest in the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to drastically change the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation. Representative missions include marine habitat mapping, pipeline inspection, and archaeological surveying. Central to the operation of some classes of AUVs is the availability of good underwater positioning systems to localize one or more vehicles simultaneously based on information received on-board a support ship or a set of autonomous surface vehicles. In an interesting operational scenario the AUV is equipped with an acoustic pinger and the set of surface vehicles carry a network of acoustic receivers that measure the ranges between the emitter and each of the receivers. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network at the ocean surface that will maximize the range-related information available for underwater target positioning. It is assumed that the range measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Furthermore, we also assume that an initial estimate of the target position is available, albeit with uncertainty. The Fisher Information Matrix and the maximization of its determinant are used to determine the sensor configuration that yields the most accurate \u201cexpected\u201d positioning of the target, the position of which is expressed by a probabilistic distribution. It is shown that the optimal configuration lends itself to an interesting geometrical interpretation and that the \u201cspreading\u201d of the sensor configuration depends explicitly on the intensity of the range measurement noise, the probabilistic distribution that defines the target position, and the target depth. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.",

        "abstract": "Up to now, there are different kinds of robot-assisted ultrasound diagnostic systems proposed in the last decade. However, the compensation of the ultrasound probe position according to the patient movement is still one of the most important and useful functions required for those systems. For this purpose, in this research, we aim at developing an automated diagnostic system for the measurement of the wave intensity which is usually measured at the common carotid artery. In particular, in this paper, we focus on proposing a robust visual servoing method for tracking out-of-plane motion for a robot-assisted medical ultrasound diagnostic system by using a conventional 2D probe. A robotic device which manipulates the ultrasound probe firstly scans a small area around the target position and records several B-mode images at a regular interval. In order to track the out-of-plane motion, an inter-frame block matching method has been proposed and implemented on the Waseda-Tokyo Women's Medical-Aloka Blood Flow Measurement System No. 2 Refined (WTA-2R). A set of experiments was proposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. From the experimental results, we could confirm its robustness while doing the task with real human tissues.",

Our system relies on a relational database infrastructure to achieve a high degree of flexibility in the type of analyses it can support. We discuss the main steps required for going from raw data to numerical estimates describing the performance of the perception system, including the generation of ground truth information and the safe speed metric we found to be most useful for comparing the perception system's outputs to the ground truth data.

A new bundle adjustment (BA) algorithm using the proposed parallax angle parametrization is developed and shown to be more reliable as compared with existing BA algorithms that use Euclidean XYZ or inverse depth parametrizations. A new map joining algorithm that allows combining a sequence of local maps generated using BA with the proposed parametrization, that avoids the large computational cost of a global BA, and can automatically optimize the relative scales of the local maps without any loss of information, is also presented. Extensive simulations and a publicly available large-scale real dataset with centimeter accuracy ground truth are used to demonstrate the accuracy and consistency of the BA and map joining algorithms using the new parametrization. Especially, since the relative scales are optimized automatically in the proposed BA and map joining algorithms, there is no need to compute any relative scales even for a loop more than 1km.",

The device presented is a compliant moving table having 6 degrees of freedom (dof) among which three are actuated: z axis translation having a stroke of a few hundreds of microns, and \u03b8x and \u03b8y tilt angles up to about 15\u00b0. The structure is immersed in a liquid and the actuation principle is based on fluidic parameters (pressure and volume). A model to calculate the stiffness of the system is presented and validated by experimental measurements. Some issues inherent to this type of actuation are also addressed. The presented device is an illustration of a promising solution for microrobotic actuation using capillary effects in a liquid media.",

At the core of our approach are parametrized shape models for clothing articles. Each clothing category has its own shape model, and the variety in shapes for a given category is achieved through variation of the parameters. We present an efficient algorithm to find the parameters that provide the best fit when given an image of a clothing article. The models are such that, once the parameters have been fit, they provide a basic parse of the clothing article, allowing it to be followed by autonomous folding from category level specifications of fold sequences. Our approach is also able to recover the configuration of a clothing article when folds are being introduced-an important feature towards closing the perception-action loop. Additionally, our approach provides a reliable method of shape-based classification, simply by examining which model yields the best fit. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large set of clothing articles. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end system, which starts from an unknown spread-out clothing article, performs a parametrized model fit, then follows a category-level (rather than article specific) set of folding instructions, closing the loop with perceptual feedback by re-fitting between folds.",

The proposed method combines the benefits of programming by human demonstration for teaching appropriate grasps with those of automatic 3D shape segmentation for object recognition and semantic modeling. The work is motivated by important studies on human manipulation suggesting that when an object is perceived for grasping it is first parsed in its constituent parts. Following these findings we present a manipulation planning system capable of grasping objects by their parts which learns new tasks from human demonstration. The central advantage over previous approaches is the use of a topological method for shape segmentation enabling both object retrieval and part-based grasp planning according to the affordances of an object. Manipulation tasks are demonstrated in a virtual reality environment using a data glove. After the learning phase, each task is planned and executed in a robot environment that is able to generalize to similar, but previously unknown, objects",

We describe two metrics which measure the maximum and sum, respectively, of the forces that need to be applied at the contacts involved in a grasp, in order to exert some given unit wrench on the grasped object. For a given object P of complexity O(n) and a pure force T, we describe efficient algorithms which compute all combinations of m features (edges of polygons or facets of polyhedra) that admit grasps capable of exerting T such that the value of our metric is greater than some threshold. In particular, we show that if P is a polygon, all pairs of edges that admit frictionless two-finger grasps capable of exerting T can be computed in O(n log2 n+K) time, where K is the number of pairs of edges in the output. Also, all two-finger grasps with friction of a polyhedral object can be computed in O(n3/2+\u03b5 + K') time and all frictionless three-finger grasps of a polyhedron can be computed in O(n5/2+\u03b5 + K') time, where K0 is the number of pairs or triples of facets that satisfy some slightly weaker condition and \u03b5 is some arbitrarily small, positive constant.",

This paper shows that connecting a haptic interface to a discrete time virtual environment through a wave variable controller can inject energy into the haptic feedback loop and thus jeopardize the stability of the haptic interaction. The connection involves a one step computational delay when the virtual environment is not known prior to starting the interaction. Using the Jury-Marden stability criterion, the paper investigates the effect of this computational delay on the stability of wave variable control of haptic interaction with a virtual wall. It also develops a time domain passivity analysis to compute the energy injected in the wave variable transformation by the computational delay. Then, it proposes an algorithm for dissipating the extra energy and restoring the passivity of the wave variable transformation. The paper concludes with the experimental validation of the energy dissipating algorithm.",

Teleoperation in task space R3 \u00d7 SO (3) presents some distinctive features different from its joint-space counterpart, i.e., SO (3) is non-convex and bears quite different structure from Euclidean space Rn. Through advisable parametrization of the error attitude matrix between master and slave robots, we propose a new transpose Jacobian control algorithm for bilateral teleoperators with communication time delays. Passivity of the closed-loop teleoperator system is ensured by injecting additional task space dissipation both at the master and the slave sides to accommodate the detrimental effects of the time delay. Using Lyapunov stability tool and Schwarz inequality, we show passivity of the closed-loop teleoperator system and illustrate the tracking and force-reflecting performance of the teleoperator. Simulation study on a master-slave teleoperator composed of two six-DOF manipulators is performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed control approach.",

The proposed method is not hindered by complexity of the computation because the proposed controller executes no contact force planning, and uses only a compact feedback for implementation. It is also robust to errors caused by the environment or internal motion. We prove the stability of the system according to the Lyapunov's direct method.

        "abstract": "As a step towards enabling snake robots to move in unstructured environments, this paper considers control strategies where environment adaptation is combined with directional control of snake robot locomotion. The first contribution of the paper is a general framework for motion control of snake robots, which allows the motion to be specified in terms of a body wave component, an environment adaptation component, and a heading control component. As a second contribution, we employ the controller framework to propose a control law for straight line path following control of snake robots in environments with obstacles. The paper presents simulation results where the path following controller is combined with a waypoint guidance strategy in order to steer the snake robot between waypoints in an obstacle environment.",

        "abstract": "An autonomous aircraft capable of utilising soaring flight in a dynamic wind field could considerably extend flight duration by limiting the use of on-board energy for propulsion. While soaring flight is relatively well understood for known wind, an autonomous soaring aircraft would have to generate paths based only on local observations of the wind made during the flight. This paper presents a method to simultaneously map and utilise a wind field using Gaussian process regression to generate a spatio-temporal map of the wind, and a path planning and dynamic target assignment algorithm to generate energy-gain paths from the current wind estimate. The planning architecture is tested in simulation for dynamic wind fields and shows consistent energy gain through exploration and exploitation of the wind environment.",

Due to their low surge speed, however, gliders are strongly affected by ocean currents, making path planning a crucial tool for this type of vehicles. In this work, we present a novel path planning algorithm for gliders based on iterative optimization that shows promising results in realistic simulations. This method reflects accurately the vehicle operation pattern and exhibits a better performance when compared with alternative approaches that are compared in this paper.",

The reason is that they produce a sparse graph of landmark estimates and their probabilistic relations, which is of little value to find collision free paths for navigation. In contrast, we argue in this paper that Pose SLAM graphs can be directly used as belief roadmaps. We present a method that devises optimal navigation strategies by searching for the path in the pose graph with lowest accumulated robot pose uncertainty, independently of the map reference frame. The method shows improved navigation results when compared to shortest paths both over synthetic data and real datasets.",

A novel acceleration-based approach combined with gyroscope data is developed to achieve a better heading estimation.

In this paper, a high sampling rate of visual feedback is achieved by distributed computation on a cloud image processing platform. For target tracking with a networked visual servo control system, a switching control law considering the varying feedback delay caused by image processing and data transmission is applied to improve the control performance. A sending rate scheduling strategy aiming at saving the network load is proposed based on the tracking error. Experiments on a 7 degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator are carried out to validate the proposed approach. The proposed approach shows a similar control performance as a system without sending rate scheduling, however, beneficially with largely reduced network load.",

The changing environment is modeled as an accumulation function which grows in areas that are not within range of the robot, and decreases in areas that are within range of the robot. The robot must continually move through the environment to prevent the accumulation of any area from growing unbounded. We consider the case in which a predefined path is given for the robot, and we focus on controlling the robot's speed along the path. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions on the speed controller of the robot for keeping the accumulation function bounded. We then search among the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a finite set of basis functions.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a path planning algorithm and a velocity control algorithm for underwater gliders to persistently monitor a patch of ocean. The algorithms address a pressing need among ocean scientists to collect high-value data for studying ocean events of scientific and environmental interest, such as the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. The path planner optimizes a cost function that blends two competing factors: it maximizes the information value of the path, while minimizing the deviation from the path due to ocean currents. The speed control algorithm then optimizes the speed along the planned path so that higher resolution samples are collected in areas of higher information value. The resulting paths are closed circuits that can be repeatedly traversed to collect long term ocean data in dynamic environments. The algorithms were tested during sea trials on an underwater glider operating off the coast of southern California over the course of several weeks. The results show significant improvements in data resolution and path reliability compared to a sampling path that is typically used in the region.",

Introduced is a method to adapt the observation model of a particle filter, to identify partial and full occlusions of a person, to determine the amount of occlusion behind an obstacle, and the occluding obstacle itself. This is done by tracing rays from positions near the person to the sensor and determining whether the ray hits an obstacle. The laser range data is represented using a voxel grid, which facilitates efficient retrieval and data reduction. As our experiments show, our proposed tracking approach is able to reliably keep track of a person in real-time, even when only partially visible, when moving in uneven terrain, or when the person passes closely another person of different size.",

        "abstract": "There are wafer fabrication processes in cluster tools that require revisiting. It is shown that swapping is efficient in operating a dual-arm cluster tool. For dual-arm cluster tools with wafer revisiting, if a swap strategy is applied, it forms a three wafer periodical process with three wafers completed in each period. Such a period contains three cycles in a revisiting process and another three cycles in non-revisiting process. Hence, analysis and scheduling of dual-arm cluster tools with wafer revisiting become very complicated. In this work, a Petri net model is developed to describe the operations of such tools. Based on it, it is found that if a swap strategy is applied to a dual-arm cluster tool with wafer revisiting, it is always in a transient state. A systematic method is presented to analyze its performance.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the desire to achieve fast payload transportation as well as sufficient swing suppression, a novel phase plane based motion planning method is proposed for underactuated overhead cranes. Specifically, the variation law of the underactuated system states in the phase plane is firstly derived via mathematical analysis for the phase portraits. Based on this, an analytical three-segment acceleration trajectory (namely, a trapezoid velocity trajectory) with the coupling behavior being taken into consideration is obtained under actual crane control constraints. To deal with the jerk (discontinuity) problem, we then present two modified acceleration trajectories by introducing some transition stages and performing some rigorous analysis. Moreover, the trajectories generated by the proposed method can evaluate the maximum payload swing and the arrival time for a given transportation task in advance, which provides essential control indexes for crane operation. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed trajectory planning method.",

Most previous work on tracking assumes simple motion models, and consequently tracking typically fails in a variety of situations. Our insight is that incorporating physics models of object behaviour improves tracking performance in these cases. In particular it allows us to handle tracking in the face of rigid body interactions where there is also occlusion and fast object motion. We show how to incorporate rigid body physics simulation into a particle filter. We present two methods for this based on pose and force noise. The improvements are tested on four videos of a robot pushing an object, and results indicate that our approach performs considerably better than a plain particle filter tracker, with the force noise method producing the best results over the range of test videos.",

Excavation experiments are successfully conducted using the excavator alone and at lighter weights. We show that the excavator can begin boring from a launcher, and in case of excavator of 1/6 of its own weight, it successfully excavates at the same depth as in its own weight. This demonstrates that this novel excavator is expected to accomplish future missions on other planets and the moon.",

        "abstract": "We present a new sampling-based method for planning optimal, collision-free, curvature-constrained paths for nonholonomic robots to visit multiple goals in any order. Rather than sampling configurations as in standard sampling based planners, we construct a roadmap by sampling circles of constant curvature and then generating feasible transitions between the sampled circles. We provide a closed-form formula for connecting the sampled circles in 2D and generalize the approach to 3D workspaces. We then formulate the multi goal planning problem as finding a minimum directed Steiner tree over the roadmap. Since optimally solving the multi-goal planning problem requires exponential time, we propose greedy heuristics to efficiently compute a path that visits multiple goals. We apply the planner in the context of medical needle steering where the needle tip must reach multiple goals in soft tissue, a common requirement for clinical procedures such as biopsies, drug delivery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. We demonstrate that our multi-goal planner significantly decreases tissue that must be cut when compared to sequential execution of single-goal plans.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a search-based motion planning algorithm for manipulation that handles the high dimensionality of the problem and minimizes the limitations associated with employing a strict set of pre-defined actions. Our approach employs a set of adaptive motion primitives comprised of static motions with variable dimensionality and on-the-fly motions generated by two analytical solvers. This method results in a slimmer, multi-dimensional lattice and offers the ability to satisfy goal constraints with precision. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator to perform experiments on a real mobile manipulation platform (Willow Garage's PR2). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the planner in efficiently navigating cluttered spaces; the method generates consistent, low-cost motion trajectories, and guarantees the search is complete with bounds on the suboptimality of the solution.",

        "abstract": "Faced with the challenge of making running speed robots, improved light weight actuation is a primary concern. Pneumatic Air Muscle (PAM) has not been advanced significantly since their conception and some new features are needed to meet compact bi-pedal robots. Driven by air pressure, all PAMs require air control valves that ideally are light weight, low power and provide high flow rates for rapid contract-relax cycling. PAMs require air compressors and air reservoirs. These are normally very heavy and very bulky. A new approach to both the PAM and air valves is presented in this paper with a view to enabling the design of compact, lightweight and dynamic robots. Similarly a totally new way of generating pneumatic pressure is presented based on heat engine methods. The improvements are described and the advantages, method of operation and method of implementation in a bi-pedal robot are discussed. Initial analysis is presented for the actuation force characteristic, isometric and isotonic behaviors of the muscles and flow rate for the valves. The heat engine based actuator is explained covering the design choices and the early results of a working prototype is described. The heat engine work capacity and efficiency is contrasted to that of standard air compression.",

        "abstract": "Heavy object manipulation by wheeled mobile manipulators may lead to serious consequences such as postural instability, and this necessitates dynamically stable planning based on systematic analysis to better predict and eliminate the possibility of toppling down. In the present study, stable motion planning is investigated for wheeled mobile manipulators during heavy object manipulation tasks. It is assumed that the initial and final poses of a heavy payload are specified. Based on these known postures of the payload two proper configurations for robotic system is defined. Then, between these two initial and final poses, appropriate trajectories for multiple robotic arms relative to the moving base are planned without considering the postural stability of the system. Next, motion of the moving base is planned so that the stability of the overall system is guaranteed while its predetermined initial and final positions and velocities are fulfilled. To this end, the problem of stable planning is solved as an optimization problem. A proper cost function is considered, to be minimized, which is a measure of the control effort to be used for the platform motion. Moreover, using the new dynamic postural Moment-Height Stability (MHS) measure, a constraint denoting the system dynamic stability is derived and satisfied. The proposed planning approach is applied to move a heavy object with a wheeled robotic system that consists of two manipulators, where the obtained results reveal a stable optimal motion besides satisfaction of various practical aspects.",

        "abstract": "This paper identifies and fills the probably last two missing items in minimal pose estimation algorithms using points and lines. Pose estimation refers to the problem of recovering the pose of a calibrated camera given known features (points or lines) in the world and their projections on the image. There are four minimal configurations using point and line features: 3 points, 2 points and 1 line, 1 point and 2 lines, 3 lines. The first and the last scenarios that depend solely on either points or lines have been studied a few decades earlier. However the mixed scenarios, which are more common in practice, have not been solved yet. In this paper we show that it is indeed possible to develop a general technique that can solve all four scenarios using the same approach and that the solutions involve computing the roots of either a 4th degree or an 8th degree equation. The centerpiece of our method is a simple and generic method that uses collinearity and coplanarity constraints for solving the pose. In addition to validating the performance of these algorithms in simulations, we also show a compelling application for geo-localization using image sequences and coarse (plane-based) 3D models of GPS-challenged urban canyons.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Postural control is a difficult problem for bipedal robots. Even in robots restricted to the sagittal plane, the system must react to falling forward or backward to stabilize itself during walking, standing, and during initiation and termination of walking. Most robots rely mainly on proprioceptive information such as foot pressure sensors and joint angle sensors for balance. By contrast, humans use a variety of sensory sources, including visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sources to adapt fluidly to varying conditions. These sensory inputs combine to control posture but are \"reweighted\" in response to changing conditions such as floor motion, visual scene motion, and degradation in vestibular sensitivity. Based on models of sensory reweighting in humans, we implement a sensory reweighting scheme in a bipedal robot using an adaptive Kalman filter. The adaptive filter uses an online estimate of the noise variance to adjust the Kalman gain depending on time-varying noise conditions. Thus, the robot automatically downweight sensory channels with unreliable data.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for precise robot positioning and path tracking, performed by industrial robots over large surfaces of arbitrary size, shape and orientation. The methodology is based on a vision-based, calibration-free robot control method known as camera-space manipulation. The path, defined and stored in a CAD file, is later adapted to the curved, work-surface by using a mapping procedure. When applied to large surfaces, the precision of the positioning and path-tracking maneuvers depends on several factors like the resolution of the cameras per unit physical space and the mapping procedure, which may introduce distortion specially in the case of non-developable surfaces. In order to reduce the influence of camera-resolution, this paper presents two alternatives: the use of multiple cameras and the application of cameras mounted over non-expensive, sensorless pan/tilt units. In the case of the distortion produced by the mapping procedure, the paper discusses several options like a modified geodesic mapping and virtual projection. The proposed techniques were tested multiple times over flat and deformed surfaces, by using a large work-envelope, industrial robot.",

        "abstract": "Visual tracking of an object can provide a powerful source of feedback information during complex robotic manipulation operations, especially those in which there may be uncertainty about which new object pose may result from a planned manipulative action. At the same time, robotic manipulation can provide a challenging environment for visual tracking, with occlusions of the object by other objects or by the robot itself, and sudden changes in object pose that may be accompanied by motion blur. Recursive filtering techniques use motion models for predictor-corrector tracking, but the simple models typically used often fail to adequately predict the complex motions of manipulated objects. We show how statistical machine learning techniques can be used to train sophisticated motion predictors, which incorporate additional information by being conditioned on the planned manipulative action being executed. We then show how these learned predictors can be used to propagate the particles of a particle filter from one predictor-corrector step to the next, enabling a visual tracking algorithm to maintain plausible hypotheses about the location of an object, even during severe occlusion and other difficult conditions. We demonstrate the approach in the context of robotic push manipulation, where a 5-axis robot arm equipped with a rigid finger applies a series of pushes to an object, while it is tracked by a vision algorithm using a single camera.",

The system consists of two modules : \"motion symbol tree\" and \"motion symbol graph\", Human demonstrator motion patterns are stored as motion symbols, which abstract the motion data by using Hidden Markov Models. The stored motion patterns are organized into a hierarchical tree structure, which represents the similarity among the motion patterns and provides abstracted motion patterns. The formed hierarchical structure is the motion symbol tree. Concatenated sequences of motion patterns are stochastically represented as transitions between the motion patterns by using an Ngram Model, and the causality among the human behaviors are extracted. This structure is the motion symbol graph. The behavioral hierarchy and transition model make it possible to predict human behaviors during observation and to generate sequences of motion patterns automatically while maintaining a natural motion stream, as if the system is a \"crystal ball\" to reflect future behaviors. The experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework on a large scale motion data.",

As one solution of these problems, we propose \"soft handling probe\" in this paper. The probe has an electrode as a microheater. The thermoresponsive polymer can be gelled when a current is applied to the electrode in the thermoresponsive polymer solution. The electrode was fabricated by cupper wire and sputtering of gold on the probe. Thermal gelation of the thermoresponsive polymer was realized at the fabricated probe tip. The manipulation of micro objects and assembly of three dimensional structures were demonstrated by the probe. The handling of yeast cell and liposome were also realized by the probe. It is expected that the probe can realize the soft handling by the generated thermal gel and realize the precise positioning by reducing the effect of surface force.",

In the context of both a new controller structure for bounding with a body joint and existing bounding controllers for the rigid trunk, we use optimization methods to identify the highest performance gait parameters and establish that the spinal joint allows increased forward speeds and hopping heights.",

        "abstract": "A robust robot perception system intended to enable object manipulation needs to be able to accurately identify objects and their pose at high speeds. Since objects vary considerably in surface properties, rigidity and articulation, no single detector or object estimation method has been shown to provide reliable detection across object types to date. This indicates the need for an architecture that is able to quickly swap detectors, pose estimators, and filters, or to run them in parallel or serial and combine their results, preferably without any code modifications at all. In this paper, we present our implementation of such an infrastructure, ReIn (REcognition INfrastructure), to answer these needs. ReIn is able to combine a multitude of 2D/3D object recognition and pose estimation techniques in parallel as dynamically loadable plugins. It also provides an extremely efficient data passing architecture, and offers the possibility to change the parameters and initial settings of these techniques during their execution. In the course of this work we introduce two new classifiers designed for robot perception needs: BiGGPy (Binarized Gradient Grid Pyramids) for scalable 2D classification and VFH (Viewpoint Feature Histograms) for 3D classification and pose. We then show how these two classifiers can be easily combined using ReIn to solve object recognition and pose identification problems.",

The main objectives are to allow the achievement of a variety of missions without an explicit writing of control schemes by the developer, and the possibility to augment the robot capacities without any major rewriting. The proposed architecture relies on a partition of the decisional layer in separate resources, each one managed by a specific agent. The mechanisms that guarantee the good use of each resource and manage the network of agent into a coherent system are depicted, and illustrated in the case of an autonomous navigation mission.",

However, the tasking of these agents to most efficiently build the map is a problem that has seen less attention. Unfamiliar, highly cluttered environments can confound exploration strategies that rely solely on occupancy grid frontier identification or even semantic classification methods keyed on geometric features. To reason about partial maps of novel, highly cluttered locations, hypotheses about significant structure in the disposition of free space may be used to guide exploration task assignment. A parsing of map data into places with semantic significance to the exploration task provides a foundation from which one may infer an efficient exploration strategy.",

The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.",

        "abstract": "Computing globally optimal motion plans requires exploring the configuration space to identify reachable free space regions as well as refining understanding of already explored regions to find better paths. We present the rapidly-exploring roadmap (RRM), a new method for single-query optimal motion planning that allows the user to explicitly consider the trade-off between exploration and refinement. RRM initially explores the configuration space like a rapidly exploring random tree (RRT). Once a path is found, RRM uses a user-specified parameter to weigh whether to explore further or to refine the explored space by adding edges to the current roadmap to find higher quality paths in the explored space. Unlike prior methods, RRM does not focus solely on exploration or refine prematurely. We demonstrate the performance of RRM and the trade-off between exploration and refinement using two examples, a point robot moving in a plane and a concentric tube robot capable of following curved trajectories inside patient anatomy for minimally invasive medical procedures.",

We present in this paper a systematic approach for generating robust motion control strategies to satisfy high level specifications of safety, target attainability, and invariance, under unknown but bounded, continuous disturbances. The motion planning task is decomposed into the two sub-problems of finite horizon reach with avoid and infinite horizon invariance. The set of states for which each of the sub-problems is robustly feasible is computed via iterative reachability calculations under a differential game framework. We discuss how the results of this computation can be used to inform selections of control inputs based upon state measurements at run-time and provide an algorithm for implementing the corresponding feedback control policies. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental application of this method to the control of an autonomous helicopter in tracking a moving ground vehicle.",

While this model can identify single leg strategies for balance control, it does not consider the double support that is common to bipedal locomotion, indicating that current strategies do not fully exploit the theoretical potential of balance control in bipedal systems. Here we extend the linear inverted pendulum model to a bipedal system which includes double support dynamics, and derive a reactive balance controller based on foot placement and double stance length. We show that this controller enables the model to stand and walk at user-defined target speeds, to transition between these behaviors by acceleration and deceleration, and to react to intermittent disturbances and compensate for permanent ones, as long as they are compatible with the swing leg dynamics placing the feet. Finally, we discuss how the versatility of this balance controller depends on including double support and suggest further steps to improve dynamic balance control in bipedal systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the first prototype of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible piezoelectric actuated robot integrated with a high-resolution fiber optic sensor for prostate brachytherapy with real-time in situ needle steering capability in 3T MRI. The 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot consists of a modular 3-DOF needle driver with fiducial tracking frame and a 3-DOF actuated Cartesian stage. The needle driver provides needle cannula rotation and translation (2-DOF) and stylet translation (1-DOF). The driver mimics the manual physician gesture by two point grasping. To render proprioception associated with prostate interventions, a Fabry Perot interferometer based fiber optic strain sensor is designed to provide high-resolution axial needle insertion force measurement and is robust to large range of temperature variation. The paper explains the robot mechanism, controller design, optical modeling and opto-mechanical design of the force sensor. MRI compatibility of the robot is evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average signal noise ratio (SNR) loss is limited to 2% during actuator motion. A dynamic needle insertion is performed and bevel tip needle steering capability is demonstrated under continuous real-time MRI guidance, both with no visually identifiable interference during robot motion. Fiber optic sensor calibration validates the theoretical modeling with satisfactory sensing range and resolution for prostate intervention.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel color tracking model for image registration that exploits directly the color information provided by standard color cameras. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, the color tracking model is designed to handle both global and local illumination changes within a robust framework that also rejects outliers such as occluding objects, shadows, etc. In order to demonstrate the proposed approach a planar template tracking algorithm is used, however, the approach is also valid for a general class of direct tracking algorithms. In particular, the objective function is defined to be minimized directly in the CFA (color filter array) space instead of the common RGB space. It will be shown that this not only takes advantage of the discernibility of color measurements but also drastically improves the efficiency of the vision processing pipeline and ultimately improves real-time performance. A robust global illumination model is then combined with a robust M-estimation technique that is shown to handle outliers as well as global and local illumination changes. Results from synthetic and real sequences are presented to demonstrate the proposed concept.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a control strategy using real-time feedback combined with feasible path planning to manipulate a type of microorganism, Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis), as a micro-bio-robot using artificial magnetotaxis. Artificially magnetotactic T. pyriformis cells were created by the internalization of iron oxide nano particles. Following the magnetization of the internalized particles, the cells become controllable using an external time-varying magnetic field. The behavior of artificially magnetotactic T. pyriformis under a magnetic field has been investigated in a manual control experiment. A feasible path planner called rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and a feedback control scheme are implemented to guide the cell to a desired position and orientation. Since the motion of T. pyriformis is nonlinear like that of a car, combining the RRT and feedback control allows the cell to be controlled in 3-dimensional (x, y, \u00b8) space. In the results, real-time feedback control of T. pyriformis in 3-dimensional space demonstrated the potential of utilizing T. pyriformis as a micro-bio-robot for microscale tasks.",

C4 achieves 20 fps speed and state-of-the-art detection accuracy, using only one processing thread without resorting to special hardwares like GPU. Real-time accurate human detection is made possible by two contributions. First, we show that contour is exactly what we should capture and signs of comparisons among neighboring pixels are the key information to capture contours. Second, we show that the CENTRIST visual descriptor is particularly suitable for human detection, because it encodes the sign information and can implicitly represent the global contour. When CENTRIST and linear classifier are used, we propose a computational method that does not need to explicitly generate feature vectors. It involves no image pre-processing or feature vector normalization, and only requires O(1) steps to test an image patch. C4 is also friendly to further hardware acceleration. In a robot with embedded 1.2GHz CPU, we also achieved accurate and 20 fps high speed human detection.",

In case of stereo image processing results have to be available in time even if high computational costs occur. This paper addresses the problem of real-time image processing for motion planning and distance estimation based on stereo camera images. Ensuring hard real-time with complex algorithms on modern computer architectures is difficult to realize due to unpredictable execution times of algorithms with data dependent runtime. To solve this problem a scheduling scheme based on task pairs can be used to avoid an unpredicted state after a deadline violation. A new two level scheduler as extension of RTAI/Linux will be introduced. This new scheduling scheme allows to use AnyTime algorithms, which can provide results even if the task is not finished. A SURF algorithm used for stereo image processing was modified to match the AnyTime concept: First results are made available early and are improved over time. In case of a missed deadline the image processing task will not fail due to already provided results. Design considerations, implementation and results will be shown.",

All the monocular approaches, however, suffer from the lack of metric scale. In this paper, we present a solution to tackle this issue by adding an inertial sensor equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. In contrast to previous approaches, our solution is independent of the underlying vision algorithm which estimates the camera poses. As a direct consequence, the algorithm presented here operates at a constant computational complexity in real time. We treat the visual framework as a black box and thus the approach is modular and widely applicable to existing monocular solutions. It can be used with any pose estimation algorithm such as visual odometry, visual SLAM, monocular or stereo setups or even GPS solutions with gravity and compass attitude estimation. In this paper, we show the thorough development of the metric state estimation based on an Extended Kalman Filter. Furthermore, even though we treat the visual framework as a black box, we show how to detect failures and estimate drifts in it. We implement our solution on a monocular vision pose estimation framework and show the results both in simulation and on real data.",

        "abstract": "Making changes of cells function by regulating the external mechanical environment is one of the major interests in the mechanobiology field. Based on extensive studies, force at nano-to-micro newton and geometric shape changes at nano to-micrometer are the physical stimuli that can be sensed by cells. It has been postulated that controllable cell responses can be produced by activating diversity of mechanosesory proteins through physical changes of force or shape. In this paper, a real-time machine vision algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency and robustness of the cell membranes strain calculation. The proposed adaptive image thresholding method with modified numerical implementation is able to apply on all the images captured in the deforming process to extract the deformed cell boundary in real-time. Based on the proposed method, the cell membrane strain is modeled and controlled to deform the cell into a predefined deformation. It enables biologists to study the biochemical changes within the cell by providing a controllable geometric changes. It also expects that a particular cell status or function could be produced by giving a proper deformation.",

To uniquely determine the spatial position and orientation of the cable driven parallel manipulator, the real-time optimization is conducted according to the principle of uniform tension in the six driving cables. Synchronized points and the \u201cjudge and wait\u201d mechanism ensure the continuity and synchrony of the trajectory tracking of the two parallel manipulators. The preadjustment of the micro parallel manipulator reduces the drastic dynamical coupling as a result of the fast movement of the micro manipulator. Besides, over-workspace avoidance procedure is introduced to restrict the micro parallel manipulator not to exceed it workspace. Experimental results validate the high precision of the macro-micro parallel manipulator system with supervisory controller and the motion prediction algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Mapping is important for mobile robots in unknown environments. However, existing work largely relies on long-range sensors such as expensive laser range finders and cameras. Little has been done for robots with only short-range sensors such as bumpers or wall sensors. In this paper, we fill in the gap and propose a method for real-time indoor mapping for blind robots, i.e. robots that have only short-range sensors. Several key problems for mapping are addressed in this paper: (1) generating map from a single robot's odometry and short-range sensor data, (2) combining and collating maps from multiple robots to generate a coherent bigger map, and (3) detecting loops in the map and performing loop closure. The method has been implemented on iRobot Create and tested in hallways of office buildings. Experimental results have shown that the system is robust to noisy odometry and obstacles along the walls.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for measuring the in-bucket payload volume on a dragline excavator for the purpose of estimating the material's bulk density in real-time. Knowledge of the payload's bulk density can provide feedback to mine planning and scheduling to improve blasting and therefore provide a more uniform bulk density across the excavation site. This allows a single optimal bucket size to be used for maximum overburden removal per dig and in turn reduce costs and emissions in dragline operation and maintenance. The proposed solution uses a range bearing laser to locate and scan full buckets between the lift and dump stages of the dragline cycle. The bucket is segmented from the scene using cluster analysis, and the pose of the bucket is calculated using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Payload points are identified using a known model and subsequently converted into a height grid for volume estimation. Results from both scaled and full scale implementations show that this method can achieve an accuracy of above 95%.",

The humanoid robot, WABIAN-2R, has achieved human-like walking with heel contact and toe off motions by using a human-like foot mechanism with a passive toe joint. The human-like foot enables a robot to turn by using slipping motion between the feet and the ground because it can switch ground contact conditions such as heel contact, sole contact and toe contact. To realize a slipping turn, we develop an attitude control. Verification of the proposed method is conducted through experiments with a biped humanoid robot WABIAN-2R. WABIAN-2R realized a quick turn by using slipping motion with both feet. We also confirmed that the energy consumption of a slipping turn is less than that of a stepping turn.",

We use a two-staged bottom up approach in which we first detect balls as circles and feed these measurements into a multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT). The novel circle detection scheme works in realistic scenes without tuning parameters or background assumptions. We extend the classical multi-hypothesis tracking with prior information about the expected trajectories, therefore limiting the number of hypotheses in the first place. Since the robot starts moving while the ball is still tracked, the cameras shake heavily. A 6-DOF inertial measurements unit (IMU) is integrated to compensate this motion. Using ground-truth from a marker based tracking system we evaluate the metrical accuracy of the motion compensation as well as the tracker's prediction accuracy while in motion.",

To obtain a more precise initial policy, a constrained dynamics model is used to generate the offline policy. A heteroscedastic sparse Gaussian process is applied for online calculation of the foot positioning policy. In order to make the generated policy to adapt with the full-body dynamics, a sample-efficient MAP-like updating method for the heteroscedastic sparse Gaussian process model is also proposed. Experiments on both simulation and a real full-body humanoid are developed to show the performance of the final foot positioning policy. With the help of proposed method, the full-body humanoid robot succeeded walking down an elastic deformable platform and several obvious compensation foot steps can be observed for the robot to retrieve its balance.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for collision avoidance for mobile robots that takes into account acceleration constraints. We discuss both the case of navigating a single robot among moving obstacles, and the case of multiple robots reciprocally avoiding collisions with each other while navigating a common workspace. Inspired by the concept of velocity obstacles [3], we introduce the acceleration-velocity obstacle (AVO) to let a robot avoid collisions with moving obstacles while obeying acceleration constraints. AVO characterizes the set of new velocities the robot can safely reach and adopt using proportional control of the acceleration. We extend this concept to reciprocal collision avoidance for multi-robot settings, by letting each robot take half of the responsibility of avoiding pairwise collisions. Our formulation guarantees collision-free navigation even as the robots act independently and simultaneously, without coordination. Our approach is designed for holonomic robots, but can also be applied to kinematically constrained non-holonomic robots such as cars. We have implemented our approach, and we show simulation results in challenging environments with large numbers of robots and obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Due to the unilateral driving property of cables, it has been mathematically proven that a 6-DOF single rigid-bodied cable-driven platform requires a minimum of 7 cables with positive tension to fully constrain it. However, force-closure analysis of open chains driven by cables is still an open question. For the case of an n-DOF open chain driven by cables, two important questions arise: (i) Are n+1 cables sufficient to fully constrain the entire chain? (ii) How can force-closure analysis be carried out for a given cable routing configuration while retaining the geometric insights of the problem? This paper will address these issues and propose a systematic and novel approach based on the reciprocal screw theory. The analysis shows that the entire n-DOF open chain requires a minimum of n+1 cables to fully constrain it and the proposed methodology can analyze any cable routing configuration.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to recognize 6 DOF rigid body motion trajectories (3D translation + rotation), such as the 6 DOF motion trajectory of an object manipulated by a human. As a first step in the recognition process, 3D measured position trajectories of arbitrary and uncalibrated points attached to the rigid body are transformed to an invariant, coordinate-free representation of the rigid body motion trajectory. This invariant representation is independent of the reference frame in which the motion is observed, the chosen marker positions, the linear scale (magnitude) of the motion, the time scale and the velocity profile along the trajectory. Two classification algorithms which use the invariant representation as input are developed and tested experimentally: one approach based on a Dynamic TimeWarping algorithm, and one based on Hidden Markov Models. Both approaches yield high recognition rates (up to 95 % and 91 %, respectively). The advantage of the invariant approach is that motion trajectories observed in different contexts (with different reference frames, marker positions, time scales, linear scales, velocity profiles) can be compared and averaged, which allows us to build models from multiple demonstrations observed in different contexts, and use these models to recognize similar motion trajectories in still different contexts.",

A method is developed which can be used to classify the behavior of other team members, and provide a measure of how similar their behavior is to the expected behavior.

The system produces textured three-dimensional models, which contain significantly more information than traditional archaeological survey methods. The photo-realistic maps that are produced allow further archaeological research to be performed, without diving on a site during the restrictive time limitations of permits and field seasons. The hardware and software components of the mapping system and its method of operation are described, and initial results are presented and discussed.",

The capability that robots are able to identify different regions highly depends on the unsupervised topological segmentation results. This paper addresses the problem of segmenting a metric map into regions. Nowadays many researches in this direction develop approaches based on spectral clustering. However there are inherent drawbacks of spectral clustering algorithms. In this paper, we first discuss these drawbacks using several testing results; then we propose our approach based on information theory which uses Chow-Liu tree to segment the composed graph according to the weight differences. The results show that our method provides more flexible and faster results in the sense of facilitating semantic mapping or further applications.",

        "abstract": "An experimental study was done to examine the relationship between vibrotactile amplitude displacement and softness sensation. Merkel Disk behavior relative to softness sensation was studied under psychophysical experimentation of human participants. Restrictions are carefully applied on contact area spreading so that vibration will be the only factor that would induce a sensation. A vibrotactile device was excited at constant frequency and its amplitude is adjusted at different levels to alter the amount of skin displacement. Volunteers participated in a two-alternative force choice experiment were ask to compare the perceived softness difference between voice coil and silicone rubber. Statistical analysis on the responses of participants showed a decline of spring constant. It was interesting to note, that even though contact area was significantly restrained participants were still able to discriminate softness sensation form vibrotactile stimulation. Such observation possibly shows that illusion of contact area spread rate can be reproduced by vibrotactile stimulation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for estimating the nonlinear stiffness of robot joints with flexible transmissions. Based on the definition of dynamic residual signals, we derive stiffness estimation methods that use only position and velocity measurements on the motor side and needs only the knowledge of the dynamic parameters of the motors. In particular, no extra force/torque sensing is needed. Two different strategies are considered, a model-based stiffness estimator and a black-box stiffness estimator. Both strategies consist of two stages. The first stage of the model-based estimator generates a residual signal that is a first-order filtered version of the flexibility torque of the transmission, while in the second stage a least squares fitting method is used to estimate the model parameters of the stiffness. The black-box estimator uses in the first stage a second-order residual that is directly a filtered version of the stiffness multi plied by the deformation rate of the transmission. In the second stage, a simple regressor provides the transmission stiffness in a singularity-robust way. Numerical results reported for the cases of constant, nonlinear, or variable stiffness transmissions demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and the relative merits of the two estimation strategies.",

Our approach combines the ALT (A* search, landmarks and the triangle inequality) algorithm and risk heuristics to guide search over probabilistic cost maps. We build on previous work which generates probabilistic cost maps from aerial imagery and use these cost maps to precompute heuristics for searches such as A* and D* using the ALT technique. The resulting heuristics are probability distributions. We can speed up and direct search by characterising the risk we are prepared to take in gaining search efficiency while sacrificing optimal path length. Results are shown which demonstrate that ALT provides a good approximation to the true distribution of the heuristic, and which show efficiency increases in excess of 70% over normal heuristic search methods.",

The proposed approach based on Receding Horizon Control solves the formation navigation, planning and stabilization in real-word environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The formations employed for sweeping are built up ad-hoc, taking into account length of robots' effectors (e.g. shovels, sweepers) and width of the working area. Presented method enables to smoothly merge smaller teams with the view of sweeping the larger roads (e.g. runways, highways). The formations can operate in two modes: sweeping and moving. In the sweeping mode, the formations are guided with an aim to effectively cover the cleaning roads, while in the moving mode, the planning system emphasizes the effort to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the moving mode enables to autonomously design complex formation maneuvers, as is reverse driving or turning on spot.",

This state of the art, dexterous, anthropomorphic robotic torso has significant technical improvements over its predecessor making it a far more valuable tool for astronauts. Upgrades include: increased force sensing, greater range of motion, higher bandwidth, and improved dexterity. R2's integrated mechatronic design results in a more compact and robust distributed control system with a fraction of the wiring of the original Robonaut. Modularity is prevalent throughout the hardware and software along with innovative and layered approaches for sensing and control. The most important aspects of the Robonaut philosophy are clearly present in this latest model's ability to allow comfortable human interaction and in its design to perform significant work using the same hardware and interfaces used by people. The following describes the mechanisms, integrated electronics, control strategies, and user interface that make R2 a promising addition to the Space Station and other environments where humanoid robots can assist people.",

With robotic manipulation of optical tweezers, the target cells can be moved to the desired area. Motions of optical tweezers are further analyzed for improvement of transportation efficiency. The relationship between the laser power and the cell maximum moving velocity is analyzed such that the robust cell sorting with as low power as possible can be achieved.

Established or currently emerging molecular and near cellular modalities, such as optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, offer new opportunities for assessing tissue pathophysiology in situ. The limited tissue penetration of those modalities can be addressed by locally placing the sensor, i.e. with a minimally invasive trans-needle or trans-catheter approach. Herein, we describe the use of a robotic manipulator to scan the area of interest by carrying such a sensor for generating 1-D scans while registering them to a guiding modality. The approach is demonstrated by using a miniature RF coil for collecting proton MR spectra (MRS) and scanning an area of interest on phantoms with the manipulator. MRI is used to guide this procedure as well as co-register MR imaging and spectroscopy. LineScans on two compartment phantoms demonstrated a clear spatial distribution of the resonances originating from those compartments in agreement with the scout guiding MR images. The system described herein, is a generalized platform for performing MR-guided multimodality and multilevel sensing.",

Computer Generated Hologram (CGH) is one of the techniques and it can trap more than 200 objects in three dimension. For dexterous micromanipulation, it is useful to apply robotics into optical tweezers. In this research, we designed the optical system and control system of Holographic Optical Tweezers (HOT). For optical design, we considered working space and positioning resolution. For control design, we applied teleoperation. For online generation of hologram, we developed GCH generator applied General-purpose GPU (GPGPU) acceleration. This system achieved high-speed generation of hologram (250 Hz). For full automatic control, we applied stability control theory to the multi-beam control system. With the built system, the positioning precision and response were revealed with trajectory control and teleoperation experiments. As the result, we checked the effectiveness of HOT enhanced by robotics.",

        "abstract": "In recent, control approaches for the human-like behavior in the field of service robotics have been attracting considerable attention, since most humans or animals perform various tasks uncomplicatedly. Hence simple control methods based on gaining a physical insight into human reaching movement in redundancy of DOFs have been proposed. In comparison with the conventional approaches, the proposed method tries to control directly robotic systems in task-space with the control signal composed of linear superposition of three terms 1) joint-damping, 2) virtual spring, and 3) virtual damper in task-space. In particular, our work contains a muscle tension effect of a human under the gravity. This give birth to energy efficient natural motions avoiding problems on repeatability of the motion and ill-posedness problems emerged in most of redundant DOF systems. Thus, this paper exhibits expendability of the position control into the orientation control and compliant behavior. It is verified with a real robotic arm that satisfies human-like movements and motion repeatability under kinematic redundancy of joints.",

Optical traps serve as end-effectors to manipulate micro-beads attached to the cell surface. The dynamics of the cell-bead mixture during cell stretching is investigated for the first time. Based on our previous work, cell stiffness is extracted and biomechanical properties of cells can be characterized. Our study shows that the modeling results agree with the experimental data. Further, the area compressibility moduli of two types of cells, human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM), are characterized. The results indicate that undifferentiated stem cells are much softer than differentiated ones, which provides an important insight into the cell mechanics during hESC differentiation. In summary, this paper successfully demonstrates that the robot-tweezer system can manipulate biological cells effectively to characterize biomechanical properties of living cells.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study on the Design Of Experiments (DOE)-based parameter optimization technique to adapt to the manufacturing environment changes in robotic force control assembly. Based on a real-world transmission torque converter assembly production process, investigation and analysis are performed in production. An on-pendant robotic assembly parameter optimization tool is introduced. When manufacturing environment changes such as the changes of geometrical dimension of part and tool (the location of feature on part, the size of the feature, the dimension of the tool, etc.), the changes of position and orientation of part, fixture or robot; the changes of properties of part (weight, spring constant, etc.), the performance metrics such as mean of the cycle time, mean plus 3 sigma of the cycle time, first time through (FTT) rate are degraded. The on-pendant optimization tool applies full factorial experiments on the most influential parameters. Then the results are subjected to statistical analysis to find the optimal parameter set. Finally verifying the optimized parameter set through running a number of experiments and checking on performance of the force control assembly to adapt the changes. The efficiency of proposed method is proved in the Ford Powertrain assembly production. The program continues running in production and adjusting the process parameters to adapt the manufacturing variations. The real factory acceptance testing results are presented and analyzed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and discussion and further investigation is proposed.",

In this paper, we developed a robotic system to detect prostate cancers using robotic palpation to find the suspected area of the tissue as well as to localize the area of the needle biopsy. To validate the performance of the developed system, the experiment on soft tissue phantoms was carried out. The results indicate that the system can identify the differences of tissue phantoms within and without inclusions. In addition, the bigger inclusions and the closer inclusions from the surface show larger value of the force response. These results indicate that the developed robotic system can be used to find hard materials such as tumor and malignant tissue in the prostate.",

As motivation for this interesting form of locomotion we provide a geometric analysis of a vertical step climbing task, one that tumbling robots perform well with respect to their size and complexity.

        "abstract": "We describe our efforts to create infrastructure to enable web interfaces for robotics. Such interfaces will enable researchers and users to remotely access robots through the internet as well as expand the types of robotic applications available to users with web-enabled devices. This paper centers on rosjs, a lightweight Javascript binding for ROS, Willow Garage's robot middleware framework. rosjs exposes many of the capabilities of ROS, allowing application developers to write controllers that are executed through a web browser. We discuss how rosjs extends ROS and briefly overview some of the features it provides. rosjs has been instrumental in the creation of remote laboratories featuring the iRobot Create and the PR2. These facilities will be available to the community as experimental resources. We describe the overall goals of this project as well as provide a brief description of how rosjs was used to help create web interfaces for these facilities.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a 3D model-based object tracking approach using edge and keypoint features in a particle filtering framework. Edge points provide 1D information for pose estimation and it is natural to consider multiple hypotheses. Recently, particle filtering based approaches have been proposed to integrate multiple hypotheses and have shown good performance, but most of the work has made an assumption that an initial pose is given. To remove this assumption, we employ keypoint features for initialization of the filter. Given 2D-3D keypoint correspondences, we choose a set of minimum correspondences to calculate a set of possible pose hypotheses. Based on the inlier ratio of correspondences, the set of poses are drawn to initialize particles. For better performance, we employ an autoregressive state dynamics and apply it to a coordinate-invariant particle filter on the SE(3) group. Based on the number of effective particles calculated during tracking, the proposed system re-initializes particles when the tracked object goes out of sight or is occluded. The robustness and accuracy of our approach is demonstrated via comparative experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel solution to overcome the disturbance noise (outlier) for the Extended Kalman Filter based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (EKF-SLAM). The standard Kalman Filter (KF) is not robust to the disturbance noise. The possibility that disturbance may happen is high, because SLAM aims at exploring unknown environment. Hence KF based SLAM methods should consider how to handle the disturbance noise. Variations of KF have been introduced to overcome this problem. However, these methods employ manual parameter tuning, detecting/weighting method. The core of our algorithm is to inflate the state uncertainty by using the magnitude of innovation, without tuning and detecting. Although it is impossible to estimate the state value immediately, the inflated state uncertainty makes it possible for the estimated value to converge on the true value much faster. We evaluate the proposed method under the well-known benchmark Matlab program. The results show that the proposed method overcomes the disturbance noise and increases the performance of EKF-SLAM.",

We consider a nonlinear three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the horizontal motion of each AUV. By using the Jacobi transform, the horizontal dynamics of AUVs are explicitly expressed as dynamics for formation shape and formation center, and are further decoupled by feedback control. We treat the coupling terms as perturbations to the decoupled system. An H\u221e. state feedback controller is designed to achieve robust stability of the closed loop formation and translation dynamics. By incorporating an orientation controller, the formation shape under control converges and the formation center tracks a desired trajectory simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of UGV navigation in various environments and lightning conditions. Previous approaches use a combination of different sensors, or work well, only in scenarios with noticeable road marking or borders. Our robot is used for chemical, nuclear and biological contamination measurement. Thus, to avoid complications with decontamination, only a monocular camera serves as a sensor since it is already equipped. In this paper, we propose a novel approach - a fusion of frequency based vanishing point estimation and probabilistically based color segmentation. Detection of a vanishing point, is based on the estimation of a texture flow, produced by a bank of Gabor wavelets and a voting function. Next, the vanishing point defines the training area, which is used for self-supervised learning of color models. Finally, road patches are selected by measuring of the roadness score. A few rules deal with dark cast shadows, overexposed highlights and adaptivity speed. In addition to the robustness of our system, it is easy-to-use since no calibration is needed.",

Considering vision device's limited adaptability in the dark environment, a 3D-laser-based scene recognition approach that extracts and matches SIFT features from Bearing Angle images is proposed, which makes it possible to make full use of both global metric information and local scale-invariant features. This approach can not only cope with irregular disturbances of dynamic objects, but also tackle obvious changes of observation location robustly in a semi-structured environment.

The second approach is to reduce the effect of the servoing error. With respect to the first approach, we propose a robust detection method of the stone position based on shape information.

We start with deriving a mirror transformation matrix in a homogeneous coordinate and geometric constraints for corresponding real and virtual feature points in the image. We find that existing feature detection methods are not reflection invariant. We introduce a secondary artificial reflection to virtual features to generate secondary features which are proven to share a rigid body motion relationship with the original feature set. We propose an iterative strategy to adjust the secondary mirror configuration so that existing feature matching methods can be used. The combined method yields a robust mirror detection algorithm which has been verified in physical experiments.",

First, separate histograms are generated for the Cartesian major axis, i.e. X, Y and Z, on stereo data with an arbitrary roll, pitch and yaw rotation. Using the traditional Markov particle filters and minimal entropy as metric on the histograms, we are able to estimate the camera orientation with respect to orthogonal structure. Once the orientation is estimated we extract a hypotheses of the room structure by exploiting 2D histograms using mean shift clustering techniques as rough estimate for a pre-segmentation of voxels i.e. plane orientation and position. We apply superpixel over segmentation on the colour input to achieve a dense segmentation. The over segmentation and pre-segmented voxels are combined using graph-cuts for a not a-priori known number of final plane segments with a a-expansion graph cut variant proposed by Delong et al. with polynomial runtime. We show the robustness of our approach with respect to noise in real world data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a quadruped robot designed for bounding gait with only one actuator per compliant leg. Under the analysis of the dynamics model of the robot, a new simple linear running controller using the energy control idea, which requires minimal task level feedback and only controls both the leg torque and ending impact angle, is proposed. It successfully executes fast running from rest till a constant speed and hi-speed turning, both in the prototype simulation and robot experiment. These results contribute to that complex dynamically dexterous tasks may be controlled via simple energy control method and delayed task feedback, which is closer to the animal's actual locomotion conditions. In the future, we plan to modify this method for reducing the energy expending and make the robot running fast.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic path planning in static environments is a thoroughly studied problem that can typically be solved very efficiently. However, planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is still computationally challenging because it requires adding time as an additional dimension to the search-space explored by the planner. In order to avoid the increase in the dimensionality of the planning problem, most real-time approaches to path planning treat dynamic obstacles as static and constantly re-plan as dynamic obstacles move. Although gaining efficiency, these approaches sacrifice optimality and even completeness. In this paper, we develop a planner that builds on the observation that while the number of safe timesteps in any configuration may be unbounded, the number of safe time intervals in a configuration is finite and generally very small. A safe interval is a time period for a configuration with no collisions and if it were extended one timestep in either direction, it would then be in collision. The planner exploits this observation and constructs a search-space with states defined by their configuration and safe interval, resulting in a graph that generally only has a few states per configuration. On the theoretical side, we show that our planner can provide the same optimality and completeness guarantees as planning with time as an additional dimension. On the experimental side, in simulation tests with up to 200 dynamic obstacles, we show that our planner is significantly faster, making it feasible to use in real-time on robots operating in large dynamic environments. We also ran several real robot trials on the PR2, a mobile manipulation platform.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces a method called SLAC (Simultaneous Localization And Capture) to track the spatial location of a human using wearable inertia sensors without additional external assistive global sensing device (e.g., camera, ultrasound, IR, etc.) The method uses multiple wearable inertia sensors to determine the orientation of the body segments and lower limb joint motions. At the same time, based on human kinematics and locomotion phase detection, the spatial position and trajectory of a reference point on the body can be determined. Preliminary experimental study has shown that the position error of SLAC can be controlled stairs within less than 2% error of the total distance travelled for a person to walk around a rectangle on the floor and climb up and down stairs. A benchmark study on the accuracy of SLAC was carried out using the camera-based Motion Analysis\u00ae system. The localization data obtained from SLAC tally well with that from the commercial system. The positioning accuracy obtained from SLAC is at least an order of magnitude better than that of GPS. Since the sensors can be worn on the human at any time and any place, this method has no restriction to indoor and outdoor applications and is complimentary to GPS applications.",

        "abstract": "Cameras are often a good choice as the primary outward-looking sensor for mobile robots, and a wide field of view is usually desirable for responsive and accurate navigation, SLAMand relocalisation. While this can potentially be provided by a single omnidirectional camera, it can also be flexibly achieved by multiple cameras with standard optics mounted around the robot. However, such setups are difficult to calibrate. Here we present a general method for fully automatic extrinsic auto-calibration of a fixed multi camera rig, with no requirement for calibration patterns or other infrastructure, which works even in the case where the cameras have completely non-overlapping views. The robot is placed in a natural environment and makes a set of programmed movements including a full horizontal rotation and captures a synchronized image sequence from each camera. These sequences are processed individually with a monocular visual SLAM algorithm. The resulting maps are matched and fused robustly based on corresponding invariant features, and then all estimates are optimised full joint bundle adjustment, where we constrain the relative poses of the cameras to be fixed. We present results showing accurate performance of the method for various two and four camera configurations.",

        "abstract": "We present a new approach to motion planning using a stochastic trajectory optimization framework. The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.",

It requires to draw meaningful relationships and constraints between the acquired visual perception and the geometry of the environment both empirically and programmatically. This contribution proposes a novel robot learning framework to classify and acquire scenario specific autonomous behaviors through demonstration. During demonstration, robocentric 3D range and omnidirectional images are recorded as training instances of typical robot navigation situations pertaining to different contexts in multiple indoor scenarios. A programming by demonstration approach generalizes the demonstrated trajectories to a general mapping between visual features extracted from the omnidirectional image onto a corresponding robot motion. The approach is able to distinguish among different traversing scenarios and further identifies the best matching context within the scenario to predict an appropriate robot motion. As a comparison to context matching, the behaviors are trained by means of an artificial neural network and its generalization ability is evaluated against the former. The experimental validation on the mobile robot indicates that the acquired visual behavior is robust and generalizes meaningful actions beyond the specific environments and scenarios presented during training.",

Analysis over a database of natural scenes demonstrates that regions proposed by the saliency-based model of visual attention are robust to image transformations. Using a nearest neighbor classifier and a distance measure defined over the salient regions, we obtained 97.35% and 78.28% classification rates with SIFT and C2 features from the HMAX model at 5 salient regions covering at most 31% of the image. Classification with features extracted from the entire image results in 99.3% and 82.32% using SIFT and C2 features, respectively. Comparing attentional and adhoc approaches shows that classification rate of the first approach is 0.95 of the second. Overall, our results prove that efficient scene classification, in terms of reducing the complexity of feature extraction is possible without a significant drop in performance.",

By reparameterizing a set of monocular images into a light field structure, it becomes possible to apply a linear fan filter and its inverse to extract the background and distractors, respectively. Results are shown for a hovering AUV imaging a region with non-trivial 3D structure and containing moving elements. The output is a distractor-free 3D light field model of the sea floor and a set of images of isolated distractors. We show that the technique is insensitive to parallax in the background elements, outperforming pixel differencing techniques.",

Previous work in the field largely builds on the assumption that the object in question starts out within the ready sensory reach of the robot. In this work we aim to relax this assumption by providing the means to perform robust and large-scale active visual object search. Presenting spatial relations that describe topological relationships between objects, we then show how to use these to create potential search actions. We introduce a method for efficiently selecting search strategies given probabilities for those relations. Finally we perform experiments to verify the feasibility of our approach.",

        "abstract": "The high cost of damaging an expensive robot or injuring people or equipment in its environment make even rare failures unacceptable in many mobile robot applications. Often the objects that pose the highest risk for a mobile robot are those that were not present throughout previous successful traversals of an environment. Change detection, a closely related problem to novelty detection, is therefore of high importance to many mobile robotic applications that require a robot to operate repeatedly in the same environment. We present a novel algorithm for performing online change detection based on a previously developed robust online novelty detection system that uses a learned lower-dimensional representation of the feature space to perform measures of similarity. We then further improve this change detection system by incorporating online scene segmentation to better utilize contextual information in the environment. We validate these approaches through extensive experiments onboard a large outdoor mobile robot. Our results show that our approaches are robust to noisy sensor data and moderate registration errors and maintain their performance across diverse natural environments and conditions.",

Local pH regulation inside the liposome was developed using photochromic chemical for selective cell injection of the nanotool. The nanotool was modified by Leuco crystal violet (LCV). LCV emits the proton by ultraviolet (UV) illumination. The emitted proton decreases the pH value in the liposome. This pH regulation is reversible by UV/VIS illumination. The liposome was manipulated by optical tweezers. After contact of the liposome to the cell, the liposome was adhered to the cell by UV induced membrane fusion. Injected nanotool was manipulated by optical tweezers. Intracellular temperature was detected by measuring the fluorescence intensity from the nanotool. We demonstrated optical pH regulation, selective cell injection of the nanotool, and manipulation of the nanotool in the cell.",

It is a step in the direction of lifelong learning and adaptation and is motivated by the desire to build robots that have plastic competencies which are not baked in. They should react to and benefit from use. We consider a particular instantiation of this problem in the context of place recognition. Based on a topic based probabilistic model of images, we use a measure of perplexity to evaluate how well a working set of background images explain the robot's online view of the world. Offline, the robot then searches an external resource to seek out additional background images that bolster its ability to localise in its environment when used next. In this way the robot adapts and improves performance through use.",

More importantly, to enable on line generation of general motions, such as whole-body-motion, collision avoidance must be employed, which is usually more challenging. In this paper, a model-based and efficient on-line distance calculation between links of the robot is proposed. To avoid collisions the results are projected into the null space term of the inverse-kinematics which is based on the redundancy resolution framework of LIEGEOIS. Additionally, a novel method to reduce the vertical angular momentum for a walking biped robot which uses the arm motion is proposed. It reduces the vertical angular momentum of the walking robot especially for larger steps. Since the method also works in the null-space, it can easily be combined with the proposed collision avoidance scheme. Finally, results for the proposed methods from simulations and experiments with the robot Lola are shown.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to obstacle detection for collision-free, efficient humanoid robot navigation based on monocular images and sparse laser range data. To detect arbitrary obstacles in the surroundings of the robot, we analyze 3D data points obtained from a 2D laser range finder installed in the robot's head. Relying only on this laser data, however, can be problematic. While walking, the floor close to the robot's feet is not observable by the laser sensor, which inherently increases the risk of collisions, especially in nonstatic scenes. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to frequently stop walking and tilting the head to obtain reliable information about close obstacles. We therefore present a technique to train obstacle detectors for images obtained from a monocular camera also located in the robot's head. The training is done online based on sparse laser data in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach projects the obstacles identified from the laser data into the camera image and learns a classifier that considers color and texture information. While the robot is walking, it then applies the learned classifiers to the images to decide which areas are traversable. As we illustrate in experiments with a real humanoid, our approach enables the robot to reliably avoid obstacles during navigation. Furthermore, the results show that our technique leads to significantly more efficient navigation compared to extracting obstacles solely based on 3D laser range data acquired while the robot is standing at certain intervals.",

        "abstract": "Here we consider the problem of automatically segmenting images taken from a boat or low-flying aircraft. Such a capability is important for autonomous river following and mapping. The need for accurate segmentation in a wide variety of riverine environments challenges the state of the art vision-based methods that have been used in more structured environments such as roads and highways. Apart from the lack of structure, the principal difficulty is the large spatial and temporal variations in the appearance of water in the presence of nearby vegetation and with reflections from the sky. We propose a self-supervised method to segment images into \u2018sky\u2019, \u2018river\u2019 and \u2018shore\u2019 (vegetation + structures) regions. Our approach uses assumptions about river scene structure to learn appearance models based on features like color, texture and image location which are used to segment the image. We validated our algorithm by testing on four datasets captured under varying conditions on different rivers. Our self-supervised algorithm had higher accuracy rates than a supervised alternative, often significantly more accurate, and does not need to be retrained to work under different conditions.",

        "abstract": "The development of a semi-automated haptic device for installing cables is a promising application for ship building industry, as well as in other industries which require power cable installations. The most critical tasks of this device involve quickly and reliably grasping and releasing cables. In this study, we design a device with an end-effector that uses a self-locking mechanism based on rope elements. Here, the pulling force is directly transferred to the cable using a frictional connection. The modules of this device are designed for one-person-operation, and optimize for the harsh environment of shipyards. A set of equations of motions were derived from a mathematical model of the connection between rope elements of the end effector and the cable, which show that the presented design provides the necessary no-slip condition between the end effector and the cable. A printed circuit board with an 8-bit microcontroller controls the induction motor which gives 0.6 horsepower, in combination with an AC motor driver. Thereby sensor signals are processed to ensure the desired functions by the operator's commands. This device has been shown to perform with enhanced efficiency in cable-installing tasks throughout the field test in a shipyard.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the comparison of the low-level sensor failure detection capabilities of model-based Kalman filtering and a model-free Fuzzy voting approach. The ability to identify failing and degrading sensors is essential when dealing with error-prone data acquired in harsh application environments as can be typically found in the field of embedded systems. In order to investigate the respective performance concerning rejection of faulty data several experiments were conducted in a simulation environment. The two candidates were selected to gain more insight into the advantages and limitations of system modeling (or the lack thereof) in signal-level data fusion. The Kalman filter was selected as a typical candidate that relies on extensive models for both the system and information sources. The fuzzy approach, however, employs a heuristic that requires no modeling at all. This results in a broader field of possible applications since detailed knowledge is no longer required. Thus, it can be employed in scenarios that one would not be able to use a model-based algorithm. Such applications include scenarios with ongoing reconfiguration (e.g. wireless sensor networks) or systems with limited detail knowledge about the devices.",

One of the important problems is to determine how to construct a sensor-driven neural system in order to control the robot for adaptive locomotion. To solve this problem, a sensor-based neural network is presented in this paper. To realize collision-free behavior of the snake-like robot, three IR range sensors were used to obtain the obstacle information. By analyzing the motion strategies for the snake-like robot, a signal feedback network was constructed based on the neuron model. The sensory signals were used as the adjusted values for the input of CPG oscillators. By changing the driving input of the extensor neurons or flexor neurons in the CPG network, the snake-like robot could perform the desired turning motion to avoid the obstacles. The performance of the proposed sensor-driven neural controller was verified by conducting an experiment on a snake robot in an environment with obstacles.",

Separate DOF control here means each player controls one DOF of an object or a task independently in collaborative virtual environment. Mutual guidance is also proposed which provides guidance force to each player. We setup an experiment to evaluate its efforts on cooperation performance and co-presence. Twelve participants did the experiment. The results revealed that this collaboration mode is effective. Ten of the twelve participants believed that they performed well in the experiment and thought the collaboration way was very interesting. The presented results motivated a new haptic collaboration mode in the fields of game design, education and cooperative assembly.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation and control of a device intented to mechanically improve the safety of serial robots interacting with humans. The device consists of an electronically adjustable torque limiter placed in series with each actuator, referred to as a Series Clutch Actuator (SCA). By appropriately adjusting the limit torques according to the robot's configuration, the maximum static force that the robot can apply to its environment at the Tool Centre Point (TCP) can be limited to a prescribed safe level. If a limit torque is exceeded, the SCA slips and an emergency stop is triggered while the inertia located upstream from the SCA in the kinematic chain is mechanically disconnected. A method is presented to determine the optimal limit torques that maximize the isotropically achievable force (which can be applied in all directions without triggering any SCA) while satisfying the safe force limit. An approach to optimize the pose of a redundant robot in order to maximize the isotropically achievable force while preserving a safe maximum force threshold is also proposed. The design and fabrication of a torque limiter using a large number of friction discs is presented. Finally, the mechanisms are implemented into a 4-DOF redundant serial arm and preliminary experimental results are presented.",

However, the robot may have poor performance or the instruments can not reach all the surgical sites if the requirements of the robot are not considered. A setup optimization process that not only considers the surgery requirements but also considers the robot performance is proposed in the paper. In this process, incisions are chosen carefully by surgeons based on surgical requirements before surgery. The position of the robot relative to the incision is predetermined by maximizing the Global Conditioning Index (GCI) within the moving ranges of the joints. The posture of the robot is optimized also by maximizing the GCI and meets a set of performance constraints. This optimization process is repeated until the robot can reach all the surgical sites. The calculation results verify the effectiveness of this technique in robot-assisted MIS.",

The model incorporates geometrically constrained structure of the arm to derive its deformation shape function. It is able to simulate spatial bending, pure elongation, and incorporates a new stiffness control feature. The model is validated through numerical simulations, based on a prototype continuum arm, that yields physically accurate results.",

In this paper we provide a generalization to the case of arbitrary FOVs, including the case that the direction of motion is not an axis of symmetry for the FOV, and even that it is not contained in the FOV. The provided solution is of particular relevance to applications using side-scanning, such as e.g. in underwater sonar-based surveying and navigation.",

Previously, we have studied the shuffle-turning method for a humanoid robot, which can perform a stepless and stable turning. In this paper, we present a precise shuffle turn with feedback control and a new shuffle translation method by repeating shuffle turns. Experiments using a humanoid robot were conducted and the results revealed that the proposed method was effective for shuffle translation.",

This mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations and tested in pick-and-place experiments using commercial laser diode components. The advantage of the capillary microgripper has been demonstrated in picking and aligning microchips from adhesive films, which requires substantial picking force.",

However, such efforts have been hampered by the lack of prototype hardware in such quantities and the unavailability of accurate and highly scalable simulations. This paper describes a simulation framework for such systems, which can model the execution of distributed software and the physical interaction between modules. We develop a scalable, multithreaded version of an off-the-shelf physics engine, and create a software execution engine that can efficiently harness hundreds of cores in a cluster of commodity machines. Our approach is shown to run 108x faster than a previous scalable simulator, and permit simulations with over 20 million modules.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a two-dimensional simulation model of an amoeboid robot that exhibits locomotion in a decentralized manner. The significant feature to note is that the model does not control friction between parts of the robot and ground explicitly but exploits passive dynamics of the inner fluid of the robot, i.e., thixotropic flow, in order to generate locomotion. Thixotropy is a very interesting rheological property of a fluid to form a gelled structure over time when not subject to shearing and then to liquefy when agitated, which is observed in protoplasmic streaming of amoeba and plasmodium of true slime mold. Simulation results show that embedding this passive dynamics induces morphological positive feedback mechanism, leading to convection of the inner fluid, which in turn generates locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure. The results obtained are expected to shed new light on revealing the secret of how decentralized control should be designed.",

        "abstract": "Stereo vision is useful for a variety of robotics tasks, such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, recovery of valid range data from stereo depends on accurate calibration of the extrinsic parameters of the stereo rig, i.e., the 6-DOF transform between the left and right cameras. Stereo self calibration is possible, but, without additional information, the absolute scale of the stereo baseline cannot be determined. In this paper, we formulate stereo extrinsic parameter calibration as a batch maximum likelihood estimation problem, and use GPS measurements to establish the scale of both the scene and the stereo baseline. Our approach is similar to photogrammetric bundle adjustment, and closely related to many structure from motion algorithms. We present results from simulation experiments using a range of GPS accuracy levels; these accuracies are achievable by varying grades of commercially-available receivers. We then validate the algorithm using stereo and GPS data acquired from a moving vehicle. Our results indicate that the approach is promising.",

In the field of computer vision it has been acknowledged that context plays an important role in image parsing, but in most of the researches contextual information is only used in one direction and little attention is paid to the relative pose context between objects and local features. We observe, however, place and object can serve as context to each other, that is the recognition of one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper, a new hierarchical random field which can encode multiple kinds of context including co-occurrence context, temporal context and relative pose context is proposed for simultaneous place and object recognition with a mobile platform. And a new kind of relative pose context, which is scale and rotation invariant, is defined to improve the stability of pose-encoded context. Experimental results with a mobile robot prove that the proposed method significantly improve the precision of the place and object recognition in familiar and unfamiliar environments.",

        "abstract": "One characteristic attribute of mobile platforms equipped with a set of independent steering wheels is their omnidirectionality and the ability to realize complex translational and rotational trajectories. An accurate coordination of steering angle and spinning rate of each wheel is necessary for a consistent motion. Since the orientations of the wheels must align to the Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR), the current location and velocity of this specific point is essential for describing the state of the platform. However, singular configurations of the controlled system exist depending on the ICR, leading to unfeasible control inputs, i.e., infinite steering rates. Within this work we address and analyze this problem in general. Furthermore, we propose a solution for mobile platforms with variable footprint. An existing controller based on dynamic feedback linearization is augmented by a new potential field-based algorithm for singularity avoidance which uses the tunable leg lengths as an additional control input to minimize deviations from the nominal motion trajectory. Simulations and experimental results on the mobile platform of DLR's humanoid manipulator Justin support our approach.",

        "abstract": "Singularity issue has been a long standing problem in task-space control of robot. It is commonly assumed in the theoretical analysis of task-space control system that the robot is operating in a finite task space such that singularity problem can be avoided. This limits the potential workspace of the robot when task-space control is employed. In this paper, a singularity-robust task-space controller is proposed for tracking control of robot manipulator. The proposed controller consists of a joint-space position controller that is activated when the robot is near singular configurations, and a task-space tracking controller that is used when the robot leaves the singular region. Therefore, the robot can start from the singular regions and transit smoothly from joint space to task space. It can also enter the singular region during the course of movement. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed with consideration of the singularity issue. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

In this work, we present a Reinforcement Learning based approach to acquiring new motor skills from demonstration. Our approach allows the robot to learn fine manipulation skills and significantly improve its success rate and skill level starting from a possibly coarse demonstration. Our approach aims to incorporate task domain knowledge, where appropriate, by working in a space consistent with the constraints of a specific task. In addition, we also present an approach to using sensor feedback to learn a predictive model of the task outcome. This allows our system to learn the proprioceptive sensor feedback needed to monitor subsequent executions of the task online and abort execution in the event of predicted failure. We illustrate our approach using two example tasks executed with the PR2 dual-arm robot: a straight and accurate pool stroke and a box flipping task using two chopsticks as tools.",

In this work, we propose a design approach that is based on an advanced version of the small-gain theorem developed previously for complex network-based interconnections. It is shown that, using the proposed design approach, a networked cooperative force-reflecting teleoperator system can be made stable in the presence of irregular communications by adjusting the local control gains appropriately.

Since only the tip goes forward by drawing out the outer skin from its inside, the actuator creeps without moving against the outer environment, just like the plant's growing process. The actuator is composed of the plural flexible flat tubes, placed around the cylindrical slippery cloth in parallel, whose tips are bent to cut off the fluid passage. Moreover, it is designed to be capable of steering the direction actively by curving its tip, while the outer shape formed before remains constant. The developed prototype named \u201cGrow-hose-I\u201d creeps at the maximized speed of 500mm/s with generating the driving force of 40N in linear motion. Finally, its feasibility for search and rescue operation is discussed, aiming to make it carry small cameras and microphones as smoothly as possible at the disastrous site.",

        "abstract": "In our prior work, we proposed the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture as a general method to combine coalition formation and execution for tightly-coupled multirobot tasks. IQ ASyMTRe extends the ASyMTRe architecture by introducing several new mechanisms to provide more flexibility for coalition formation as well as to facilitate coalition execution. On the other hand, these mechanisms also change the process of reasoning about solutions and further increase the complexity of the solution space. In this paper, we provide improvements for utilizing the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture based on reasoning about the solution space. We introduce a method in which the exponential growth of the number of potential solutions to be searched can be avoided; instead, the search space is only of linear size for certain tasks. Unnecessary potential solutions are removed to further increase online efficiency. Moreover, the relationships between the created solution space and the complete solution space are studied, and are utilized to provide more coverage of the complete solution space for arbitrary tasks. Although these improvements are discussed with respect to IQ-ASyMTRe, they are also applicable to architectures that approach the generality that IQ-ASyMTRe achieves. Robot simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the generation and searching of the solution space can be done online (which was impractical previously even for tasks with relatively modest complexities) for certain tasks, and to illustrate how our approach impacts the solution space.",

        "abstract": "In this work we address joint object category and instance recognition in the context of RGB-D (depth) cameras. Motivated by local distance learning, where a novel view of an object is compared to individual views of previously seen objects, we define a view-to-object distance where a novel view is compared simultaneously to all views of a previous object. This novel distance is based on a weighted combination of feature differences between views. We show, through jointly learning per-view weights, that this measure leads to superior classification performance on object category and instance recognition. More importantly, the proposed distance allows us to find a sparse solution via Group-Lasso regularization, where a small subset of representative views of an object is identified and used, with the rest discarded. This significantly reduces computational cost without compromising recognition accuracy. We evaluate the proposed technique, Instance Distance Learning (IDL), on the RGB-D Object Dataset, which consists of 300 object instances in 51 everyday categories and about 250,000 views of objects with both RGB color and depth. We empirically compare IDL to several alternative state-of-the-art approaches and also validate the use of visual and shape cues and their combination.",

From a single video sequence with multiple moving objects and stationary background, our algorithm combines spatial (color distribution) and temporal (variety between two consecutive frames) information to extract foreground objects accurately and efficiently. The key idea of our method is to employ tracking results as feedback cues for target detection in the next frame, which adaptively updates the weights and threshold. Using spatiotemporal energy modeling, the foreground extraction errors caused by ambiguous colors in foreground and background boundary and abnormal movements can be substantially reduced. Experimental results of complex scenario video demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

The efficiency of this approach depends however on the ability to realistically reproduce the situations encountered in the real world. If not, users could develop false perception-action loops or illusionary conjunctions. This would be detrimental for the transfer of the training to the real world. Our institute, the Lab of applied research on Software-Intensive Technologies from the French Atomic Energy Commission, CEA, LIST, is currently developing such a platform for the training of maxillo facial surgery. As no existing haptic device fits the requirements of this application, we specifically developed a new interface. This paper presents its specification, design and performances.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to develop an integral equation based spectral method for prediction of chatter stability in low radial immersion milling. First, the delay-differential equation with time-periodic coefficients governing the dynamic milling process is transformed into the integral equation. Then, the duration of one tooth period is divided into the free vibration and the forced vibration processes. While the former one has an analytical solution, the discretization technique is explored to approximate the solution of the latter one. After the forced vibration duration being equally discretized, the Gauss-Legendre formula is used to discretize the definite integral, in the meantime the Lagrange interpolation is adopted for approximating the state item and the time-delay item by using the corresponding discretized state points and time-delay state points. The approximate Floquet transition matrix is thereafter constructed to predict the milling stability based on the Floquet theory. The benchmark examples are utilized to verify the proposed method. Compared with previous time domain methods, the proposed method enables higher rate of convergence. The results also demonstrate that the proposed method is high-effective.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning in high dimensional configuration space is an intractable problem. Sampling based motion planning is considered as one of the best ways to tackle the \"curse of dimensionality\" and to model the configuration space. In these methods (e.g. probabilistic roadmap (PRM)), a graph is produced by random nodes of valid configurations. As the number of the nodes N increases, for expansive configuration spaces the failure probability of PRM planner exponentially approaches zero; but computing expansiveness property is not feasible for most interesting problems. Another major hurdle is narrow passages detection. Therefore, we need easily computable ways to characterize the properties of configuration spaces. We propose a new framework for narrow passage detection using spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian of the PRM. We give empirical evidences to show that eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal useful information about number and size of narrow passages, visibility and expansiveness. Simulations on various motion planning scenarios are done to verify the framework.",

The registration is then subsequently carried out, first the registration of rotation is done, in a second step the scale is determined and finally the translation is calculated. Results are presented with generated test series on public available data and data recorded with Laser Range Finders (LRF). Furthermore one example of a scan pair recorded under realistic conditions showing the robustness of this method is given.",

        "abstract": "Terrain classification is key to using terrain dependent control modes to improve performance of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). One of the most viable forms of terrain classification, reaction-based terrain classification, is subject to the problem of speed and load dependency, which requires collecting large data sets for algorithm training. The research presented here presents a method of interpolating point clouds called Singular Value Decomposition Interpolation or SVDI, which uses singular value decomposition, matrix logarithms and Catmull-Rom splines. The estimated point clouds can then substitute for empirical training data, thereby reducing the need to collect large data sets for algorithm training. Here, SVDI is applied to the problem of speed dependency using a mobile robot. Although it is seen that interpolated point clouds are not as effective as real data, interpolated point clouds are seen to be more effective than known point clouds that do not correspond to the desired vehicle speed. Therefore it is concluded that SVDI can effectively reduce the speed and load dependence of reaction-based terrain classification.",

In this paper, we reconsider their method and propose an easier approach to derive the discrete-time linear error system. Our approach enables to derive the error system without integral terms. Through the theoretical investigations, we show that a passive compass-gait is formed by the combination of unstable stance phases and marginally stable collision phases. The validity is investigated by numerical simulations.",

The Tread-Walk 1 not only assists mobility but also helps the elderly maintain their physical abilities. However, the turning movement of the Tread-Walk is likely to be unstable, because the Tread-Walk is controlled by walking. In this paper, we focus on the stable turning movement of the Tread-Walk 1. First, we simulate the centrifugal force applied to the driver, which was not considered in our previous report. Then, a new algorithm to realize stable turning movement is established by measuring the driver's standing position. Finally, the developed algorithm for the turning movement of the Tread-Walk 1 is evaluated by measuring the handle grasping time. With the new algorithm, the Tread-Walk 1 turned steadily and driver did not lose their balance.",

        "abstract": "In robot assisted rehabilitation the development of sophisticated training strategies using force and impedance control methods is an important field of research. The objective of the presented work is to provide a haptic control framework for end-effector based gait rehabilitation robots, which allows for the training of arbitrary foot trajectories of daily life and the design of sophisticated, patient-adaptive training environments. Due to the end-effector design principle the machine carries the patient's full bodyweight during the whole training cycle which implies excessively high forces at the interaction ports. To allow for a guided movement under the described conditions the machine features powerful drives and a massive, stiff mechanical structure. This results in exceptionally high device inertia comparable to heavy-duty industrial robots and normally not common in haptic displays. To ensure stable interaction with a passive user and a known range of stiff and viscose virtual environments an adaptive virtual coupling controller is developed. To minimize the complexity of design procedure, a linear, discrete-time coupled and contact transition stability analysis is derived, taking into account the known target range of environments. The developed haptic controller was implemented and tested experimentally on the robotic walking simulator HapticWalker. It was shown to interact stably with virtual environments within the defined stiffness bounds. Further a set of lower target impedance parameters was evaluated in free motion without contact. An algorithm for the adaptation of the target damping was suggested to improve transparency during free motion while still ensuring a stable contact transition and interaction with stiff environment objects. The feasibility of the adaptive coupling controller was proven in free motion and walking experiments on the HapticWalker with the simulation static and dynamic virtual environments. Show More",

The VS joints developed at DLR show very low intrinsic damping for efficient energy storage and retrieval whereas the desired damping behavior for task execution needs to be implemented in control. Robotic arms with multiple VS joints, as for example the DLR Hand Arm System, ask for advanced control algorithms which can cope with the elastic joints and the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system properties of the mechanical setup. We propose a MIMO controller for flexible joint robots based upon an eigenmode decoupling approach. For robustness reasons, the controller is designed to modify the intrinsic plant properties as little as possible while attaining the desired damping. A gain design algorithm is proposed. The controller is validated in simulations and experiments.",

First, the static balancing of the parallel manipulator is investigated. The definition and methodology of static balancing are introduced. Two methods including adjusting kinematic parameters and counterweights are applied to the structure and the counterweights method leads to static balancing of the PKM. The conditions of static balancing are given. Then the dynamic model of the proposed PKM is deduced. It describes the relationship between the driving forces and the motion of the end-effector platform. Two approaches, the Newton-Euler and the Lagrange methods, are compared and the later one is selected to build the dynamic model of the 3-DOF tripod mechanism.",

In RO desalination system design, amount of coupled differential equations related to mass balance and momentum balance need to be solved to develop system model. Hence, by applying EES to solve differential equations is a very efficient and effective method to build RO desalination system model. Comparing with Matlab, EES has the advantage of easy programming and fast convergence speed.

        "abstract": "We propose a new method of indoor-scene stereo vision that uses probabilistic prior knowledge of indoor scenes in order to exploit the global structure of artificial objects. In our method, we assume three properties of the global structure \u2014 planarity, connectivity, and parallelism/orthogonality \u2014 and we formulate them in the framework of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. To enable robust estimation, we employ a probability distribution that has both high peaks and wide flat tails. In experiments, we demonstrated that our approach can estimate shapes whose surfaces are not constrained by three orthogonal planes. Furthermore, comparing our results with those of a conventional method that assumes a locally smooth disparity map suggested that the proposed method can estimate more globally consistent shapes.",

        "abstract": "During walking and running, passive foot prostheses can only do positive work by releasing elastic energy stored in compliant structures. This limited ability to generate positive work can be improved in devices which actively support the push-off. Here, we estimate the peak power and energy requirements of a simulated serial elastic actuator (SEA) for walking and running and compare it with a direct drive setup. The simulations indicate that a serial spring can highly reduce peak power and the energy. Results suggest that optimizing SEA stiffness to obtain minimal peak power is the more general approach as it needs similar energy requirements as observed in optimizing for minimal energy. In contrast, optimization for minimal energy results in clearly higher peak power requirements. For both gaits, the predicted optimal spring stiffness suitable for minimizing peak power increases with speed. For optimizing energy, the stiffness decreases with walking speed and remains nearly constant across speeds in running. A constant stiffness for both gaits is possible. It should be chosen based on the optimized peak power solution for the highest desired speed, where the peak power requirements are most critical.",

In solving the proposed problems, we show that effective exploitation of a unique finite automaton structure yields time complexity linear in both the length of the story and the length of the sensor observation history.

In this paper, we aim to analyze all sensory data available to separate a scene into a few physically meaningful parts, which we term structure, while discarding background clutter. In particular, we consider the combination of image and range data, and base our decision in both appearance and 3D shape. Our main contribution is the development of a framework to perform scene segmentation that preserves physical objects using multi-modal data. We combine image and range data using a novel mid-level fusion technique based on the concept of regions that avoids any pixel-level correspondences between data sources. We associate groups of pixels with 3D points into multi-modal regions that we term regionlets, and measure the structure-ness of each regionlet using simple, bottom-up cues from image and range features. We show that the highest-ranked regionlets correspond to the most prominent objects in the scene. We verify the validity of our approach on 105 scenes of household environments.",

Our method shares its mathematical foundation with feature detectors from the computer vision community, where structure tensor based methods have been successful. Our resulting method is capable of identifying stable and repeatable features at a variety of spatial scales, and produces uncertainty estimates for use in a state estimation algorithm.

In such a material, we envision semiconducting polymer based sensing, actuation, and information processing for on-board decision making to be combined into one active material. This paper describes incremental steps taken towards developing such a multifunctional active material, concentrating on distributed forms of actuation and cognition, with an intermediate goal of utilizing SCP as a \u201cskin\u201d of a soft robot - a robot, made of flexible materials, which is not bounded by its rigid structure and can adjust to its changing environment - with its sensing, cognition, and actuation embedded in the shape. We demonstrate, via experiment and rudimentary simulation, the feasibility of utilizing water hammer as a form of directed, distributed actuation. We also show that distributed form of cognition can be realized via a novel concept termed Synthetic Neural Network (SNN), which is a type of organic neuromorphic architecture modeled after Artificial Neural Network. SNN, based on a single-transistor-single-memristor-per-input for an individual neuron, can approximate the sigmoidal activation function with an accuracy of about 3%. A simulation of the SNN is shown to accurately predict the directionality of water hammer propulsion with an accuracy of 7.2 percent.",

The appearance of tracking target is modeled as a sparse linear combination of Eigen templates plus a sparse error due to occlusions. We address the structured sparse representation that preferably matches the practical visual tracking problem by taking the contiguous spatial distribution of occlusion into account. The sparsity is achieved by Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (BOMP) for solving structured sparse representation problem more efficiently. The model update scheme, based on incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), guarantees the Eigen templates that are able to capture the variations of target appearance online. Then the approximation error is adopted to build a probabilistic observation model that integrates with a stochastic affine motion model to form a particle filter framework for visual tracking. Thanks to the block structure of sparse representation and BOMP, our proposed tracker demonstrates superiority on both efficiency and robustness improvement in comparison experiments with publicly available benchmark video sequences.",

        "abstract": "Robots in a household environment have to execute a variety of tasks including carrying objects. In order to grasp the correct objects for a desired action it is indispensable that the robot is able to recognize the objects in its environment. From time to time, the robot will encounter new unknown objects which it has never seen before. In order to recognize them in a later task the robot has to acquire an internal representation of them. In this paper, we present an approach for the autonomous acquisition of visual object representations in a cluttered environment. Guided by surprise, the robot detects novel objects in a familiar environment, selects local image features which represent their appearance and stores them in a database. Experimental results show that our method for the detection of surprising events reliably directs the robot's attention to the novel objects and that the recognition behavior based on our acquired object representations outperforms a state-of-the-art approach.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the major principles of gene regulation and cellular interactions in multi-cellular organism's development, we propose a distributed self-organizing algorithm for swarm robot pattern formation. In this approach, swarm robots are able to self-organize themselves into complex shapes driven by the dynamics of a gene regulatory network based model. This is a distributed approach, since only local interaction is needed for each robot to make decisions during shape formation without any global controller. The target shape is represented by the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and embedded into the gene regulation model, analogous to the morphogen gradients in morphogenesis. Since the self-organization algorithm does not need a global coordinate system, the target shape can be formed anywhere within the environment based on the current distribution of the robots. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for complex shape construction and robust to environmental changes and system failures.",

The caudal fin actuator closely mimics the morphology of a real trout, in particular the geometry, stiffness and stiffness distribution of the body and the caudal fin. We hypothesize that the linear relationship between the tail-beat frequency and speed, well-known and proven to hold for all fish studied so far, also holds for an artificial fish. We validate the hypothesis and use the results to derive a linear control law to adjust the tail-beat frequency to the swimming speed. We use an onboard pressure sensor to detect the flow speed and test the actuation in a controlled hydrodynamic environment in a flow pipe.",

A hysteresis-based switching control strategy is proposed, rendering the system globally practically stable to a set G around the origin. The control scheme consists of three control laws; the first one is active out of G and drives the system trajectories into G, based on a dipole-like vector field. The other two control laws are active in G and alternately regulate the position and the orientation of the vehicle. The system is shown to be robust, in the sense that the vehicle enters and remains into G even if only a maximum bound of the perturbation is known. The efficacy of the solution is demonstrated through simulation results.",

A problem, which prevents SCT from having a major breakthrough industrially, is that the supervisory synthesis often suffers from the state-space explosion problem. To alleviate this problem, a well-known strategy is to represent and explore the state-space symbolically by using Binary Decision Diagrams. Based on this principle, an efficient symbolic state-space traversal approach, depending on the disjunctive partitioning technique, is presented and the correctness of it is proved. Finally, the efficiency of the presented approach is demonstrated on a set of benchmark examples.",

        "abstract": "Fractional order differential equations (FODE) provides a more flexible approach to describe dynamic systems. However, the extra flexibility poses a difficult problem in system identification, which requires not only the estimation of model coefficients but also the determination of fractional orders. They are coupled nonlinearly. In addition, the model coefficients in a FODE are shown nonlinearly coupled with respect to the often used Sum Squared Error (SSE) objective function. In this article, a two-layer approach is designed to estimate fractional orders and model coefficients iteratively. An intermediate step that estimates model coefficients is also introduced to address the nonlinear coupling of coefficients in a SSE. In the subsequent simulation for electrochemical systems, it is found that prior knowledge on physical systems being modeled is necessary to create optimization constraints and justify the results.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the practical problem as to how a humanoid robot opens a door in an office environment. Among the several tasks for the door opening, we focus on the recognition of a door and grasping its knob and propose a systematic touch scheme that combines the visual and touch data to grasp a knob safely and robustly. The visual recognition of a door and its knob is done by feature matching by a feature classifier and a segmentation method with minor assumptions about a knob, respectively. The position of a knob from the visual recognition is refined by the proposed touch scheme where a robot touches a knob several times with a hand equipped with a force-torque sensor. We realize that in the on-line experiment, a robot recognizes a door and its knob, and grasps the knob and partially opens the door.",

        "abstract": "Modern robotic systems are composed of many distributed processes sharing a common communications infrastructure. High bandwidth sensor data is often collected on one computer and served to many consumers. It is vital that every device on the network agrees on how time is measured. If not, sensor data may be at best inconsistent and at worst useless. Typical clocks in consumer grade PCs are highly inaccurate and temperature sensitive. We argue that traditional approaches to clock synchronization, such as the use of NTP are inappropriate in the robotics context. We present an extremely efficient algorithm for learning the mapping between distributed clocks, which typically achieves better than millisecond accuracy within just a few seconds. We also give a probabilistic analysis providing an upper-bound error estimate.",

        "abstract": "In aging societies, there is a strong demand for robotics to tackle problems resulting from the aging population. Patient transfer, such as lifting and moving a bedridden patient from a bed to a wheelchair and back, is one of the most physically challenging tasks in nursing care. We have developed a prototype nursing-care assistant robot, RIBA, that can conduct patient transfer using human-type arms. The basic robot motion trajectories are created by interpolating several postures designated in advance. To accomplish more flexible and suitable motion, adjustment using sensor information is necessary, because the patient's posture and positions in contact with the robot may differ slightly in each trial. In this paper, we propose a motion adjustment method in patient lifting using tactile sensors mounted on the robot arms. The results of experiments using a lifesize dummy are also presented.",

In this paper we present the Tangent Space Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (TS-RRT) algorithm for planning on constraint manifolds. The key idea is to construct random trees not on the constraint manifold itself, but rather on tangent space approximations to the constraint manifold. Curvature-based methods are developed for constructing bounded tangent space approximations, as well as procedures for random node generation and bidirectional tree extension. Extensive numerical experiments suggest that the TS-RRT algorithm, despite its increased preprocessing and bookkeeping, outperforms existing constrained planning algorithms for a wide range of benchmark planning problems.",

We introduce a new approach for synthesizing variance, both with and without constraints, using a stochastic process. Based on optimal control theory and operational space control, our method can generate an infinite number of variations in real-time that resemble the kinematic and dynamic characteristics from the single input motion sequence. We also introduce a stochastic method to generate smooth but nondeterministic transitions between arbitrary motion variants. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluate task-aware variance against random white torque noise, operational space control, style-based inverse kinematics, and retargeted human motion to prove that task-aware variance generates human-like motion. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of task-aware variance to maintain velocity and time-dependent features that exist in the input motion.",

While impedance control has been extensively studied in robotics, prosthetic arms present a unique combination of human and robotic control, in which human capabilities and preferences play an important role. To understand the desirable impedance characteristics of prosthetic arms, we studied human control of a one-degree of-freedom virtual prosthetic limb with variable stiffness and damping in tasks involving (1) force minimization and (2) trajectory tracking. Subjects performed best with different patterns of impedance modulation depending on task goals and available feedback, suggesting that the ability to modulate the impedance of a prosthetic limb may be beneficial to the wearer. The results of this study inform the future design of prosthetic limbs in which the wearer can vary limb impedance to improve performance in a variety of manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Muscle synergies are hypothesized as a way to reduce the control space of redundant biological neuromuscular control. Robotics researchers are starting to use grasping synergies to simplify the task of coordinating many joints for complex manipulators. This is especially useful for hand movement control as there are many joints and muscles to control to achieve even simple tasks. This paper uses the Anatomically Correct Testbed (ACT) Robotic Hand to understand how task-specific synergies may be formed and used for complex robotic manipulation tasks such as writing. A comparison is made between synergies formed from (1) general hand movements, (2) task-specific demonstration of generic writing, and (3) practice of writing a specific letter. Results showed that performance using task specific demonstration synergies outperforms performance using general-purpose synergies in terms of completion time, energy expenditure, and trajectory error. Performance using practiced synergy outperforms the performance using demonstration synergies in trajectory error, even though there was no statistical difference in completion time and energy expenditure. These results indicate that task specific synergies from demonstration and practice allow a robotic hand to write better than using more generic synergies that may work for other tasks. How general/specific these synergies should be to optimize the performance of different complex tasks without learning too many specific synergies is an interesting topic for the future.",

Because the lunar surface is covered by regolith which implies an irregular and rough terrain, the rover has difficulty in moving. Therefore a new low-pressure wheel is recommended for high mobility performance and low power consumption with a less complex mechanism. A low-pressure wheel can change its contact shape and pressure distribution to account for terrain. The presented measurement is achieved by a new measurement instrument on the wheel, and we presented analysis model is conducted through analysis of terramechanics mobility dynamics of a low-pressure wheel with normal stress. These procedures are valuable for evaluating the longitudinal velocity of the low-pressure wheel on deformable terrain.",

        "abstract": "A textured occupancy grid map is an extremely versatile data structure. It can be used to render human readable views and for laser rangefinder localization algorithms. For camera-based localization, landmark or feature based maps tend to be favored in current research. This may be because of a tacit assumption that working with a textured occupancy grid with a camera would be impractical. We demonstrate that a textured occupancy grid can be combined with an extremely simple monocular localization algorithm to produce a viable localization solution. Our approach is simple, efficient, and produces localization results comparable to laser localization results. A consequence of this result is that a single map representation, the textured occupancy grid, can now be used for humans, robots with laser rangefinders, and robots with just a single camera.",

        "abstract": "Bringing mechanically compliant joints to robots is in the focus of interest world wide, especially in the humanoid robotics community. Variable Stiffness Joints (VSJ) promise to gain a high performing and robust robotic system. The presented DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ) is a VSJ module designed for the first 4 axes of the anthropomorphic DLR Hand Arm System. The DLR Hand Arm System aims to match the skills of its natural archetype. For this purpose, the joints have to be extremely compact to fit into the arm. At the same time they require a high power density in order to approximate the human arm skills. The new DLR FSJ is designed completely from an energy based point of view. This addresses not only energy efficient components and low friction design, but also that the potential energy of the spring is used as good as possible. A demonstration of robustness is given by the investigation of a blunt impact to the tip of the arm.",

        "abstract": "In recent years a new generation of motion simulators, based on serial kinematics industrial robots, emerged as alternative to the currently prevalent Steward-platforms. This paper presents the newest addition to this: The DLR Robot Motion Simulator. Part I covers the design process and gives a detailed introduction of the setup. The overall layout of the simulation platform and its parts is introduced. To meet the requirements of an interactive simulation, a new piloting cell had to be designed using light-weight construction and real time vehicle simulations were required. Another key issue of the whole design is the guarantee of safety. The simulator utilizes a 10m linear axis to increase its workspace to provide a better simulation experience compared to previous designs of motion simulators with serial or parallel kinematics. Part II introduces a new path planning algorithm for the kinematically redundant simulator platform, required for the generation of appropriate motion cues. Furthermore the application artistic-flight simulation is demonstrated and validated.",

In this Part II, a path-planning algorithm for mentioned platform will be discussed. By replacing the widely used hexapod kinematics by an antropomorhic, industrial robot arm mounted on a standard linear axis, a comparably larger workspace at lower hardware costs can be achieved. But the serial, redundant kinematics of the industrial robot system also introduces challenges for the path-planning as singularities in the workspace, varying movability of the system and the handling of robot system's kinematical redundancy. By solving an optimization problem with constraints in every sampling step, a feasible trajectory can be generated, fulfilling the task of motion cueing, while respecting the robot's dynamic constraints.",

The two robots are mounted behind the user, such that the intersecting workspace of the robots and the human arms becomes maximal. In order to enhance user interaction, various hand interfaces and additional tactile feedback devices can be used together with the robots. The presented system is equipped with a thorough safety architecture that assures safe operation for human and robot. Additionally, sophisticated control strategies improve performance and guarantee stability.

Using this device it is possbile to develop continuous grasp impedance measurement methods as it is an active research topic in physiology as well as in robotics, especially since nowadays (bio-inspired) robotics can be impedance-controlled. Potential applications of human impedance estimation range from impedance-controlled telesurgery to limb prosthetics and rehabilitation robotics. We validate the device through a physiological experiment in which the device is used to show a linear relationship between finger stiffness and grip force.",

The Motion Grammar is a formal tool for task decomposition and hybrid control in the presence of significant online uncertainty. In this paper, we describe the Motion Grammar, introduce some of the formal guarantees it can provide, and represent the entire game of human-robot chess through a single formal language. This language includes game-play, safe handling of human motion, uncertainty in piece positions, misplaced and collapsed pieces. We demonstrate the simple and effective language formulation through experiments on a 14-DOF manipulator interacting with 32 objects (chess pieces) and an unpredictable human adversary.",

The TOPE process is derived and shown to be capable of solving this problem in dynamic state spaces, by continuously calculating the optimum value of any system parameters that can affect this total time. Procedures are presented to apply this process to an existing replanning system, and to determine its required accuracy and timeliness. It is shown that the TOPE process can yield lower total times than other planning systems if these requirements are met.",

        "abstract": "The passive dynamic walking model, which can only depend on the gravity and its own inertia, presents stable, high-efficient, natural periodic gait on a slight slope. The stable periodic gait of the robot has a delicate balance of energy conversion, which makes the gait adjust itself as the parameters of the model change. In our work, the cell mapping method is combined with Newton-Raphson iteration to obtain the limit cycle of the periodic gait in the model, the track stability of the limit cycle is analyzed, and the eigenvalues change rule of Poincare Jacobi matrix is deduced. The influence of changing parameters on the gait is analyzed and discussed by simulations on the model with different sets of parameters. The result suggests that, the location of the center of leg mass too high or too low, foot radius increase or decrease, the slope or moment of inertia increase, will lead to the occurrence of bifurcation of the gait period and chaos; while the way the gait enters chaos from period doubling bifurcation, which results from different parameters change, obeys the law all the period doubling bifurcation share, that is, it has the same Feigenbaum constant. Furthermore, the dynamic features of the robot at the entrance of the chaos are obtained by the rule of the period doubling bifurcation of the gait; meanwhile, it can be found by the analysis of the gait features in the chaos area that there is also certain periodic law in the chaotic gait.",

In this paper we present the mechanical realization of the lower body developed for the \u201ccCub \u201dhumanoid robot, a derivative of the original \u201ciCub\u201d, which has passive compliance in the major joints of the legs. It is hypothesized that this will give to the robot high versatility to cope with unpredictable disturbance ranging from small uneven terrain variations to unexpected collisions or even accidental falls. As part of the AMARSI European project, the passive compliance of this newly developed robot will be exploited for safer interaction, energy efficient and more aggressive damage-safe learning. The passive compliant actuation module used is a compact unit based on the series elastic actuator principle (SEA). In addition to the passive compliance the \u201ccCub \u201ddesign includes other significant updates over the original prototype such as full joint state sensing including joint torque sensing and improved range of motion and torque capabilities. In this paper, the new leg mechanisms of the \u201ccCub \u201drobot are introduced.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a novel multi-robot coverage scheme for an unknown number of robots; it focuses on optimizing the number of robots and each path cost. Coverage problems traditionally deal with how a given number of robots covers the entire environment. This work, however, presents solutions of not only (i) how to cover the area (locations of interest) within the minimum time, but simultaneously (ii) how to find the optimal number of robots for a given time. Also, we consider the worst but realistic case of all robots starting at the same location instead of assuming randomly initialized positions. The minimum coverage time depends upon the number of robots used. Our research specifies (iii) how to find the minimum coverage time without knowing the number of robots. Finally, we present a deterministic coverage algorithm based on finding the shortest paths in order to optimize the number of robots and corresponding paths.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Swing-leg retraction was introduced as a way to improve the stability and disturbance rejection of running robots. It was also suggested that the reduced foot speed due to swing-leg retraction can help reduce impact energy losses, decrease peak forces, and minimize foot slipping. However, the extent to which swing-leg retraction rate influences all these benefits was unknown. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of swing-leg retraction rate on these benefits. The results of this study show that swing-leg retraction can indeed improve the performance of running robots in all of the suggested areas. However, the results also show that, for moderate and high running speeds, the optimal retraction rate for maximal disturbance rejection and stability is different from the optimal retraction rate for minimal impact losses, peak forces, and foot slipping. This discrepancy indicates an inherent tradeoff to consider when selecting the retraction rate for a robot control system: in general, retraction rate can be optimized for better stability and disturbance rejection or for more favorable efficiency, impact forces, and footing stability, but not all simultaneously. Furthermore, this tradeoff becomes more severe as running speed increases.",

        "abstract": "The fundamental problem in robotic exploration and mapping of an unknown environment is answering the question 'have I been here before?', which involves disambiguating the robot's current location from previously visited or known locations. One approach to answering this problem in embedded topological worlds is to resort to the use of an external aid that can help the robot disambiguate places. Here we investigate the power of different marker-based aids in exploring undirected topological graphs. We demonstrate that for undirected graphs, certain marker aids are insufficient, while others have powers that are sufficient to develop asymptotically optimal exploration algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The searching for a location-unknown radio transmitter is a challenging task for autonomous robot. We propose an adaptive searching algorithm named theseus gradient guide (TGG) which is designed for solving the searching problem in indoor environments using received signal strength (RSS). While the RSS gradient serves as the main guide, the robot prefers to move to the places which have never been traveled. Thus the robot will not get stuck in the local maxima. Moreover, unlike the commonly used random kick strategy the TGG drives the robot escaping the local maxima with low cost in terms of travel distance. Meanwhile, TGG is not sensitive to motion errors. Simulation results show that the searches using TGG cost much less compared with those using other gradient based methods in our testing indoor environment. Guided by TGG, the robot can successfully reach the location-unknown radio transmitter with a ratio over 97% when the standard deviation of motion error is up to 20% of the step length.",

In this paper, we realized a tactile shell based on a Lamb wave diffraction method. Surface-contact sensing is calibrated and tested with a finger; the spatial resolution is 17 \u00d7 13 on a 100 mm \u00d7 75 mm projected-dimension surface. Structure of the tactile shell comprises only four small (25 mm2 \u00d7 0.5 mm) piezoelectric ceramics transducers bonded to the edges of the shell. The sensing results have good accuracy with response time less than 15 ms, the presented method is able to be used for a humanoid robot's whole-body tactile sensing.",

Three dimensional (3D) lower limb kinematic and kinetic analysis based on ambulatory measurements is introduced in this paper. We developed a wireless sensor system composed of a mobile force plate system, 3D motion analysis units and a wireless data logger. 3D motions of body segment and triaxial ground reaction force (GRF) could be simultaneously measured using the system, and the data obtained from sensor units on thighs, shanks and feet could be transferred to a personal computer by wireless local area network (LAN). A stick-chain model was built to visually analyze lower limb postures and joint trajectories, and an inverse dynamics method was adopted to calculate triaxial joint moments. We conducted application experiments on volunteers to visualize and analyze 3D segment orientations and joint moments during successive gait for level ground walking, treadmill walking, and stair climbing. Experiment results showed that 3D segment orientations and joint trajectories could be shown and analyzed using the stick chain model, and that joint loads for different walking conditions could be compared in each gait cycle.",

The fingertip is comprised virtually of a finite number of elastic compressible and bendable cantilevers whose free ends act as infinitesimal contact points. The contact surface is afterward meshed using finite element method based on coordinates of contact points. By introducing Coulomb's law and contact compliance into each contact point, we are able to assess the frictional characteristic during sliding motions of the fingertip. We also successfully described dynamically localized displacements on the contact surface during stick slip transition, which occurs substantially on hemispherical soft fingertip. Moreover, each simulation trial was implemented in a very small amount of time comparing to commercial softwares, promising use of this model in realtime application In addition, we conducted experiments to valid proposed simulation, including force/moment and vision setups.",

This architecture is then incorporated for con trolling behavior-based mobile robots moving in unstructured environments while maintaining a fixed distance between each other, which resembles a tightly-coupled multi robot object manipulation task.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the dynamic interplay between decentralized controllers and mesh networking protocols for controlling groups of robots. A proportional controller is used to maintain robots in a formation based on estimates of the robots' states observed through the network. The state information is propagated through the network using a flooding algorithm, which introduces topology-dependent time delays. The coupled interaction of information flow over the network with the dynamics of the robots is modeled as a linear dynamical system. With this model it is shown that systems made up of robots with stable first order dynamics are stable for all network update times, positive feedback gains, and connected communication graphs. With higher order robot dynamics it is found that stability is a complex and counter intuitive function of feedback gain and network update time. A performance metric is proposed for analyzing the convergence rate of the multi-robot system.

A novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) is developed for precise control of the plate point's final temperature (FT) with fast computational speed. The control objective of time-temperature curve (plate temperature evolution) is converted into a space distribution of plate temperature along cooling line, which simplifies the ACC model to a linear model then does beneficial to employ MPC directly for optimizing the FT of plate points. The predictive horizon and control horizon of MPC is reduced to one or two sample time since the space distribution of plate temperature contains the future information of plate point's temperature, then dramatically reduce the computational burden. The simulation result shows the efficiency of the proposed method.",

It uses time-stamps to estimate the network-induced delays from the sampling instants of different axes to the controller node. The network-induced delays are considered for accurately estimating the contour error in real-time. Furthermore, a networked CNC simulation system based on TrueTime toolbox is constructed, on which the proposed TSCCC algorithm is compared with the cross-coupled control (CCC) algorithm. Simulation results on two DC servomotors show that the TSCCC algorithm achieves better contour accuracy than the CCC algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots are increasingly being used in real-world applications due to the ready availability of high-fidelity sensors and the development of sophisticated information processing algorithms. However, one key challenge to the widespread deployment of mobile robots equipped with multiple sensors and processing algorithms is the ability to autonomously tailor sensing and information processing to the task at hand. This paper poses this challenge as the task of planning under uncertainty, and more specifically as an instance of probabilistic sequential decision-making. A novel hierarchy of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is incorporated, which uses constrained-convolutional policies and automatic belief propagation to achieve efficient and reliable operation on mobile robots. All algorithms are implemented and evaluated on simulated and physical robot platforms for the task of searching for target objects in dynamic indoor environments.",

The development of a similar capacity in a robot will contribute to the future success of intuitive human-robot interaction. This paper presents a method of touch sensing based on the principle of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) that can be used to implement a large, flexible and stretchable artificial sensitive skin for robots. A classifier based on the \u201cLogitBoost\u201d algorithm is used to classify the modality of six different types of touch on an experimental EIT-based skin. Experiments showed that the modality of touch was correctly classified in approximately 80% of the trials. This is comparable with the experimental accuracy of a human touch recipient. The classification accuracies show significant improvements from previous classification algorithms applied to different artificial sensitive skins.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "As robotic software systems become larger and more complex, it is increasingly important to reuse existing software components to control development costs. For a broad class of relatively simple components, ranging from sensor and actuation interfaces to many simple perception and navigation algorithms, this can be a reasonably straightforward process, and many excellent frameworks have been developed in recent years that support reuse of such components in novel systems. However, there is also a class of more advanced software components, such as for modeling and interacting with complex environments, for which reuse can be a much more challenging problem. In particular, many advanced robotic algorithms can be highly sensitive to the perception and actuation capabilities of the specific robots they are deployed on, in turn requiring significant and invasive modifications to accommodate the specific capabilities of a different robotic system. This work examines the nature of this sensitivity and proposes a novel design methodology for isolating a stable, reusable \"core\" algorithm from any platform-specific enhancements, or \"supplemental\" effects. Modern software engineering techniques are used to encapsulate these supplemental effects separately from the core algorithm, allowing platform-specific details to be accommodated by modular substitution instead of direct modification of the \"core\" component. This methodology is experimentally evaluated on existing software for autonomous driving behaviors, yielding useful insights into the creation of highly adaptable robotic software components.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a framework for optimal coordinated sensor motion using the Bayes risk. For the purpose of illustration, we address an intrusion detection problem, which is cast as a binary hypothesis testing problem. We consider two distinct hypotheses or classes for moving targets. They are classified as threat or safe, depending on the future target trajectory entering or not entering a specified area of interest. The principal contribution of our work is a formal analysis, under various simplifying assumptions, of how Bayes risk can used to generate sensor motion control laws. We propose the use of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) state estimate and covariance as the summary statistic for the sensor observations. Thus the novelty of our approach lies in combining the classification and estimation problems formally, leading to an optimal coordinated sensor motion control algorithm.",

We also support more realistic three-dimensional visibility computations that allow evading agents to hide in crowds or behind hills. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on mobile robots and in simulation for a variety of scenarios including pursuit-evasion and tag on terrains, in multi-level buildings, and in crowds.",

        "abstract": "Object recognition is a critical next step for autonomous robots, but a solution to the problem has remained elusive. Prior 3D-sensor-based work largely classifies individual point cloud segments or uses class-specific trackers. In this paper, we take the approach of classifying the tracks of all visible objects. Our new track classification method, based on a mathematically principled method of combining log odds estimators, is fast enough for real time use, is non-specific to object class, and performs well (98.5% accuracy) on the task of classifying correctly-tracked, well-segmented objects into car, pedestrian, bicyclist, and background classes. We evaluate the classifier's performance using the Stanford Track Collection, a new dataset of about 1.3 million labeled point clouds in about 14,000 tracks recorded from an autonomous vehicle research platform. This dataset, which we make publicly available, contains tracks extracted from about one hour of 360-degree, 10Hz depth information recorded both while driving on busy campus streets and parked at busy intersections.",

        "abstract": "We present our work towards the development of a MR image-guided SMA-actuated neurosurgical robot. We used two antagonistic SMA wires as actuators for each joint in the robot, so that each joint can be actuated independently. We also modeled and tested the force behaviour of SMA wires in the bent configuration, which can be used as a guideline for SMA actuator selection. Due to the size scale of the robot, it is impossible to have individual position sensors at each joint and hence we rely primarily on vision feedback to control the joint motion of the robot. The images used to control the robot in this paper were obtained from a camera with the goal of eventually using MR images to control the end-effector motion. We then developed a control strategy and a switching circuit to control multiple links simultaneously and independently using only one power supply. Experimental results from our current prototype of a 3-DOF robot showed that we can actuate the robot and hence observe joint motion in a gelatin slab. We also did a series of experiments inside the MRI to show that the robot is fully MRI-compatible and creates no significant image distortion in the MR images.",

We propose a new way for grasp representation in the task space, which provides a suitable basis for grasp imitation learning. Inspired by neuroscientific findings, finger movement synergies in the task space together with fingertip positions are used to derive a parametric low-dimensional grasp representation. Taking into account correlating finger movements, we describe grasps using a system of virtual springs to connect the fingers, where different grasp types are defined by parameterizing the spring constants. Based on such continuous parameterization, all instantiation of grasp types and all hand preshapes during a grasping action (reach, preshape, enclose, open) can be represented. We present experimental results, in which the spring constants are merely estimated from fingertip motion tracking using a stereo camera setup of a humanoid robot. The results show that the generated grasps based on the proposed representation are similar to the observed grasps.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method to teach a robot to regrasp an object based on the Programming by Demonstration paradigm. In this paradigm, a robot observes a human performing a regrasping task via various sensors to recognise crucial information in order to reproduce the task using its own hand. The main contribution is in the proposal of a representation technique that can analyse a human regrasping movement and reproduce this movement in a robot hand. The technique is based on tangle topology where both hand and manipulated object are considered as strands. This allows a regrasping movement to be considered as an alteration of the tangle relationship between the strands (hand and the object) over time. Human regrasping movements are analysed and reproduced in multi-fingered robot hands in a grasp simulation to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Cameras have emerged as the dominant sensor modality for localization and mapping in three-dimensional, unstructured terrain, largely due to the success of sparse, appearance-based techniques, such as visual odometry. However, the Achilles' heel for all camera-based systems is their dependence on consistent ambient lighting, which poses a serious problem in outdoor environments that lack adequate or consistent light, such as the Moon. Actively illuminated sensors on the other hand, such as a light detection and ranging (lidar) device, use their own light source to illuminate the scene, making them a favourable alternative in light-denied environments. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the largely successful appearance-based methods traditionally used with cameras can be applied to laser-based sensors, such as a lidar. We present two experiments that are vital to understanding and enabling appearance-based methods for lidar sensors. In the first experiment, we explore the stability of a representative keypoint detection and description algorithm on both camera images and lidar intensity images collected over a 24 hour period. In the second experiment, we validate our approach by implementing visual odometry based on sparse bundle adjustment on a sequence of lidar intensity images.",

        "abstract": "As autonomous personal robots come of age, we expect certain applications to be executed with a high degree of repeatability and robustness. In order to explore these applications and their challenges, we need tools and strategies that allow us to develop them rapidly. Serving drinks (i.e., locating, fetching, and delivering), is one such application with well-defined environments for operation, requirements for human interfacing, and metrics for successful completion. In this paper we present our experiences and results while building an autonomous robotic assistant using the PR21 platform and ROS2. The system integrates several new components that are built on top of the PR2's current capabilities. Perception components include dynamic obstacle identification, mechanisms for identifying the refrigerator, types of drinks, and human faces. Planning components include navigation, arm motion planning with goal and path constraints, and grasping modules. One of the main contributions of this paper is a new task-level executive system, SMACH, based on hierarchical concurrent state machines, which controls the overall behavior of the system. We provide in-depth discussions on the solutions that we found in accomplishing our goal, and the implementation strategies that let us achieve them.",

We study the problem of determining the minimum number of robots, and how to position them, so that all clients using the resulting robotic network are connected and all network links satisfy minimum rate requirements. The key challenge we address is that in an environment with obstacles the strength of a wireless link is a non-monotonic function of the distance between the link end-points. Our approach to the problem is based on virtual potential fields. Clients and environmental obstacles are modeled as virtual charged particles exerting virtual forces on the robots. We validate our algorithm with physical robots in an indoor environment and demonstrate that we are able to get feasible solutions.",

However, many of the catheters used in these procedures exhibit non-linear behavior, and thus present many difficulties in implementing effective open-loop control. Systems such as this have been shown to benefit from closed-loop control, however very little investigation has been done into 3D closed loop control of this class of manipulators. Initial investigations by the authors have shown greatly improved positioning accuracy and response with closed-loop control based on feedback from an electromagnetic localization sensor. This paper describes the control approach and experimental results, and provides a robotic catheter system overview.",

This work tries to identify best practice algorithms in the domain of 3D perception and modeling with a focus on environment reconstruction for robotic applications. The goal is to have a collection of refactored algorithms that are easily measurable and comparable. The realization follows a methodology consisting of five steps. After a survey of relevant algorithms and libraries, common representations for the core data-types Cartesian point, Cartesian point cloud and triangle mesh are identified for use in harmonized interfaces. Atomic algorithms are encapsulated into four software components: the Octree component, the Iterative Closest Point component, the k-Nearest Neighbors search component and the Delaunay triangulation component. A sample experiment demonstrates how the component structure can be used to deduce best practice.",

We present the first work using motion data from a robotic surgery simulation environment in development for classifying users of varying skills and detecting completion of trainee. Given the standardized environment of the simulator, and the availability of the ground truth, skill measurements and feedback based on task motion hold the promise of effective automated objective assessment. Based on motion data of a simulated manipulation task from 17 users of varying skills, we demonstrate binary classification (proficient vs. trainee) of user skill with 87.5% accuracy. Alternate measures based on instrument pose more relevant in the simulated environment including a new measure of motion efficiency are also presented and evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Joint attention between a human user and a robot is essential for effective human-robot interaction. In this work, we propose an approach to person awareness and to the perception of showing and pointing gestures for a domestic service robot. In contrast to previous work, we do not require the person to be at a predefined position, but instead actively approach and orient towards the communication partner. For perceiving showing and pointing gestures and for estimating the pointing direction a Time-of-Flight camera is used. Estimated pointing directions and shown objects are matched to objects in the robot's environment. Both the perception of showing and pointing gestures as well as the accurary of estimated pointing directions have been evaluated in a set of different experiments. The results show that both gestures are adequatly perceived by the robot. Furthermore, our system achieves a higher accuracy in estimating the pointing direction than is reported in the literature for a stereo-based system. In addition, the overall system has been successfully tested in two international RoboCup@Home competitions and the 2010 ICRA Mobile Manipulation Challenge.",

The ability to print robots introduces a fast and low-cost fabrication method to modern, real-world robotic applications. To this end, we employ laser-engraved origami patterns to build a new class of robotic systems for mobility and manipulation. Origami is suitable for printable robotics as it uses only a flat sheet as the base structure for building complicated functional shapes, which can be utilized as robot bodies. An arbitrarily complex folding pattern can be used to yield an array of functionalities, in the form of actuated hinges or active spring elements. For actuation, we use compact NiTi coil actuators placed on the body to move parts of the structure on-demand. We demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept case study, the end-to-end fabrication and assembly of a simple mobile robot that can undergo worm-like peristaltic locomotion.",

Our goal is to model human-robot interaction from the perspective of risk minimization, taking into account errors in communication, \u201crisk\u201d involved in performing the required task, and task execution costs. Given an input modality with non-trivial uncertainty, we calculate the cost associated with performing the task specified by the user, and if deemed necessary, ask the user for confirmation. The estimated task cost and the uncertainty measure are given as input to a Decision Function, the output of which is then used to decide whether to execute the task, or request clarification from the user. We test our system through human-interface experiments, based on a framework custom-designed for our family of amphibious robots, and demonstrate the utility of the framework in the presence of large task costs and uncertainties. We also present qualitative results of our algorithm from field trials of our robots in both open- and closed-water environments.",

Currently, programmers bridge this gap by mapping abstract instructions to parametrized algorithms and rigid body parts of a robot within their control programs. By linking descriptions of robot components, i.e. sensors, actuators and control programs, via capabilities to actions in an ontology we equip robots with knowledge about themselves that allows them to infer the required components for performing a given action. Thereby a robot that is instructed by an end-user, a programmer, or even another robot to perform a certain action, can assess itself whether it is able and how to perform the requested action. This self-knowledge for robots could considerably change the way of robot control, robot interaction, robot programming, and multi-robot communication.",

We argue that the design of robust and autonomous systems would greatly benefit from adopting a semi-supervised online learning approach. Indeed, the support of open-ended, lifelong learning is fundamental in order to cope with the dazzling variability of the real world, and online learning provides precisely this kind of ability. Here we focus on the robot place recognition problem, and we present an online place classification algorithm that is able to detect gap in its own knowledge based on a confidence measure. For every incoming new image frame, the method is able to decide if (a) it is a known room with a familiar appearance, (b) it is a known room with a challenging appearance, or (c) it is a new, unknown room. Experiments on a subset of the challenging COLD database show the promise of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots should be able to grasp and handle objects in the environment, even if the objects are seen for the first time. A plausible solution to this problem is to categorize these objects into existing classes with associated actions and functional knowledge. So far, efforts on visual object categorization using humanoid robots have either been focused on appearance-based methods or have been restricted to object recognition without generalization capabilities. In this work, a shape model-based approach using stereo vision and machine learning for object categorization is introduced. The state-of-the-art features for shape matching and shape retrieval were evaluated and selectively transfered into the visual categorization. Visual sensing from different vantage points allows the reconstruction of 3D mesh models of the objects found in the scene by exploiting knowledge about the environment for model-based segmentation and registration. These reconstructed 3D mesh models were used for shape feature extraction for categorization and provide sufficient information for grasping and manipulation. Finally, the visual categorization was successfully performed with a variety of features and classifiers allowing proper categorization of unknown objects even when object appearance and shape substantially differ from the training set. Experimental evaluation with the humanoid robot ARMAR-IIIa is presented.",

In this work, we adopt a system-level perspective for the development of a rotary-wing micro air vehicle and propose a new design that utilizes gyroscopic dynamics for attitude control. Unlike traditional vehicles where attitude control moments are generated by aerodynamic control surfaces, the proposed vehicle will leverage the existing angular momentum of its rotating components to generate gyroscopic moments for controlling attitude. The capacity to rapidly generate large gyroscopic control moments, coupled with the precision gained from eliminating the need for complex and restrictive aerodynamic models, improves both agility and adaptability. We present the design and analysis of a new flying machine including the dynamic model with simplified aerodynamics and a control scheme based on a model linearized around hover. Simulations show the responsiveness and stabilization of a simple linear controller for hover.",

        "abstract": "People detection and tracking is a key component for robots and autonomous vehicles in human environments. While prior work mainly employed image or 2D range data for this task, in this paper, we address the problem using 3D range data. In our approach, a top-down classifier selects hypotheses from a bottom-up detector, both based on sets of boosted features. The bottom-up detector learns a layered person model from a bank of specialized classifiers for different height levels of people that collectively vote into a continuous space. Modes in this space represent detection candidates that each postulate a segmentation hypothesis of the data. In the top-down step, the candidates are classified using features that are computed in voxels of a boosted volume tessellation. We learn the optimal volume tessellation as it enables the method to stably deal with sparsely sampled and articulated objects. We then combine the detector with tracking in 3D for which we take a multi-target multi-hypothesis tracking approach. The method neither needs a ground plane assumption nor relies on background learning. The results from experiments in populated urban environments demonstrate 3D tracking and highly robust people detection up to 20 m with equal error rates of at least 93%.",

        "abstract": "Omnidirectional cameras allow direct tracking and motion estimation of planar regions in images during a long period of time. However, using only one camera leads to plane and trajectory reconstruction up to a scale factor. We propose to develop dense plane tracking based on omnidirectional stereovision to answer this issue. The presented method estimates simultaneously the parameters of several 3D planes along with the camera motion in a spherical model formulation. Results show the efficiency of the approach.",

        "abstract": "The outdoor perception problem is a major challenge for driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle systems. While these systems can often employ active sensors such as sonar, radar, and lidar to perceive their surroundings, the state of standard traffic lights can only be perceived visually. By using a prior map, a perception system can anticipate and predict the locations of traffic lights and improve detection of the light state. The prior map also encodes the control semantics of the individual lights. This paper presents methods for automatically mapping the three dimensional positions of traffic lights and robustly detecting traffic light state onboard cars with cameras. We have used these methods to map more than four thousand traffic lights, and to perform onboard traffic light detection for thousands of drives through intersections.",

        "abstract": "Detection of traffic light state is essential for autonomous driving in cities. Currently, the only reliable systems for determining traffic light state information are non-passive proofs of concept, requiring explicit communication between a traffic signal and vehicle. Here, we present a passive camera based pipeline for traffic light state detection, using (imperfect) vehicle localization and assuming prior knowledge of traffic light location. First, we introduce a convenient technique for mapping traffic light locations from recorded video data using tracking, back-projection, and triangulation. In order to achieve robust real-time detection results in a variety of lighting conditions, we combine several probabilistic stages that explicitly account for the corresponding sources of sensor and data uncertainty. In addition, our approach is the first to account for multiple lights per intersection, which yields superior results by probabilistically combining evidence from all available lights. To evaluate the performance of our method, we present several results across a variety of lighting conditions in a real-world environment. The techniques described here have for the first time enabled our autonomous research vehicle to successfully navigate through traffic-light-controlled intersections in real traffic.",

Four propellers are devoted to the attitude control of the robot, and two manipulators are designed for the wall-climbing and arm-operating modes. When the aerial robot works in wall-climbing and arm-operating, there are dynamics coupling between the manipulators and the main body. The dynamics of manipulators depends on the motion of the main body, and the motion of manipulators will have reaction force and torque applied on the main body. The dynamics modeling of the robot is investigated by using recursive method. Based on the model, the trajectory linearization control of the robot is proposed. The controller of the robot when it transitions between its flight mode and wall-climbing mode is then designed. The simulation verification of the controller is presented, which can verified the feasibility of the controller.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world tasks require fast planning of highly dynamic movements for their execution in real-time. The success often hinges on quickly finding one of the few plans that can achieve the task at all. A further challenge is to quickly find a plan which optimizes a desired cost. In this paper, we will discuss this problem in the context of catching small flying targets efficiently. This can be formulated as a non-linear optimization problem where the desired trajectory is encoded by an adequate parametric representation. The optimizer generates an energy-optimal trajectory by efficiently using the robot kinematic redundancy while taking into account maximal joint motion, collision avoidance and local minima. To enable the resulting method to work in real-time, examples of the global planner are generalized using nearest neighbour approaches, Support Vector Machines and Gaussian process regression, which are compared in this context. Evaluations indicate that the presented method is highly efficient in complex tasks such as ball-catching.",

The proposed method aims at transformation from a four-wheeled mode for high speed mobility to an inverted pendulum mode, which has advantages of high viewing position and small turning radius. The transformation starts with lifting up the wheel-arms to raise the center of gravity of the whole body. From such initial states, the body is lifted up and controlled to the target angle by partial linearization, while returning the arms to the initial angle. Then, the wheels are slowed down by properly changing the target pitch angle of the body. Stability analysis is carried out by taking into account the transient response of the body angle to the target value, which is neglected in existing work. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Surface manufacturing is a process of adding material to or removing material from the surfaces of a part, where industrial robots are usually used. Robot programming for these applications is still time consuming and costly. Typical teaching methods are not cost effective and efficient. There are many offline programming methods developed to reduce the robot programming effort. However, these methods suffer many practical issues, such as cable/hose tangling, robot configuration, collision and reachability. To solve these problems, this paper discusses a new method to generate robot programs based on existing ones in the database, which contains not only the robot paths, but also the programmers' knowledge and process parameters. Since industrial robots have been used in production for decades, there are many robot programs for different parts generated by the robot programmers. Some of these parts are quite similar, such as car bodies. Therefore, these robot programs can be transformed to generate new ones with some adjustments based on the geometry of new parts. In this paper, a robot path generation method is developed based on the existing robot paths in the database. Experiments were performed to validate the developed methodology. The results are very promising in reducing the programming efforts in surface manufacturing.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect and reconstruct transparent objects. This approach makes use of the fact that many transparent objects, especially the ones consisting of usual glass, absorb light in certain wavelengths [1]. Given a controlled illumination, this absorption is measurable in the intensity response by comparison to the background. We show the usage of a standard infrared emitter and the intensity sensor of a time of flight (ToF) camera to reconstruct the structure given we have a second view point. The structure can not be measured by the usual 3D measurements of the ToF camera. We take advantage of this fact by deriving this internal sensory contradiction from two ToF images and reconstruct an approximated surface of the original transparent object. Therefor we are using a perspectively invariant matching in the intensity channels from the first to the second view of initially acquired candidates. For each matched pixel in the first view a 3D movement can be predicted given their original 3D measurement and the known distance to the second camera position. If their line of sight did not pass a transparent object or suffered any other major defect, this prediction will highly correspond to the actual measured 3D points of the second view. Otherwise, if a detectable error occurs, we approximate a more exact point to point matching and reconstruct the original shape by triangulating the points in the stereo setup. We tested our approach using a mobile platform with one Swissranger SR4k. As this platform is mobile, we were able to create a stereo setup by moving it. Our results show a detection of transparent objects on tables while simultaneously identifying opaque objects that also existed in the test setup. The viability of our results is demonstrated by a successful automated manipulation of the respective transparent object.",

        "abstract": "Increasing demand for both accuracy and productivity in cell positioning highlights the need for automation process that integrates robotics and micro/nano manipulation technologies. Optical tweezers, which use low power laser beams to trap and manipulate particles at micro/nano scale, can be treated as special robot \"end-effectors\" to position biological objects in a noninvasive way. In this paper, we propose to use a robot-tweezer manipulation system for automatic transportation of biological cells. Computer vision is utilized to supply real-time positions of target cells. Dynamics equation of the trapped cell during the movement is analyzed. Closed-loop controllers are designed for transporting single cell as well as multiple cells. Experiments are performed on transporting live cells to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Making a robot realize an environment and climb on a tree autonomously is a challenging task as the shape of tree is complex and irregular. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper dealing with the autonomous climbing problem in an unknown tree environment. The proposed method is aimed to use minimal sensing resources to achieve autonomous climbing. It reconstructs the shape of tree by using tactile sensors and guides the robot to climb along an optimal path. Numerous experiments have been carried out and the results are satisfactory.",

The intensity, gradient and smoothness have different influences on each image area. Thus, we propose the control functions that take the image as the input to tune the estimation process. We use the second moment matrix to characterize distinct image areas and embed these functions into the variational model. We also separate the gradient term and intensity term in the model. In addition, we use the coarse-to-fine strategy to deal with the large displacement in the image sequence. Experimental results show the stability of our proposed method on different image sequences.",

A world model is the robot's view of the world and contains information about obstacle locations and velocities. A two level algorithm is proposed. It is of particular use for teams of cooperating robots and the algorithm is based on a multiple hypotheses filter. Each robot features a low level world model with a fast update rate which can be used for obstacle avoidance. The local world models are combined to one global view of the world that is shared between all robots and can be used for the implementation of team strategies. Labeling and tracking is added to the multiple hypotheses filter in order to reduce the sensitivity to track loss in case of temporary occlusions of objects or false measurements. The algorithm was extensively tested during the 2010 RoboCup Middle Size League world championships in Singapore, the results of which are presented.",

The USBL is operated in a standard configuration, with the transponder onboard the AUV and the transceiver on the sea surface. Hence, position fixes are fed back to the AUV through an acoustic modem. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used for the Multi Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). The clocks of the AUV and the USBL-computer are synchronized, and a bounded circular buffer of past vehicle poses is kept to project the received USBL position fix, to update the corresponding time step producing a delayed position fix. The method is validated using a data set gathered for a dam inspection task.",

The aim lies in developing such a method that neither involves camera calibration parameters nor inverse kinematics. The approach adopted in this paper includes transpose Jacobian control; thus, inverse of the Jacobian matrix is no longer required. The proposed controller allows stabilizing the camera despite the unknown value of the target point depth. To make sure that the features remain in the camera field of view, and to restrict the controller's input using some bounds, visibility and kinematic constraints are introduced in the form of LMIs. By invoking the Lyapunov's direct method, closed-loop stability of the system is ensured. Simulation results are shown for three different cases, which exhibit the system stability and convergence even in the presence of large errors, and present the comparative analysis of both i.e., systems with and without visibility and kinematic constraints.",

The objective of this robot is to enable various internal and external transitions which are very challenging tasks for previously developed climbing robots. Realizing the transitions by an using under-actuated system without complex control is another contribution of this research. The robot is driven using a tread-wheel mechanism made of a flat sticky polymer to realize fast and robust climbing. Directional compliant joints are used between the two modules to increase the preload on each front wheel. An active tail is used at the end of the second module to compensate for the negative effects of the compliant joint forces. This combination of directional compliant joints and active tail also allows the robot to perform various internal and external transitions passively. The induced positive preload on the front wheels are analyzed and verified. Three types of internal transition and three types of external transition including a thin-wall transition are achieved by the robot prototype. The concept of the directional compliance with the active tail can be adopted to other climbing robots to enhance robustness and mobility.",

        "abstract": "Underactuated fingers have been extensively studied and optimized in order to achieve better grasp performance in terms of object acquisition and stability. However, little work has been done related to the coupling mechanisms between the fingers and their effects on grasp performance. This paper presents a novel method of underactuated finger coupling that utilizes friction and allows for increased stability and adaptability of robotic grippers. We show that variable friction within the coupling element can help the system maintain kinematic form closure while not affecting non-closure forces during grasp acquisition. A proof of concept prototype demonstrates the increased stability of objects within the grasp as compared to traditional coupling mechanisms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Fish and aquatic amphibians use the lateral line system, consisting of arrays of hair-like neuromasts, as an important sensory organ for prey/predator detection, communication, and navigation. In this paper a novel bio-inspired artificial lateral line system is proposed for underwater robots and vehicles by exploiting the inherent sensing capability of ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs). Analogous to its biological counterpart, the IPMC-based lateral line processes the sensor signals through a neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed lateral line was validated in localization of underwater motion sources, including both a vibrating sphere (a dipole source) and a flapping foil. In particular, as a proof of concept, a prototype with Body Length (BL) of 8 cm, comprising five millimeter-scale IPMC sensors, was constructed and tested. Experimental results showed that the IPMC-based lateral line could localize the sources from 4-5 BLs away, with a localization error comparable to source placement resolution at the source sensor separation of 1 BL. In addition to the ease of fabrication, these results established the competitiveness of the proposed approach, in terms of both localization range and accuracy, against the state of the art in artificial lateral lines.",

However, the traditional methods divide the problem into parallel parking, perpendicular parking, and echelon parking, then different methods are applied for the parking motion planning. In this paper a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based path planner is implemented for autonomous vehicle parking problem, which treats all the situations in a unified manner. As the RRT method sometimes generates some complicated paths, a smoother is also implemented for smoothing generated paths. The proposed algorithm is verified in simulation and generates applicable solutions for the proposed application scenarios.",

In addition to the nonholonomic constraint, state estimation and collision avoidance chance constraints are incorporated to the predictive scheme.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we use the notion of affordances, proposed in cognitive science, as a framework to propose a developmental method that would enable a robot to ground symbolic planning mechanisms in the continuous sensory-motor experiences of a robot. We propose a method that allows a robot to learn the symbolic relations that pertain to its interactions with the world and show that they can be used in planning. Specifically, the robot interacts with the objects in its environment using a pre-coded repertoire of behaviors and records its interactions in a triple that consist of the initial percept of the object, the behavior applied and its effect, defined as the difference between the initial and the final percept. The method allows the robot to learn object affordance relations which can be used to predict the change in the percept of the object when a certain behavior is applied. These relations can then be used to develop plans using forward chaining. The method is implemented and evaluated on a mobile robot system with limited object manipulation capabilities. We have shown that the robot is able to learn the physical affordances of objects from range images and use them to build symbols and relations that can be used in making multi-step predictions about the affordances of objects and achieve complex goals.",

Although there exist many solutions to the localization problem, structurally symmetrical or featureless environments can prevent different locations from being distinguishable given the data obtained with the robot's sensors. Such ambiguities typically make localization approaches more likely to fail. In this paper, we investigate how artificial landmarks can be utilized to reduce the ambiguity in the environment. We present a practical approach to compute a configuration of indistinguishable landmarks that decreases the overall ambiguity and thus increases the robustness of the localization process. We evaluate our approach in different environments based on real data and in simulation. Our results demonstrate that our approach improves the localization performance of the robot and outperforms other landmark selection approaches.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel anti-phase tremor compensation method using surface electromyography (SEMG) and accelerometer (ACC). The usefulness of the SEMG signal is that it precedes the generated joint movement by 20 100 ms (electromechanical delay, EMD). Hence by detecting the tremor in advance, there is enough time window to do the necessary computation and to actuate the antagonist muscle by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). This is also possible because the time taken for FES to actuate the muscle is significantly less than that of the neural signal, as detected by SEMG. Specifically, what is proposed in this paper is algorithm to an estimate the EMD and to determine when to start/stop the FES such that anti-phase tremor cancellation. Experimental result from one Essential Tremor patient show 57% reduction in tremor power as measured by the ACC.",

This paper introduces an algorithm rooted in the expansion scheme of the RRT that uses local trees to improve performance in difficult cases without sacrificing it in straightforward ones. This method interconnects these local trees, forming a roadmap that is useable for future queries. Additionally, a viable path can be trivially extracted by treating the output as a tree, or one of improved quality can be obtained via discrete search. Experimental data demonstrate performance equal to or better than several other single-query algorithms on two-dimensional test problems and significantly better on two common SE(3) benchmark problems, the flange and the alpha puzzle.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of identifying objects of interest in laser range point clouds for the purposes of manipulation. One of the characteristics of perception for manipulation is that while it is unnecessary to label all objects in the scene, it may be very important to maximize the likelihood of correctly locating a desired object. This paper leverages this and proposes an approach for locating the most likely object configurations given an object parameterization and a point cloud. While many other approaches to object localization need to explicitly associate points with hypothesized objects, our proposed method avoids this by optimizing relaxations of the likelihood function rather than the exact likelihood. The result is a simple, efficient, and robust method for locating objects that makes few assumptions beyond the desired object parameterization and with few parameters that require tuning.",

This work presents the design and implementation of a modular servo-VSA multi-unit system, called VSA-CubeBot. It offers a customizable platform for the realization and test of variable stiffness robotic structures with many degrees of freedom. We present solutions relative to the variable stiffness mechanism, embedded electronics, mechanical and electrical interconnections. Characteristics, both theoretic and experimental, of the single actuator are reported and, finally, five units are interconnected to form a single arm, to give an example of the many possible applications of this modular VSA actuation unit.",

        "abstract": "The compliance of an underactuated robotic hand, or a robotic hand with fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, is a function of the mechanism type, the design parameters, and the operational control mode. The transmissions used in underactuated mechanisms can be divided into two main classes based on the self adaptive transmission used to route actuation to the various degrees of freedom, namely the single-acting transmission and the double-acting transmission. While both transmission classes can be represented using a kinematic constraint equation that defines the relationship between actuator and joint motion, the main difference between the two transmission classes is that the kinematic constraint is always active in double-acting mechanisms while there are specific combinations of external disturbances and mechanism parmeters that render the constraint inactive in single-acting mechanisms. While previous studies have only explored the performance of underactuated mechanisms with the constraint always active, this paper identifies the benefits for robotic grasping (such as better disturbance rejection) that arise when the constraint becomes inactive in single-acting mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Fish excel in their swimming capabilities. These result from a dynamic interplay of actuation, passive properties of fish body, and interaction with the surrounding fluid. In particular, fish are able to exploit wakes that are generated by objects in flowing water. A powerful demonstration that this is largely due to passive body properties are studies on dead trout. Inspired by that, we developed a multi joint swimming platform that explores the potential of a passive dynamic mechanism. The platform has one actuated joint only, followed by three passive joints whose stiffness can be changed online, individually, and can be set to an almost arbitrary nonlinear stiffness profile. In a set of experiments, using online optimization, we investigated how the platform can discover optimal stiffness distribution along its body in response to different frequency and amplitude of actuation. We show that a heterogeneous stiffness distribution - each joint having a different value - outperforms a homogeneous one in producing thrust. Furthermore, different gaits emerged in different settings of the actuated joint. This work illustrates the potential of online adaption of passive body properties, leading to optimized swimming, especially in an unsteady environment.",

Our research compares a set of feature extraction methods applied for this specific task and four classification techniques. The best system achieves an average 85% vehicle detection rate and 1800 false alarms per flight hour over a large variety of areas including vegetation, rural roads and buildings, lakes and rivers collected during several day time illuminations and seasonal changes over one year.",

A virtual flexible curved bar with force delay has been modeled that connects the leader to the follower. The length of this virtual bar is a function of the turning radiuses of the leader vehicle. Through this model, the follower vehicle is in effect being virtually dragged by the leader through the virtual flexible curved bar. It is the virtual dragging force that makes the follower accelerate/decelerate so as to adjust its speed to match that of the leader. Finally, simulations were carried out in MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed algorithm has improved the trajectory tracking error greatly, compared to the virtual rigid straight link approach.",

In production or maintenance processes, the most important VR application can be assembly areas as the efficiency of a production or maintenance scheme primarily depends on the assembly and disassembly (A/D) sequence, number of gripper changes and the path used in an A/D process. In this paper, a novel optimum assembly algorithm with ant colony algorithm is proposed to solve the maintenance assembly process for 3D objects and complex environments, and to find both optimal sequence and 3D path planning. Sequentially, the assembly sequence was optimized by a traditional ant colony optimization algorithm and then, the 3D path planning with the optimized sequence information was optimized by combining an ant colony algorithm enhanced by potential field concepts. Simulation results showed that proposed algorithm has faster convergence rate towards the optimal solution when compared with existing algorithms based on genetics and traditional ant colony approach.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the visibility of known 3D points with respect to a query camera in large-scale environments. In our approach, we model the visibility of each 3D point with respect to a camera pose using a memory-based learning algorithm, in which a distance metric between cameras is learned in an entirely non-parametric way. We show that by fully exploiting the geometric relationships between the 3D map and the camera poses, as well as the related appearance information, the resulting prediction is much more robust and efficient than conventional approaches. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a large urban 3D model in terms of both speed and accuracy.",

Both the static deployment case and the case of finding deployments that minimize total robot movement are considered. We provide algorithms for the moving agent case, consider their performance on various discretizations for a range of problem sizes, and discuss our experimental implementation of the presented ideas.",

        "abstract": "We propose an algorithm for a visibility-based pursuit-evasion problem in a simply-connected two-dimensional environment, in which a single pursuer has access to a probabilistic model describing how the evaders are likely to move in the environment. The application of our algorithm can be best viewed in the context of search and rescue: Although the victims (evaders) are not actively trying to escape from the robot, it is necessary to consider the task of locating the victims as a pursuit-evasion problem to obtain a firm guarantee that all of the victims are found. We present an algorithm that draws sample evader trajectories from the probabilistic model to compute a plan that lowers the Expected Time to Capture the evaders without drastically increasing the Guaranteed Time to Capture the evaders. We introduce a graph structure that takes advantage of the sampled evader trajectories to compute a path that would \"see\" all the evaders if they followed only those trajectories in our sampled set. We then use a previous technique to append our path with actions that provide a complete solution for the visibility-based pursuit evasion problem. The resulting plan guarantees that all evaders are located, even if they do not obey the given probabilistic motion model. We implemented the algorithm in a simulation and provide a quantitative comparison to existing methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a monocular vision based 3D bicycle tracking framework for intelligent vehicles based on a detection method exploiting a deformable part model and a tracking method using an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm. Bicycle tracking is important because bicycles share the road with vehicles and can move at comparable speeds in urban environments. From a computer vision standpoint, bicycle detection is challenging as bicycle's appearance can change dramatically between viewpoints and a person riding on the bicycle is a non-rigid object. To this end, we present a tracking-by-detection method to detect and track bicycles that takes into account these difficult issues. First, a mixture model of multiple viewpoints is defined and trained via a Latent Support Vector Machine (LSVM) to detect bicycles under a variety of circumstances. Each model uses a part based representation. This robust bicycle detector provides a series of measurements (i.e., bounding boxes) in the context of the Kalman filter. Second, to exploit the unique characteristics of bicycle tracking, two motion models based on bicycle's kinematics are fused using an IMM algorithm. For each motion model, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the position and velocity of a bicycle in the vehicle coordinates. Finally, a single bicycle tracking method using an IMM algorithm is extended to that of multiple bicycle tracking by incorporating a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter which runs a particle filter for a data association and an IMM filter for each bicycle tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of experiments run on a new bicycle dataset captured from a vehicle-mounted camera.",

However, nearby moving objects could degrade the cooperative localization performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that the cooperative simultaneous localization and tracking approach is superior in challenging scenarios. Localization and moving object tracking are mutually beneficial. The proposed approach is evaluated using humanoid robots in the RoboCup environment in which only uncertain data from onboard cameras and odometry are used. Ample experimental results with ground truthing from laser scanners demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed vision-based cooperative simultaneous localization and tracking algorithm.",

In V-SLAM the main focus is most often laid on the localization part of the problem allowing for a drift free motion estimate. To this end, a sparse set of landmarks is tracked and their position is estimated. However, this set of landmarks (rendering the map) is often too sparse for tasks in autonomous driving such as navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance etc. Some methods keep the raw measurements for past robot poses to address the sparsity problem often resulting in a pose only SLAM akin to laser scanner SLAM. For the stereo case, this is however impractical due to the high noise of stereo reconstructed point clouds. In this paper we propose a dense stereo V-SLAM algorithm that estimates a dense 3D map representation which is more accurate than raw stereo measurements. Thereto, we run a sparse V SLAM system, take the resulting pose estimates to compute a locally dense representation from dense stereo correspondences. This dense representation is expressed in local coordinate systems which are tracked as part of the SLAM estimate. This allows the dense part to be continuously updated. Our system is driven by visual odometry priors to achieve high robustness when tracking landmarks. Moreover, the sparse part of the SLAM system uses recently published sub mapping techniques to achieve constant runtime complexity most of the time. The improved accuracy over raw stereo measurements is shown in a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by presenting outdoor experiments of a car like robot.",

In this paper, a method of carrier visual detection and tracking is described.

This provides an initialization to a real time 3D model-based tracker estimating the camera pose during the sequence.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of using visual information to estimate vehicle motion (a.k.a. visual odometry) from a machine learning perspective. The vast majority of current visual odometry algorithms are heavily based on geometry, using a calibrated camera model to recover relative translation (up to scale) and rotation by tracking image features over time. Our method eliminates the need for a parametric model by jointly learning how image structure and vehicle dynamics affect camera motion. This is achieved with a Gaussian Process extension, called Coupled GP, which is trained in a supervised manner to infer the underlying function mapping optical flow to relative translation and rotation. Matched image features parameters are used as inputs and linear and angular velocities are the outputs in our non-linear multi-task regression problem. We show here that it is possible, using a single uncalibrated camera and establishing a first-order temporal dependency between frames, to jointly estimate not only a full 6 DoF motion (along with a full covariance matrix) but also relative scale, a non-trivial problem in monocular configurations. Experiments were performed with imagery collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying over a deserted area at speeds of 100\u2013120 km/h and altitudes of 80-100 m, a scenario that constitutes a challenge for traditional visual odometry estimators.",

The most interesting feature of this paper is that the problem was discussed in the image frame and the inertial frame, which made the problem easy and useful.

The objective is to stabilize the vehicle to the pose associated with a visual image of a planar target. By using the homography matrix computed from the camera measurements of the target, stabilizing feedback laws are derived. Explicit stability conditions on the control parameters are provided. It is shown that very good robustness and performance can be achieved without any apriori information on the visual target (like geometry, or orientation), by a proper tuning of the control parameters.

Since man-made environments generally exhibit strong regularity in structure, a set of line segments that are either parallel or orthogonal to the gravitational direction can provide visual measurements for the absolute attitude from a calibrated camera. Line segments are robustly classified with the assumption that a single vertical vanishing point or multiple horizontal vanishing points exist. In the fusion with gyro angles, we introduce a new Kalman update step that directly uses line segments rather than vanishing points. The simulation and experiment based on urban images at distant views are provided to demonstrate that our method can serve as a robust visual attitude sensor for aerial robot navigation.",

As critical surfaces as well as surgical targets often lie subsurface, a range of techniques (e.g. ultrasound and near-infrared imaging) and registration methods have been investigated as robotic surgery gains popularity. While investigation of nerves, blood vessels, and tumors has received prior attention, we present a new prototype system for real-time multimodal image registration that focuses on the visualization of the urinary tract. By providing an accurate registration between stereo video images and a near infrared imager, we aim to enhance surgical awareness and make critical uretary tasks such as mobilization of the ureters easier. Engineering validation experiments with a prototype imager, and in-vivo experiments using a prototype Hamamatsu Photodynamic Eye (PDE) imager together with the da Vinci surgical system demonstrating feasibility are presented. These initial experiments have also shown encouraging response from the clinicians.",

We first establish putative point correspondence in the high dimensional feature space and then use these correspondences in a random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework to obtain an initial rigid body transformation that aligns the two scans. This initial transformation is then refined in a generalized iterative closest point (ICP) framework. The proposed method is completely data driven and does not require any initial guess on the transformation.

The consistency of the spatial eigenspaces formed by the speech source at different frequencies and the resonant curve similarity of the WUW are used as the features for detection. These features are processed and detected separately and the result is determined by cascading individual outcome using Bayes risk detector. This proposed method can keep a high recognition rate under very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, this method can estimate the direction of arrivals of the sound source, and the proposed architecture is easy to expand by adding detectors with other features in the cascaded manner to further improve the recognition rate.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Performing laparoscopic surgery requires several skills which have never been required for conventional open surgery, surgeons experience difficulties in learning and mastering these techniques. Various training methods and metrics have been developed in order to assess and improve surgeon's operative abilities. While these training metrics are currently widely being used, skill evaluation methods are still far from being objective in the regular laparoscopic skill education. This paper proposes a methodology of defining a model to objectively evaluate surgical performance and skill expertise in the routine laparoscopic training course. Our approach is based on the processing of kinematic data describing the movements of surgeon's upper limbs. An ultra-miniaturized wearable motion capture system (Waseda Bioinstrumentation system WB-3), therefore, has been developed to measure and analyze these movements. The skill evaluation model was trained by using the subjects' motion features acquired from WB-3 system and further validated to classify the expertise levels of the subjects with different laparoscopic experience. An experiment for training fundamental laparoscopic psychomotor skill was elaborated by using laparoscopic box trainer. Preliminary results show that, the proposed methodology can be efficiently used both for quantitative assessment of surgical ability, and for the discrimination between expert surgeons and novices.",

        "abstract": "Survey class Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) rely on Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) for precise navigation near the seafloor. In cases where the seafloor depth is greater than the DVL bottom lock range, transiting from the surface where GPS is available to the seafloor presents a localisation problem since both GPS and DVL are unavailable in the mid-water column. This is traditionally addressed by using acoustic positioning systems, which take extra time to deploy or require a tracking vessel. Such systems increase the costs of operating in deep waters and reduce the flexibility of AUV operations. This paper proposes an alternative approach to navigation in the mid-water column that exploits the stability of current profiles of water columns over short periods of time. Observation of these currents are possible with the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) mode of the DVL. Results with real data from missions with the Sirius AUV show how the full integration of water column descent with the ADCP, seafloor view-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping), and ascent to the sea surface with ADCP gives results similar to having continuous bottom lock and shows potential to act as an alternative to acoustic localisation.",

A short-time exposure of tactile receptors to sub-sensory white-noise vibration is known to improve the tactile sensitivity. This phenomenon, called \u201cnoise-enhanced tactile sensation\u201d or stochastic resonance (SR) in the somatosensory system, is expected to enhance the sense of touch when white-noise vibration is applied to a fingertip, and thereby improve associated motor skills. A prototype sensorimotor enhancer has been developed in this research. This wearable device is to stimulate tactile receptors by applying vibration from a compact lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric stack actuator attached at the radial side of the fingertip. This design keeps the palmar region free and maintains the wearer's manipulability. Sensory and motor tests have been conducted for health subjects to confirm the efficacy of the device. Statistical significance has been observed in most of the tests.",

        "abstract": "A hyperelastic, thin, transparent pressure sensitive keypad is fabricated by embedding a silicone rubber film with conductive liquid-filled microchannels. Applying pressure to the surface of the elastomer deforms the cross-section of underlying microchannels and changes the electrical resistance across the affected channels. Perpendicular conductive channels form a quasi-planar network within an elastomeric matrix that registers the location, intensity and duration of applied pressure. Pressing channel intersections of the keypad triggers one of twelve keys, allowing the user to write any combination of alphabetic letters. A 5% change in channel output voltage must be achieved to trigger a key. It is found that approximately 100 kPa of pressure is necessary to produce a 5% change in voltage across a conductive microchannel that is 20 microns in height and 200 microns in width. Sensitivity of the keypad is tunable via channel geometry and choice of elastomeric material.",

        "abstract": "We investigate in this paper the problem of misalignment-robust facial expression recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been formally addressed in the literature. Most existing facial expression recognition methods, however, can only work well when face images are well-aligned. In many real world applications such as human robot interaction and visual surveillance, it is still very challenging to obtain well-aligned face images for expression recognition due to currently imperfect vision techniques, especially under uncontrolled conditions. Motivated by the fact that interclass facial images with small differences are more easily mis-classified than those with large differences, we propose a biased linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) method by imposing large penalties on interclass samples with small differences and small penalties on those samples with large differences simultaneously, such that more discriminative features can be extracted for recognition. Moreover, we generate more virtually misaligned facial expression samples and assign different weights to them according to their occurrence probabilities in the testing phase to learn a weighted BLDA (WBLDA) feature space to extract misalignment-robust discriminative features for recognition. Experimental results on two widely used face databases are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "For such biomedical applications as single cell manipulation and targeted delivery of chemicals, it is important to fabricate microstructures that can be powered and controlled without a tether in fluidic environments. In this work, we describe the construction and operation of micronsized, biocompatible ferromagnetic microtransporters driven by external magnetic fields capable of exerting forces at the pico Newton scale. We develop microtransporters using a simple, single step micro fabrication technique that allows us to produce large numbers in the same step. We also fabricate microgels to deliver drugs. We demonstrate that the microtransporters can be navigated to separate individual targeted cells with micron-scale precision, and deliver microgels without disturbing the cells in the neighborhood and the local microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a balance control algorithm which uses Zero Moment Point (ZMP) in order to improve the mobility of leg-wheel hybrid structures on hard, flat surfaces. The algorithm generates balancing leg motions which continuously adjust the contact points to allow the geometric center of the contact area to follow ZMP. During our simulation of a balance control system which uses Individual Joint PD Control (IJPD), we encountered two main problems-high frequency oscillation and unbalanced control input. To solve these issues, we derived a method for dynamic decoupling and control allocation (DDCA). We tested the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by simulating the maximum distance that a robot can stably move during a fixed time period. There are three important advantages to our proposed balance control algorithm. First, the balancing motions have no effect on the primary tasks of its arms and upper body. Second, the interaction forces between the contact points are minimized, thereby reducing an unbalance of the control inputs. Third, the task dynamics are decoupled and controlled independently.",

        "abstract": "We present iSAM2, a fully incremental, graph-based version of incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM). iSAM2 is based on a novel graphical model-based interpretation of incremental sparse matrix factorization methods, afforded by the recently introduced Bayes tree data structure. The original iSAM algorithm incrementally maintains the square root information matrix by applying matrix factorization updates. We analyze the matrix updates as simple editing operations on the Bayes tree and the conditional densities represented by its cliques. Based on that insight, we present a new method to incrementally change the variable ordering which has a large effect on efficiency. The efficiency and accuracy of the new method is based on fluid relinearization, the concept of selectively relinearizing variables as needed. This allows us to obtain a fully incremental algorithm without any need for periodic batch steps. We analyze the properties of the resulting algorithm in detail, and show on various real and simulated datasets that the iSAM2 algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots are intended to act and interact in dynamically changing environments in the presence of humans. Current robotic systems are usually able to move in dynamically changing environments because of an inbuilt depth and obstacle sensing. However, for acting in their environment the internal representation of such systems is usually constructed by hand and known in advance. In contrast, this paper presents a system that dynamically constructs its internal scene representation using a model-based vision approach. This enables our system to approach and grasp objects in an previously unknown scene. We combine standard stereo with model-based image fitting techniques for a real-time estimation of the position and orientation of objects. The model-based image processing allows for an easy transfer to the internal, dynamic scene representation. For movement generation we use a task-level whole-body control approach that is coupled with a movement optimization scheme. Furthermore, we present a novel method that constrains the robot to keep certain objects in the FOV while moving. We demonstrate the successful interplay between model-based vision, dynamic scene representation, and movement generation by means of some interactive reaching and grasping tasks.",

Unlike current systems that use active sensors (e.g. Kinect), in the proposed approach, the human-poses are captured by a single camera and used to control the course of the game. This eliminates the need for traditional hand-held controllers and allows for the player to be immersed into the virtual environment of the game. The success of the approach is achieve through a robust extraction of human silhouettes and by a simple but effective human-pose recognizer. The system employs an adaptive framework for background subtraction using Adaptive Local Principal Component Analysis (ALPCA), which is able to handle sudden as well as gradual changes in background. Next, the extracted human silhouettes are used to train a appearance-based algorithm that can recognize the human poses. The excellent results reported here justify the elimination of active sensors and game controllers for many traditional games.",
