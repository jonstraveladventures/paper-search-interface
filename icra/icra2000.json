        "abstract": "4D/RCS is the reference model architecture currently being developed for the Demo III Experimental Unmanned Vehicle program. 4D/RCS integrates the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) RCS (real-time control system) with the German (Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen) VaMoRs 4D approach (3 dimensions+time) to dynamic machine vision. The 4D/RCS architecture consists of a hierarchy of computational nodes each of which contains behavior generation (BG), world modeling (WM), sensory processing (SP), and value judgement (VJ) processes. Each node also contains a knowledge database (KD) and an operator interface. These computational nodes are arranged such that the BG processes represent organizational units within a command and control hierarchy.",

        "abstract": "The application of a repetitive controller with zero phase error tracking compensation (ZPETC) to the speed control problem of travelling wave ultrasonic motors is investigated. The proposed control strategy is aimed at reducing the typical speed ripples of ultrasonic motors as well as compensating the load and temperature changes. Repetitive controllers are capable of improving the response of dynamical systems under periodic disturbances by learning from the stored error valves of preceding periods. Since it is desirable for the stabilizing compensator of repetitive controllers to be zero phase and perfect error tracker, the ZPET controller is a natural choice when the servo's closed-loop transfer function has non-minimum zeros. The performance of the proposed controller is compared against that of a PI-repetitive controller and its effectiveness experimentally demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "For an object grasped by a robot hand to work in the compliance control domain, we first analyze a necessary condition for successful stiffness modulation in the operational space. Next, we propose a compliance control method for robot hands which consist of two steps: the RIFDS (resolved inter-finger decoupling solver) decomposes the desired compliance characteristic specified in the operational space into the compliance characteristic in the fingertip space without inter-finger coupling; and the RIJDS (resolved inter-joint decoupling solver) decomposes the compliance characteristic in the fingertip space into the compliance characteristic in the joint space without inter-joint coupling. According to the analysis results, the finger structure should be biomimetic in the sense that either kinematic redundancy or force redundancy are required to implement the proposed compliance control scheme. Five-bar fingered robot hands are treated as illustrative examples to implement the proposed compliance control method. To show the effectiveness of the proposed compliance control method, simulations are performed for two-fingered and three-fingered robot hands.",

Current tactile displays are flat and rigid, and require precise machining and assembly of many parts. This paper describes the fabrication and performance of a one-piece pneumatically-actuated tactile display molded from silicone rubber. Tactor spacing is 2.5 mm with 1 mm diameter tactor elements. Tactile display compliance ensures contact between the finger and tactile display at all times. Unlike previous pneumatic tactile displays, there is no chamber leakage and no seal friction. A psychophysics experiment showed that a synthetic grating on the tactile display was perceived as well as a low-pass-filtered real contact.",

A conceptual architecture is described and implemented in a robot assembly cell to demonstrate that this approach can lead to a manufacturing control system which can adapt relatively simply to long-term change. A design methodology and migration strategy for achieving these solutions using conventional hardware is proposed to develop execution level of manufacturing control systems.",

The vergence process is controlled by the retinal optical flow disparity and the target depth velocity is directly obtained from this disparity. The relationship between the target depth (focused target distance) and the focusing odometry of the motorized lens is obtained by an off-line focusing calibration, using a bivariate polynomial to model the relationship between these parameters. The focusing system is velocity controlled and the focusing velocity is dependent on the target focusing depth velocity and the focal distance velocity. The influence of the focal distance velocity that arise due to the focusing process itself is compensated by the adjustment of the zoom parameter based on a constant magnification approach, or through the modeling of the focal distance as a function of the zoom and focus lens settings.",

        "abstract": "We propose a concept for integrating multiple sensors in real-time robot control. To increase the controller robustness under diverse uncertainties, the robot systematically generates series of sensor data (as robot state) while memorising the corresponding motion parameters. From the collection of (multi-) sensor trajectories, statistical indices for each sensor type can be extracted. If the sensor data are preselected as output relevant, the principal components can be used very efficiently to approximately represent the original perception scenarios. After this dimension reduction procedure, a nonlinear fuzzy controller can be trained to map the subspace projection into the robot control parameters. We apply the approach to a real robot system with two arms and multiple vision and force/torque sensors. These external sensors are used simultaneously to control the robot arm performing insertion and screwing operations. The experiments show that the robustness as well as the precision of robot control can be enhanced by integrating multiple additional sensors using this concept.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot systems operating in the real world have to be able to learn new tasks and environmental conditions without the need for an outside teacher. While reinforcement learning represents a good formalism to achieve this, its long learning times and need for extensive exploration often make it impracticable for online learning on complex systems. The hybrid architecture presented in this paper addresses this issue by applying reinforcement learning on top of an automatically derived abstract discrete event dynamic system (DEDS) supervisor. This reduces the problem of policy acquisition within this approach to learning to coordinate a set of closed-loop control strategies in order to perform a given task. Besides dramatically reducing the complexity of the learning task this framework also permits the incorporation of a priori knowledge and facilitates the inclusion of learned policies as actions in order to transfer skills to new task domains. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, the architecture is used to learn locomotion gaits on a four-legged robot platform.",

Robotic batting is taken as a task example. The problem is approached so as to result in an iterative learning of the joint driving torque patterns of the manipulator that are considered as the task skills and learned against several typically given desired ball velocities. A multi-layered artificial neural network is used to learn and generalize the joint driving torque against various desired ball velocities, and an iterative optimal control algorithm is adopted to generate the supervisory joint driving torque signals for the neural network. Computer simulation examples of a three-degree-of-freedom manipulator are outlined, the results are depicted to explain the idea and verify the proposed approach, and the robustness issues are discussed qualitatively.",

This method solves many of classical problems found in the potential field methods. However, a zig-zaging phenomenon appears in some heavy cluttered environments. To avoid this situation, a graph based on the local geometry of the environment is constructed and an A* search is performed in order to find a new dead-lock free position.

With task complexity rising, the likelihood of unexpected events is increasing. Advanced service robots therefore require intelligent controllers to handle task oriented exceptions, to select appropriate countermeasures and to execute these efficiently. In order to manage and to perform appropriately and to handle cascaded exceptions as well, systematic knowledge gathering, analysis and representation is required Here relational data models are extensively used to generate measures in case of external or internal exceptions, and to accept and store new information for use in similar situations. A hierarchical controller architecture that has been developed and verified using Petri net models, supervises planned task execution and enforces the measures required for successful autonomous operation. The efficiency of the proposed exception handling approach has been tested and evaluated with the mobile robot MACROBE performing several inspection and transportation tasks in a shop floor environment.",

The nonlinear controller together with the switching strategy result in exponential convergence and also provide a near method to overcome problems associated with closed loop behavior near an unstable equilibrium that are inherent to controllers with quaternion feedback. Bounds of convergence rates and \"turn around time\" to the stable equilibrium are explicitly calculated. A \"time-scaling\" approach for partial reference trajectory redesign is then presented to achieve tracking when constraints on the magnitude of the available input torques are present.",

Such a system would realize provision of support without a strict model of the assembly target and enable support in cases where neither the assembly process, nor the final form of the completed task is known to the system in advance. First, a method of measuring human information and extracting states where support is necessary, from the human work model is presented. Next a support system for assembly work cooperation according to the work model, with physical interaction capabilities is described. Experiments were carried out to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the system.

        "abstract": "A hierarchical fuzzy controller with two levels is proposed to solve the control for a multi-chain robotic system formed by tentacle manipulators grasping a common object with hard point contacts. The control system contains two parts: the first component is a conventional controller which implements a control strategy based on the Lyapunov stability, and the second one is an adaptive fuzzy controller which adjusts the control parameters by the output of the first level controller. The stability and robustness is investigated and the fuzzy rules are established. Simulation results are presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "The use of multiple sensing modalities for the autonomous operation and navigation of mobile robots is demonstrated through many vehicles, including the HelpMate mobile courier. We propose a \"value measure\" for the various resources of such a system, so that the control of sensing processes (and eventually motion processes) can be optimized and continuously calibrated. Value quantity (varying with quality) and task-specific utility can be compared with costs in a higher-level planner of a hierarchical system providing the most efficient use of electrical and computing power. This approach can benefit by using an object-oriented database architecture to enhance task-oriented-focused sensing thereby allowing \"closed-loop sensing\", that would be guided by a priori information driving a directed-sensing process; it will eventually also be related to motion control, as dictated by the system's current task/plan(s).",

The method searches for a sequence of physically realizable actions, called action modules, to produce a plan for a given task. The search is performed with a hierarchical selection process that uses task and configuration filters to reduce the action module inventory to a reasonable search space. Then, a genetic algorithm search finds a sequence of actions that allows the robot to complete the task without violating any physical constraints. The results for the LIBRA climbing robot show the method is able to produce effective plans.",

The actual controller is in real feedback loop with the plant whereas the virtual ones are in virtual feedback such that the coupled behavior of any of these control modules with plant conforms to what is called normality criterion in the context of partial observation. Every time that a failure occurs and the environment changes, the actual controller is replaced by one of these virtual ones.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a multi-agent approach to the integration of product design, manufacturability analysis, process planning, and assembly in a distributed manner. The objective is to develop a distributed concurrent engineering system to allow geographically dispersed entities to work cooperatively towards overall system goals. The proposed model considers constraints and requirements from the different product development cycles in the early development phases and fully supports the concept of design-for-manufacturability. This methodology uses conflict resolution (CR) techniques and design-improvement suggestions to refine the initial product design. The model comprises six service agents, a console agent and a facilitator agent. Each service agent is used to model different product development phases, and the console agent acts as an interacting interface between designers and the system, while the facilitator is responsible for the decomposition and dispatch of tasks, and solving conflicts of poor designs. The implementation methodology provides an effective way of enabling heterogeneous legacy software tools in communicating and coordinating with others over the Web through the use of Java-based agent wrapping techniques.",

        "abstract": "Model based error compensation of a robotic manipulator, also known as robot calibration, requires the identification of its generalized errors. These errors are found from measured data and used to predict, and compensate for, the end-point errors as a function of configuration. However, the generalized error formulation introduces redundant parameters, often non-intuitive, that may compromise the robustness of the calibration. The existing numerical methods to eliminate such errors are formulated on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, the general analytical expressions and physical interpretation of the redundant parameters are developed for any serial link manipulator, expressed through its Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. These expressions are used to eliminate the redundant parameters from the error model of any manipulator prior to the identification process, allowing for systematic robot calibration with improved accuracy. Simulations are conducted to verify the theory presented in the paper.",

When little is known about the geometry of the system, conventional methods cannot be used to calculate the system's compliance matrix. A new method has been developed that uses experimental data to calculate a passive system's compliance matrix,and an eigenvalue decomposition to extract the directions and magnitudes of the system constraints. The data were wrenches applied to the system and the mechanism's resulting displacement from equilibrium. Computer simulations suggest that the method reliably finds eigenscrew pitches, compliances and directions for well-conditioned matrices. Eigenscrew pitches and compliances can be found for ill-conditioned matrices. This analytical technique can be used to evaluate the static behaviour of a system. It may prove valuable as a design and analysis tool for biomechanics, robotics and automation.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an online trajectory modification scheme for biped robots to cope with uncertainty of their environment. The trajectory of the base link in the vertical direction is modified depending on the magnitude of zero moment point deviation from its safety boundary such that appropriate angular moment is generated to maintain stable walking. The modified trajectory then gradually returns to the original trajectory using a 3rd- or 5th-order interpolation polynomial. We expand the gravity-compensated inverted pendulum mode to generate the base-link trajectory not only for single support phases but also double support phases. In the simulations to evaluate the proposed scheme, an impedance controller is used to control a 6-DOF biped robot and the environment of the biped robot is assumed to consist of nonlinear and linear compliant contact models. The simulation results show that the proposed online trajectory modification scheme effectively enhances the stability of locomotion.",

To gain insight to the intricate mechanism of human motion, researchers sometimes use imaging technology to record the trajectories of humans performing various tasks. From these observations, they are able to estimate the forces and moments at each joint by an inverse dynamics computation. This problem is conceptually simple; however, in practice, the inverse solution requires the calculation of higher order derivatives of experimental observations contaminated by noise. The errors due to differentiation results in erroneous joint force and moment calculations. This paper provide a control theoretic framework for analyzing human motion which avoids derivative computations. The method is also suitable for synthesis of stable controllers for robotic and 'biorobic' applications which require tracking a desired reference trajectory under different loading conditions.",

Recent panoramic cameras present a very wide field of view from a single viewpoint. A single viewpoint is useful in mobile robotics for a number of reasons, including perspective reprojection and stereo analysis. However, the requirement of single viewpoint for panoramic cameras restricts the optical and geometrical design of these devices. In this paper we present a method for approximating a single viewpoint in panoramic devices that allows much greater freedom in design. We illustrate the method with a compact catadioptric device using a spherical mirror and standard optics, and apply it to perspective reprojection. The resultant panoramic camera has been integrated as a surveillance device on a small mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "During teleoperation, a human operator often receives only 2D visual feedback from the remote environment. While a variety of kinematic sensors exist on the remote manipulator for control purposes, the information inherent in these signals is rarely extracted and presented to the operator in a useful form. This paper investigates the extraction of such information through the development of an algorithm that estimates the geometric properties of a manipulated object and its environment using the remote robot sensors and knowledge of the task being performed. The focus of the paper is the development of contact constraint equations parametrized by the desired geometric properties and the automatic segmentation of the data stream according to the set of active contacts. The approach is validated for 3D peg-in-hole insertion using a desktop teleoperator system.",

The architecture can be divided into three layers, one for deliberation, one for task execution, and one reactive layer. Scalability and a high degree of flexibility have been primary design goals, making it easy to reconfigure the system. The system has been built in an object oriented fashion. An application of the architecture has been tested in a significant number of missions in our lab, where one room has been setup as an ordinary living room.",

In this paper, we propose a balance control method based on an off-line planned walking pattern with real-time modification. First, a method of generating a highly stable, smooth walking pattern is presented. Then, a method of real-time modification consisting of body posture control, actual zero moment point control and landing time control based sensor information is proposed. By combining the proposed off-line walking pattern with real-time modification, the biped robot can walk smoothly and adapt to unknown environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by dynamic simulator such as walking on unexpected irregular rough terrain, soft ground and in environments in the presence of disturbances.",

The pendulum has two rotational degrees of freedom and its base point is moved in two-dimensional space by a planar direct-drive robot. The robot has three degrees of freedom and its kinematic redundancy occurring at the inverse kinematics is utilized to optimize the joint acceleration and the manipulability measure. A decentralized joint acceleration control with a software velocity/acceleration observer, is used to accelerate/decelerate each joint of the robot to balance the pendulum. Experimental results are described to show the stable and robust responses of the control system.",

Utilization of a behavior-based controller makes the controller designing process easier and shorter, because the designer can deal with behavior controllers for simple behaviors independently, and after that can coordinate those behavior controllers in order for a robot to achieve the objective complex behavior. Some problems are still remaining. One is how to adjust the total behavior when the target task or environment is changed. We propose the method to adjust the behavior coordinator against some changes. This method adjusts the activation level of each behavior controller for the changes in fewer trials. It is applied to real brachiation robot control. The brachiation robot has a redundant mechanism to locomote from branch to branch like a long-armed ape.",

In this line of thought, the generalized inverse control scheme is tested through experiments that reveal the difficulties that often arise. Motivated by these problems this paper studies kinematics and dynamics of the trajectory planning scheme. The experiment confirm the nonlinear and chaotic performance of the algorithm and gives a deeper insight towards the future development of superior trajectory control systems.",

The multi-DOF ultrasonic motor consists of a bar-shaped stator and a spherical rotor. The spherical rotor is rotated around three perpendicular axes by the three natural vibrations excited on the stator. In the present study, the driving and control characteristics around one driving axis, which is perpendicular to the stator's geometric axis, are measured in detail, namely the relationship between the frequency of the input signal and the rotational speed, the relationship between the torque and the rotational speed and the step response of the ultrasonic motor, are measured. The maximum rotational speed and the maximum torque are 183 rpm and 5 mNm, respectively. The rotational speed was controlled successfully.",

The paper presents the solutions we have developed to maintain an acceptable precision of the vehicle positioning even during the satellite masking phases. By combining a gyro with steering angle and speed measurements, we show that it is possible to obtain satisfying performances in dead reckoning navigation with low-cost equipment. A forward-backward Kalman filter is proposed to deal with particularly long maskings, which typically occur when the compactor works under bridges. Experimental results carried out in the framework of a cooperation with the Laboratoire Central des Fonts et Chaussees and the Centre d'Experimentations Routieres are presented to validate the proposed solutions.",

The authors have developed a macroscopic actuator array consisting of many motorized wheels. As opposed to a MEMS array, the analysis requires the explicit modeling of the discreteness in the system, including the set of supports, distribution of weight, and generation of traction forces. Using an open-loop wheel velocity field, discreteness causes undesirable behavior such as unstable rotational equilibria, suggesting the use of object feedback. Discrete distributed control algorithms are derived by inverting the dynamics of manipulation. These algorithms reduce the many-input-three-output control problem to a three-input-three-output control problem.",

Given grasping points of m fingers not in form-closure, we show that the calculation of optimal grip points for the n-m fingers can be viewed as a nonlinear programming problem. We propose a sufficient and necessary condition for the n-m fingers to achieve an n-finger form-closure grasp with the m fingers given. Based on this condition, we derive a set of nonlinear constraints for the nonlinear programming problem. Furthermore, we give a performance index serving as an objective function which measures the distance between the center of mass of the grasped object and the contact points to be determined. In addition, the algorithm proposed can be applied to the frictionless grasp. We have implemented the algorithm and verified its efficiency by two examples.",

First, the relationship between the stick area and the internal strain distribution of the finger is calculated using FE (finite element) analysis. Based on this relationship, a method is proposed for controlling the grasping force by decreasing the increasing ratio of the tangential force when the stick area is decreasing. Finally, the grasping force is controlled using an actual elastic finger, which is made of silicone rubber and in which strain gages are incorporated. It is confirmed that objects can be grasped using adequate grasping force without complete slippage, even when the weight and the friction coefficient of the objects are unknown.",

The authors (1999) have proposed the following approach: 1) based on sensor information, tasks will be dynamically generated using task templates; 2) generation of task is tuned in quality by feeding back executed result and in the number by action suppression; 3) main part of the architecture consists of two real-time planner: priority-based task-assignment planner solved by using a linear programming method and motion planners based on short-time estimation. In this paper, we implement our task-assignment architecture on a real robot system and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by cooperative transport experiment in unknown environment.",

        "abstract": "Deadlock avoidance policies guarantee deadlock-free resource allocation to concurrent competing processes in flexible manufacturing systems. Most deadlock avoidance work in manufacturing deals with systems where each part requires a fired sequence of operations. In contrast, this paper deals with those systems that support sequencing flexibility, that is, the operations required by the part are partially ordered. In this setting, the order in which operations are performed is not predetermined, but becomes a real-time decision. Specifically, the paper characterizes the deadlock detection and avoidance problems for these systems, presents a sub-optimal deadlock avoidance approach, and addresses two relevant special structures on the partial orders for which optimal deadlock avoidance is of polynomial complexity.",

The first aspect is related to the convergence of the navigation system to the goal. It is shown how the dynamic system which drives the strategies can be analyzed by using classical concepts such as the Lyapunov functions. The second aspect concerns the conservativeness of the resulting navigation vector fields. It is shown how this deals with the repeatability of the trials. Furthermore, the selection of the best landmarks to perform the navigation processes strongly affects the conservativeness thus providing a formal way to do landmark learning. The theory has been tested with two different visual methods that have been derived from the biological world: the snapshot model and the landmark model.",

This biped is made of one trunk and two legs without feet, animated by means of four active articulations. This paper describes the design of the prototype, closely combining technological considerations and dynamics ones. The geometrical parameters and actuation characteristics are defined with the aim of generating walking and running gaits with rather large velocities. Each gait is synthesised with optimization criterion including the energy consideration with respect to actuator performances. During the single support phase and the flight phase, the biped is under-actuated. The synthesis of the corresponding trajectories is carried out by means of a local optimization method, and the cyclic constraints being handled as equality constraints. The optimal gear ratio of the speed reducers is computed.",

To achieve transparency and stability for a teleoperation of an underwater manipulator in unknown environments with time-varying uncertainties such as added mass, buoyancy, hydraulic drag and friction effect, an adaptive sliding mode control scheme is proposed for robust position tracking control of slave manipulator. To guarantee a force transparency in the master side, disturbance observer is used as a local controller for compensating a friction and coupled nonlinear dynamic effects of the master manipulator. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the transparency and robustness of the proposed controller.",

Walking can be classified into one-foot and two-foot standing during the common speed smooth walking. In two-foot standing, the weight of robot can be distributed to all joints. However, in one-foot standing, it is burdened to one foot, especially to ankle joint. So bigger actuator or even the passive joint is considered at the ankle joint; but bigger actuator increases the weight of robot and passive joint does not control ankle. When the small power actuator is used at all joints, ankle joint is sometimes overloaded during walking and this makes walking impossible. This problem is solved using the appropriate walking gait, that is, it depresses or distributes the driving power of the ankle joint when the load is applied to the ankle, and drives the ankle joint before the load is applied. By this method, the small power biped robot can be implemented without overloading the ankle joint. Experiments are conducted to prove the proposed method.",

During the quick stretching phase the leg tips slip over the ground surface and the platform moves for a small increment. Repetition of this procedure results in a continuous motion. Although the platform design is very simple, it is possible to achieve various motion speeds, very precise positioning and either translatory or complex planar motion. The prototype has been constructed and tested.",

This approach requires that the task-space trajectory be represented in terms of Fourier series. Various frequency components from this series are then used to generate the reference joint-space trajectories based on the natural frequencies of the respective subsystems. This approach is further extended for trajectory planning of an autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator system, where the underwater vehicle has much slower response than the on-board manipulator. The advantage of this proposed dynamics-based planning methodology is its ability to generate both kinematically admissible and dynamically feasible trajectories. Results from computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Jung and Gupta reported (1996) a representation, called octree distance map (ODM), for efficient collision detection in static environments. ODM captured partial distance information in a hierarchical manner and traded some memory (2 bytes per white node) for speed gains (as compared to an octree) in collision detection. In this paper, we propose a much more complete and systematic hierarchical representation for distance maps, the extended octree distance map (EODM). Like ODM, it utilizes an octree as the base representation. Along the perimeter of each white node in the octree, it stores a distance function that represents the distance of each boundary point of the white node to the obstacle closest to that point. As a result, EODM is more memory intensive than an ODM (and an octree), however, it would significantly decrease the collision detection time compared to either a conventional octree or the ODM. EODM is computed once and then repeatedly used for collision detection queries. We present algorithms for creating the EODM and use it for collision detection. Our preliminary experiments in 2D show that while EODM requires about three to five times more memory than an octree and four to five times extra memory than an ODM, it speeds up collision detection by a factor of three to six compared to an octree and by a factor of three to four as compared to an ODM.",

In the past, the problem has been studied by means of a number of formal frameworks, including the finite state automata (FSA) and Petri nets (PN). In this paper, it is shown that a significant class of deadlock avoidance policies (DAP), known as algebraic PK-DAP, originally developed in the FSA paradigm, can be analyzed using recent results from PN structural analysis. Furthermore, the approach to DAP analysis and design taken in this paper has led to the effective generalization of the currently available algebraic PK-DAP, and to their enrichment with new and more flexible policy implementations.",

        "abstract": "Generation of a stationary environmental map is one of the important tasks for vision based robot navigation. Observational errors in the generated environmental map accumulate in long movements of the robot. To generate a large environmental map, it is desirable not to assume known robot motion. In this paper, under the assumption of unknown translational motions of the robot, we propose a method to generate a stationary environmental map, and estimate the egomotion of a robot in a dynamic environment by using an omnidirectional image sensor. Since both robot and objects move in the environment, the stationary map generation and the robot egomotion estimation by using a single camera are difficult because of correspondence ambiguity caused by occlusion. The proposed method can detect a moving object and find occlusion and mismatching by evaluating the estimation error of each object location.",

        "abstract": "In this research, the problems of how to teach a robot to execute skilled operations are studied. Human workers usually accumulate his experience after executing the same task repetitively. In the process of training, the worker must find ways of adjusting his/her execution. In our system, the parameters for the impedance control scheme are used as the targets for adjustment. After mass amount of training, the worker is supposed to be able to execute deburring tasks successfully. This is because the worker might have gotten some knowledge about tuning the parameters required in the impedance control scheme. Thus, the rules for adjusting the parameters in impedance control are the operational skills to be identified. In this research, a training scheme, called the evolution-based virtual training scheme, is proposed in extracting knowledge for robotic deburring tasks. In this approach, an evolution strategy is employed for searching for the best set of fuzzy rules. This learning scheme has been successfully applied in adjusting the parameters of impedance controllers required in deburring operations. In general, the results of deburring are much more satisfactory when compared with those in previous research. When executing a deburring task, the robot simulator can find its optimal adjusting rules for parameters after several generations of evolution.",

We also present traversal techniques for accelerating distance queries using coherence and priority directed search. These algorithms have been used to perform proximity queries for applications including virtual prototyping, dynamic simulation, and motion planning on complex models.

        "abstract": "Accurate oculomotor control is one of the essential pre-requisites of successful visuomotor coordination. Given the variable nonlinearities of the geometry of binocular vision as well as the possible nonlinearities of the oculomotor plant, it is desirable to accomplish accurate oculomotor control through learning approaches. We investigate learning control for a biomimetic active vision system mounted on a humanoid robot. By combining a biologically inspired cerebellar learning scheme with a state-of-the-art statistical learning network, our robot system is able to acquire high performance visual stabilization reflexes after about 40 seconds of learning despite significant nonlinearities and processing delays in the system.",

        "abstract": "In order to detect potential problems of a cutter path, geometric verification of the NC milling result is necessary prior to actual machining. Result shape of the workpiece can be computed by subtracting the swept volume of a cutter moving along the path from a solid model representing the stock shape. In this paper, the authors propose an acceleration method of the subtracting operation using the hidden surface elimination mechanism of the 3 dimensional graphics hardware. Before the operation, component surfaces of the cutter swept volume must be tessellated. Computation time of the proposed method is proportional to the total number of polygons approximating the component surfaces. Some portions of the surfaces do not contribute the result shape of the workpiece. Our algorithm reduces the polygons by properly excluding such surface portions from the tessellation. An experimental program is implemented and computations of some sculptured surface milling results are demonstrated.",

The technique, which is based on the isolation of fault signatures via filtered torque prediction error estimates, does not require measurements or estimates of manipulator acceleration as is the case with some of the previously suggested methods. The method is formally demonstrated to be robust under uncertainty in the robot parameters. Furthermore, an adaptive version of the algorithm is introduced, and shown to both improve coverage and significantly reduce detection times. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experiments with a two-joint manipulator system.",

        "abstract": "A critical problem in sensory interpretation is the derivation of the right mapping between sensor signals and properties of the world. In this regard, the method proposed uses active sensing to acquire environmental features for reliable navigation in indoor environments. The features utilized are lines, corners, and edges extracted from common indoor room features such as walls, room corners and room edges, respectively. These features are abundant in indoor environments and allow for closed-form location estimates from time-of-flight sonar information. Subsequently, a multiple hypothesis testing procedure is utilized to accurately localize and identify those features. Experiments using a new active sonar system, implemented using a 3 DOF binaural sonar head, shows that the system is able to correctly localize and identify indoor environmental features, and that active sensing strategies based on sensor reconfiguration makes the process of feature extraction more accurate.",

A fingernail is instrumented with miniature LEDs and photodetectors in order to measure changes in the nail color when the fingertip is pressed against a surface. The fingernail sensor allows the fingers to directly contact the environment without obstructing the human's natural haptic senses. Reflectance photoplethysmography is used to measure the pattern of nail color, i.e., the blood content under the fingernail. Hemodynamic modeling, based on actual fingertip anatomy and physiology, is used to investigate the dynamics of the change in blood volume at multiple locations under the fingernail. An optical model is created to relate the blood volume to the light intensity measured by the photodetectors. The theoretical analysis is verified through model simulation and experimentation using a prototype fingernail sensor.",

Many different sensors have been developed over the past years to fit the requirements of different but very specific tasks. Special seam tracking sensors support the robot in welding applications. Vision systems are common in quality control and inspection. Force/torque sensors mounted to a robot's wrist are still an exception and limited to the fields of scientific research. Compared to the number of annual robot sales the number of sensor equipped robots is still negligible, although the benefits of sensory feedback are obvious.

For Earth-orbit applications the time delay is normally between 5-7 seconds. On the other hand, it is well known that task execution performance can be dramatically improved with the addition of some kind of force reflection (FR) to the operator, although time delay makes its application extremely difficult. This paper reports on several proposals to improve continuous teleoperation through long communication delays using force reflecting hand controllers. It also addresses the implementation of these ideas for the ground teleoperation of the ETS-7 satellite robot arm. Results of the first extensive application of FR for ground teleoperation of a real space robot are explained in detail.",

A new omni-directional sonar, which we developed, can measure accurate distance and direction of reflecting points, and an omnidirectional vision can give direction to edges of segment. We propose a sensor fusion method using both the reflecting points measured by the sonar and the edges of segment measured by the vision, based on the angles. Those data are different in character, so they compensate each other in the proposed method, and it becomes possible to get better information which are useful for environment recognition of mobile robots. We describe the proposed method and an experimental result to show its potential.",

        "abstract": "Redundant manipulators have more degrees of freedom (DOF) than the DOF of the task space. The redundancy resolution can be based on the kinematic or the dynamic equations of the manipulator. In the article, a dynamic level redundancy resolution is proposed. The manipulator dynamical model in the joint space is first transformed to a reduced-order model in the pseudovelocity space. The elements of the foregoing transformation matrix indirectly determine the contribution of each joint to the total motion. These elements are selected using a fuzzy logic based method so as to minimize the instantaneous manipulator power. A nullspace vector in the velocity relationship between the two spaces is determined by imposing a constraint on the continuity of the joint velocities at the time instant when the elements of the transformation matrix experience a discontinuity. The application of the proposed method to resolve the redundancy is illustrated by simulations.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the paper is the application of a geometrically consistent impedance concept to control interaction with the environment of a rigid object manipulated by a dual-robot system. A six-DOF impedance is specified at the object level to confer a compliant behavior for both the translational and the rotational motion when an external force and moment occurs at the contact. Geometric consistency is ensured thanks to the use of the unit quaternion to describe object frame orientation. The resulting object motion is decomposed into the equivalent motions at the end effectors of the two robots, via a task-oriented formulation. The control scheme is derived according to an inverse dynamics strategy with adoption of an inner motion loop providing robustness to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances. Experimental results on the two industrial robots available in the lab are discussed.",

The modelling and control strategy takes into account the dynamics of a velocity controlled 6 DOF manipulator as well as a simplified model of the camera and acquisition system in order to increase the bandwidth of the servo loop. multi-input multi-output (MIMO) generalized predictive control (GPC) is used to optimally control the visual loop with respect to the proposed dynamic model. The visual sensor used in the experiments is a high speed camera that allows to acquire 120 noninterlaced images per second. With this camera, we achieve a sampling frequency of 120 Hz for the visual loop. Experimental results on a 6 DOF industrial robot are presented that validate the proposed model. They show drastic improvement of the loop performance with respect to more classical control strategies like PID type control.",

Among the most pressing of the requirements are actuation systems that can interact in a safer and more natural way. Pneumatic technology has many of the compliance forms needed for this softer interaction and a number of new systems based on McKibben muscles have been developed in recent years. In this paper a new model of operation of pneumatic muscle systems is developed. In particular, the model considers the distortion effects at the termination nodes and the radial pressure loss due to rubber elasticity. The new model is compared experimentation on a very large actuator and shows how this new model improves the assessment of forces and displacement that can be achieved by the actuator. The new model is compared against previous systems models.",

The system can recognize an infant's status (quiet, moving and crying), posture, body parts' positions and movement unrestrainedly. It can, in recognizing the behavior, cope with the infant's rapid growth and unique physique. The algorithm of the infant behavior recognition system is summarized as follows. 1) First, the system measures the pressure distribution image with 384 pressure sensors distributed in the bed. 2) The authors propose \"activity score\"; this is calculated by using the measured pressure distribution image and indicates kinetic energy of the infant's activity. Based on the activity score, the system decides the infant's status. 3) If the infant is quiet, the system estimates the infant's physique. 4) Based on the estimated physique, the system recognizes the infant's posture and body part movement. Experimental results reveal that the system successfully recognizes infants' status (quiet, moving and crying), posture, body parts position and movements.",

        "abstract": "Visual-servoing tasks for mobile robots characteristically require the processing of vast amounts of navigational information which can impede the performance of even the most well designed systems. This paper investigates the idea of using a simple human-based strategy to guide a mobile robot to intercept a projectile. This vision based control strategy relies on a single image-based parameter whose sign corresponds to a decision whether to run forward or backward for successful interception. Assuming the ball can be tracked easily in real time by the robot's vision system, motion decision making and control computations are minimized. We examine and develop several motion control strategies which incorporate the robot's velocity and acceleration in addition to this human-based strategy. The simplest strategy is tested on a mobile robot and demonstrates results similar to a human.",

We derive the sufficient conditions in order for the hand to make the desired contact and avoid collision. These conditions are then formulated as a constrained nonlinear global optimization problem, whose solution yields a definitive answer to kinematic graspability for a grasp configuration.

A fundamental problem is that odometry-based dead reckoning cannot be used to assign accurate global position information to a map because of drift errors caused by wheel slippage. The paper introduces a fast, online method of learning globally consistent maps, using only local metric information. The approach differs from previous work in that it is computationally cheap, easy to implement and is guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution. Experiments are presented in which large, complex environments were successfully mapped by a real robot, and quantitative performance measures are used to assess the quality of the maps obtained.",

        "abstract": "Presents a rapid localization method for mobile robots. Localization, i.e., absolute position measurement, is an important issue since odometer errors render it impossible for any robot to precisely follow a specified trajectory, resulting in a growing difference between the actual configuration and the calculated configuration as the robot travels. Periodic localization is required to correct these errors. We propose a localization method using range sensor data which is based on simple geometric properties of the environment. In many common situations, information regarding the environment is provided a priori for path planning. During processing, the method proposed here utilizes this information to partition the workspace into sectors using simple visibility computations, and a small identifying label is computed for each sector. The localizer analyzes range sensor readings (distances) and extracts characteristic points, which are compared with the pre-computed sector labels to localize the robot, first to a sector, and then to a particular configuration within that sector. Advantages of this two step process are that it is computationally very simple, and that it allows precise localization without any landmarks from any configuration in the environment. This localization method also provides opportunities for the global navigation procedure to analyze and select trajectories in terms of their tolerance to localization errors.",

Two types of springs are used: simple and complex. The term simple spring refers to a purely translational or purely rotational passive spring while a complex spring couples translational and rotational components. Any symmetric positive definite spatial stiffness matrix can be realized with a parallel connection of such springs. However, to reduce the compliance mechanism's complexity, it is desirable to minimize the number of complex springs. This article presents a method for determining minimal realizations for any symmetric positive definite or semi-definite spatial stiffness matrix. These realizations are minimal in the sense that they minimize both the number of complex springs and the total number of springs.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to make a contribution to the mobile robot self-localization problem, when the initial position is unknown. It is assumed that a simple map of the environment, consisting of a list of 2D-edge coordinates is available. These are regarded as natural or artificial landmarks. It is further assumed that the position of edges can be detected by a sensor in the local coordinate frame of the robot. From every pair of feature measures and map-landmarks, hypotheses of the robot-pose are constructed. These are regarded as measurement inputs into the probabilistic data association using Bayesian formulation (PDAB) approach. The presented first results demonstrates that the suggested method in combination with low level features is a promising approach for self-localization in unstructured and sparse modeled environments.",

        "abstract": "Inverse kinematics computation using an artificial neural network that learns the inverse kinematics of a robot arm has been employed by many researchers, However, conventional learning methodologies do not pay enough attention the the discontinuity of the inverse kinematics system of typical robot arms with joint limits. The inverse kinematics system of the robot arms is a multi-valued and discontinuous function. Since it is difficult for a well-known multi-layer neural network to approximate such a function, a correct inverse kinematics model for the end-effector's overall position and orientation cannot be obtained by using a single neural network. In order to overcome the discontinuity of the inverse kinematics function, we propose a modular neural network system for the inverse kinematics model learning. We also propose the online learning and control method for trajectory tracking.",

The motion estimates and the feature correspondence measures are determined in order to minimize a cost function. The performance of this algorithm was evaluated with experiments carried out in real cluttered indoor environments.",

The planning strategy was tested using a PUMA type robot arm integrated into a LENS/sup TM/ (Laser Engineered Net Shape) system. Previous systems relied on a series of x, y, and z stages, to provide a minimal coordinated motion control capability. This limited the complexity of geometries that could be constructed. With the coordinated motion provided by a robotic arm, the system can produce three dimensional parts by \"writing\" material onto any face of existing material. The motion planning strategy relied on solid model geometry evaluation and exploited robotic positioning flexibility to allow the construction of geometrically complex parts. The integration of the robotic manipulator into the LENS/sup TM/ system was tested by producing metal parts directly from CAD models.",

        "abstract": "We propose a motion planning method for cooperative transportation of a large object by multiple mobile robots in a 3 dimensional environment. This task has various kinds of problems, such as path planning, manipulation and so on. All of these problems can't be solved at once, since computational time is exploded. Accordingly, we divide a motion planner into a local manipulation planner and a global path (motion) planner, and design these two planners respectively, and we integrate two planners. Namely, we aim at integrating a gross motion planner and a fine motion planner. As to the local manipulation planner, we build a manipulation technique, which is suitable for mobile robots by position control. We compute conditions, in which the object becomes unstable during manipulation, and generate each robot's motion considering the robots' motion errors and indefinite factors from the planning stage. As to the global path planner, we reduce the dimensions of the configuration space (C-space) using the feature of transportation by mobile robots. We can find a solution with searching in this smaller dimensional C-space using the potential field defined in the C-space, and constraints of the object manipulation are considered as the potential function. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed motion planning method through simulations and experiments.",

The approach is based on using pairs of robots that observe each other's behavior, acting in concert to reduce odometry errors. We assume the robots can both directly sense nearby obstacles and see each other. This allows the robots to obtain a map of higher accuracy than would be possible with robots acting independently by reducing inaccuracies that occur over time from dead reckoning errors. Furthermore, by exploiting the ability of the robots to see each other, we can detect opaque obstacles in the environment independently of their surface reflectance properties. Two different algorithms, based on the size of the environment, are introduced with a complexity analysis, and experimental results in simulation and with real robots.",

        "abstract": "Force-reflection is significantly important in complex teleoperations. This study aims to develop a practical force-reflecting teleoperator through the Internet, and supposes the time delay in the order of several hundred milliseconds. Since the transmission delays existing in network vary rapidly and possibly randomly, it is very difficult to ensure the stability. Accordingly, in this paper, the time-varying controllers, which are adjusted to the round trip time delay observed online are designed based on the framework of the H/sub /spl infin// gain-scheduling. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments of the bilateral teleoperation through the Internet.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the processing of sonar signals using neural networks for robust differentiation of commonly encountered features in indoor environments. The neural network can differentiate more targets, and achieves high differentiation and localization accuracy, improving on previously reported methods. It achieves this by exploiting the identifying features in the differential amplitude and time-of-flight characteristics of these targets. An important observation follows from the robustness tests, which indicate that the amplitude information is more crucial than time-of-flight for reliable operation. The study suggests wider use of neural networks and amplitude information in sonar-based mobile robotics.",

It contains control mechanisms developed from flight-simulator experience to allow precise motion and force-control using very low-force input. The robot constrains the tool motion to a safe region using methods developed for robotic surgery. These regions are defined pre-operatively using MRI segmentation techniques developed with the help of a simulator, ROBO-SIM. The intraoperative target location is tracked in real-time using ultrasound transducers. By applying updates using the ultrasound probe, safety is maintained by compensating for brain-shift. The overall system is being evaluated on phantoms.",

Solving the optimal control problem reliably requires computing exact analytic gradients of the objective function, which is made possible by a hybrid recursive algorithm that calculates the dynamics of the system. This algorithm is formulated with Lie algebra techniques and matrix exponentials, resulting in equations that are easily differentiable. This quality is essential when solving ill-conditioned systems such as the diver. Also, the importance of initial conditions in light of the constant angular momentum constraint is discussed.",

The subsequent inertial forces and moments are calculated by using the Newton-Euler formulation assuming known inertial parameters (mass, center of mass, inertia tensor) of the payload. An extended Kalman filter is employed to perform the estimation of the sensor gain matrix based on the measurements of the manipulator velocity and the sensor outputs. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated by simulation.",

        "abstract": "We describe a technique which enables a fuzzy-logic based robot control system to automatically determine the membership functions (MF) of the input sensors online and in a short time interval. There is a necessity for such online self-calibration for fast changing and dynamic environments such as agricultural environments and difficult or inaccessible environments, such as nuclear reactors, underwater and space environments. In these media the robot has to learn the appropriate MF with no human intervention taking into account the difference in sensor characteristics in the different environments and changes in production requirements and repairing or otherwise upgrading robots. So there is a necessity to find a fast converging algorithm that can calibrate the MF online in real time with no need for human intervention or simulation. our work reports on an approach based on the use of a modified genetic algorithm to evolve the fuzzy MF of the individual behaviours. The MF of four behaviours were learnt online in an average time of 4 minutes for each behaviour in an outdoor environment. These learnt behaviours were then co-ordinated and tested in complex and dynamic environments in which the robot gave a very good response.",

Standard visual servoing techniques can then be applied to tract the given trajectory. In this paper, we have applied the idea to 2D and 3D (kinematic) motion planning and discussed the mechanisms for taking advantage of surplus features and incorporating other image-based constraints, such as that the targets always remain in the field of view.",

In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) embedded search strategy over a hybrid color-timed Petri-net (HCTPN) for wafer fabrication is proposed. Through the HCTPN model, all possible behaviors of the wafer manufacturing systems such as WIP status and machine status can be completely tracked down by the reachability graph of the net. The chromosome representation of the search nodes in GA is constructed directly from the HCTPN model, recording the information about the appropriate scheduling policy for each workstation in the fabrication. A better chromosome found by GA is received by the HCTPN based schedule builder, and then a near-optimal schedule is generated.",

        "abstract": "Predictive displays have proven their suitability to compensate time delays in visual feedback which impair the performance of teleoperation applications. Most current implementations employ simple computer graphics for the prediction of the visual feedback given to the operator who is controlling the remote manipulation. Furthermore, they require a well-known remote environment. The aim of the presented work is to improve the efficacy of the predictive display by increasing the degree of immersion and by enhancing the system's flexibility. Potential applications include maintenance and repair of machines located in remote plant- or office-type environments, which are typically non-static and a priori only partially known. Communication media are high- and medium-bandwidth LANs and WANs inducing round trip delays varying from 0.2 to 2 seconds. Additionally, a sufficient bandwidth cannot be assured during the entire remote operation. The paper describes a predictive display system which achieves photo-realism based on autonomously explored and updated scene models. Model acquisition is performed with a binocular CCD camera system. Photo-realism is obtained by using computer graphics techniques, especially the mapping of original, real textures. Besides the concepts, an early stage of implementation and first experimental results in scene reconstruction and photo-realistic scene prediction are presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper overviews Q2, an algorithm for optimizing the expected output of a multi-input noisy continuous function. Q2 is designed to need only a few experiments, it avoids strong assumptions on the form of the function, and it is autonomous in that it requires little problem-specific tweaking. These capabilities are directly applicable to industrial processes, and may become increasingly valuable elsewhere as the machine learning field expands beyond prediction and function identification, and into embedded active learning subsystems in robots, vehicles and consumer products. Four existing approaches to this problem (response surface methods, numerical optimization, supervised learning, and evolutionary methods) all have inadequacies when the requirement of \"black box\" behavior is combined with the need for few experiments. Q2 uses instance-based determination of a convex region of interest for performing experiments. In conventional instance-based approaches to learning, a neighborhood was defined by proximity to a query point. In contrast, Q2 defines the neighborhood by a new geometric procedure that captures the size and shape of the zone of possible optimum locations. Q2 also optimizes weighted combinations of outputs, and finds inputs to produce target outputs. We compare Q2 with other optimizers of noisy functions on several problems, including a simulated noisy process with both nonlinear continuous dynamics and discrete-event queueing components. Results are encouraging in terms of both speed and autonomy.",

The queueing model includes analyzer and predictor modules. The system analyzer module provides the analysis of arrival pattern and service pattern for each tool group. The system predictor module provides the forecast of important performance measures, such as products cycle time, lots remaining cycle time, tool utilization, queueing length, tool moves, stage moves. In addition, a modularized system, QFAB, is designed to implement the model proposed. A systematic analysis of arrival pattern and service pattern for tool groups is proposed. An approach to compute the effective tool number for tool groups is also addressed. Based on the analysis, the supervisors can gain more insights and choose the proper queueing models. Comparing the obtained results to the actual fab data, the accuracy of prediction of cycle time is satisfactory.",

Given a trajectory for the gripper to follow, a tracking algorithm for the manipulator is designed, and at the same time the base motions are generated in such a way that the base is coordinated with the gripper. Furthermore, it is shown that the method allows arbitrary upper and lower bounds on the gripper-base distance to be set and this can be achieved without introducing deadlocks into the system. The solution also ensures that the control effort, spent on slow base motions, is kept small.",

In the past few years many successful attempts have been made to use the Internet as a command transmission media; through which control can be sent to remote systems and feedback can be obtained. But with this media come several limitations: delay, lost packets and disconnection. All of these limitations may cause instability in the system especially if the system loop is closed. All the previous work addressing these problems assumed several conditions; for example, time delay is constant or has an upper bound, control is not in real-time. A new real-time control approach is presented that deals with these limitations without any assumptions made regarding delay. The approach is based on event-based control, which was implemented on a mobile robot over the Internet. The commands sent to the robot are velocity and the feedback is force based on the environment. It will be shown that this approach results in a stable system. In addition, a new force feedback generation method is used.",

Registration occurs by aligning the regions that are common to multiple images. The largest difficulty in performing this registration is dealing with outliers and local minima while remaining efficient. A commonly used technique, iterative closest point, is efficient but is unable to deal with outliers or avoid local minima. Another commonly used optimization algorithm, simulated annealing, is effective at dealing with local minima but is very slow. Therefore, the algorithm developed in this paper is a hybrid algorithm that combines the speed of iterative closest point with the robustness of simulated annealing. Additionally, a robust error function is incorporated to deal with outliers. This algorithm is incorporated into a complete modeling system that inputs two sets of range data, registers the sets, and outputs a composite model.",

        "abstract": "The control of multi-fingered robot hands has been the subject of interest. To manipulate some object with regrasping motion, there are many parameters to be determined; the grasping points, grasping forces, regrasping phases, finger allocation and so on. It is difficult to optimize such manipulation parameters for achieving effective manipulation. We propose a generation method of regrasping motion for a four-fingered robot hand using evolutionary programming (EP). In this case, EP determines not only finger motions, but also rotation of the target object in order to increase its manipulability. In manipulating an object like a rectangular solid, it is very important to change the object directions and to grasp another face according to the task progress because the grasping faces tend to be limited to only two. The evolutionary optimization method is generally able to find optimal solutions without a supervisor after much iteration, which makes it almost impractical to apply a real robot directly. Therefore we control the real robot hand with an optimal controller that has been generated in computer simulations. We show the effectiveness of the proposed acquisition method for the regrasping motion with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Various coordinated control schemes are explored in the multi-operator-multi-robot (MOMR) tele-collaborative system through a network with time delay. Multi-robot cooperation has rapidly emerged in many possible applications such as the plant maintenance, construction, and surgery, because it would have a significant advantage over a single robot in such cases. Thus, time-delayed control of a multi-robot system is expected to play an important role in remote operations, too. However, the effect of time-delay would pose a more difficult problem to the MOMR teleoperation systems and seriously affect their performance. In this work, first, we have built an experimental system to investigate the remote cooperation in MOMR teleoperation. Then, different coordinated control methods are proposed to cope with the collision, arising from the time delay over the network. To verify the validity of the proposed schemes, we have carried out various experiments on a planar block arrangement by two slave arms employing graphic simulators and a LAN subject to a significant communication delay.",

        "abstract": "Based on resource-oriented Petri net models of automated manufacturing systems (AMS), and Wu's previous work (1999) on a necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock-free operation, this paper proposes a new control policy such that deadlock is completely avoided, starvation and blocking situations are reduced and sometimes eliminated. It attempts to release an appropriate number of jobs into the system and control the order of resource usage based on state information in the net model. The theoretical results for the correctness of this policy are presented. A simple AMS is used to demonstrate its great potential to high utilization and productivity.",

        "abstract": "An important aim of robotics is to design and build machines that can recognize and exploit opportunities afforded by new situations. Traditionally in artificial intelligence, this task has fallen on abstract representations, but that has left the problem of how to ground the representations in sensorimotor activity. The paper proposes a computational architecture whereby a mobile robot internalizes representations based on its experience. The paper examines a fast online learning algorithm that allows the robot to build up a mapping of how its motor signals transform sensory data. The author also proposes a way of categorizing object affordances according to their internal effects. Based on these effects, wavelet analysis is applied to sensory data to uncover invariance, thus abstracting a representation of goals. Finally, heuristics are explored for projecting a learned sensorimotor mapping into the future to attain these goals.",

It measures the imbalance between the end-effector accelerations achievable in different directions. Prior to this, no measure of this characteristic was adequate for a six degree-of-freedom manipulator because its end-effector motions are referenced to a mix of linear and angular coordinates. The proposed measure addresses both linear and angular accelerations. It also indicates oversized actuators, since this contributes to the imbalance in achievable accelerations. The development of this measure is based on the formulation of the motion isotropy hypersurface. The shape of this hypersurface is a weak indicator a acceleration isotropy.",

In the paper an algorithm for the optimal path-planning of rigid formations of mobile robots is considered for a case in which the path cost index is given by the sum of all distances covered by the robots in the group. The proposed solution method provides an approximate solution to the problem based on a discretization of the configuration space of the formation. A dynamic programming algorithm is used then to find the optimal path in configuration space. Several examples are introduced to show the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic programming method as compared to three heuristic strategies which are also devised in the paper.",

Furthermore, this work employs physical robots as the actors, employing the real-time sensor values from the robots as inputs into the acting process.

The time optimal trajectory for a mass-damper system is determined and given as a reference input to the system. The feedback controller is constructed so that the fine stage tracks the coarse stage errors. The controller is robustly designed as the \"perturbation compensated sliding mode control\" law, which is a combination of sliding mode controller and perturbation observer. In addition, a null motion controller which regulates the fine stage at its neutral position is designed based on the \"dynamic consistency\" and, as a result, the overall dual-stage servo system exhibits robust and time-optimal performance.

A speedy recognition is achieved by operating on a stream of filtered 3D sensor features, reconstructed for navigation tasks of the robot, instead of using a separate sensor data processing. Furthermore, simple, inexpensive recognition strategies are applied. Robustness is obtained by integrating complementary recognition strategies: four indexing techniques and two (2D and 3D) matching methods for verification, are completed by a hypothesis promotion, based on feedback of information to the sensor system. All strategies differ in their requirements, reliability, selectivity, and temporal constraints. Hypotheses are integrated using fusion, ruling out, and aging techniques. The approach is evaluated experimentally with varying calibration errors, scene complexity, and sensing conditions.",

For manipulating multiple objects, there are two key issues which do not arise in the manipulation, of a single object, (1) each object's motion is restricted by the other objects, and (2) the contact force among objects is not controlled directly. As for (1), we first formulate the motion constraint for the whole grasp system, and then provide a necessary condition for manipulating multiple objects uniquely. As for (2), we provide a condition for determining the contact forces among objects uniquely. We further show a sufficient condition for manipulating multiple objects within the object motion constraint. Under this sufficient condition, we propose a control scheme for object motion by taking the motion constraint into account. An experimental result is provided to confirm our idea.",

        "abstract": "Many approaches to visual servoing and mobile robot navigation are based on tracking feature points or landmarks in images, but not all features points are equally effective as landmarks. Here we develop methods for selecting within an image those landmarks which are both perceptually salient and visually distinctive, and consequently are readily recognized in a second image acquired from a different viewpoint. Empirically, we characterize the performance of the recognition method and then demonstrate that the selection process does in fact choose the landmarks which are more likely to be recognized.",

        "abstract": "Presents a systematic approach for developing a concise self-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (SANFIS) with a fast hybrid parameter learning algorithm for online learning the control knowledge for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The multi-layered structure of SANFIS incorporates fuzzy basis functions for better function approximations. Based on the need of different applications, we investigate three SANFIS structures with three different types of fuzzy IF-THEN-rule-based models and cast the rule formation problem as a clustering problem. A recursive least squares algorithm and a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with limited memory are exploited to accelerate the learning process. Thus, incorporating an online clustering technique, a fast hybrid learning procedure and rule examination, the SANFIS is capable of self-organizing and self-adapting its internal structure for learning the required control knowledge for an AUV to follow desired trajectories. Computer simulations for modeling a control system for an AUV have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SANFIS.",

The motion of a single wheel robot is analyzed using Lagrangian dynamics with no assumption that the robot is constrained to remain vertical. We linearized the dynamic model around the position perpendicular to the surface and proposed a state feedback controller for preventing the robot falling over. The backstepping control was designed to stabilize the robot following a straight path with a general heading angle. The feasibility and efficiency of the method are then validated by simulation study.",

(ii) This structure converts a small displacement into a concentrated large strain. (iii) Each unit doesn't interfere with the other units by piling up structures. (iv) The lateral rigidity is high. We propose this structure for a piezoelectric vibrating gyroscope (angular rate sensor), and detected angular rate using this gyroscope. In this paper is shown the method for super sensitizing by bringing two resonance frequencies (drive resonance frequency and sensing resonance frequency) close together. Then we propose the suppression method of the mechanical coupling that arises by bringing two resonance frequencies close. From this result, this structure suits for the gyroscope. Experimental results are shown.",

To shorten this programming time and minimize the effort, we have been developing a system which we refer to as \"assembly-plan-from-observation (APO) system;\" this system provides the ability for a robot to observe a human performing an assembly tasks, understand the tasks, and subsequently generate a program to perform that same task. One of the necessary tasks in APO is to create a trajectory of robot hand movement from observing human performance. The previous system developed a direct observation method based on the trajectory of a human movement. Though simple and handy, the system was susceptible to noise. This paper proposes a method to make the observation robust against noise by using symbolic representations of a trajectory based on contact analysis. The system divides the trajectory into small segments based on the contact analysis, then allocates an operation element referred to as a sub-skill to those segments; the result is a robust trajectory-based APO system.",

We show that, regardless of the number of joints or the configuration of the links, there exists a subspace within the 21-dimensional compliance matrix space that cannot be reached by a simple serial elastic mechanism. This restriction is shown to be dual to the restriction on the stiffness matrices associated with simple parallel mechanisms. Although analogous to each other, the two restrictions correspond to different elastic behaviors. A procedure to synthesize any realizable compliance matrix with a simple serial mechanism is provided. The dualities and differences between the parallel and serial cases are discussed.",

Real-time simulation is synchronized with actual disasters, computing complex relationship between various damage factors and agent behaviors. A mission-critical man-machine interface provides portability and robustness of disaster mitigation centers, and augmented-reality interfaces for rescue parties in real disasters.

        "abstract": "This paper describes the progress of the BIP2000 project. This project is aimed at the realization of the lower part of an anthropomorphic biped robot. The robot consists of two legs, two feet, a pelvis and a trunk. It has 15 active joints. The mass distribution, the kinematics and the capacities of the robot in terms of joint torques are close to the ones of humans. The transmissions are specific screw/nut-based systems which have good dynamic performances and small size. They are arranged in parallel at the ankles and at the trunk/pelvis linkage. The control schemes are either based on a control of the center of mass associated with suitable task functions, or take dynamically into account the unilateral constraints foot/ground. The robot has been built and tested, the computer control architecture has been realized and connected with the robot, and the basic control schemes have been implemented.",

        "abstract": "Rapid prototyping has been widely known as being able to fabricate 3D object with complex geometric shapes. Rapid prototyping can shorten the product development cycle and improve the design process by providing rapid and effective feedback to the designer, thus help a company keep ahead in a rapidly changing market. This paper presents software and hardware technologies of building LCD display based rapid prototyping system. Software design includes slicing algorithm, LCD photomask display process, user interface and motion control program. Hardware configuration of this architecture includes LCD photomask, optical system, z-axis elevator, resin supply system and PC based control system. After slicing process, the cross section contour of each layer is transferred to the LCD projector that is used for photomask. The optical system emits parallel light upwardly through the mask to expose and solidify the entire layer at once. After one layer is completed, the platform with the part rises and a new layer of photopolymer is applied to the bottom plate. After the sweep roller wipes the resin, the LCD photomask displays the cross sectional contour of the next layer. At this moment, the platform moves downwards to the correct height, and the next layer is cured subsequently. This process is done repeatedly until the whole part is finished. This LCD display based rapid prototyping system can operate smoothly and quietly.",

First, using a recursive reduction technique, we transform the problem in 6D wrench space to one in three dimensions. Then we rewrite the sufficient and necessary condition for form-closure grasps in the equivalent form of the inconsistency of each of the two sets of linear inequalities. Then we propose three conditions to check the inconsistency of the inequality system, which geometrically indicates whether the convex region formed by the inequality system is empty. We have implemented the algorithms and confirmed their real-time efficiency for the synthesis of 3D form-closure grasps.",

The algorithm consists of four steps: (i) the structure of the dynamic equations is exploited to embed the dynamic equations explicitly into the constraints; (ii) the inequalities in the space of joint angles and their derivatives are inner approximated by a set of linear inequalities, i.e., a polytope; (iii) a feasible trajectory is then sought within a class of basis functions by using a discrete collocation grid in time where the inequalities are satisfied; and (iv) the feasible trajectories are characterized in terms of a convex set of the coefficients associated with the basis functions. The approach is illustrated in theory and experiments with a master-slave dual-arm manipulation system.",

We present a new approach to parts orienting through the manipulation of pose distributions. Through dynamic simulation we can determine the pose distribution for an object being dropped from an arbitrary height on an arbitrary surface. By varying the drop height and the shape of the support surface we can find the initial conditions that will result in a pose distribution with minimal entropy. We attempt to uniquely orient a part with high probability just by varying the initial conditions. We derive a condition on the pose and velocity of an object in contact with a sloped surface that will allow us to quickly determine the final resting configuration of the object. This condition can then be used to quickly compute the pose distribution. We also show simulation and experimental results which confirm that our dynamic simulator can be used to find the true pose distribution of an object.",

        "abstract": "Traditional fuzzy controllers or artificial neural networks are constrained by standardized formal procedures and structural restrictions. While in general it is guaranteed that these approaches or their integration can solve a quite wide class of problems, their \"orthodox\" application may result in too complicated control not exploiting the peculiarities of the given task under consideration. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that unconventional integration of simple elements such as classic PID/ST, regression analysis, saturated sigmoid transition functions, fuzzy sets and uniform structures obtained from the Lagrangian classical mechanics instead of the connection structure of a feedforward artificial neural networks can result in a simple and efficient adaptive control for robots involved in unknown environmental dynamic interaction. Due to their simplicity and reduced number of parameters real time tuning can be carried out in these structures. Most of the parameters are independent of the particular problem to be solved and neither \"scaling problems\" nor \"network paralysis\" occur during the learning phase. It is concluded that the different components of the control can successfully co-operate in finding the \"proper\" system model even in the case of very rough initial model estimation and external interaction.",

        "abstract": "The kinematically decoupled joint space decomposition (KD-JSD) is proposed as a systematic method for synthesis of dynamic control of kinematically redundant manipulators. The method leads to a proper control for direct specification and control of the self-motion of kinematically redundant manipulators, as well as the task motion. To cover various possibilities in specifying desired self-motion behaviors the conventional gradient projection method and task priority based method are reformulated within the framework of the KD-JSD. The validity of the proposed control method is shown experimentally adopting a three degrees-of-freedom direct-drive planar redundant manipulator.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We are developing paradigms and algorithms for browsing and editing families of animation using a haptic force-feedback device called a Phantom. These techniques may be generalized to navigation of any high degree-of-freedom system from a lower degree-of-freedom control space, with applications to telerobotics and simulation of virtual humans. We believe that modeling the animation configuration space coupled with the highly interactive nature of the haptic device provides one with useful and intuitive means of control. We have implemented our ideas in a system for the manipulation of animation motion capture data; in particular, anthropomorphic figures with 57 degrees of freedom are controlled by the user in real time. We treat trajectories, which encode animation, as first-class objects; haptic manipulation of these trajectories results in change to the animation. We have several haptic editing modes in which these trajectories are either haptically deformed or performed by the user with expressive control subject to dynamic haptic constraints.",

        "abstract": "Compensating for friction is considered in the paper using the variable structure systems approach. First, variable structure-based observers are developed for friction estimation in mechanical systems with or without information of velocity. The estimates are then used for a model-based feedforward compensation for friction. For a non-model based approach, a robust sliding mode controller can also be used to cancel the influence of friction. Sigmoidal functions are used in lieu of signum functions to reduce chattering. Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed technique to compensate for friction of both static and dynamic models.",
