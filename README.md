## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonstraveladventures/paper-search-interface.git
   cd paper-search-interface
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   # On Unix/Linux/macOS:
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   
   # On Windows:
   install.bat
   ```

3. **Start the web interface**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:5001`

## GitHub Pages (Static Hosting)

You can host a static version (no backend required) directly on GitHub Pages:

1. A static site is in `docs/` and loads `docs/data.json` client-side.
2. The build script `tools/build_static.py` generates `docs/data.json` from `all_papers.csv`.
3. A workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds and publishes `docs/` to Pages.

Steps:
- Push to `main`. The workflow will run and deploy.
- In GitHub repository settings ‚Üí Pages, set Source to ‚ÄúGitHub Actions‚Äù.
- Your site will be available at the repository Pages URL.

Note: `docs/data.json` is large (~60 MB). Pages will serve it, but initial load can be slow. If needed, consider:
- Splitting by year into multiple JSON files
- Lazy-loading by selected years/conferences
- Hosting the JSON on an external CDN

## Usage

### Basic Search
- Enter keywords in the title search box
- Type author names in the author search box
- Use the year range sliders to filter by publication year

### Advanced Filtering
- **Countries**: Select specific countries or entire continents
- **Venues**: Choose conferences organized by research subfield
- **Bulk Selection**: Use buttons to select all countries, African countries, or venues

### Export Results
- Click the "üì• Export to CSV" button to download search results
- The exported file includes all paper metadata

## Data Attribution

This tool includes data from [Paper Copilot](https://papercopilot.com). Please ensure you comply with their [Terms and Conditions](https://papercopilot.com/policy/terms-and-conditions/) when using this tool.

### Mapping and cartogram sources
- The inline map is a choropleth built with [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [world-atlas TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas).
- A separate cartogram prototype was explored using Max Roser‚Äôs world population cartogram data via [mattdzugan/World-Population-Cartogram](https://github.com/mattdzugan/World-Population-Cartogram) (not required for the main interface).
