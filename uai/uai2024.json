        "author": "Abhishek Sinha",
        "abstract": "Classic no-regret multi-armed bandit algorithms, including the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Hedge, and EXP3, are inherently unfair by design. Their unfairness stems from their objective of playing the most rewarding arm as frequently as possible while ignoring the rest. In this paper, we consider a fair prediction problem in the stochastic setting with a guaranteed minimum rate of accrual of rewards for each arm. We study the problem in both full-information and bandit feedback settings.

However, they often suffer from slow inference times. To address this challenge, Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) have emerged as a promising solution. BPC methods aim to create a small synthetic dataset, known as pseudo-coresets, that approximates the posterior inference achieved with the original dataset. This approximation is achieved by optimizing a divergence measure between the true posterior and the pseudo-coreset posterior. Various divergence measures have been proposed for constructing pseudo-coresets, with forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence being the most successful.

        "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) excel in uncertainty quantification (UQ) by estimating the posterior distribution of model parameters, yet face challenges due to the high computational demands of Bayesian inference. Evidential deep learning methods address this by treating target distribution parameters as random variables with a learnable conjugate distribution, enabling efficient UQ. However, there\u2019s debate over whether these methods can accurately estimate epistemic uncertainty due to their single-network, sampling-free nature. In this paper, we combine the strengths of both approaches by distilling BNN knowledge into a Dirichlet-based model, endowing it with a Bayesian perspective and theoretical guarantees. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements to further improve the integration of Bayesian UQ with Dirichlet-based models. To relax the heavy computational load with BNNs, we introduce a self-regularized training strategy using Laplacian approximation (LA) for self-distillation.

Evidential deep learning methods address this by treating target distribution parameters as random variables with a learnable conjugate distribution, enabling efficient UQ. However, there\u2019s debate over whether these methods can accurately estimate epistemic uncertainty due to their single-network, sampling-free nature. In this paper, we combine the strengths of both approaches by distilling BNN knowledge into a Dirichlet-based model, endowing it with a Bayesian perspective and theoretical guarantees. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements to further improve the integration of Bayesian UQ with Dirichlet-based models. To relax the heavy computational load with BNNs, we introduce a self-regularized training strategy using Laplacian approximation (LA) for self-distillation. To alleviate the conjugate prior assumption, we employ an expressive normalizing flow for refining the model in a post-processing manner, where a few training iterations can enhance model performance. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in both UQ accuracy and robustness.}\n}",

Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.",

Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Rating elicitation is a success element for recommender systems to perform well at cold-starting, in which the systems need to recommend items to a newly arrived user with no prior knowledge about the user\u2019s preference. Existing elicitation methods employ a fixed set of items to learn the user\u2019s preference and then infer the users\u2019 preferences on the remaining items. Using a fixed seed set can limit the performance of the recommendation system since the seed set is unlikely optimal for all new users with potentially diverse preferences. This paper addresses this challenge using a 2-phase, personalized elicitation scheme. First, the elicitation scheme asks users to rate a small set of popular items in a \u201cburn-in\u201d phase. Second, it sequentially asks the user to rate adaptive items to refine the preference and the user\u2019s representation. Throughout the process, the system represents the user\u2019s embedding value not by a point estimate but by a region estimate. The value of information obtained by asking the user\u2019s rating on an item is quantified by the distance from the region center embedding space that contains with high confidence the true embedding value of the user.

Existing elicitation methods employ a fixed set of items to learn the user\u2019s preference and then infer the users\u2019 preferences on the remaining items. Using a fixed seed set can limit the performance of the recommendation system since the seed set is unlikely optimal for all new users with potentially diverse preferences. This paper addresses this challenge using a 2-phase, personalized elicitation scheme. First, the elicitation scheme asks users to rate a small set of popular items in a \u201cburn-in\u201d phase. Second, it sequentially asks the user to rate adaptive items to refine the preference and the user\u2019s representation. Throughout the process, the system represents the user\u2019s embedding value not by a point estimate but by a region estimate. The value of information obtained by asking the user\u2019s rating on an item is quantified by the distance from the region center embedding space that contains with high confidence the true embedding value of the user. Finally, the recommendations are successively generated by considering the preference region of the user. We show that each subproblem in the elicitation scheme can be efficiently implemented. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing rating-elicitation methods on several prominent datasets.}\n}",

MAML learns the new task from meta-initialization parameters with an inner update and finds the meta-initialization parameters in the outer loop. In general, the injection of noise into the gradient of the model for augmenting the gradient is one of the widely used regularization methods. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative meta-learning framework dubbed CML which leverages gradient-level regularization with gradient augmentation. We inject learnable noise into the gradient of the model for the model generalization. The key idea of CML is introducing the co-learner which has no inner update but the outer loop update to augment gradients for finding better meta-initialization parameters. Since the co-learner does not update in the inner loop, it can be easily deleted after meta-training. Therefore, CML infers with only meta-learner without additional cost and performance degradation. We demonstrate that CML is easily applicable to gradient-based meta-learning methods and CML leads to increased performance in few-shot regression, few-shot image classification and few-shot node classification tasks.

To prevent such attacks, we propose DistriBlock, an efficient detection strategy applicable to any ASR system that predicts a probability distribution over output tokens in each time step. We measure a set of characteristics of this distribution: the median, maximum, and minimum over the output probabilities, the entropy of the distribution, as well as the Kullback-Leibler and the Jensen-Shannon divergence with respect to the distributions of the subsequent time step.  Then, by leveraging the characteristics observed for both benign and adversarial data, we apply binary classifiers, including simple threshold-based classification, ensembles of such classifiers, and neural networks.  Through extensive analysis across different state-of-the-art ASR systems and language data sets, we demonstrate the supreme performance of this approach, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing target adversarial examples against clean and noisy data of 99% and 97%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has showcased its efficacy across a broad spectrum of decision-making problems. However, its performance often degrades under vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state, which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model.

However, its performance often degrades under vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state, which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model. During the tree traversal, our method constructs the state-conditioned action abstraction for each node on-the-fly, reducing the search space by discarding the exploration of redundant sub-actions.

The two algorithmic approaches are driven by whether or not a PSNE is guaranteed to exist. We first show that deciding the existence of a PSNE in a k-DCG is NP-complete even when players have binary and unit demand vectors. For general cost functions (potentially non-monotonic), we devise a new CSP-inspired algorithmic framework for PSNE computation, leading to algorithms that run in polynomial time under certain assumptions while offering exponential savings over standard CSP algorithms. We further refine these algorithms for variants of k-DCGs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this new CSP framework for hard, non-monotonic k-DCGs. We then provide learning dynamics-based PSNE computation algorithms for linear and exponential cost functions. These algorithms run in polynomial time under certain assumptions.

The two algorithmic approaches are driven by whether or not a PSNE is guaranteed to exist. We first show that deciding the existence of a PSNE in a k-DCG is NP-complete even when players have binary and unit demand vectors. For general cost functions (potentially non-monotonic), we devise a new CSP-inspired algorithmic framework for PSNE computation, leading to algorithms that run in polynomial time under certain assumptions while offering exponential savings over standard CSP algorithms. We further refine these algorithms for variants of k-DCGs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this new CSP framework for hard, non-monotonic k-DCGs. We then provide learning dynamics-based PSNE computation algorithms for linear and exponential cost functions. These algorithms run in polynomial time under certain assumptions. For general cost, we give a learning dynamics algorithm for an (\\ensuremath{(\\alpha, \\beta)})-approximate PSNE (for certain \\ensuremath{\\alpha} and \\ensuremath{\\beta}).

The computation-efficient augmentation techniques enable the prevalent usage of GCL to alleviate the supervision shortage issue.   Despite the remarkable performance of those GCL methods, the InfoMax principle used to guide the optimization of GCL has been proven to be insufficient to avoid redundant information without losing important features.   In light of this, we introduce the Graph Contrastive Learning with Cross-View Reconstruction (GCVR), aiming to learn robust and sufficient representation from graph data. Specifically, GCVR introduces a cross-view reconstruction mechanism based on conventional graph contrastive learning to elicit those essential features from raw graphs. Besides, we introduce an extra adversarial view perturbed from the original view in the contrastive loss to pursue the intactness of the graph semantics and strengthen the representation robustness.

This work studies the problem of directly estimating the difference between two linear SEMs, i.e.  *without estimating the individual DAG structures*, given two sets of samples drawn from the individual SEMs. We consider general classes of linear SEMs where the noise distributions are allowed to be Gaussian or non-Gaussian and have different noise variances across the variables in the individual SEMs. We rigorously characterize novel conditions related to the topological layering of the structural difference that lead to the *identifiability* of the difference DAG (DDAG).

Moreover, we propose an *efficient* algorithm to identify the DDAG via sequential re-estimation of the difference of precision matrices. A surprising implication of our results is that causal changes can be identifiable even between *non-identifiable* models such as Gaussian SEMs with unequal noise variances. Synthetic experiments are presented to validate our theoretical results and to show the scalability of our method.}\n}",

The optimal treatment regime aims to provide the best-expected outcome in the entire population, known as the value function. One approach to determine this optimal regime is by maximizing the Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) estimator of the value function.  However, the derived treatment regime can be intricate and nonlinear, limiting their use. For clarity and interoperability, we emphasize linear regimes and determine the optimal linear regime by optimizing the AIPW estimator within set constraints.

Our results show that the parameter associated with the linear regime follows a cube-root convergence to a non-normal limiting distribution characterized by the maximizer of a centered Gaussian process with a quadratic drift.

However, noisy labels often have a serious negative impact on label integration. In this case, most existing works always focus on designing more complex label integration methods to infer unknown true labels more accurately from multiple noisy labels, but little attention has been paid to another perspective, i.e., purifying noisy labels before label integration. In this paper, we aim to purify noisy labels for existing label integration methods and propose a label consistency-based worker filtering (LCWF) algorithm. In LCWF, we consider that if all low-quality workers are filtered out and only high-quality workers remain, the label consistency should be high. Therefore, we utilize label consistency to filter out low-quality workers. Firstly, we directly transform the worker filtering problem into a discrete optimization problem and utilize label consistency to define the fitness function for this problem. Then, we search for the optimal solution to this problem by a genetic algorithm. Finally, we filter out all labels from low-quality workers according to the optimal solution we obtained.

        "abstract": "Decision trees are a popular tool in machine learning and yield easy-to-understand models. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for learning a decision tree classifier, with different techniques working well for data from different domains. In this work, we develop approaches to design decision tree learning algorithms given repeated access to data from the same domain. We propose novel parameterized classes of node splitting criteria in top-down algorithms, which interpolate between popularly used entropy and Gini impurity based criteria, and provide theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed to learn the splitting function appropriate for the data at hand. We also study the sample complexity of tuning prior parameters in Bayesian decision tree learning, and extend our results to decision tree regression. We further consider the problem of tuning hyperparameters in pruning the decision tree for classical pruning algorithms including min-cost complexity pruning.

Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for learning a decision tree classifier, with different techniques working well for data from different domains. In this work, we develop approaches to design decision tree learning algorithms given repeated access to data from the same domain. We propose novel parameterized classes of node splitting criteria in top-down algorithms, which interpolate between popularly used entropy and Gini impurity based criteria, and provide theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed to learn the splitting function appropriate for the data at hand. We also study the sample complexity of tuning prior parameters in Bayesian decision tree learning, and extend our results to decision tree regression. We further consider the problem of tuning hyperparameters in pruning the decision tree for classical pruning algorithms including min-cost complexity pruning.

        "abstract": "Active learning is a promising paradigm for reducing labeling costs by strategically requesting labels to improve model performance. However, existing active learning methods often rely on expensive acquisition functions, extensive model retraining, and multiple rounds of interaction with annotators. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for active learning, which aims to select batches of unlabeled instances through a learned surrogate model for data acquisition. A key challenge in this approach is to develop an acquisition function that generalizes well, as the history of data, which forms part of the utility function\u2019s input, grows over time. Our novel algorithmic contribution is a multi-task bilevel optimization framework that predicts the relative utility\u2014measured by the validation accuracy\u2014of different training sets, and ensures the learned acquisition function generalizes effectively.

However, existing active learning methods often rely on expensive acquisition functions, extensive model retraining, and multiple rounds of interaction with annotators. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for active learning, which aims to select batches of unlabeled instances through a learned surrogate model for data acquisition. A key challenge in this approach is to develop an acquisition function that generalizes well, as the history of data, which forms part of the utility function\u2019s input, grows over time. Our novel algorithmic contribution is a multi-task bilevel optimization framework that predicts the relative utility\u2014measured by the validation accuracy\u2014of different training sets, and ensures the learned acquisition function generalizes effectively. For cases where validation accuracy is expensive to evaluate, we introduce efficient interpolation-based surrogate models to estimate the utility function, reducing the evaluation cost.

        "abstract": "Data Augmentation (DA) has become a widely adopted strategy for addressing data scarcity in numerous NLP tasks, especially in scenarios with limited resources or imbalanced classes. However, many existing augmentation techniques rely on randomness or additional resources, presenting challenges in both performance and practical implementation. Furthermore, there is a lack of exploration into what constitutes effective augmentation.  In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing DA methods across a comprehensive range of text-classification benchmarks. The empirical analysis highlights that the most significant change resulting from augmentation is observed in the data variance. This observation inspires the proposed approach, termed Mask-for-Data Augmentation (M4DA), which strategically masks tokens from original samples for augmentation. Specifically, M4DA consists of a Variance-Oriented Masker Module (VMM), which ensures an increase in data variances, and a Complexity-Enhanced Selection Module (CSM), designed to select the augmented sample with the highest semantic complexity.

However, many existing augmentation techniques rely on randomness or additional resources, presenting challenges in both performance and practical implementation. Furthermore, there is a lack of exploration into what constitutes effective augmentation.  In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing DA methods across a comprehensive range of text-classification benchmarks. The empirical analysis highlights that the most significant change resulting from augmentation is observed in the data variance. This observation inspires the proposed approach, termed Mask-for-Data Augmentation (M4DA), which strategically masks tokens from original samples for augmentation. Specifically, M4DA consists of a Variance-Oriented Masker Module (VMM), which ensures an increase in data variances, and a Complexity-Enhanced Selection Module (CSM), designed to select the augmented sample with the highest semantic complexity.  The effectiveness of the proposed method is empirically validated across various text-classification benchmarks, including scenarios with limited or full resources and imbalanced classes.

        "abstract": "Despite their superior performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a method for automatically designing the architectures of DNNs, has shown remarkable performance across various machine learning applications. However, the adversarial robustness of architectures learned by NAS against adversarial threats remains under-explored. By integrating a robust teacher, we examine whether NAS can yield a robust neural architecture by inheriting robustness from the teacher. In this paper, we propose Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge Distillation (RNAS-CL), a novel NAS algorithm that enhances the robustness of architectures learned by NAS through employing cross-layer knowledge distillation from a robust teacher. Distinct from previous knowledge distillation approaches that only align student-teacher outputs at the final layer, RNAS-CL dynamically searches for the optimal teacher layer to guide each student layer. Our experimental findings validate the effectiveness of RNAS-CL, demonstrating that it can generate both compact and adversarially robust neural architectures.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a method for automatically designing the architectures of DNNs, has shown remarkable performance across various machine learning applications. However, the adversarial robustness of architectures learned by NAS against adversarial threats remains under-explored. By integrating a robust teacher, we examine whether NAS can yield a robust neural architecture by inheriting robustness from the teacher. In this paper, we propose Robust Neural Architecture Search by Cross-Layer Knowledge Distillation (RNAS-CL), a novel NAS algorithm that enhances the robustness of architectures learned by NAS through employing cross-layer knowledge distillation from a robust teacher. Distinct from previous knowledge distillation approaches that only align student-teacher outputs at the final layer, RNAS-CL dynamically searches for the optimal teacher layer to guide each student layer. Our experimental findings validate the effectiveness of RNAS-CL, demonstrating that it can generate both compact and adversarially robust neural architectures. Our results pave the way for developing new strategies for compact and robust neural architecture design applicable across various fields.

While the demographic parity (DP)  notion has been frequently used to measure a model\u2019s fairness in training fair classifiers, several studies in the literature suggest potential impacts of enforcing DP in fair learning algorithms. In this work, we analytically study the effect of standard DP-based regularization methods on the conditional distribution of the predicted label given the sensitive attribute. Our analysis shows that an imbalanced training dataset with a non-uniform distribution of the sensitive attribute could lead to a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding the majority of training data. To control such inductive biases in DP-based fair learning, we propose a sensitive attribute-based distributionally robust optimization (SA-DRO) method improving robustness against the marginal distribution of the sensitive attribute. Finally, we present several numerical results on the application of DP-based learning methods to standard centralized and distributed learning problems. The empirical findings support our theoretical results on the inductive biases in DP-based fair learning algorithms and the debiasing effects of the proposed SA-DRO method.

Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of (DR-)CPO in optimizing state-of-the-art LLMs for human preferences on direct outcome data, and we validate the robustness of DR-CPO under difficult confounding conditions.}\n}",

This approach hinges on decomposing any given vector, matrix, or tensor into two factors.

The response time (RT) to make each choice captures additional information about the decision process, but existing models incorporating RTs for choice prediction do so in a fully parametric way or over discrete inputs. At the same time, state-of-the-art Gaussian process (GP) models of perception and preferences operate on choices only, ignoring RTs. We propose two approaches for incorporating RTs into GP preference and perception models.

At the same time, state-of-the-art Gaussian process (GP) models of perception and preferences operate on choices only, ignoring RTs.

        "abstract": "Generative diffusion models, notable for their large parameter count (exceeding 100 million) and operation within high-dimensional image spaces, pose significant challenges for traditional uncertainty estimation methods due to computational demands. In this work, we introduce an innovative framework, Diffusion Ensembles for Capturing Uncertainty (DECU), designed for estimating epistemic uncertainty for diffusion models. The DECU framework introduces a novel method that efficiently trains ensembles of conditional diffusion models by incorporating a static set of pre-trained parameters, drastically reducing the computational burden and the number of parameters that require training. Additionally, DECU employs Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) to accurately measure epistemic uncertainty by evaluating the mutual information between model outputs and weights in high-dimensional spaces. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through experiments on the ImageNet dataset, highlighting its capability to capture epistemic uncertainty, specifically in under-sampled image classes.",

Therefore, the predictive ability of numerous LDL algorithms may be degraded by the presence of noise in the label space. To address this problem, we propose a novel stability-trust LDL framework that aims to reconstruct the feature space of an arbitrary LDL dataset by using feature decoupling and prototype guidance. Specifically, first, we use prototype learning to select reliable cluster centers (representative vectors of label distributions) to filter out a set of clean samples (with labeled noise) on the original dataset. Then, we decouple the feature space (eliminating correlations among features) by modeling a weight assigner that is learned on this clean sample set, thus assigning weights to each sample of the original dataset. Finally, all existing LDL algorithms can be trained on this new re-weighted dataset for the goal of robust modeling.

        "abstract": "The goal of unsupervised feature selection is to identify a feature subset based on the intrinsic characteristics of a given dataset without user-guided information such as class variables. To achieve this, score functions based on information measures can be used to identify essential features. The major research direction of conventional information-theoretic unsupervised feature selection is to minimize the entropy of the final feature subset. Although the opposite way, i.e., maximization of the joint entropy, can also lead to novel insights, studies in this direction are rare. For example, in the field of information retrieval, selected features that maximize the joint entropy of a feature subset can be effective discriminators for reaching the target tuple in the database. Thus, in this work, we first demonstrate how two feature subsets, each obtained by minimizing/maximizing the joint entropy, respectively, are different based on a toy dataset. By comparing these two feature subsets, we show that the maximization of the joint entropy enhances the pattern discrimination power of the feature subset.

To achieve this, score functions based on information measures can be used to identify essential features. The major research direction of conventional information-theoretic unsupervised feature selection is to minimize the entropy of the final feature subset. Although the opposite way, i.e., maximization of the joint entropy, can also lead to novel insights, studies in this direction are rare. For example, in the field of information retrieval, selected features that maximize the joint entropy of a feature subset can be effective discriminators for reaching the target tuple in the database. Thus, in this work, we first demonstrate how two feature subsets, each obtained by minimizing/maximizing the joint entropy, respectively, are different based on a toy dataset. By comparing these two feature subsets, we show that the maximization of the joint entropy enhances the pattern discrimination power of the feature subset. Then, we derive a score function by remedying joint entropy calculation; high-dimensional joint entropy calculation is circumvented by using the low-order approximation. The experimental results on 30 public datasets indicate that the proposed method yields superior performance in terms of pattern discrimination power-related measures.}\n}",

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the local-feature-aware transformer ($\\alpha$-Former), inspired by how humans find the camouflaged instance in a given photograph. We use traditional computer vision descriptors to simulate how humans find the unnatural boundary in a given photograph. Then, the information extracted by traditional descriptors can be employed as prior knowledge to enhance the neural network\u2019s performance. Moreover, due to the non-learnable characteristics of traditional descriptors, we designed a learnable binary filter to simulate the traditional descriptors. In order to aggregate the information from the backbone and binary filter, we introduce an adapter to merge local features into the transformer framework.

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the local-feature-aware transformer ($\\alpha$-Former), inspired by how humans find the camouflaged instance in a given photograph. We use traditional computer vision descriptors to simulate how humans find the unnatural boundary in a given photograph. Then, the information extracted by traditional descriptors can be employed as prior knowledge to enhance the neural network\u2019s performance. Moreover, due to the non-learnable characteristics of traditional descriptors, we designed a learnable binary filter to simulate the traditional descriptors. In order to aggregate the information from the backbone and binary filter, we introduce an adapter to merge local features into the transformer framework. Additionally, we introduce an edge-aware feature fusion module to improve boundary results in the segmentation model. Using the proposed transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, our $\\alpha$-Former surpasses state-of-the-art performance on the COD10K and NC4K datasets.}\n}",
