We show a convergence rate of $O(\\tr(G_T)/T)$, where $G_T$ captures the geometry of the gradient subspace. Since $\\tr(G_T)=O(\\sqrt{T})$ we can obtain faster rates for convex and Lipschitz functions, compared to the $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate achieved by known versions of noisy (stochastic) gradient descent with comparable noise variance. In particular, we show that if the gradients lie in a known constant rank subspace, and assuming algorithmic access to an envelope which bounds decaying sensitivity, one can achieve faster convergence to an excess empirical risk of $\\tilde O(1/\\epsilon n)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the privacy budget and $n$ the number of samples. Letting $p$ be the problem dimension, this result implies that, by running noisy Adagrad, we can bypass the DP-SGD bound $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{p}/\\epsilon n)$ in $T=(\\epsilon n)^{2/(1+2\\alpha)}$ iterations, where $\\alpha \\geq 0$ is a parameter controlling gradient norm decay, instead of the rate achieved by SGD of $T=\\epsilon^2n^2$.

In this paper, we investigate the capability of a natural average-case learning framework, heuristic PAC (heurPAC) learning to answer this and some other related questions. Roughly speaking, we say that a concept class is heurPAC learnable if there exists a learning algorithm that given $n, s\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\epsilon,\\delta,\\eta\\in(0,1]$ as input, learns all but $\\eta$ fraction of $n$-input target functions represented as $s$-bit strings in the class from passively collected examples and then outputs an $\\epsilon$-close hypothesis with failure probability at most $\\delta$ in polynomial-time in $n$, $s$, $\\epsilon^{-1},\\delta^{-1}$, and $\\eta^{-1}$, where each example is generated according to some example distribution.  First, we establish a positive learnability result. Specifically, we show that a simple Fourier-based algorithm heurPAC learns $\\Omega(\\log n)$-junta functions on the uniform distribution, which is a central open question in the original PAC learning model. Our technical contribution is to introduce the notion of elusive functions that captures hard-to-learn cases and to establish a polynomial relation between the running time and the fraction of such elusive functions. Second, we present clear relations between heurPAC learnability and cryptography. Particularly, we show that for any efficiently evaluated class $\\mathscr{C}$, (1) if $\\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable, then an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) exists; (2) if $\\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable on the uniform distribution, then an infinitely-often one-way function (io-OWF) exists. As a corollary, we also present new characterizations for AIOWF and io-OWF based on heurPAC learnability, which is conceptually stronger than the previous ones that are based on average-case learnability for fixed parameters. These results show that our framework might yield heuristic learners with theoretical guarantees for broader classes than the usual PAC learning framework, and any efficiently evaluated class has a potential for such a heuristic learner or a secure cryptographic primitive.

        "abstract": "Adaptive sequential decision making is one of the central challenges in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In such problems, the goal is to design an interactive policy that plans for an action to take, from a finite set of $n$ actions, given some partial observations. It has been shown that in many applications such as active learning, robotics, sequential experimental design, and active detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive submodularity, a notion that generalizes the notion of diminishing returns to policies.  In this paper, we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an adaptive monotone submodular function. We propose an efficient semi adaptive policy that with $O(\\log n \\times\\log k)$ adaptive rounds of observations can achieve an almost tight $1-1/e-\\epsilon$ approximation guarantee with respect to an optimal policy that carries out $k$ actions in a fully sequential manner. To complement our results, we also show that it is impossible to achieve a constant factor approximation with $o(\\log n)$ adaptive rounds. We also extend our result to the case of adaptive stochastic minimum cost coverage where the goal is to reach a desired utility $Q$ with the cheapest policy. We first prove the long-standing conjecture by Golovin and Krause and show that the greedy policy achieves the asymptotically tight logarithmic approximation guarantee. We then propose a semi adaptive policy that provides the same guarantee in polylogarithmic adaptive rounds through a similar information-parallelism scheme. Our results shrink the adaptivity gap in adaptive submodular maximization by an exponential factor.",

Our algorithm improves and generalizes their O(\\ell)-approximation algorithms for the problem.  The natural LP relaxation for the problem has an integrality gap of \\Omega(\\ell). In order to obtain our result, we introduce a strengthened LP relaxation and show that it has an integrality gap of \\Theta((log \\ell) / (log log \\ell)) for a fixed p.

The socially fair clustering problem was independently proposed by Abbasi, Bhaskara, and Venkatasubramanian (2021) and Ghadiri, Samadi, and Vempala (2021). Our algorithm improves and generalizes their O(\\ell)-approximation algorithms for the problem.  The natural LP relaxation for the problem has an integrality gap of \\Omega(\\ell). In order to obtain our result, we introduce a strengthened LP relaxation and show that it has an integrality gap of \\Theta((log \\ell) / (log log \\ell)) for a fixed p. Additionally, we present a bicriteria approximation algorithm, which generalizes the bicriteria approximation of Abbasi et al. (2021).}\n}",

Unfortunately, in standard worst-case models of learning, the active setting often provides no improvement over non-adaptive algorithms. To combat this, a series of recent works have considered a model in which the learner may ask \\emph{enriched} queries beyond labels. While such models have seen success in drastically lowering label costs, they tend to come at the expense of requiring large amounts of memory. In this work, we study what families of classifiers can be learned in \\emph{bounded memory}. To this end, we introduce a novel streaming-variant of enriched-query active learning along with a natural combinatorial parameter called \\emph{lossless sample compression} that is sufficient for learning not only with bounded memory, but in a query-optimal and computationally efficient manner as well. Finally, we give three fundamental examples of classifier families with small, easy to compute lossless compression schemes when given access to basic enriched queries: axis-aligned rectangles, decision trees, and halfspaces in two dimensions.",

The best-known previous result on $\\ell_2$ estimation error for this problem is $O\\left( \\frac{s\\log\\left( {d}/{s}\\right)}{n2^b}\\right)$. Surprisingly, we show that when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold $n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\\ell_2$ estimation error of $O\\left( \\frac{s}{n2^b}\\right)$. This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence rate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing the support of the distribution beforehand.\nWe next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows dimension-free convergence?'.  To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel localization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown support.

However, the same properties also make them slow to converge and sample inefficient, as the on-policy nature is not amenable to data reuse and the incremental updates result in a large iteration complexity before a near optimal policy is discovered. These empirical findings are mirrored in theory in the recent work of\u00a0\\citet{agarwal2020pc}, which provides a policy optimization method PC-PG that provably finds near optimal policies in the linear MDP model and is robust to model misspecification, but suffers from an extremely poor sample complexity compared with value-based techniques.  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, COPOE, that overcomes the poor sample complexity of PC-PG while retaining the robustness to model misspecification.  COPOE makes several important algorithmic enhancements of PC-PG, such as enabling data reuse, and uses more refined analysis techniques, which we expect to be more broadly applicable to designing new RL algorithms.

In this work, we study this problem in the more challenging non-convex setting. We introduce a structural characterization of clusters, called $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-convexity, that can be applied to any finite set of points equipped with a metric (or even a semimetric, as the triangle inequality is not needed).  Using $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-convexity, we can translate natural density properties of clusters (which include, for instance, clusters that are strongly non-convex in $R^d$) into a graph-theoretic notion of convexity.  By exploiting this convexity notion, we design a deterministic algorithm that recovers $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-convex clusters using $O(k^2 \\log n + k^2 (\\frac{6}{\\beta\\gamma})^{dens(X)})$ same-cluster queries, where $k$ is the number of clusters and $dens(X)$ is the density dimension of the semimetric.  We show that an exponential dependence on the density dimension is necessary, and we also show that, if we are allowed to make $O(k^2 + k \\log n)$ additional queries to a \"cluster separation\" oracle, then we can recover clusters that have different and arbitrary scales, even when the scale of each cluster is unknown.",

We give two new oblivious dimensionality reduction techniques for the $\\ell_1$-norm which improve exponentially over prior ones:\n- We design a distribution over random matrices $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$, where $r = 2^{\\textrm{poly}(d/(\\varepsilon \\delta))}$, such that given any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, with probability at least $1-\\delta$, simultaneously for all $x$, $\\|SAx\\|_1 = (1 \\pm \\varepsilon)\\|Ax\\|_1$. Note that $S$ is linear, does not depend on $A$, and maps $\\ell_1$ into $\\ell_1$. Our distribution provides an exponential improvement on the previous best known map of Wang and Woodruff (SODA, 2019), which required $r = 2^{2^{\\Omega(d)}}$, even for constant $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$. Our bound is optimal, up to a polynomial factor in the exponent, given a known $2^{\\textrm{poly}(d)}$ lower bound for constant $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$.\n- We design a distribution over matrices $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times n}$, where $k = 2^{O(q^2)}(\\varepsilon^{-1} q \\log d)^{O(q)}$, such that given any $q$-mode tensor $A \\in (\\mathbb{R}^{d})^{\\otimes q}$, one can estimate the entrywise $\\ell_1$-norm $\\|A\\|_1$ from $S(A)$. Moreover, $S = S^1 \\otimes S^2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes S^q$ and so given vectors $u_1, \\ldots, u_q \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, one can compute $S(u_1 \\otimes u_2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes u_q)$ in time $2^{O(q^2)}(\\varepsilon^{-1} q \\log d)^{O(q)}$, which is much faster than the $d^q$ time required to form $u_1 \\otimes u_2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes u_q$.

In this paper we study the task of approximate recovery, in which we tolerate having a small number of incorrectly classified items.  One of the most well-known, optimal, and easy to implement testing procedures is the non-adaptive Bernoulli group testing, where all tests are conducted in parallel, and each item is chosen to be part of any certain test independently with some fixed probability. In this setting, there is an observed gap between the number of tests above which recovery is information theoretically possible, and the number of tests required by the currently best known efficient algorithms to succeed. In this paper we seek to understand whether this computational-statistical gap can be closed. Our main contributions are the following: 1.Often times such gaps are explained by a phase transition in the landscape of the solution space of the problem (an Overlap Gap Property (OGP) phase transition). We provide first moment evidence that, perhaps surprisingly, such a phase transition does not take place throughout the regime for which recovery is information theoretically possible. This fact suggests that the model is in fact amenable to local search algorithms.  2. We prove the complete absence of \u201cbad\u201d local minima for a part of the \u201chard\u201d regime, a fact which implies an improvement over known theoretical results on the performance of efficient algorithms for approximate recovery without false-negatives.  3. Finally, motivated by the evidence for the abscence for the OGP, we present extensive simulations that strongly suggest that a very simple local algorithm known as Glauber Dynamics does indeed succeed, and can be used to efficiently implement the well-known (theoretically optimal) Smallest Satisfying Set (SSS) estimator. Given that practical algorithms for this task utilize Branch and Bound and Linear Programming relaxation techniques, our finding could potentially be of practical interest.",

One limitation of current techniques for this analysis is their restriction to Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions.

We then give several algorithmic applications.  1. In models where a random signal is observed through coordinatewise-independent noise applied in an exponential family, the success or failure of low-degree polynomials is governed by the z-score overlap, the inner product of z-score vectors with respect to the null distribution of two independent copies of the signal.  2.

In a spiked matrix model with a particular non-Gaussian noise distribution, the low-degree prediction is incorrect unless polynomials with arbitrarily large degree in individual matrix entries are permitted. This shows that polynomials summing over self-avoiding walks and variants thereof, as proposed recently by Ding, Hopkins, and Steurer (2020) for spiked matrix models with heavy-tailed noise, are strictly suboptimal for this model. Thus low-degree polynomials appear to offer a tradeoff between robustness and strong performance fine-tuned to specific models.

Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that even for a single ReLU neuron, it is impossible to characterize the implicit regularization with the square loss by any explicit function of the model parameters (although on the positive side, we show it can be characterized approximately). For one hidden-layer networks, we prove a similar result, where in general it is impossible to characterize implicit regularization properties in this manner, except for the \u201cbalancedness\u201d property identified in Du et al.

In contrast, an equal-sized i.i.d. sample from $\\mathbb{P}$ suffers $\\Omega(n^{-\\frac14})$ integration error.  Our sub-exponential guarantees resemble the classical quasi-Monte Carlo error rates for uniform $\\mathbb{P}$ on $[0,1]^d$ but apply to general distributions on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide range of common kernels. We use our results to derive explicit non-asymptotic maximum mean discrepancy bounds for Gaussian, Mat\u00e9rn, and B-spline kernels and present two vignettes illustrating the practical benefits of kernel thinning over i.i.d. sampling and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo thinning.}\n}",

Our results significantly improve upon the recent work of (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2020) which only considers the full-information setting and achieves suboptimal regret. Our work is also the first to consider bandit feedback with adversarial costs.  Our algorithms are built on top of the Online Mirror Descent framework with a variety of new techniques that might be of independent interest, including an improved multi-scale expert algorithm, a reduction from general stochastic shortest path to a special loop-free case, a skewed occupancy measure space, and a novel correction term added to the cost estimators. Interestingly, the last two elements reduce the variance of the learner via positive bias and the variance of the optimal policy via negative bias respectively, and having them simultaneously is critical for obtaining the optimal high-probability bound in the bandit feedback setting.",

Alice\u2019s utility is $\\Gamma_A + \\lambda \\Gamma_B$ (and similarly for Bob), where $\\Gamma_A$ is Alice\u2019s total reward and $\\lambda \\in [-1, 1]$ is a cooperation parameter. At $\\lambda = -1$ the players are competing in a zero-sum game, at $\\lambda = 1$, their interests are aligned, and at $\\lambda = 0$, they are neutral: each player\u2019s utility is their own reward.

One method to measure this for a matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is the \\emph{numerical sparsity}, denoted $\\mathsf{ns}(A)$, defined as the minimum $k\\geq 1$ such that $\\|a\\|_1/\\|a\\|_2 \\leq \\sqrt{k}$ for every row and every column $a$ of $A$. This measure of $a$ is smooth and is clearly only smaller than the number of non-zeros in the row/column $a$.  The seminal work of Achlioptas and McSherry (2007) has put forward the question of approximating an input matrix $A$ by entrywise sampling. More precisely, the goal is to quickly compute a sparse matrix $\\tilde{A}$ satisfying $\\|A - \\tilde{A}\\|_2 \\leq \\epsilon \\|A\\|_2$ (i.e., additive spectral approximation) given an error parameter $\\epsilon>0$. The known schemes sample and rescale a small fraction of entries from $A$.

The generative model provides a restricted, \u201clocal\u201d access to the MDP: The planner can ask for random transitions from previously returned states and arbitrary actions, and the features are also only accessible for the states that are encountered in this process. As opposed to previous work (e.g. Lattimore et al.

A recent lower bound by Weisz et al. (2020) established that the related problem when the action-value function of the optimal policy is linearly realizable requires an exponential number of queries, either in $H$ (the horizon of the MDP) or $d$ (the dimension of the feature mapping).

In particular, we present the TensorPlan algorithm which uses $\\poly((dH/\\delta)^A)$ simulator queries to find a $\\delta$-optimal policy relative to any deterministic policy for which the value function is linearly realizable with some bounded parameter (with a known bound). This is the first algorithm to give a polynomial query complexity guarantee using only linear-realizability of a single competing value function. Whether the computation cost is similarly bounded remains an interesting open question. We also extend the upper bound to the near-realizable case and to the infinite-horizon discounted MDP setup.

While there are simple and natural cases where improper learning is useful and even necessary, it is natural to ask how complex must the improper predictors be in such cases.  Can one always achieve nearly optimal mistake/regret bounds using \"simple\" predictors?  In this work, we give a complete characterization of when this is possible, thus settling an open problem which has been studied since the pioneering works of Angluin (1987) and Littlestone (1988).  More precisely, given any concept class C and any hypothesis class H, we provide nearly tight bounds (up to a log factor) on the optimal mistake bounds for online learning C using predictors from H.  Our bound yields an exponential improvement over the previously best known bound by Chase and Freitag (2020).  As applications, we give constructive proofs showing that (i) in the realizable setting, a near-optimal mistake bound (up to a constant factor) can be attained by a sparse majority-vote of proper predictors, and (ii) in the agnostic setting, a near-optimal regret bound (up to a log factor) can be attained by a randomized proper algorithm.  The latter was proven non-constructively by Rakhlin, Sridharan, and Tewari (2015).  It was also achieved by constructive but improper algorithms proposed by Ben-David, Pal, and Shalev-Shwartz (2009) and Rakhlin, Shamir, and Sridharan (2012).  A technical ingredient of our proof which may be of independent interest is a generalization of the celebrated Minimax Theorem (von Neumann, 1928) for binary zero-sum games with arbitrary action-sets: a simple game which fails to satisfy Minimax is \"Guess the Larger Number\".  In this game, each player picks a natural number and the player who picked the larger number wins.  Equivalently, the payoff matrix of this game is infinite triangular.  We show that this is the only obstruction: if the payoff matrix does not contain triangular submatrices of unbounded sizes then the Minimax theorem is satisfied.  This generalizes von Neumann\u2019s Minimax Theorem by removing requirements of finiteness (or compactness) of the action-sets, and moreover it captures precisely the types of games of interest in online learning: namely, Littlestone games.",

Such independence, and the implied impossibility of characterizing learnability of a class by any combinatorial parameter, stems from the basic definitions viewing learners as arbitrary functions. That level of generality not only results in unprovability issues but is also problematic from the perspective of modeling practical machine learning, where learners and predictors are computable objects. In light of that, it is natural to consider learnability by algorithms that output computable predictors (both learners and predictors are then representable as finite objects). A recent study [Agarwal, Ananthakrishnan, Ben-David, Lechner and Urner, 2020] initiated a theory of such models of learning. It proposed the notion of CPAC learnability, by adding some basic computability requirements into a PAC learning framework. As a first step towards a characterization of learnability in the CPAC framework, Agarwal et al showed that CPAC learnability of a binary hypothesis class is not implied by the finiteness of its VC-dimension anymore, as far as proper learners are concerned. A major remaining open question is whether a similar result holds also for improper learning. Namely, does there exist a computable concept class consisting of computable classifiers, that has a finite VC-dimension but no computable learner can PAC learn it (even if the learner is not restricted to output a hypothesis that is a member of the class)?

Our upper bound proof introduces a new technique based on a projection characterization of the Metropolis adjustment which reduces the study of MALA to the well-studied discretization analysis of the Langevin SDE and bypasses direct computation of the acceptance probability.}\n}",

By exploiting depth, we show that $O(N^{2/3})$ parameters suffice to memorize $N$ pairs, under a mild condition on the separation of input points.

        "abstract": "The softmax policy gradient (PG) method, which performs gradient ascent under softmax policy parameterization, is arguably one of the de facto implementations of policy optimization in modern reinforcement learning. For $\\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs), remarkable progress has recently been achieved towards establishing global convergence of softmax PG methods in finding a near-optimal policy.

        "abstract": "For a tall $n\\times d$ matrix $A$ and a random $m\\times n$ sketching matrix $S$, the sketched estimate of the inverse covariance matrix $(A^\\top A)^{-1}$ is typically biased: $E[(\\tilde A^\\top\\tilde A)^{-1}]\\ne(A^\\top A)^{-1}$, where $\\tilde A=SA$. This phenomenon, which we call inversion bias, arises, e.g., in statistics and distributed optimization, when averaging multiple independently constructed estimates of quantities that depend on the inverse covariance. We develop a framework for analyzing inversion bias, based on our proposed concept of an $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-unbiased estimator for random matrices. We show that when the sketching matrix $S$ is dense and has i.i.d. sub-gaussian entries, then after simple rescaling, the estimator $(\\frac m{m-d}\\tilde A^\\top\\tilde A)^{-1}$ is $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-unbiased for $(A^\\top A)^{-1}$ with a sketch of size $m=O(d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$. This implies that for $m=O(d)$, the inversion bias of this estimator is $O(1/\\sqrt d)$, which is much smaller than the $\\Theta(1)$ approximation error obtained as a consequence of the subspace embedding guarantee for sub-gaussian sketches. We then propose a new sketching technique, called LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, which uses ideas from both data-oblivious sparse embeddings as well as data-aware leverage-based row sampling methods, to get $\\epsilon$ inversion bias for sketch size $m=O(d\\log d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$ in time $O(\\text{nnz}(A)\\log n+md^2)$, where nnz is the number of non-zeros. The key techniques enabling our analysis include an extension of a classical inequality of Bai and Silverstein for random quadratic forms, which we call the Restricted Bai-Silverstein inequality; and anti-concentration of the Binomial distribution via the Paley-Zygmund inequality, which we use to prove a lower bound showing that leverage score sampling sketches generally do not achieve small inversion bias.",

Our evidence takes the form of a \"computationally-quiet planting\": we construct a distribution of d-regular graphs that has significantly smaller chromatic number than a typical regular graph drawn uniformly at random, while providing evidence that these two distributions are indistinguishable by a large class of algorithms.

Through the work of Acharya, Das, Orlitsky and Suresh (2016), this implies a polynomial time universal estimator for symmetric properties of discrete distributions in a broader range of error parameter.  To obtain our results on PML we establish new connections between PML and the well-studied Bethe and Sinkhorn approximations to the permanent (Vontobel, 2012 and 2014). It is known that the PML objective is proportional to the permanent of a certain Vandermonde matrix (Vontobel, 2012) with $\\sqrt{n}$ distinct columns, i.e. with non-negative rank at most $\\sqrt{n}$. This allows us to show that the convex approximation to computing PML distributions studied in (Charikar, Shiragur and Sidford, 2019) is governed, in part, by the quality of Sinkhorn approximations to the permanent. We show that both Bethe and Sinkhorn permanents are $\\exp(O(k \\log(N/k)))$ approximations to the permanent of $N \\times N$ matrices with non-negative rank at most $k$. This improves upon the previous known bounds of $\\exp(O(N))$ and combining these insights with careful rounding of the convex relaxation yields our results.",

We develop a method for finding hard families of examples for a wide range of concept classes by using LP duality.  For Boolean-valued concept classes, we show that the $L^1$-polynomial regression algorithm is essentially best possible among SQ algorithms, and therefore that the SQ complexity of agnostic learning is closely related to the polynomial degree required to approximate any function from the concept class in $L^1$-norm.

In this model, given a set of $n$ items which belong to $k$ unknown groups (or clusters), our goal is to recover the clusters by asking pairwise queries to an oracle. This oracle can answer the query that \u201cdo items $u$ and $v$ belong to the same cluster?\u201d. However, the answer to each pairwise query errs with probability $\\epsilon$, for some $\\epsilon\\in(0,\\frac12)$. Mazumdar and Saha provided two algorithms under this model: one algorithm is query-optimal while time-inefficient (i.e., running in quasi-polynomial time), the other is time efficient (i.e., in polynomial time) while query-suboptimal. Larsen, Mitzenmacher and Tsourakakis [WWW 2020] then gave a new time-efficient algorithm for the special case of $2$ clusters, which is query-optimal if the bias $\\delta:=1-2\\epsilon$ of the model is large. It was left as an open question whether one can obtain a query-optimal, time-efficient algorithm for the general case of $k$ clusters and other regimes of $\\delta$.  In this paper, we make progress on the above question and provide a time-efficient algorithm with nearly-optimal query complexity (up to a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$) for all constant $k$ and any $\\delta$ in the regime when information-theoretic recovery is possible. Our algorithm is built on a connection to the stochastic block model.",

However, the answer to each pairwise query errs with probability $\\epsilon$, for some $\\epsilon\\in(0,\\frac12)$. Mazumdar and Saha provided two algorithms under this model: one algorithm is query-optimal while time-inefficient (i.e., running in quasi-polynomial time), the other is time efficient (i.e., in polynomial time) while query-suboptimal. Larsen, Mitzenmacher and Tsourakakis [WWW 2020] then gave a new time-efficient algorithm for the special case of $2$ clusters, which is query-optimal if the bias $\\delta:=1-2\\epsilon$ of the model is large. It was left as an open question whether one can obtain a query-optimal, time-efficient algorithm for the general case of $k$ clusters and other regimes of $\\delta$.  In this paper, we make progress on the above question and provide a time-efficient algorithm with nearly-optimal query complexity (up to a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$) for all constant $k$ and any $\\delta$ in the regime when information-theoretic recovery is possible. Our algorithm is built on a connection to the stochastic block model.}\n}",
