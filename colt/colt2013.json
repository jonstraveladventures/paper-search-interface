A central problem in ranking is to design a ranking measure for evaluation of ranking functions. State of the art leaning to rank methods often train a ranking function by using a ranking measure as the objective to maximize. In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used NDCG type ranking measures. We analyze the behavior of these ranking measures as the number of objects to rank getting large. We first show that, whatever the ranking function is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result seems to imply that NDCG cannot distinguish good and bad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many applications. Our next main result is a theorem which shows that although NDCG converge to the same limit for all ranking functions, it has distinguishability for ranking functions in a strong sense. We then investigate NDCG with other possible discount. Specifically we characterize the class of feasible discount functions for NDCG. We also compare the limiting behavior and the power of distinguishability of these feasible NDCG type measures to the standard NDCG. We next turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. The most popular NDCG@k uses a combination of a slow logarithmic decay and a hard cut-off as its discount. So a natural question is why not simply use a smooth discount with fast decay? We show that if the decay is too fast, then the NDCG measure does not have strong power of distinguishability and even not converge. Finally, feasible NDCG@k are also discussed.",

The points contained in T are called  inliers and the remaining points are  outliers. This problem has received considerable attention in computer science and in statistics. Yet efficient algorithms from computer science are not robust to  adversarial outliers, and the estimators from robust statistics are hard to compute in high dimensions. This is a serious and persistent issue not just in this application, but for many other problems in unsupervised learning. Are there algorithms for subspace recovery that are both robust to outliers and efficient?  We give an algorithm that finds T when it contains more than a d/n fraction of the points.  Hence, for say d = n/2 this estimator is both easy to compute and well-behaved when there are a constant fraction of outliers. We prove that it is small set expansion hard to find T when the fraction of errors is any larger and so our estimator is an  optimal compromise between efficiency and robustness. In fact, this basic problem has a surprising number of connections to other areas including small set expansion, matroid theory and functional analysis that we make use of here.",

In the full-information setting, the player after choosing her action can observe the whole loss function in that round, while in the bandit setting, the only information the player can observe is the loss value of that action. Designing such bandit algorithms appears challenging, as the best regret currently achieved for general convex loss functions is much higher than that in the full-information setting, while for strongly convex loss functions, there is even a regret lower bound which is exponentially higher than that achieved in the full-information setting. To aim for smaller regrets, we adopt a relaxed two-point bandit setting in which the player can play two actions in each round and observe the loss values of those two actions. Moreover, we consider loss functions parameterized by their deviation D, which measures how fast they evolve, and we study how regrets depend on D. We show that two-point bandit algorithms can in fact achieve regrets matching those in the full-information setting in terms of D.

The goal is to  recover  each speech signal  from the microphone inputs.

The objective is to recover the  matrix A^-1 given random samples from X. A range of techniques  collectively known as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been proposed to address this problem in the signal processing and machine learning literature.

In this paper we propose a new algorithm for solving the blind signal separation problem in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, when we are given samples from X=AS+\u03b7, where \u03b7is drawn from an unknown, not necessarily spherical n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our approach is based on a method for decorrelating a sample with additive Gaussian noise under the assumption that the underlying distribution is a linear transformation of a distribution with independent components. Our decorrelation routine is based on the properties of cumulant tensors and can be combined with any standard cumulant-based method for ICA to get an algorithm that is provably robust in the presence of Gaussian noise.

Thus, the set of training examples for each class is contaminated by examples of the other class. Previous theoretical work on this problem assumes that the two classes are separable, that the label noise is independent of the true class label, or that the noise proportions for each class are known. We introduce a general framework for classification with label noise that eliminates these assumptions. Instead, we give assumptions ensuring identifiability and the existence of a consistent estimator of the optimal risk, with associated estimation strategies. For any arbitrary pair of contaminated distributions, there is a unique pair of non-contaminated distributions satisfying the proposed assumptions, and we argue that this solution corresponds in a certain sense to maximal denoising. In particular, we find that learning in the presence of label noise is possible even when the class-conditional distributions overlap and the label noise is not symmetric. A key to our approach is a universally consistent estimator of the maximal proportion of one distribution that is present in another, a problem we refer to as\u201cmixture proportion estimation.

Our result can also be interpreted as efficiently learning the intersection of n + 1 half-spaces in R^n in the model where the intersection is bounded and we are given polynomially many uniform samples from it. Our proof uses the local search technique from Independent Component Analysis (ICA), also used by Frieze et al. (1996). Unlike these previous algorithms, which were based on analyzing the fourth moment, ours is based on the third moment.  We also show a direct connection between the problem of learning a simplex and ICA: a simple randomized reduction to ICA from the problem of learning a simplex.

Specifically if the sequence encountered by the learner is described well by a known \u201cpredictable process\u201d, the algorithms presented enjoy tighter bounds as compared to the typical worst case bounds. Additionally, the methods achieve the usual worst-case regret bounds if the sequence is not benign. Our approach can be seen as a way of adding \\emphprior knowledge about the sequence within the paradigm of online learning. The setting is shown to encompass partial and side information.

In this paper, we focus on a generalized no-regret problem with vector-valued rewards, defined in terms of a desired reward set of the agent. For each mixed action q of the opponent, the agent has a set R(q) where the average reward should reside. In addition, the agent has a response mixed action p which brings the expected reward under these two actions, r(p, q), to R(q). If a strategy of the agent ensures that the average reward converges to R(\\barq_n), where \\barq_n is the empirical distribution of the opponent\u2019s actions, for any strategy of the opponent, we say that it is a no-regret strategy with respect to R(q). The standard no-regret problem is obtained as a special case for scalar rewards and R(q) = r \u2208R: r \u2265r(q), where r(q) = \\max_p r(p, q). For this problem, the multifunction R(q) is convex, and no-regret strategies can be devised. Our main interest in this paper is in cases where this convexity property does not hold. The best that can be guaranteed in general then is the convergence of the average reward to R^c(\\barq_n), the convex hull of R(\\barq_n). However, as the game unfolds, it may turn out that the opponent\u2019s choices of actions are limited in some way. If  these restrictions were known in advance, the agent could possibly ensure convergence of the average reward to some desired subset of R^c(\\barq_n), or even approach R(\\barq_n) itself. We formulate appropriate goals for opportunistic no-regret strategies, in the sense that they may exploit such limitations on the opponent\u2019s action sequence in an on-line manner, without knowing them beforehand. As the main technical tool, we propose a class of approachability algorithms that rely on a calibrated forecast of the opponent\u2019s actions, which are opportunistic in the above mentioned sense. As an application, we consider the online no-regret problem with average cost constraints, introduced in Mannor, Tsitsiklis, and Yu (2009), where the best-response-in-hindsight is not generally attainable, but only its convex relaxation. Our proposed algorithm applied to this problem does attain the best-response-in-hindsight if the opponent\u2019s play happens to be stationary (either in terms of its mixed actions, or the empirical frequencies of its pure actions).",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding the edges of a hidden weighted graph and their weights by using a certain type of queries as few times as possible, with focusing on two types of queries with additive property. For a set of vertices, the additive query asks the sum of weights of the edges with both ends in the set. For a pair of disjoint sets of vertices, the cross-additive query asks the sum of weights of the edges crossing between the two sets. These queries were motivated by DNA sequencing, population genetics, and artificial intelligence, and have been paid considerable attention to in computational learning. In this paper, we achieve an ultimate goal of recent years for graph finding with the two types of queries, by constructing the first polynomial time algorithms with optimal query complexity for the general class of graphs with n vertices and at most m edges in which the weights of edges are arbitrary real numbers. The algorithms are randomized and their query complexities are O(\\fracm \\log n\\log m). These bounds improve the best known by a factor of \\log m, and settle the open problem posed in some papers including [Choi and Kim, Optimal query complexity bounds for finding graphs, STOC 2008].  To build key components for graph finding, we consider the coin weighing problem with a spring scale. The problem itself has been paid much attention to in a long history of combinatorial search. We construct the first polynomial time algorithm with optimal query complexity for the general case in which the weight differences between counterfeit and authentic coins are arbitrary real numbers. We also construct the first polynomial time optimal query algorithm for finding the Fourier coefficients of a certain class of pseudo-Boolean functions.",

Our main result is the following structural theorem: any submodular function is \u03b5-close in \\ell_2 to a real-valued decision tree (DT) of depth O(1/\u03b5^2). This immediately implies that any submodular function is  \u03b5-close to a function of at most 2^O(1/\u03b5^2) variables and has a spectral \\ell_1 norm of 2^O(1/\u03b5^2). It also implies the closest previous result that states that submodular functions can be approximated by polynomials of degree O(1/\u03b5^2) (Cheraghchi et al., 2012). Our result is proved by constructing an approximation of a submodular function by a DT of rank 4/\u03b5^2 and a proof that any rank-r DT can be \u03b5-approximated by a DT of depth \\frac52(r+\\log(1/\u03b5)). We show that these structural results can be exploited to give an attribute-efficient PAC learning algorithm for submodular functions running in time \\tildeO(n^2) \u22c52^O(1/\u03b5^4). The best previous algorithm for the problem requires n^O(1/\u03b5^2) time and examples (Cheraghchi et al., 2012) but works also in the agnostic setting. In addition, we give improved learning algorithms for a number of related settings. We also prove that our PAC and agnostic learning algorithms are essentially optimal via two lower bounds: (1) an information-theoretic lower bound of 2^\u03a9(1/\u03b5^2/3) on the complexity of learning monotone submodular functions  in any reasonable model (including learning with value queries); (2) computational lower bound of n^\u03a9(1/\u03b5^2/3) based on a reduction to learning of sparse parities with noise, widely-believed to be intractable.

The Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution (also called Polya urn scheme) and extensions thereof are widely applied for online i.i.d. estimation. Good a-priori choices for the parameters in this regime are difficult to obtain though. I derive an optimal adaptive choice for the main parameter via tight, data-dependent redundancy bounds for a related model.

A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for AUC optimization/bipartite ranking has been to reduce the problem to pairwise classification; in particular, it is well known that the AUC regret can be formulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper bounded using usual regret bounds for binary classification. Recently, Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed AUC regret bounds in terms of the regret associated with \u2018balanced\u2019 versions of the standard (non-pairwise) logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we obtain such (non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for the AUC in terms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term \\emphstrongly proper.

Our result yields explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a variety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential, squared and squared hinge losses. An important consequence is that standard algorithms minimizing a (non-pairwise) strongly proper loss, such as logistic regression and boosting algorithms (assuming a universal function class and appropriate regularization), are in fact AUC-consistent; moreover, our results allow us to quantify the AUC regret in terms of the corresponding surrogate regret.
