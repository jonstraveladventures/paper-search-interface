Specifically, our algorithm achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{KST}, K^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\Delta ^{\\frac{1}{3}}T^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\})$ dynamic regret for a contextual bandit problem with $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, $S$ switches and $\\Delta$ total variation in data distributions. Importantly, our algorithm is adaptive and does not need to know $S$ or $\\Delta$ ahead of time, and can be implemented efficiently assuming access to an ERM oracle. Our results strictly improve the $\\mathcal{O} (\\min \\{S^{\\frac{1}{4}}T^{\\frac{3}{4}}, \\Delta^{\\frac{1}{5}}T^{\\frac{4}{5}}\\})$ bound of (Luo et al., 2018), and greatly generalize and improve the $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{ST})$ result of (Auer et al., 2018) that holds only for the two-armed bandit problem without contextual information. The key novelty of our algorithm is to introduce {\\it replay phases}, in which the algorithm acts according to its previous decisions for a certain amount of time in order to detect non-stationarity while maintaining a good balance between exploration and exploitation.",

We prove that, even without any distributional assumption on the input data stream, a large family of statistics can be estimated to non-trivial accuracy. To give one concrete example, suppose that we are given access to an arbitrary binary sequence $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ of length $n$.  Our goal is to accurately predict the average observation, and we are allowed to choose the window over which the prediction is made: for some $t < n$ and $m \\le n - t$, after seeing $t$ observations we predict the average of $x_{t+1}, \\ldots, x_{t+m}$.

This result holds for any sequence (that is not adaptive to when the prediction is made, or the predicted value), and the expectation of the error is with respect to the randomness of the prediction algorithm.

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with finding an  optimal algorithm for minimizing a composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d-th order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find \u2013 in that setting \u2013 the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ).  A high-order tensor algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes (2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as established in Nesterov (2018) and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the  Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.",

The problem has received a lot of attention in signal processing, learning, and theoretical computer science. The problem is formalized as factorizing a matrix $X (d \\times n)$ (whose columns are the signals) as $X = AY$, where $A$ has a prescribed number $m$ of columns (typically $m \\ll n$), and $Y$ has columns that are $k$-sparse (typically $k \\ll d$).

The goal of our work is to understand what can be said in the absence of such assumptions. Can we still find $A$ and $Y$ such that $X \\approx AY$? We show that this is possible, if we allow violating the bounds on $m$ and $k$ by appropriate factors that depend on $k$ and the desired approximation. Our results rely on an algorithm for what we call the threshold correlation problem, which turns out to be related to hypercontractive norms of matrices.

In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of arms on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward that the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their expectations. In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear, and the performance of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz constant to encapsulate the function\u2019s nonlinearity. This may lead to loose regret bounds, since by itself, a large gradient does not necessarily cause a large regret, but only in regions where the uncertainty in the reward\u2019s parameters is high.  To overcome this problem, we introduce a new smoothness criterion, which we term \\emph{Gini-weighted smoothness}, that takes into account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the arms. We show that a linear dependence of the regret in the batch size in existing algorithms can be replaced by this smoothness parameter. This, in turn, leads to much tighter regret bounds when the smoothness parameter is batch-size independent. For example, in the probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) problem, that has many applications, including influence maximization, diverse recommendations and more, we achieve dramatic improvements in the upper bounds. We also prove matching lower bounds for the PMC problem and show that our algorithm is tight, up to a logarithmic factor in the problem\u2019s parameters.",

In this paper, we bridge this gap and prove approximation guarantees for the local search algorithms for D-optimal design and A-optimal design problems. We show that the local search algorithms are asymptotically optimal when $\\frac{k}{d}$ is large. In addition to this, we also prove similar approximation guarantees for the greedy algorithms for D-optimal design and A-optimal design problems when $\\frac{k}{d}$ is large.}\n}",

Indeed, the question of whether a robust classifier for their task exists in the large perturbation regime seems related to important open questions in computational number theory. In this work, we extend their work in three directions.

In the latter setting, not only does a non-robust classifier exist, but also an efficient algorithm that generates fresh new labeled samples given access to polynomially many training examples (termed as generation by Kearns et al.

        "abstract": "We address the problem of estimating the mixing time $t_{\\mathsf{mix}}$ of an arbitrary ergodic finite Markov chain from a single trajectory of length $m$. The reversible case was addressed by Hsu et al. [2018+], who left the general case as an open problem. In the reversible case, the analysis is greatly facilitated by the fact that the Markov operator is self-adjoint, and Weyl\u2019s inequality allows for a dimension-free perturbation analysis of the empirical eigenvalues. As Hsu et al. point out, in the absence of reversibility (and hence, the non-symmetry of the pair probabilities matrix), the existing perturbation analysis has a worst-case exponential dependence on the number of states $d$. Furthermore, even if an eigenvalue perturbation analysis with better dependence on $d$ were available, in the non-reversible case the connection between the spectral gap and the mixing time is not nearly as straightforward as in the reversible case. Our key insight is to estimate the pseudo-spectral gap instead, which allows us to overcome the loss of self-adjointness and to achieve a polynomial dependence on $d$ and the minimal stationary probability $\\pi_\\star$. Additionally, in the reversible case, we obtain simultaneous nearly (up to logarithmic factors) minimax rates in $t_{\\mathsf{mix}}$ and precision $\\varepsilon$, closing a gap in Hsu et al., who treated $\\varepsilon$ as constant in the lower bounds. Finally, we construct fully empirical confidence intervals for the pseudo-spectral gap, which shrink to zero at a rate of roughly $1/\\sqrt m$, and improve the state of the art in even the reversible case.",

Recent work gave the first polynomial time algorithms for this problem with near-optimal error guarantees for several natural structured distributions.  Our main contribution is to develop faster algorithms for this problem whose running time nearly matches that of computing the empirical covariance. Given $N = \\tilde{\\Omega}(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ samples from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution, an $\\epsilon$-fraction of which may be arbitrarily corrupted, our algorithm runs in time $\\tilde{O}(d^{3.26})/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon)$ and approximates the unknown covariance matrix to optimal error up to a logarithmic factor.

Motivated by applications involving time-series data, there has been a growing literature on learning and generalization in settings where data is sampled from an ergodic process. This work has also developed complexity measures, which appropriately extend the notion of Rademacher complexity to bound the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in this setting. Rather than time-series data, our work is  motivated  by settings where data  is sampled on a network or a spatial domain, and thus do not fit well within the framework of prior work. We provide learning and generalization bounds for data that are complexly dependent, yet their distribution satisfies the standard Dobrushin\u2019s condition. Indeed, we show that the standard complexity measures of Gaussian and Rademacher complexities and VC dimension are sufficient measures of complexity for the purposes of bounding the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in our setting. Moreover, our generalization bounds only degrade by constant factors compared to their i.i.d.\u00a0analogs, and our learnability bounds degrade by log factors in the size of the training set.",

A fundamental obstacle that comes up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate a so-called step-size or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient norms, etc. A recent technique promises to overcome this difficulty by maintaining multiple learning rates in parallel. This technique has been applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for online convex optimization and the Squint algorithm for prediction with expert advice. However, in both cases the user still has to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter that bounds the norm of the gradients. Although this hyperparameter is typically not available in advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set too small, the methods may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by designing new versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value automatically. We achieve this by dynamically updating the set of active learning rates. For MetaGrad, we further improve the computational efficiency of handling constraints on the domain of prediction, and we remove the need to specify the number of rounds in advance.",

While classical theoretical analysis of SGD for convex problems studies (suffix) \\emph{averages} of iterates and obtains information theoretically optimal bounds on suboptimality, the \\emph{last point} of SGD is, by far, the most preferred choice in practice.

A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design).   A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs.    Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive.   We address this by proposing a framework for experimental  design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution.   We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses  in this general model. Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result.   In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d. importance sampling method: inverse score sampling.   A key novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. sampling via the jointness of volume sampling.

For this problem, all existing regret minimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a positive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and SVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at least quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a corresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied extensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that work directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence require only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration. This raises the question: \\textit{can non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms be shown to minimize regret in online adversarial settings?} In this paper we take a step forward towards answering this question. We introduce an \\textit{adversarially-perturbed spiked-covariance model} in which, each data point is assumed to follow a fixed stochastic distribution with a non-zero spectral gap in the covariance matrix,  but is then perturbed with some adversarial vector. This model is a natural extension of a well studied standard \\textit{stochastic} setting that allows for non-stationary (adversarial) patterns to arise in the data  and hence, might serve as a significantly better approximation for real-world data-streams. We show that in an interesting regime of parameters, when the non-convex online gradient ascent algorithm is initialized with a \u201cwarm-start\" vector, it provably minimizes the regret with high probability. We further discuss the possibility of computing such a \u201cwarm-start\" vector, and also the use of regularization to obtain fast regret rates.

All previous reductions either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all quickly degrade given weak forms of the $\\textsc{pc}$ conjecture. We give a reduction from $\\textsc{pc}$ that yields the first full characterization of the computational barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that even a mild improvement in the signal strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would imply that the hardness threshold for $\\textsc{pc}$ is $\\text{polylog}(N)$, rather than on the order $N^{1/2}$ as is widely conjectured.

In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions corrupted by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret guarantee, without knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free way. Recently, Cutkosky and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded subgradients, it is impossible to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an exponential penalty. This paper shows that it is possible to go around the lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients to be unbounded via stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in unconstrained OCO is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal regret bounds or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free OCO algorithm for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting on noisy coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem.

Motivated by a problem of communication security, we focus on the case where the planted structure consists in the addition of a tree graph.  In the case of planted line graphs, we establish the following phase diagram for detection and reconstruction. In a low density region where the average degree $\\lambda$ of the original graph is below some critical value $\\lambda_c=1$, both detection and reconstruction go from  impossible to easy as the line length $K$ crosses some critical value $K^*=\\ln(n)/\\ln(1/\\lambda)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. In a high density region where $\\lambda>\\lambda_c$, detection goes from impossible to easy as $K$ goes from $o(\\sqrt{n})$ to $\\omega(\\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, reconstruction remains impossible so long as $K=o(n)$.  We then consider planted $D$-ary trees of varying depth $h$ and $2\\le D\\le O(1)$. For these we identify a low-density region $\\lambda<\\lambda_D$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the threshold for emergence of the $D$-core in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs $\\mathcal G(n,\\lambda/n)$ for which the following holds. There is a threshold $h*=g(D)\\ln(\\ln(n))$ with the following properties. Detection goes from impossible to feasible as $h$ crosses $h*$. Interestingly, we show that only partial reconstruction is feasible at best for $h\\ge h*$. We conjecture a similar picture to hold for $D$-ary trees as for lines in the high-density region $\\lambda>\\lambda_D$, but confirm only the following part of this picture: Detection is easy for $D$-ary trees of size $\\omega(\\sqrt{n})$, while at best only partial reconstruction is feasible for $D$-ary trees of any size $o(n)$. These results provide a clear contrast with the corresponding picture for detection and reconstruction of {\\em low rank} planted structures, such as dense subgraphs and block communities.  In the examples we study, there is i) an absence of hard phases for both detection and reconstruction, and ii) a discrepancy between detection and reconstruction, the latter being impossible for a wide range of parameters where detection is easy.

Specifically, we consider a random graph drawn according to the stochastic block model: its vertex set is partitioned into blocks, or communities, and edges are placed randomly and independently of each other with probability depending only on the communities of their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the community labels better than by random guess, based only on the observation of the graph. In the sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a new spectral method based on the distance matrix $D^{(\\ell)}$, where $D^{(\\ell)}_{ij} = 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to $\\ell$. We show that when $\\ell \\sim c\\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the eigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(\\ell)}$ provide enough information to perform non-trivial community recovery with high probability, provided we are above the so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold. This yields an efficient algorithm for community detection, since computation of the matrix $D^{(\\ell)}$ can be done in $O(n^{1+\\kappa})$ operations for a small constant $\\kappa$.  We then study the sensitivity of the eigendecomposition of $D^{(\\ell)}$ when we allow an adversarial perturbation of the edges of $G$. We show that when the considered perturbation does not affect more than $O(n^\\varepsilon)$ vertices for some small $\\varepsilon > 0$, the highest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors incur negligible perturbations, which allows us to still perform efficient recovery. Our proposed spectral method therefore: i) is robust to larger perturbations than prior spectral methods,  while semi-definite programming (or SDP) methods can tolerate yet larger perturbations; ii) achieves  non-trivial detection down to the KS threshold, which is conjectured to be optimal and is beyond reach of  existing SDP approaches; iii) is faster than SDP approaches.",

Such matrices arise in various computational contexts such as learning image manifolds, handwriting recognition, and multi-dimensional unfolding. In this work we study algorithms for low-rank approximation of distance matrices. Recent work by Bakshi and Woodruff (NeurIPS 2018) showed it is possible to compute a rank-$k$ approximation of a distance matrix in time $O((n+m)^{1+\\gamma}) \\mathrm{poly}(k,1/\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is an error parameter and $\\gamma>0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. Notably, their bound is sublinear in the matrix size, which is unachieveable for general matrices. We present an algorithm that is both simpler and more efficient. It reads only $O((n+m)k/\\epsilon)$ entries of the input matrix, and has a running time of $O(n+m) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k,1/\\epsilon)$. We complement the sample complexity of our algorithm with a matching lower bound on the number of entries that must be ready by any algorithm. We provide experimental results to validate the approximation quality and running time of our algorithm",

Recent work by Bakshi and Woodruff (NeurIPS 2018) showed it is possible to compute a rank-$k$ approximation of a distance matrix in time $O((n+m)^{1+\\gamma}) \\mathrm{poly}(k,1/\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is an error parameter and $\\gamma>0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. Notably, their bound is sublinear in the matrix size, which is unachieveable for general matrices. We present an algorithm that is both simpler and more efficient. It reads only $O((n+m)k/\\epsilon)$ entries of the input matrix, and has a running time of $O(n+m) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k,1/\\epsilon)$. We complement the sample complexity of our algorithm with a matching lower bound on the number of entries that must be ready by any algorithm. We provide experimental results to validate the approximation quality and running time of our algorithm}\n}",

In contrast with previous works, the approach is particularly suited for handling sublinear convergence rates and stochastic oracles. The technique relies on semidefinite programming and potential functions. It allows simultaneously obtaining worst-case guarantees on the behavior of those algorithms, and assisting in choosing appropriate parameters for tuning their worst-case performances. The technique also benefits from comfortable tightness guarantees, meaning that unsatisfactory results can be improved only by changing the setting.

For many properties, it is known that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain size. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform distribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\\ell_1$-distance uses only $O(\\sqrt{n})$ samples.  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise, even when the amount of noise is quite small.
