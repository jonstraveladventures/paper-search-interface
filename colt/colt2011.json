To estimate the Shannon entropy, it suffices to accurately estimate the $\\alpha$-th  moment with $\\delta= |1-\\alpha|\\approx 0$.

We give an analysis of the query complexity of this problem, under the assumption that the payoff of each arm is given by a function belonging to a known, finite, but otherwise arbitrary function class. Our analysis centers on a new notion of function class complexity that we call the haystack dimension, which is used to prove the approximate optimality of a simple greedy algorithm. This algorithm is then used as a subroutine in a functional MAB algorithm, yielding provably near-optimal regret.

We give an analysis of the query complexity of this problem, under the assumption that the payoff of each arm is given by a function belonging to a known, finite, but otherwise arbitrary function class. Our analysis centers on a new notion of function class complexity that we call the haystack dimension, which is used to prove the approximate optimality of a simple greedy algorithm. This algorithm is then used as a subroutine in a functional MAB algorithm, yielding provably near-optimal regret.

We show that complexity of the family of checking rules can be captured by the notion of a sequential cover introduced in (Rakhlin et al., 2010a). Various natural assumptions on the class of checking rules are considered, including finiteness of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Littlestone\u2019s dimensions.}\n}",

Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as conjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and hence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant\u2019s framework. One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether conjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant, 2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new combinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of learning from correlations. We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions having a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable distribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses instead of 0-1 loss in Valiant\u2019s original definition. The proof of evolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions that are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in several other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009b; Valiant, 2011). An important property of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm guarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance.

        "abstract": "Much work has been done on learning various classes of \u201csimple\" monotone functions under the uniform distribution. In this paper we give the first unconditional lower bounds for learning problems of this sort by showing that polynomial-time algorithms cannot learn shallow monotone Boolean formulas under the uniform distribution in the well-studied Statistical Query (SQ) model. We introduce a new approach to understanding the learnability of \u201csimple\u201d monotone functions that is based on a recent characterization of Strong SQ learnability by Simon (2007). Using the characterization we first show that depth-3 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned by any polynomial-time SQ algorithm to accuracy $1 - 1/(\\log n)^{\\Omega(1)}$.  We then build on this result to show that depth-4 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned even to a certain $\\frac 1 2 + o(1)$ accuracy in polynomial time.  This improved hardness is achieved using a general technique that we introduce for amplifying the hardness of \u201cmildly hard\u201d learning problems in either the PAC or SQ framework.

In this paper we give the first unconditional lower bounds for learning problems of this sort by showing that polynomial-time algorithms cannot learn shallow monotone Boolean formulas under the uniform distribution in the well-studied Statistical Query (SQ) model. We introduce a new approach to understanding the learnability of \u201csimple\u201d monotone functions that is based on a recent characterization of Strong SQ learnability by Simon (2007). Using the characterization we first show that depth-3 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned by any polynomial-time SQ algorithm to accuracy $1 - 1/(\\log n)^{\\Omega(1)}$.  We then build on this result to show that depth-4 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned even to a certain $\\frac 1 2 + o(1)$ accuracy in polynomial time.  This improved hardness is achieved using a general technique that we introduce for amplifying the hardness of \u201cmildly hard\u201d learning problems in either the PAC or SQ framework. Thi shardness amplification for learning builds on the ideas in the work of O\u2019Donnell (2004) on hardness amplification for approximating functions using small circuits, and is applicable to a number of other contexts. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can also be used to reduce the well-known open problem of learning juntas to learning of depth-3 monotone formulas.}\n}",

        "abstract": "This work studies the problem of privacy-preserving classification \u2013 namely, learning a classifier from sensitive data while preserving the privacy of individuals in the training set. In particular, the learning algorithm is required in this problem to guarantee differential privacy, a very strong notion of privacy that has gained significant attention in recent years. A natural question to ask is: what is the sample requirement of a learning algorithm that guarantees a certain level of privacy and accuracy? We address this question in the context of learning with infinite hypothesis classes when the data is drawn from a continuous distribution. We first show that even for very simple hypothesis classes, any algorithmth at uses a finite number of examples and guarantees differential privacy must fail to return an accurate classifier for at least some unlabeled data distributions. This result is unlike the case with either finite hypothesis classes or discrete data domains, in which distribution-free private learning is possible, as previously shown by Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008). We then consider two approaches to differentially private learning that get around this lower bound. The first approach is to use prior knowledge about the unlabeled data distribution in the form of a reference distribution $\\mathcal{U}$ chosen independently of the sensitive data. Given such a reference $\\mathcal{U}$, we provide an upper bound on the sample requirement that depends (among other things) on a measure of closeness between $\\mathcal{U}$ and the unlabeled data distribution. Our upper bound applies to the non-realizable as well as the realizable case. The second approach is to relax the privacy requirement, by requiring only label-privacy \u2013namely, that the only labels (and not the unlabeled parts of the examples)be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the sample requirement of learning with label privacy was shown by Chaudhuri et al. (2006); in this work, we show a lower bound.",

We first show that even for very simple hypothesis classes, any algorithmth at uses a finite number of examples and guarantees differential privacy must fail to return an accurate classifier for at least some unlabeled data distributions. This result is unlike the case with either finite hypothesis classes or discrete data domains, in which distribution-free private learning is possible, as previously shown by Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008). We then consider two approaches to differentially private learning that get around this lower bound. The first approach is to use prior knowledge about the unlabeled data distribution in the form of a reference distribution $\\mathcal{U}$ chosen independently of the sensitive data. Given such a reference $\\mathcal{U}$, we provide an upper bound on the sample requirement that depends (among other things) on a measure of closeness between $\\mathcal{U}$ and the unlabeled data distribution. Our upper bound applies to the non-realizable as well as the realizable case. The second approach is to relax the privacy requirement, by requiring only label-privacy \u2013namely, that the only labels (and not the unlabeled parts of the examples)be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the sample requirement of learning with label privacy was shown by Chaudhuri et al. (2006); in this work, we show a lower bound.}\n}",

The main focus is on the situation where the number of relevant covariates, called intrinsic dimension, is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Without assuming any parametric form of the underlying regression function, we get tight conditions making it possible to consistently estimate the set of relevant variables. These conditions relate the intrinsic dimension to the ambient dimension and to the sample size.  The procedure that is provably consistent under these tight conditions is simple and is based on comparing the empirical Fourier coefficients with an appropriately chosen threshold value.",
