While regret minimization under subgaussian or bounded rewards has been widely studied, learning with heavy-tailed distributions only gained popularity over the last decade.

In this setting, we study the regret minimization problem when $\\epsilon$ and $u$ are unknown to the learner and it has to adapt. First, we show that adaptation comes at a cost and derive two negative results proving that the same regret guarantees of the non-adaptive case cannot be achieved with no further assumptions. Then, we devise and analyze a fully data-driven trimmed mean estimator and propose a novel adaptive regret minimization algorithm, \\texttt{AdaR-UCB}, that leverages such an estimator.

The vector can be interpreted as the incident vector corresponding to $n$ items out of which $k$ items are \\emph{defective}. The \\emph{quantitative group testing} (QGT) problem aims at learning this binary feature vector by queries on subsets of the items that return the total number of defective items. We consider this problem under the \\emph{non-adaptive} scenario where the queries on subsets are designed collectively and can be executed in parallel.

Recently, a near-optimal non-adaptive algorithm with a decoding complexity of $O(n^3)$ closed this gap. In this work, we present a concatenated construction method yielding a non-adaptive algorithm with a decoding complexity of $O(n^{2\\alpha} + n \\log^2 n)$. The probability of decoding failure is analyzed by establishing a connection between the QGT problem and the so-called \\emph{balls into bins} problem. Our algorithm reduces the gap between the information-theoretic and computational bound for the number of required queries/tests from $\\log k$ to $\\log \\log k$. This narrows the gap in the number of tests for non-adaptive algorithms within the class of algorithms with $o(n^2)$ decoding complexity. Moreover, although our algorithm exhibits a $\\log \\log k$ gap in terms of the number of tests, it is surpassed by the existing asymptotically optimal construction only in scenarios where $k$ is exceptionally large for moderate values of $\\alpha$, such as $k > 10^{27}$ for $\\alpha = 0.7$, thereby highlighting the practical applicability of our proposed concatenated construction.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of low-rank rectangular matrix completion in the regime where the matrix $M$  of size $n\\times m$ is \u201clong\", i.e., the aspect ratio $m/n$ diverges to infinity. Such matrices are of particular interest in the study of tensor completion, where they arise from the unfolding of a low-rank tensor. In the case where the sampling probability is $\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{mn}}$, we propose a new spectral algorithm for recovering the singular values and left singular vectors of the original matrix $M$ based on a variant of the standard non-backtracking operator of a suitably defined bipartite weighted random graph, which we call a \\textit{non-backtracking wedge operator}.

        "abstract": "We introduce and study the problem of posterior inference on tree-structured graphical models in the presence of a malicious adversary who can corrupt some observed nodes. In the well-studied \\emph{broadcasting on trees} model, corresponding to the ferromagnetic Ising model on a $d$-regular tree with zero external field, when a natural signal-to-noise ratio exceeds one (the celebrated \\emph{Kesten-Stigum threshold}), the posterior distribution of the root given the leaves is bounded away from $\\mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$, and carries nontrivial information about the sign of the root. This posterior distribution can be computed exactly via dynamic programming, also known as belief propagation. We first confirm a folklore belief that a malicious adversary who can corrupt an inverse-polynomial fraction of the leaves of their choosing makes this inference impossible. Our main result is that accurate posterior inference about the root vertex given the leaves \\emph{is} possible when the adversary is constrained to make corruptions at a $\\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\\log d)$ and $\\rho \\leq c \\varepsilon$ for some universal $c > 0$.

In the well-studied \\emph{broadcasting on trees} model, corresponding to the ferromagnetic Ising model on a $d$-regular tree with zero external field, when a natural signal-to-noise ratio exceeds one (the celebrated \\emph{Kesten-Stigum threshold}), the posterior distribution of the root given the leaves is bounded away from $\\mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$, and carries nontrivial information about the sign of the root. This posterior distribution can be computed exactly via dynamic programming, also known as belief propagation. We first confirm a folklore belief that a malicious adversary who can corrupt an inverse-polynomial fraction of the leaves of their choosing makes this inference impossible. Our main result is that accurate posterior inference about the root vertex given the leaves \\emph{is} possible when the adversary is constrained to make corruptions at a $\\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\\log d)$ and $\\rho \\leq c \\varepsilon$ for some universal $c > 0$. Since inference becomes information-theoretically impossible when $\\rho \\gg \\varepsilon$, this amounts to an information-theoretically optimal fraction of corruptions, up to a constant multiplicative factor.

Hence, we side-step the impossibility results for the standard benchmark of best fixed bid (Balseiro and Gur, 2019). When there is only a budget constraint, our algorithm specializes to the autobidding algorithm from (Balseiro and Gur, 2019), and our guarantees specialize to the regret and liquid welfare guarantees from Gaitonde et al. (2023). While our approach to bounding liquid welfare shares a common high-level strategy with Gaitonde et al. (2023), handling the ROI constraint, and particularly both constraints jointly, introduces a variety of new technical challenges. These challenges necessitate a new algorithm, changes to the way liquid welfare bounds are established, and a different methodology for establishing regret properties.",

When there is only a budget constraint, our algorithm specializes to the autobidding algorithm from (Balseiro and Gur, 2019), and our guarantees specialize to the regret and liquid welfare guarantees from Gaitonde et al. (2023). While our approach to bounding liquid welfare shares a common high-level strategy with Gaitonde et al. (2023), handling the ROI constraint, and particularly both constraints jointly, introduces a variety of new technical challenges. These challenges necessitate a new algorithm, changes to the way liquid welfare bounds are established, and a different methodology for establishing regret properties.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Let $f(\\theta, X_1),$ $ \u2026,$ $ f(\\theta, X_n)$ be a sequence of random elements, where $f$ is a fixed scalar function, $X_1, \u2026, X_n$ are independent random variables (data), and $\\theta$ is a random parameter distributed according to some data-dependent \\emph{posterior} distribution $P_n$. In this paper, we consider the problem of proving concentration inequalities to estimate the mean of the sequence. An example of such a problem is the estimation of the generalization error of some predictor trained by a stochastic algorithm, such as a neural network, where $f$ is a loss function. Classically, this problem is approached through a \\emph{PAC-Bayes} analysis where, in addition to the posterior, we choose a \\emph{prior} distribution which captures our belief about the inductive bias of the learning problem. Then, the key quantity in PAC-Bayes concentration bounds is a divergence that captures the \\emph{complexity} of the learning problem where the de facto standard choice is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, the tightness of this choice has rarely been  questioned.   In this paper, we challenge the tightness of the KL-divergence-based bounds by showing that it is possible to achieve a strictly tighter bound. In particular, we demonstrate new \\emph{high-probability} PAC-Bayes bounds with a novel and \\emph{better-than-KL} divergence that is inspired by Zhang et al. (2022). Our proof is inspired by recent advances in regret analysis of gambling algorithms, and its use to derive concentration inequalities. Our result is first-of-its-kind in that existing PAC-Bayes bounds with non-KL divergences are not known to be strictly better than KL. Thus, we believe our work marks the first step towards identifying optimal rates of PAC-Bayes bounds.",

        "abstract": "When we have a univariate distribution that is symmetric around its mean, the mean can be estimated with a rate (sample complexity) much faster than $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ in many cases. For example, given univariate random variables $Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n$ distributed uniformly on $[\\theta_0 - c, \\theta_0 + c]$, the sample midrange $\\frac{Y_{(n)}+Y_{(1)}}{2}$ maximizes likelihood and has expected error $\\mathbb{E}\\bigl| \\theta_0 - \\frac{Y_{(n)}+Y_{(1)}}{2} \\bigr| \\leq 2c/n$, which is optimal and much lower than the error rate $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ of the sample mean. What the optimal rate is depends on the distribution and it is generally attained by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, MLE requires exact knowledge of the underlying distribution; if the underlying distribution is \\emph{unknown}, it is an open question whether an estimator can adapt to the optimal rate.

In this model, $n$ vertices are randomly divided into two communities, and size-$r$ hyperedges are added randomly depending on whether all vertices in the hyperedge are in the same community. The goal of weak recovery is to recover a non-trivial fraction of the communities given the hypergraph. Pal and Zhu (2021); Stephan and Zhu (2022) established that weak recovery is always possible above a natural threshold called the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold.

We prove that for $r\\le 6$ and $d$ large enough, the KS threshold is tight.

Furthermore, we establish asymptotic bounds on the weak recovery threshold for fixed $r$ and large $d$.

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin\u2019s minorisation. Moreover, we can define a notion of convergence of Markov processes in Orlicz spaces, which depends on the corresponding contraction coefficient.  The key novelty comes from duality considerations: the convergence of a Markovian process determined by $K$ depends on the contraction coefficient of its dual $K^\\star$, which can in turn be bounded by considering appropriate nested norms of densities of $K^\\star$ with respect to the stationary measure. Our approach stands out as the first of its kind, as it does not rely on the existence of a spectral gap. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin\u2019s interpolation methods. We present the following applications of the proposed framework: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes: one can relate the contraction coefficient of the dual operator to the mixing time of the corresponding Markov chain regardless of the norm chosen. Consequently, our tighter bound on the contraction coefficient implies a tighter bound on the mixing time. We offer a result that provides an intuitive understanding of what it means to be close in a specific norm (relating the probability of any event with the probability of the same event under the stationary measure $\\pi$ and a $\\psi$-Orlicz/Amemiya-norm). We then focus on $L_p$ norms and show that asking for a bounded norm with larger $p$ guarantees a faster decay in the probability. This is particularly relevant for exponentially decaying probabilities under $\\pi$. Moreover, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. \\item Improved concentration bounds for MCMC methods leading to improved lower bounds on the burn-in period: by leveraging $L_p$-norms with large $p$ and our results on the contraction coefficient, similar to the approach undertaken for the mixing times, we can provide improved exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods. \\item Improved concentration bounds for sequences of Markovian random variables: we show how our results can be used to outperform existing bounds based on a change of measure technique for random variables with a Markovian dependence. In particular, we can prove exponential concentration in new settings (inaccessible to earlier approaches) and improve the rate in others. \\end{enumerate}",

They almost fully analyzed the case where the binomials are independent, which corresponds to all random variable entries from the sequence being independent. The remaining gap was closed by Blanchard and Vor\u00e1\u010dek (ALT 2024). In this work, we study the much more general and challenging case with correlations.

They almost fully analyzed the case where the binomials are independent, which corresponds to all random variable entries from the sequence being independent. The remaining gap was closed by Blanchard and Vor\u00e1\u010dek (ALT 2024). In this work, we study the much more general and challenging case with correlations.

For gradient descent (GD), stable convergence is possible only to minima that are sufficiently flat w.r.t. the step size, and those have been linked with favorable properties of the trained model. However, while the stability threshold of GD is well-known, to date, no explicit expression has been derived for the exact threshold of stochastic GD (SGD). In this paper, we derive such a closed-form expression. Specifically, we provide an explicit condition on the step size that is both necessary and sufficient for the linear stability of SGD in the mean square sense. Our analysis sheds light on the precise role of the batch size B. In particular, we show that the stability threshold is monotonically non-decreasing in the batch size, which means that reducing the batch size can only decrease stability. Furthermore, we show that SGD\u2019s stability threshold is equivalent to that of a mixture process which takes in each iteration a full batch gradient step w.p. 1-p, and a single sample gradient step w.p. $p$, where $p \\approx 1/B$. This indicates that even with moderate batch sizes, SGD\u2019s stability threshold is very close to that of GD\u2019s. We also prove simple necessary conditions for linear stability, which depend on the batch size, and are easier to compute than the precise threshold. Finally, we derive the asymptotic covariance of the dynamics around the minimum, and discuss its dependence on the learning rate.

(2023) proposed to perform sampling through reverse diffusion, giving rise to Diffusion-based  Monte Carlo (DMC). Specifically,  DMC follows the reverse SDE of a diffusion process that transforms the target distribution to the standard Gaussian, utilizing a non-parametric score estimation. However, the original DMC algorithm encountered high gradient complexity, resulting in an exponential dependency on the error tolerance $\\epsilon$ of the obtained samples. In this paper, we demonstrate that the high complexity of the original DMC algorithm originates from its redundant design of score estimation, and proposed a more efficient DMC algorithm, called RS-DMC, based on a novel recursive score estimation method. In particular, we first divide the entire diffusion process into multiple segments and then formulate the score estimation step (at any time step) as a series of interconnected mean estimation and sampling subproblems accordingly, which are correlated in a recursive manner. Importantly, we show that with a proper design of the segment decomposition, all sampling subproblems will only need to tackle a strongly log-concave distribution, which can be very efficient to solve using the standard sampler (e.g., Langevin Monte Carlo) with a provably rapid convergence rate. As a result, we prove that the gradient complexity of RS-DMC exhibits merely a quasi-polynomial dependency on $\\epsilon$. This finding is highly unexpected as it substantially enhances the prevailing belief of the necessity for exponential gradient complexity in all prior works such as Huang et al. (2023).

Concretely, given an undirected graph $G = (V, E, w)$ with $n$ nodes and positive edge weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E}_{> 0}$, the goal is to return eigenvalue estimates $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1 \\le \\cdots\\le \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ such that \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\\in\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}}|\\widehat{\\lambda}_i-\\lambda_i(N_G)|\\le \\varepsilon, \\end{align*} where ${\\lambda}_1(N_G)\\le \\cdots\\le{\\lambda}_n(N_G)$ are the eigenvalues of $G$\u2019s normalized adjacency matrix, $N_G$. This goal is equivalent to requiring that the Wasserstein-1 distance between the uniform distribution on $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ and the uniform distribution on $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1, \\ldots, \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ is less than $\\varepsilon$. We provide a randomized algorithm that achieves the guarantee above with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$ queries to a degree and neighbor oracle and in $O(n\\varepsilon^{-3})$ time. This improves on previous state-of-the-art methods, including an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-7})$ time algorithm from [Braverman et al., STOC 2022] and, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$, a $2^{O(\\varepsilon^{-1})}$ time method from [Cohen-Steiner et al., KDD 2018]. To achieve this result, we introduce a new notion of graph sparsification, which we call \\emph{nuclear sparsification}. We provide an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-query and $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-time algorithm for computing $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-sparse nuclear sparsifiers. We show that this bound is optimal in both its sparsity and query complexity, and we separate our results from the related notion of additive spectral sparsification. Of independent interest, we show that our sparsification method also yields the first \\emph{deterministic} algorithm for spectral density estimation that scales linearly with $n$ (sublinear in the representation size of the graph).",

The idea is to fit the score of the distribution rather than the likelihood, thus avoiding the need to evaluate the constant of proportionality. While there\u2019s a clear algorithmic benefit, the statistical cost can be steep: recent work by Koehler et al. (2022) showed that for distributions that have poor isoperimetric properties (a large Poincar{\u00e9} or log-Sobolev constant), score matching is substantially statistically less efficient than maximum likelihood.

Lifting the chain by adding a temperature like in simulated tempering can be shown to result in a Gaussian-convolution annealed score matching loss, similar to Song and Ermon (2019). Moreover, we show that if the distribution being learned is a finite mixture of Gaussians in d dimensions with a shared covariance, the sample complexity of annealed score matching is polynomial in the ambient dimension, the diameter of the means, and the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the covariance.

We provide asymptotic characterization for the minimal achievable mean squared error (MMSE) and an approximate message-passing algorithm that reaches the MMSE under conditions analogous to the linear version of the problem.  We also provide asymptotic errors achieved by methods such as principal component analysis combined with Bayesian denoising, and compare them with Bayes-optimal MMSE. }\n}",

To the best of our knowledge this is the first unconditional hardness result for learning a super-constant number of halfspaces. Our lower bounds are obtained in a unified way via a novel connection we make between intersections of halfspaces and the so-called parallel pancakes distribution\u00a0(DKS17, PLBR19, BRST21) that has been at the heart of many lower bound constructions in (robust)  high-dimensional statistics in the past few years.}\n}",

For instance, given a classifier determining loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close their credit cards and bank accounts to fool the classifier. The learning goal is to find a classifier robust against strategic manipulations. Various settings, based on what and when information is known, have been explored in strategic classification. In this work, we focus on addressing a fundamental question: the learnability gaps between strategic classification and standard learning.  We essentially show that any learnable class is also strategically learnable: we first consider a fully informative setting, where the manipulation structure (which is modeled by a manipulation graph $G^\\star$) is known and during training time the learner has access to both the pre-manipulation data and post-manipulation data. We provide nearly tight sample complexity and regret bounds, offering significant improvements over prior results. Then, we relax the fully informative setting by introducing two natural types of uncertainty.  First, following Ahmadi et al.

In the finite population setting containing $n$ individuals, with treatment and control values denoted by the potential outcome vectors $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$, much of the prior work focused on estimating median$(\\mathbf{a}) -$ median$(\\mathbf{b})$, as it is easier to estimate than the desired estimand of median$(\\mathbf{a-b})$, called the Median Treatment Effect (MTE).

We investigate classical principles related to generalization within the context of list learning. Our primary goal is to determine whether classical principles in the PAC setting retain their applicability in the domain of list PAC learning. We focus on uniform convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam\u2019s Razor). In classical PAC learning, both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of \u2018completeness\u2019: whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres to these principles. We ask whether the same completeness holds true in the list learning setting. We show that uniform convergence remains equivalent to learnability in the list PAC learning setting. In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\\{0,1,2\\}$, then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth in 1986. We prove an even stronger impossibility result, showing that there are $2$-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed even when the reconstructed function can work with lists of arbitrarily large size. We prove a similar result for (1-list) PAC learnable classes when the label space is unbounded.",

        "abstract": "Metalearning and multitask learning are two frameworks for solving a group of related learning tasks more efficiently than we could hope to solve each of the individual tasks on their own.  In multitask learning, we are given a fixed set of related learning tasks and need to output one accurate model per task, whereas in metalearning we are given tasks that are drawn i.i.d. from a metadistribution and need to output some common information that can be easily specialized to new, previously unseen tasks from the metadistribution. In this work, we consider a binary classification setting where tasks are related by a shared representation, that is, every task $P$ of interest can be solved by a classifier of the form $f_{P} \\circ h$ where $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ is a map from features to some representation space that is shared across tasks, and $f_{P} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is a task-specific classifier from the representation space to labels.  The main question we ask in this work is how much data do we need to metalearn a good representation? Here, the amount of data is measured in terms of both the number of tasks $t$ that we need to see and the number of samples $n$ per task. We focus on the regime where the number of samples per task is extremely small. Our main result shows that, in a distribution-free setting where the feature vectors are in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the representation is a linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$, and the task-specific classifiers are halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^k$, we can metalearn a representation with error $\\varepsilon$ using just $n = k+2$ samples per task, and $d \\cdot (1/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ tasks.  Learning with so few samples per task is remarkable because metalearning would be impossible with $k+1$ samples per task, and because we cannot even hope to learn an accurate task-specific classifier with just $k+2$ samples per task.  To obtain this result, we develop a sample-and-task-complexity theory for distribution-free metalearning and multitask learning, which identifies what properties of $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{H}$ make metalearning possible with few samples per task.  Our theory also yields a simple characterization of distribution-free multitask learning.  Finally, we give sample-efficient reductions between metalearning and multitask learning, which, when combined with our characterization of multitask learning, give a characterization of metalearning in certain parameter regimes.",

Here, the amount of data is measured in terms of both the number of tasks $t$ that we need to see and the number of samples $n$ per task. We focus on the regime where the number of samples per task is extremely small. Our main result shows that, in a distribution-free setting where the feature vectors are in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the representation is a linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$, and the task-specific classifiers are halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^k$, we can metalearn a representation with error $\\varepsilon$ using just $n = k+2$ samples per task, and $d \\cdot (1/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ tasks.  Learning with so few samples per task is remarkable because metalearning would be impossible with $k+1$ samples per task, and because we cannot even hope to learn an accurate task-specific classifier with just $k+2$ samples per task.  To obtain this result, we develop a sample-and-task-complexity theory for distribution-free metalearning and multitask learning, which identifies what properties of $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{H}$ make metalearning possible with few samples per task.  Our theory also yields a simple characterization of distribution-free multitask learning.  Finally, we give sample-efficient reductions between metalearning and multitask learning, which, when combined with our characterization of multitask learning, give a characterization of metalearning in certain parameter regimes.}\n}",

        "abstract": "We study optimization problems in a metric space $(\\mathcal{X},d)$ where we can compute distances in two ways: via a \u201cstrong\u201d oracle that returns exact distances $d(x,y)$, and a \u201cweak\u201d oracle that returns distances $\\tilde{d}(x,y)$ which may be arbitrarily corrupted with some probability. This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both \u201cpoint queries\u201d, where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\cX $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and \u201cedge queries\u201d where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$.  Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation. For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$.  Surprisingly, for the MST problem we give a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ approximation algorithm using no strong oracle queries at all, and we prove a matching $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ lower bound which holds even if $\\Tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ strong oracle point queries are allowed. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our algorithms, and show that their quality is comparable to that of the baseline algorithms that are given all true distances, but while querying the strong oracle on only a small fraction ($<1%$) of points.",

        "abstract": "We develop a new technique for proving distribution testing lower bounds for properties defined by inequalities on the individual bin probabilities (such as monotonicity and log-concavity). The basic idea is to find a base distribution $Q$ where these inequalities barely hold in many places. We then find two different ensembles of distributions that modify $Q$ in slightly different ways. We use a moment matching construction so that each ensemble has the same bin moments (in particular the expectation over the choice of distribution $p$ of $p_{i}^t$ is the same for the two ensembles for small integers $t$). We show that this makes it impossible to distinguish between the two ensembles with a small number of samples. On the other hand, we construct them so that one ensemble will tweak Q in such a way that it may violate the defining inequalities of the property in question in many places, while the second ensembles does not. Since any valid tester for this property must be able to reliably distinguish these ensembles, we obtain a lower bound of testing the property. Roughly speaking, if we can construct Q which nearly violates the defining inequalities in n places and if the desired error $\\epilon$ is small enough relative to n, we hope to obtain a lower bound of roughly $\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}$ up to log factors. In particular, we obtain a lower bound of $\\Omega( \\min(n,(1/\\epsilon)/ \\log^3(1/\\epsilon))\\allowbreak / ( \\epsilon^2 \\log^7(1/\\epsilon)))$  for monotonicity testing on $[n]$ and $\\Omega(\\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\epsilon^{-2} \\min(n,\\epsilon^{-1/2}\\log^{-3/2}(1/\\epsilon)))$ for log-concavity testing on $[n]$, the latter of which matches known upper bounds to within logarithmic factors. More generally, for monotonicity testing on $[n]^d$, we have the lower bound of $2^{-O(d)}d^{-d} \\epsilon^{-2} \\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\min(n,d \\epsilon^{-1} \\log^{-3}(1/\\epsilon))^d$.",

Roughly speaking, if we can construct Q which nearly violates the defining inequalities in n places and if the desired error $\\epilon$ is small enough relative to n, we hope to obtain a lower bound of roughly $\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}$ up to log factors. In particular, we obtain a lower bound of $\\Omega( \\min(n,(1/\\epsilon)/ \\log^3(1/\\epsilon))\\allowbreak / ( \\epsilon^2 \\log^7(1/\\epsilon)))$  for monotonicity testing on $[n]$ and $\\Omega(\\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\epsilon^{-2} \\min(n,\\epsilon^{-1/2}\\log^{-3/2}(1/\\epsilon)))$ for log-concavity testing on $[n]$, the latter of which matches known upper bounds to within logarithmic factors. More generally, for monotonicity testing on $[n]^d$, we have the lower bound of $2^{-O(d)}d^{-d} \\epsilon^{-2} \\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\min(n,d \\epsilon^{-1} \\log^{-3}(1/\\epsilon))^d$.}\n}",

For a certain range of $\\beta$, that depends only on the expected degree $d$ of the graph, and for typical instances of the {2-spin model} on $G(n,d/n)$, we show that the corresponding (single-site) Glauber dynamics exhibits mixing time $O\\left(n^{2+\\frac{3}{\\log^2 d}}\\right)$.

This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by B\u0142{}asiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the offline setting. The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the $L_1$ calibration error and its variants. We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes. At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. We then show that an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class. On the lower bound side, an $\\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps). Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.",

Assuming access to an (offline) ERM oracle, we show that there exists a computationally efficient online predictor that achieves a regret upper bounded by $\\tilde{O}(T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ for a finite-VC class, and upper bounded by $\\tilde{O}(T^{\\frac{p+1}{p+2}})$ for a class with $\\alpha$ fat-shattering dimension $\\alpha^{-p}$. This provides the first known oracle-efficient sublinear regret bounds for hybrid online learning with an unknown feature generation process. In particular, it confirms a conjecture of Lazaric and Munos (2012).

Several quantum advantages have been demonstrated in this setting, however, none are generic: they apply to particular concept classes and typically only work when the distribution that generates the data is known. In the general case, it was recently shown by Arunachalam and de Wolf [JMLR, 19 (2018) 1-36] that quantum PAC learners can only achieve constant factor advantages over classical PAC learners. We show that with a natural extension of the definition of quantum PAC learning used by Arunachalam and de Wolf, we can achieve a generic advantage in quantum learning.

Comput. 1998, 28, 1136\u20131153]. Several quantum advantages have been demonstrated in this setting, however, none are generic: they apply to particular concept classes and typically only work when the distribution that generates the data is known. In the general case, it was recently shown by Arunachalam and de Wolf [JMLR, 19 (2018) 1-36] that quantum PAC learners can only achieve constant factor advantages over classical PAC learners. We show that with a natural extension of the definition of quantum PAC learning used by Arunachalam and de Wolf, we can achieve a generic advantage in quantum learning.

We introduce the CVaR$_\\delta$-competitive ratio ($\\delta$-CR) using the conditional value-at-risk of an algorithm\u2019s cost, which measures the expectation of the $(1-\\delta)$-fraction of worst outcomes against the offline optimal cost, and use this measure to study three online optimization problems: continuous-time ski rental, discrete-time ski rental, and one-max search. The structure of the optimal $\\delta$-CR and algorithm varies significantly between problems: we prove that the optimal $\\delta$-CR for continuous-time ski rental is $2-2^{-\\Theta(\\frac{1}{1-\\delta})}$, obtained by an algorithm described by a delay differential equation.

We study the tradeoffs between efficacy and smooth safety costs of SLBs over polytopes, and the role of aggressive {doubly-optimistic play} in avoiding the strong assumptions made by extant pessimistic-optimistic approaches.  We first elucidate an inherent hardness in SLBs due the lack of knowledge of constraints: there exist \u2018easy\u2019 instances, for which suboptimal extreme points have large \u2018gaps\u2019, but on which SLB methods must still incur $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ regret or safety violations, due to an inability to resolve unknown optima to arbitrary precision.

Further, when safety is demanded to a finite precision, violations improve to $O(\\log^2 T).$ These results rely on a novel dual analysis of linear bandits: we argue that \\textsc{doss} proceeds by activating noisy versions of at least $d$ constraints in each round, which allows us to separately analyse rounds where a \u2018poor\u2019 set of constraints is activated, and rounds where \u2018good\u2019 sets of constraints are activated.

        "abstract": "Inverse propensity-score weighted (IPW) estimators are prevalent in causal inference for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies. Under unconfoundedness, given accurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, the size of confidence intervals of IPW estimators scales down with $n$, and, several of their variants improve the rate of scaling. However, neither IPW estimators nor their variants are robust to inaccuracies: even if a single covariate has an $\\epsilon>0$ additive error in the propensity score, the size of confidence intervals of these estimators can increase arbitrarily. Moreover, even without errors, the rate with which the confidence intervals of these estimators go to zero with $n$ can be arbitrarily slow in the presence of extreme propensity scores (those close to 0 or 1). We introduce a family of Coarse IPW (CIPW) estimators that captures existing IPW estimators and their variants.

Still, there are many problems in differential privacy for which we don\u2019t know suitable lower bounds, and even for problems that we do, the lower bounds are not smooth, and usually become vacuous when the error is larger than some threshold. In this work, we present a new framework and tools to generate smooth lower bounds on the sample complexity of differentially private algorithms satisfying very weak accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of our method by providing new lower bounds in various settings: 1. A tight lower bound for DP averaging in the low-accuracy regime, which in particular implies a lower bound for the private 1-cluster problem introduced by Nissim, Stemmer, and Vadhan (PODS 2016). 2. A lower bound on the additive error of DP algorithms for approximate k-means clustering and general (k,z)-clustering, as a function of the multiplicative error, which is tight for a constant multiplication error. 3. A lower bound for estimating the top singular vector of a matrix under DP in low-accuracy regimes, which is a special case of DP subspace estimation studied by Singhal and Steinke (NeurIPS 2021). Our main technique is to apply a padding-and-permuting transformation to a fingerprinting code. However, rather than proving our results using a black-box access to an existing fingerprinting code (e.g., Tardos\u2019 code), we develop a new fingerprinting lemma that is stronger than those of Dwork et al.

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d. Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators.

Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d. Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation.

        "abstract": "We revisit the fundamental problem of learning with distribution shift, in which a learner is given labeled samples from training distribution D, unlabeled samples from test distribution D\u2019 and is asked to output a classifier with low test error.  The standard approach in this setting is to bound the loss of a classifier in terms of some notion of distance between D and D\u2019.  These distances, however, seem difficult to compute and do not lead to efficient algorithms. We depart from this paradigm and define a new model called  testable learning with distribution shift, where we can obtain provably efficient algorithms for certifying the performance of a classifier on a test distribution.  In this model, a learner outputs a classifier with low test error whenever samples from D and D\u2019 pass an associated test; moreover, the test must accept (with high probability) if the marginal of D equals the marginal of D\u2019. We give several positive results for learning well-studied concept classes such as halfspaces, intersections of halfspaces, and decision trees when the marginal of D is Gaussian or uniform on the hypercube.  Prior to our work, no efficient algorithms for these basic cases were known without strong assumptions on D\u2019. For halfspaces in the realizable case (where there exists a halfspace consistent with both D and D\u2019), we combine a moment-matching approach with ideas from active learning to simulate an efficient oracle for estimating disagreement regions. To extend to the non-realizable setting, we apply recent work from testable (agnostic) learning.  More generally, we prove that any function class with low-degree $\\mathcal{L}_2$-sandwiching polynomial approximators can be learned in our model.  Since we require $\\mathcal{L}_2$- sandwiching (instead of the usual $\\mathcal{L}_1$ loss), we cannot directly appeal to convex duality and instead apply constructions from the pseudorandomness literature to obtain the required approximators.  We also provide lower bounds to show that the guarantees we obtain on the performance of our output hypotheses are best possible up to constant factors, as well as a separation showing that realizable learning in our model is incomparable to (ordinary) agnostic learning.",

One theme of the work is understanding how these dimensions may be re-expressed as natural dimensions of the convexity space of version spaces. Specifically, we find that the star number is precisely the VC dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions), whereas the eluder dimension is precisely the threshold dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions). We are also interested in understanding direct relations among these dimensions. For instance, we show that there is no infinite concept class with both finite Littlestone dimension and finite star number. Moreover, any infinite concept class must have infinite eluder dimension. In both cases, we also provide quantitative relations to the cardinality of the class. For the latter result, we also show an analogous relation for real-valued functions, where the cardinality of the class is replaced by the $L_\\infty$ covering number. As another relation between star numbers and VC dimension, we provide a simple, precise, and general characterization of the VC dimension of the minimal intersection-closed class containing a given concept class: namely, the 1-centered star number of the original class. Moreover, we generalize this result to provide a unifying approach to the design of certain sample compression schemes, along with a simple combinatorial dimension characterizing its compression size: the minimum star number. We also discuss a number of implications of many of these observations. Though the proofs of the above observations are actually all incredibly simple, it is interesting that such fundamental relations among these well-known quantities appear to have heretofore gone unnoticed in the literature.",

We prove a new instance specific lower bound using a new divergence and show it characterizes the local minimax optimal rates for private statistical estimation. We propose two new mechanisms that are universally instance-optimal for general estimation problems up to logarithmic factors. Our first mechanism, the total variation mechanism, builds on the exponential mechanism with stable approximations of the total variation distance, and is universally instance-optimal in the high privacy regime $\\epsilon \\leq 1/\\sqrt{n}$. Our second mechanism, the T-mechanism, is based on the T-estimator framework (Birg{\u00e9}, 2006) using the clipped log likelihood ratio as a stable test: it attains instance-optimal rates for any $\\epsilon \\leq 1$ up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we study the implications of our results to robust statistical estimation, and show that our algorithms are universally optimal for this problem, characterizing the optimal minimax rates for robust statistical estimation.",
