The main component of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm (Luo and Schapire, 2014), called AdaNormalHedge. On one hand, this new algorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost constant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the algorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts simultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and the competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al. (2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the sleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of AdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2) predicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these applications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a special case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by Warmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal shifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses.",

For Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff induction we have invariance theorems: the choice of the UTM changes bounds only by a constant. For the universally intelligent agent AIXI (Hutter, 2005) no invariance theorem is known.

Hartigan consistency has been used extensively as a framework to analyze such clustering algorithms from a statistical point of view. Still, as we show in the paper, a tree which is Hartigan consistent with a given density can look very different than the correct limit tree. Specifically, Hartigan consistency permits two types of undesirable configurations which we term \\emphover-segmentation and \\emphimproper nesting.  Moreover, Hartigan consistency is a limit property and does not directly quantify difference between trees. In this paper we identify two limit properties, \\emphseparation and \\emphminimality, which address both over-segmentation and improper nesting and together imply (but are not implied by) Hartigan consistency. We proceed to introduce a \\emphmerge distortion metric between hierarchical clusterings and show that convergence in our distance implies both separation and minimality. We also prove that uniform separation and minimality imply convergence in the merge distortion metric.  Furthermore, we show that our merge distortion metric is stable under perturbations of the density. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of these concepts by proving convergence results for two clustering algorithms.

Here, we propose a new and natural solution concept, rooted in game theory, called a \\emphvon Neumann winner, a randomized policy that beats or ties every other policy. We show that this notion overcomes important limitations of existing solutions, particularly the Condorcet winner which has typically been used in the past, but which requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We then present three \\emphefficient algorithms for online learning in our setting, and for approximating a von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these algorithms achieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although its time and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space.

A series of recent works (Keshavan 2012),(Jain et al. 2013) and (Hardt, 2013) have proposed fast non-convex optimization based iterative algorithms to solve this problem. However, the sample complexity in all these results is sub-optimal in its dependence on the rank, condition number and the desired accuracy. In this paper, we present a fast iterative algorithm that solves the matrix completion problem by observing O\\left(nr^5 \\log^3 n\\right) entries, which is independent of the condition number and the desired accuracy. The run time of our algorithm is O\\left( nr^7\\log^3 n\\log 1/\u03b5\\right) which is near linear in the dimension of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near linear time algorithm for exact matrix completion with finite sample complexity (i.e. independent of \u03b5). Our algorithm is based on a well known projected gradient descent method, where the projection is onto the (non-convex) set of low rank matrices. There are two key ideas in our result: 1) our argument is based on a \\ell_\u221enorm potential function (as opposed to the spectral norm) and provides a novel way to obtain perturbation bounds for it. 2) we prove and use a natural extension of the Davis-Kahan theorem to obtain perturbation bounds on the best low rank approximation of matrices with good eigen gap. Both of these ideas may be of independent interest.",

In this framework, the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of n items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size L and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as online gambling and online max cut. Christiano (2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of O(\\sqrtnL^3 T), where T is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of O(\\sqrtn \\log L T). One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap. In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based algorithm of Christiano (2014a) in fact achieves a regret of O(\\sqrtnLT). Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well.",

        "abstract": "We consider an online density estimation problem for the Bradley-Terry model, where each model parameter defines the probability of a match result between any pair in a set of n teams. The problem is hard because the loss function (i.e., the negative log-likelihood function in our problem setting) is not convex. To avoid the non-convexity, we can change parameters so that the loss function becomes convex with respect to the new parameter. But then the radius K of the reparameterized domain may be infinite, where K depends on the outcome sequence. So we put a mild assumption that guarantees that K is finite. We can thus employ standard online convex optimization algorithms, namely OGD and ONS, over the reparameterized domain, and get regret bounds O(n^\\frac12(\\ln K)\\sqrtT) and O(n^\\frac32K\\ln T), respectively, where T is the horizon of the game. The bounds roughly means that OGD is better when K is large while ONS is better when K is small. But how large can K be? We show that K can be as large as \u0398(T^n-1), which implies that the worst case regret bounds of OGD and ONS are O(n^\\frac32\\sqrtT\\ln T) and \\tildeO(n^\\frac32(T)^n-1), respectively. We then propose a version of Follow the Regularized Leader, whose regret bound is close to the minimum of those of OGD and ONS. In other words, our algorithm is competitive with both for a wide range of values of K. In particular, our algorithm achieves the worst case regret bound O(n^\\frac52T^\\frac13 \\ln T), which is slightly better than OGD with respect to T. In addition, our algorithm works without the knowledge K, which is a practical advantage.",

It is the first teaching complexity notion for which interesting relationships to the VC dimension (VCD) have been established. In particular, for finite maximum classes of a given VCD d, the RTD equals d. To date, there is no concept class known for which the ratio of RTD over VCD exceeds 3/2. However, the only known upper bound on RTD in terms of VCD is exponential in the VCD and depends on the size of the concept class. We pose the following question: is the RTD upper-bounded by a function that grows only linearly in the VCD? Answering this question would further our understanding of the relationships between the complexity of teaching and the complexity of learning from randomly chosen examples. In addition, the answer to this question, whether positive or negative, is known to have implications on the study of the long-standing open sample compression conjecture, which claims that every concept class of VCD d has a sample compression scheme in which samples for concepts in the class are compressed to subsets of size no larger than d.",

In particular, for finite maximum classes of a given VCD d, the RTD equals d. To date, there is no concept class known for which the ratio of RTD over VCD exceeds 3/2. However, the only known upper bound on RTD in terms of VCD is exponential in the VCD and depends on the size of the concept class. We pose the following question: is the RTD upper-bounded by a function that grows only linearly in the VCD? Answering this question would further our understanding of the relationships between the complexity of teaching and the complexity of learning from randomly chosen examples. In addition, the answer to this question, whether positive or negative, is known to have implications on the study of the long-standing open sample compression conjecture, which claims that every concept class of VCD d has a sample compression scheme in which samples for concepts in the class are compressed to subsets of size no larger than d.}\n}",

We show that, for a wide class of \\emphwell-clustered graphs, spectral clustering algorithms can give a good approximation of the optimal clustering.

Its standard formulation is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in practice by heuristics based on alternating minimization.  Recent work has resulted in several algorithms for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but somewhat surprisingly these are outperformed by the simple alternating minimization heuristics. Here we give a general framework for understanding alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze existing heuristics and to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of these algorithms seem implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the original motivation of Olshausen and Field in introducing sparse coding. We also give the first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time exponential in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the sample complexity of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis framework will have applications in other settings where simple iterative algorithms are used",

Leveraging connections between elicitation and convex analysis, we address the vector-valued property case, which has received little attention in the literature despite its applications to both machine learning and statistics. We first provide a very general characterization of linear and ratio-of-linear properties, the first of which resolves an open problem by unifying and strengthening several previous characterizations in machine learning and statistics.  We then ask which vectors of properties admit nonseparable scores, which cannot be expressed as a sum of scores for each coordinate separately, a natural desideratum for machine learning.  We show that linear and ratio-of-linear do admit nonseparable scores, and provide evidence for a conjecture that these are the only such properties (up to link functions). Finally, we give a general method for producing identification functions and address an open problem by showing that convex maximal level sets are insufficient for elicitability in general.",
