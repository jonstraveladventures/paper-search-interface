We derive the first small-loss bound for general strongly observable graphs, resolving an open problem of Lykouris et al. (2018). Specifically, we develop an algorithm with regret $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{\\kappa L_*})$ where $\\kappa$ is the clique partition number and $L_*$ is the loss of the best arm, and for the special case of self-aware graphs where every arm has a self-loop, we improve the regret to $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{\\alpha T}, \\sqrt{\\kappa L_*}\\})$ where $\\alpha \\leq \\kappa$ is the independence number. Our results significantly improve and extend those by Lykouris et al. (2018) who only consider self-aware undirected graphs. Furthermore, we also take the first attempt at deriving small-loss bounds for weakly observable graphs. We first prove that no typical small-loss bounds are achievable in this case, and then propose algorithms with alternative small-loss bounds in terms of the loss of some specific subset of arms. A surprising side result is that $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable even for weakly observable graphs as long as the best arm has a self-loop. Our algorithms are based on the Online Mirror Descent framework but require a suite of novel techniques that might be of independent interest. Moreover, all our algorithms can be made parameter-free without the knowledge of the environment.",

This technique yields several new representation and learning results for neural networks: 1.  Two-layer neural networks in the random features regime (RF) can memorize arbitrary labels for $n$ arbitrary points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\tilde{O}(\\tfrac{n}{\\theta^4})$ ReLUs, where $\\theta$ is the minimum distance between two different points. This bound can be shown to be optimal in $n$ up to logarithmic factors. 2.  Two-layer neural networks with ReLUs and smoothed ReLUs can represent functions with an error of at most $\\epsilon$ with $O(C(a,d)\\epsilon^{-1/(a+1)})$ units for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}$ when the function has $\\Theta(ad)$ bounded derivatives. In certain cases $d$ can be replaced with effective dimension $q \\ll d$. Our results indicate that neural networks with only a single nonlinear layer are surprisingly powerful with regards to representation, and show that in contrast to what is suggested in recent work, depth is not needed in order to represent highly smooth functions. 3. Gradient Descent on the recombination weights of a two-layer random features network with ReLUs and smoothed ReLUs can learn low degree polynomials up to squared error $\\epsilon$ with  $\\mathrm{subpoly}(1/\\epsilon)$ units.

Polynomial-time solutions to this problem are known but have high runtime due to their use of semi-definite programming (SDP).

In particular, the number of label queries should be independent of the complexity of $H$, and the function $h$ should be well-defined, independent of $x$.  This immediately also implies an algorithm for {\\em distance estimation}: estimating the value $opt(H)$ from many fewer labels than needed to actually learn a near-optimal $h \\in H$, by running local learning on a few random query points and computing the average error. For the hypothesis class consisting of functions supported on the interval $[0,1]$ with Lipschitz constant bounded by $L$, we present an algorithm that makes $O(({1 / \\epsilon^6}) \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ label queries from an unlabeled pool of $O(({L / \\epsilon^4})\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ samples.

We further generalize our algorithm to more than one dimensions. We emphasize that the number of labels used is independent of the complexity of the hypothesis class which is linear in $L$ in the one-dimensional case. Furthermore, we give an algorithm to locally estimate the values of a near-optimal function at a few query points of interest with number of labels independent of $L$.

Next, we study maximization of an adaptive submodular function, which is submodular in a probabilistic sense, subject to a stochastic knapsack constraint, which requires the total item cost to be within a given capacity with probability one. We present the MIX policy for this problem; our approximation guarantee for it is the first known approximation guarantee for maximizing a non-linear utility function subject to a stochastic knapsack constraint. Using alternative parameterizations of MIX, we also derive the first known approximation guarantees for maximizing an adaptive submodular function subject to a deterministic knapsack constraint. Our guarantees are powered by an innovative differential analysis technique which models the $\\beta$-GREEDY policy using a continuous-time stochastic reward process of a particle whose reward is related to the optimal utility through a differential inequality.

        "abstract": "Motivated by applications in crowd-sourcing and rank aggregation, a recent line of work has studied the problem of estimating an $n \\times n$ bivariate isotonic matrix with an unknown permutation acting on its rows (and possibly another unknown permutation acting on its columns) from partial and noisy observations. There are wide and persistent computational vs. statistical gaps for this problem. It is known that the minimax optimal rate is $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1})$ when error is measured in average squared Frobenius norm. However the best known polynomial time computable estimator due to \\cite{coltpaper} achieves the rate $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-\\frac{3}{4}})$, and this is the natural barrier to approaches based on using local statistics to figure out the relative order of pairs of rows without using information from the rest of the matrix. Here we introduce a framework for exploiting global information in shape-constrained estimation problems.

There are wide and persistent computational vs. statistical gaps for this problem. It is known that the minimax optimal rate is $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1})$ when error is measured in average squared Frobenius norm. However the best known polynomial time computable estimator due to \\cite{coltpaper} achieves the rate $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-\\frac{3}{4}})$, and this is the natural barrier to approaches based on using local statistics to figure out the relative order of pairs of rows without using information from the rest of the matrix. Here we introduce a framework for exploiting global information in shape-constrained estimation problems. In the case when only the rows are permuted, we give an algorithm that achieves error rate $O(n^{-1 + o(1)})$, which essentially closes the computational vs. statistical gap for this problem. When both the rows and columns are permuted, we give an improved algorithm that achieves error rate $O(n^{-\\frac{5}{6} + o(1)})$.

        "abstract": "Motivated by applications such as discovering strong ties in social networks and assembling genome subsequences in biology, we study the problem of recovering a hidden $2k$-nearest neighbor (NN) graph in an $n$-vertex complete graph, whose edge weights are independent and distributed according to $P_n$ for edges in the hidden $2k$-NN graph and $Q_n$ otherwise. The special case of Bernoulli distributions corresponds to a variant of the Watts-Strogatz small-world graph. We focus on two types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as $n\\to \\infty$: (1) exact recovery: all edges are classified correctly with probability tending to one; (2) almost exact recovery: the expected number of misclassified edges is $o(nk)$. We show that the maximum likelihood estimator achieves (1) exact recovery for $2 \\le k \\le n^{o(1)}$ if $ \\liminf \\frac{2\\alpha_n}{\\log n}>1$; (2) almost exact recovery for $ 1 \\le k \\le o\\left( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n} \\right)$ if $ \\liminf \\frac{kD(P_n||Q_n)}{\\log n}>1, $ where $\\alpha_n \\triangleq -2 \\log \\int \\sqrt{d P_n d Q_n}$ is the R\u00e9nyi divergence of order $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $D(P_n||Q_n)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Under mild distributional assumptions, these conditions are shown to be information-theoretically necessary for any algorithm to succeed.

The special case of Bernoulli distributions corresponds to a variant of the Watts-Strogatz small-world graph. We focus on two types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as $n\\to \\infty$: (1) exact recovery: all edges are classified correctly with probability tending to one; (2) almost exact recovery: the expected number of misclassified edges is $o(nk)$. We show that the maximum likelihood estimator achieves (1) exact recovery for $2 \\le k \\le n^{o(1)}$ if $ \\liminf \\frac{2\\alpha_n}{\\log n}>1$; (2) almost exact recovery for $ 1 \\le k \\le o\\left( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n} \\right)$ if $ \\liminf \\frac{kD(P_n||Q_n)}{\\log n}>1, $ where $\\alpha_n \\triangleq -2 \\log \\int \\sqrt{d P_n d Q_n}$ is the R\u00e9nyi divergence of order $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $D(P_n||Q_n)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Under mild distributional assumptions, these conditions are shown to be information-theoretically necessary for any algorithm to succeed. A key challenge in the analysis is the enumeration of $2k$-NN graphs that differ from the hidden one by a given number of edges. We also analyze several computationally efficient algorithms and provide sufficient conditions under which they achieve exact/almost exact recovery.

We give natural conditions under which these algorithms are differentially private, efficient, and noise-tolerant PAC learners. To demonstrate our framework, we use it to construct noise-tolerant and private PAC learners for large-margin halfspaces whose sample complexity does not depend on the dimension. We give two sample complexity bounds for our large-margin halfspace learner. One bound is based only on differential privacy, and uses this guarantee as an asset for ensuring generalization. This first bound illustrates a general methodology for obtaining PAC learners from privacy, which may be of independent interest.

We give two sample complexity bounds for our large-margin halfspace learner. One bound is based only on differential privacy, and uses this guarantee as an asset for ensuring generalization. This first bound illustrates a general methodology for obtaining PAC learners from privacy, which may be of independent interest.

Despite their widespread use, their theoretical underpinnings are far from being fully understood. Recent breakthrough advances have shown that such greedily built trees are asymptotically consistent [Biau et al. 2010, Denil et al. 2014, Scornet et al. 2015] in the low dimensional regime, where the number of features is a constant, independent of the sample size. Also, the works of [Mentch et al. 2016, Wager et al. 2018] provide asymptotic normality results for honest versions of Random Forests. In this work, we analyze the performance of regression trees and forests with binary features in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of features can grow exponentially with the number of samples.  We show that trees and forests built greedily based on the celebrated CART criterion, provably adapt to sparsity: when only a subset $R$, of size $r$, of the features are relevant, then the mean squared error of appropriately shallow trees, or  fully grown honest forests, scales exponentially only with the number of relevant features and depends only logarithmically on the overall number of features. More precisely, we identify three regimes, each providing different dependence on the number of relevant features. When the relevant variables are \u201cweakly\u201d relevant (in the sense that there is not strong separation between the relevant and irrelevant variables in terms of their ability to reduce variance), then shallow trees achieve \u201cslow rates\u201d on the mean squared error of the order of $2^r/\\sqrt{n}$, when variables are independent, and $1/n^{1/(r+2)}$, when variables are dependent. When the relevant variables are \u201cstrongly\u201d relevant, in that there is a separation in their ability to reduce variance as compared to the irrelevant ones, by a constant $\\beta_{\\min}$, then we show that greedily built shallow trees and fully grown honest forests can achieve fast parametric mean squared error rates of the order of $2^r/(\\beta_{\\min}\\,{n})$. When variables are strongly relevant, we also show that the predictions of sub-sampled honest forests have an asymptotically normal distribution centered around their true values and whose variance scales at most as $O(2^r \\log(n)/(\\beta_{\\min}\\,{n}))$. Thus, sub-sampled honest forests are provably a data-adaptive method for non-parametric inference, that adapts to the latent sparsity dimension of the data generating distribution, as opposed to classical non-parametric regression approaches. Our results show that, at least for the case of binary features, forest based algorithms can offer immense improvement on the statistical power of non-parametric hypothesis tests in high-dimensional regimes.",

        "author": "Mikito Nanashima",
        "abstract": "We investigate the meaning of efficient learnability from several different perspectives. The purpose is to give new insights into central problems in computational learning theory (CoLT). Specifically, we discuss the following two questions related to efficient PAC learnability. First, we investigate the gap between PAC learnability for polynomial-size circuits and weak cryptographic primitives taking auxiliary-input. Applebaum et al. observed that such a weak primitive is enough to show the hardness of PAC learning. However, the opposite direction is still unknown. In this paper, we introduce the following two notions: (1) a variant model of PAC learning whose hardness corresponds to auxiliary-input one-way functions; (2) a variant of a hitting set generator corresponding to the hardness of PAC learning. The equivalence gives a clearer insight into the gap between the hardness of learning and weak cryptographic primitives. Second, we discuss why proving efficient learnability is difficult. This question is natural because few classes are known to be polynomially learnable at present. In this paper, we formulate a task of determining efficient learnability as a meta-PAC learning problem and show that our meta-PAC learning is exactly as hard as PAC learning. Our result insists on one possibility: a hard-to-learn instance itself yields the hardness of proving efficient learnability.

The purpose is to give new insights into central problems in computational learning theory (CoLT). Specifically, we discuss the following two questions related to efficient PAC learnability. First, we investigate the gap between PAC learnability for polynomial-size circuits and weak cryptographic primitives taking auxiliary-input. Applebaum et al. observed that such a weak primitive is enough to show the hardness of PAC learning. However, the opposite direction is still unknown. In this paper, we introduce the following two notions: (1) a variant model of PAC learning whose hardness corresponds to auxiliary-input one-way functions; (2) a variant of a hitting set generator corresponding to the hardness of PAC learning. The equivalence gives a clearer insight into the gap between the hardness of learning and weak cryptographic primitives. Second, we discuss why proving efficient learnability is difficult. This question is natural because few classes are known to be polynomially learnable at present. In this paper, we formulate a task of determining efficient learnability as a meta-PAC learning problem and show that our meta-PAC learning is exactly as hard as PAC learning. Our result insists on one possibility: a hard-to-learn instance itself yields the hardness of proving efficient learnability. Our technical contribution is to give (1) a general framework for translating the hardness of PAC learning into auxiliary-input primitives, and (2) a new formulation to discuss the hardness of determining efficient learnability. Our work yields new important frontiers related to CoLT, including investigation of the learning hierarchy. }\n}",

Given sample access to the Gibbs distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$  and given an explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are (statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al.\u00a0(2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model. In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) Ising model, Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al.\u00a0(2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there is no identity testing algorithm when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the visible graph and $\\beta$ is the largest edge weight (in absolute value).

In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model. Previous hardness results for identity testing of Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al.

Since RBMs are on bipartite graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a novel methodology to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem and utilize the phase transition that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts model.

As a more minor contribution, we also provide a non-asymptotic $\\Omega(1/k^2)$ lower bound (independent of $n$) for the incremental gradient method, when no random shuffling takes place. Finally, we provide an indication that our lower bounds are tight, by proving matching upper bounds for univariate quadratic functions.}\n}",

Information-theoretic arguments provide a lower bound on the minimum number of samples necessary to perfectly identify the support of any multivariate normal distribution as a function of model parameters. For a model defined on a sparse graph with $p$ nodes, a maximum degree $d$ and minimum normalized edge strength $\\kappa$, this necessary number of samples scales at least as $d \\log p/\\kappa^2$. The sample complexity requirements of existing methods for perfect graph reconstruction exhibit dependency on additional parameters that do not enter in the lower bound.

In this paper, we constructively answer this question and propose an algorithm, termed DICE, whose sample complexity matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to a universal constant factor. We also propose a related algorithm SLICE that has a slightly higher sample complexity, but can be implemented as a mixed integer quadratic program which makes it attractive in practice.

We give the first computationally efficient algorithm for this problem with respect to a broad family of distributions, including log-concave distributions.

We consider a family of Markov games where the reward function and transition kernel possess a linear structure.

In the online setting, we control a single player and  play against an arbitrary opponent; the goal is to minimize the regret. For both settings, we propose an optimistic variant of the least-squares minimax value iteration algorithm. We show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and provably achieves an $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{d^3 H^3 T} )$ upper bound on the duality gap and regret, without requiring additional assumptions on the sampling model. We highlight that our setting requires overcoming several new challenges that are absent in MDPs or turn-based Markov games. In particular,  to  achieve optimism under the simultaneous-move games,  we construct both upper and lower confidence bounds of the value function, and then derive the optimistic policy by solving a general-sum matrix game with these bounds as the payoff matrices. As finding the Nash Equilibrium of this general-sum game is computationally hard, our algorithm instead solves for a Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE), which can be obtained efficiently via linear programming.

Interesting different behaviors are shown for larger dimensionality.  Specifically, on the negative side, if $d = \\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$, any algorithm is guaranteed regret of $\\Omega(d \\log T)$ (greater than $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$) under $L_\\infty$ constraints on the parameters (and the example features).

The computational limitation of applying SGD to solving these relaxations in large-scale is the need to compute a potentially high-rank singular value decomposition (SVD) on each iteration in order to enforce the low-rank-promoting constraint. We begin by considering a simple and natural sufficient condition so that these relaxations indeed admit low-rank solutions. This condition is also necessary for a certain notion of low-rank-robustness to hold. Our main result shows that under this condition which involves the eigenvalues of the gradient vector at optimal points, SGD with mini-batches, when initialized with a \u201cwarm-start\" point, produces iterates that are low-rank with high probability, and hence only a low-rank SVD computation is required on each iteration. This suggests that SGD may indeed be practically applicable to solving large-scale convex relaxations of low-rank matrix recovery problems. Our theoretical results are accompanied with supporting preliminary empirical evidence. As a side benefit, our analysis is quite simple and short.",

In contrast, a locally differentially private algorithm may only access data through public interaction with data holders, and this interaction must be a differentially private function of the data. We study the intermediate model of \\emph{pan-privacy}. Unlike a locally private algorithm, a pan-private algorithm receives data in the clear. Unlike a centrally private algorithm, the algorithm receives data one element at a time and must maintain a differentially private internal state while processing this stream. First, we show that pan-privacy against multiple intrusions on the internal state is equivalent to sequentially interactive local privacy. Next, we contextualize pan-privacy against a single intrusion by analyzing the sample complexity of uniformity testing over domain $[k]$. Focusing on the dependence on $k$, centrally private uniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(\\sqrt{k})$, while noninteractive locally private uniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(k)$. We show that the sample complexity of pan-private uniformity testing is $\\Theta(k^{2/3})$.

In contrast, a locally differentially private algorithm may only access data through public interaction with data holders, and this interaction must be a differentially private function of the data. We study the intermediate model of \\emph{pan-privacy}. Unlike a locally private algorithm, a pan-private algorithm receives data in the clear. Unlike a centrally private algorithm, the algorithm receives data one element at a time and must maintain a differentially private internal state while processing this stream. First, we show that pan-privacy against multiple intrusions on the internal state is equivalent to sequentially interactive local privacy. Next, we contextualize pan-privacy against a single intrusion by analyzing the sample complexity of uniformity testing over domain $[k]$. Focusing on the dependence on $k$, centrally private uniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(\\sqrt{k})$, while noninteractive locally private uniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(k)$. We show that the sample complexity of pan-private uniformity testing is $\\Theta(k^{2/3})$.

It is assumed that each labeled example in the training data is the information of one individual and we would like to come up with a generalizing hypothesis $h$ while guaranteeing differential privacy for the individuals. Intuitively, this means that any single labeled example in the training data should not have a significant effect on the choice of the hypothesis. This problem has received much attention recently; unlike the non-private case, where the sample complexity is independent of the domain size and just depends on the desired accuracy and confidence, for private learning the sample complexity must depend on the domain size $X$ (even for approximate differential privacy). Alon et al. (STOC 2019) showed a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log^*|X|)$  on the sample complexity and Bun et al. (FOCS 2015) presented an approximate-private learner with sample complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(2^{\\log^*|X|}\\right)$. In this work we reduce this gap significantly, almost settling the sample complexity. We first present a new upper bound (algorithm) of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\log^*|X|\\right)^2\\right)$ on the sample complexity  and then present an improved version with sample complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\log^*|X|\\right)^{1.5}\\right)$. Our algorithm is constructed for the related interior point problem, where the goal is to find a point between the largest and smallest input elements. It is based on selecting an input-dependent hash function and using it to embed the database into a domain whose size is reduced logarithmically; this results in a new database, an interior point of which can be used to generate an interior point of the original database in a differentially private manner.",

Alon et al. (STOC 2019) showed a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log^*|X|)$  on the sample complexity and Bun et al. (FOCS 2015) presented an approximate-private learner with sample complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(2^{\\log^*|X|}\\right)$. In this work we reduce this gap significantly, almost settling the sample complexity. We first present a new upper bound (algorithm) of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\log^*|X|\\right)^2\\right)$ on the sample complexity  and then present an improved version with sample complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\log^*|X|\\right)^{1.5}\\right)$. Our algorithm is constructed for the related interior point problem, where the goal is to find a point between the largest and smallest input elements. It is based on selecting an input-dependent hash function and using it to embed the database into a domain whose size is reduced logarithmically; this results in a new database, an interior point of which can be used to generate an interior point of the original database in a differentially private manner.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Estimating the shape of an elliptical distribution is a fundamental problem in statistics. One estimator for the shape matrix, Tyler\u2019s M-estimator, has been shown to have many appealing asymptotic properties. It performs well in numerical experiments and can be quickly computed in practice by a simple iterative procedure. Despite the many years the estimator has been studied in the statistics community, there was neither a non-asymptotic bound on the rate of the estimator nor a proof that the iterative procedure converges in polynomially many steps.

Secondly, we prove general lower bounds, showing that our moment bound is sharp (up to a logarithmic factor) unless some additional properties of the corresponding random variables are used. Our main probabilistic result is a general concentration inequality for weakly correlated random variables, which may be of independent interest.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Discretized Langevin diffusions are efficient Monte Carlo methods for sampling from high dimensional target densities that are log-Lipschitz-smooth and (strongly) log-concave. In particular, the Euclidean Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm has received much attention lately, leading to a detailed understanding of its non-asymptotic convergence properties and of the role that smoothness and log-concavity play in the convergence rate. Distributions that do not possess these regularity properties can be addressed by considering a Riemannian Langevin diffusion with a metric capturing the local geometry of the log-density. However, the Monte Carlo algorithms derived from discretizations of such Riemannian Langevin diffusions are notoriously difficult to analyze. In this paper, we consider Langevin diffusions on a Hessian-type manifold and study a discretization that is closely related to the mirror-descent scheme. We establish for the first time a non-asymptotic upper-bound on the sampling error of the resulting Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm. This bound is measured according to a Wasserstein distance induced by a Riemannian metric ground cost capturing the squared Hessian structure and closely related to a self-concordance-like condition.

In particular, the Euclidean Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm has received much attention lately, leading to a detailed understanding of its non-asymptotic convergence properties and of the role that smoothness and log-concavity play in the convergence rate. Distributions that do not possess these regularity properties can be addressed by considering a Riemannian Langevin diffusion with a metric capturing the local geometry of the log-density. However, the Monte Carlo algorithms derived from discretizations of such Riemannian Langevin diffusions are notoriously difficult to analyze. In this paper, we consider Langevin diffusions on a Hessian-type manifold and study a discretization that is closely related to the mirror-descent scheme. We establish for the first time a non-asymptotic upper-bound on the sampling error of the resulting Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm. This bound is measured according to a Wasserstein distance induced by a Riemannian metric ground cost capturing the squared Hessian structure and closely related to a self-concordance-like condition. The upper-bound implies, for instance, that the iterates contract toward a Wasserstein ball around the target density whose radius is made explicit. Our theory recovers existing Euclidean results and can cope with a wide variety of Hessian metrics related to highly non-flat geometries. }\n}",

Strikingly, we show that the same property can also be achieved with gradient descent updates. We obtain this result by rewriting the non-negative weights $w_i$ of multiplicative updates by $u_i^2$ and then performing a gradient descent step w.r.t. the new $u_i$ parameters. We apply this method to the Winnow update, the Hedge update, and the unnormalized and normalized exponentiated gradient (EG) updates for linear regression. When the original weights $w_i$ are scaled to sum to one (as done for Hedge and normalized EG), then in the corresponding reparameterized update, the $u_i$ parameters are now divided by $\\Vert\\mathbf{u}\\Vert_2$ after the gradient descent step. We show that these reparameterizations closely track the original multiplicative updates by proving in each case the same online regret bounds (albeit in some cases, with slightly different constants). As a side, our work exhibits a simple two-layer linear neural network that, when trained with gradient descent, can experimentally solve a certain sparse linear problem (known as the Hadamard problem) with exponentially fewer examples than any kernel method.",
