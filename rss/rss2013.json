        "abstract": "The advent of sensor arrays providing tactile feedback with high spatial and temporal resolution ask for new control strategies to exploit this important and valuable sensory channel for grasping and manipulation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a control framework to realize a whole set of tactile servoing tasks, i.e. control tasks, which intend to realize a specific tactile interaction pattern. This includes such simple tasks like tracking a touched object, maintaining both contact location and contact force, as well as more elaborate tasks like tracking the object pose or tactile object exploration. Exploiting methods known from image processing, we introduce robust feature extraction methods to estimate the 2D contact position, the contact force, and the orientation of an object edge being in contact to the sensor. The flexible control framework allows to adapt the PID-type controller to a large range of different tasks by specification of a selection matrix. We demonstrate and evaluate the capabilities of the proposed control framework in a series of experiments employing a 16 x 16 tactile sensor array attached to a Kuka LWR as a \"large\" fingertip.",

The difficulty is that potential receivers are pedestrians who are not necessarily cooperative; thus, the robot needs to appropriately plan its motion, making it is easy and non-obstructive for potential receivers to receive the flyers. In order to establish the model, we observed human interactions on distributional handing in the real world. We analyzed and evaluated different handing methods that people perform, and established a model for a robot to perform natural handing. The proposed model is implemented into a humanoid robot and is confirmed as effective in a field experiment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of manipulating and transporting multiple objects on the plane using a cable attached at each end to a mobile robot. This problem is motivated by the use of boats with booms in skimming operations for cleaning oil spills or removing debris on the surface of the water. The goal in this paper is to automate the task of separating the objects of interest from a collection of objects by manipulating them with cables that are actuated only at the ends, and then transporting them to specified destinations. Because the cable is flexible, the shape of the cable must be explicitly modeled in the problem. Further, the robots must cooperatively plan motions to achieve the required cable shape and gross position/orientation to separate the objects of interest and then transport them as specified. The theoretical foundation for the problem is derived from topological invariants, homology and homotopy. We first derive the necessary topological conditions for achieving the desired separation of objects. We then propose a distributed search-based planning technique for finding optimal robot trajectories for separation and transportation. We demonstrate the applicability of this method using a dynamic simulation platform with explicit models of the cable dynamics, the contact between the cable and one or more objects, and the surface drag on the cable and on the objects. We also describe our preliminary efforts to develop an experimental platform consisting of a system of two cooperating autonomous boats.",

We test this claim using a biomimetic fingertip to perceive object identity via surface shape at uncertain contact locations. Our method for active Bayesian perception combines decision making by threshold crossing of the posterior belief with a sensorimotor loop that actively controls sensor location based on those beliefs. Our findings include: (i) active perception with a fixation control strategy gives an order-of-magnitude improvement in acuity over passive perception without sensorimotor feedback; (ii) perceptual acuity improves as the active control requires less belief to~make a relocation decision; and (iii) relocation noise further improves acuity. The best method has aspects that resemble animal perception, supporting wide applicability of these findings.",

This paper reports a novel methodology for estimating the sensor bias of three-axis field sensors (e.g. magnetometers and accelerometers). Our approach employs three-axis angular velocity measurements from an angular-rate gyroscope to estimate the three-axis field sensor measurement bias that, when properly calibrated, can significantly improve attitude estimation. We report three methods implementing this approach based on batch linear least squares, real time Kalman filter, and real time adaptive identification. Our methods impose less restrictive conditions for the movements of the instrument required for calibration than previously reported methods, do not require knowledge of the direction of the field (e.g. the local magnetic field) or the attitude of the instrument, and also ensure convergence for the estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared with the previously reported methods with numerical simulation and in comparative experimental evaluation with sensors onboard an underwater robot vehicle.",

        "abstract": "An important aspect of human perception is anticipation, which we use extensively in our day-to-day activities when interacting with other humans as well as with our surroundings. Anticipating which activities will a human do next (and how) can enable an assistive robot to plan ahead for reactive responses in human environments. Furthermore, anticipation can even improve the detection accuracy of past activities. The challenge, however, is two-fold: We need to capture the rich context for modeling the activities and object affordances, and we need to anticipate the distribution over a large space of future human activities. In this work, we represent each possible future using an anticipatory temporal conditional random field (ATCRF) that models the rich spatial-temporal relations through object affordances. We then consider each ATCRF as a particle and represent the distribution over the potential futures using a set of particles. In extensive evaluation on CAD-120 human activity RGB-D dataset, we first show that anticipation improves the state-of- the-art detection results. For a new subjects (not seen in the training set), we obtain an activity anticipation accuracy (defined as whether one of top three predictions actually happened) of 75.4%, 69.2% and 58.1% for an anticipation time of 1, 3 and 10 seconds respectively. Finally, we also use our algorithm on a robot for performing a few reactive responses.",

        "abstract": "Employing a group of independently controlled flying micro air vehicles (MAVs) for aerial coverage missions, instead of a single flying robot, increases the robustness and efficiency of the missions. Designing a group of MAVs requires addressing new challenges, such as inter-robot collision avoidance and formation control, where individual's knowledge about the relative location of their local group members is essential. A relative positioning system for a MAV needs to satisfy severe constraints in terms of size, weight, processing power, power consumption, three-dimensional coverage and price. In this paper we present an on-board audio based system that is capable of providing individuals with relative positioning information of their neighbouring sound emitting MAVs. We propose a method based on coherence testing among signals of a small onboard microphone array to obtain relative bearing measurements, and a particle filter estimator to fuse these measurements with information about the motion of robots throughout time to obtain the desired relative location estimates. A method based on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is used to identify and extract sounds of simultaneous chirping robots in the neighbourhood. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed method in a real world experiment with three simultaneously flying micro air vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The combined use of 3D scanning lasers with 2D cameras has become increasingly popular in mobile robotics, as the sparse depth measurements of the former augment the dense color information of the latter. Sensor fusion requires precise 6-DOF transforms between the sensors, but hand-measuring these values is tedious and inaccurate. In addition, autonomous robots can be rendered inoperable if their sensors' calibrations change over time. Yet previously published camera-laser calibration algorithms are offline only, requiring significant amounts of data and/or specific calibration targets; they are thus unable to correct calibration errors that occur during live operation. In this paper, we introduce two new real-time techniques that enable camera-laser calibration online, automatically, and in arbitrary environments. The first is a probabilistic monitoring algorithm that can detect a sudden miscalibration in a fraction of a second. The second is a continuous calibration optimizer that adjusts transform offsets in real time, tracking gradual sensor drift as it occurs. Although the calibration objective function is not globally convex and cannot be optimized in real time, in practice it is always locally convex around the global optimum, and almost everywhere else. Thus, the local shape of the objective function at the current parameters can be used to determine whether the sensors are calibrated, and allows the parameters to be adjusted gradually so as to maintain the global optimum. In several online experiments on thousands of frames in real markerless scenes, our method automatically detects miscalibrations within one second of the error exceeding .25 deg or 10cm, with an accuracy of 100%. In addition, rotational sensor drift can be tracked in real-time with a mean error of just .10 deg. Together, these techniques allow significantly greater flexibility and adaptability of robots in unknown and potentially harsh environments.",

The proposed method propagates information from high-resolution images into other low-resolution modalities while allowing the images to have different spectral channels. This means the relationship between the high-resolution and low-resolution channels is expected to be non-deterministic, non-linear and non-stationary. A novel Gaussian Process (GP) framework was developed to define a stochastic prior over the estimated images. Its covariance function is computed to replicate the local structure of the high-resolution image, and allows the model to infer a high-resolution estimate from a low-resolution channel. Results are presented for natural images acquired by a UAV in a farmland mapping application.",

We rely on the notion of occupation measures to pose the synthesis problem as an infinite dimensional linear program (LP) and provide finite dimensional approximations of this LP in terms of semidefinite programs (SDPs). The solution to each SDP yields a polynomial control policy and an outer approximation of the largest achievable BRS. In contrast to traditional Lyapunov based approaches, which are non-convex and require feasible initialization, our approach is convex and does not require any form of initialization. The resulting time-varying controllers and approximated backwards reachable sets are well-suited for use in a trajectory library or feedback motion planning algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on four nonlinear systems.",

In this work, we apply a deep learning approach to solve this problem, which avoids time-consuming hand-design of features. This presents two main challenges. First, we need to evaluate a huge number of candidate grasps. In order to make detection fast, as well as robust, we present a two-step cascaded structure with two deep networks, where the top detections from the first are re-evaluated by the second. The first network has fewer features, is faster to run, and can effectively prune out unlikely candidate grasps. The second, with more features, is slower but has to run only on the top few detections. Second, we need to handle multimodal inputs well, for which we present a method to apply structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in robotic grasp detection, and can be used to successfully execute grasps on a Baxter robot.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of cooperative transportation of a cable-suspended payload by multiple quadrotors. In previous work, quasi-static models have been used to study this problem. However, these approaches are severely limited because they ignore the payload dynamics, and do not explicitly model the underactuation in the control problem. Thus, there are no guarantees on the payload trajectory or the cable tensions, which must be non negative. In this paper, we develop a complete dynamic model for the case when payload is a point load and for the case when the payload is a rigid body. We show in both cases the resulting system is differentially flat when the cable tensions are strictly positive. We also consider the case where the tensions are non negative (including the case with zero tensions) and establish that these systems are differentially flat hybrid systems by considering the switching dynamics induced by the unilateral tension constraints. We use the differential flatness property to find dynamically feasible trajectories for the payload+quadrotors system. We show using numerical and experimental methods that these trajectories are superior to those obtained by quasi-static models.",

First, we prove that the observations of: (i) a single point, and (ii) a single line of em known direction perpendicular to gravity (e.g., a non-vertical structural line of a building), provide sufficient information for rendering all degrees of freedom of a vision-aided inertial navigation system (VINS) observable, up to global translations. Next, we examine the observability properties of the linearized system employed by an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for processing line observations of known direction, and show that the rank of the corresponding observability matrix erroneously increases. To address this problem, we introduce an elegant modification which enforces that the linearized EKF system has the correct number of unobservable directions, thus improving its consistency. Finally, we validate our findings experimentally in urban scenes and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed VINS over alternative approaches.",

        "abstract": "New uses of robotics in traditionally manual manufacturing processes require the careful choreography of human and robotic agents to support safe and efficient coordinated work. Tasks must be allocated among agents and scheduled to meet temporal deadlines and spatial restrictions on agent proximity. These systems must also be capable of replanning on-the-fly to adapt to disturbances in the schedule and to respond to people working in close physical proximity. In this paper, we present a centralized algorithm, named Tercio, that handles tightly intercoupled temporal and spatial constraints and scales to larger problem sizes than prior art. Our key innovation is a fast, satisficing multi-agent task sequencer that is inspired by real-time processor scheduling techniques but is adapted to leverage hierarchical problem structure. We use this fast task sequencer in conjunction with a MILP solver, and show that we are able to generate near-optimal task assignments and schedules for up to 10 agents and 500 tasks in less than 20 seconds on average. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm in a multi-robot hardware testbed.",

(ii) An efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety and enables the algorithm to reliably solve motion planning problems, including problems involving thin and complex obstacles. We benchmarked our algorithm against several other mo- tion planning algorithms, solving a suite of 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm-planning problems and 18-DOF full-body planning problems. We compared against sampling-based planners from OMPL, and we also compared to CHOMP, a leading approach for trajectory optimization. Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved more problems, and yielded higher quality paths. Experimental evaluation on the following additional problem types also confirmed the speed and effectiveness of our approach: (i) Planning foot placements with 34 degrees of freedom (28 joints + 6 DOF pose) of the Atlas humanoid robot as it maintains static stability and has to negotiate environmental constraints. (ii) Industrial box picking. (iii) Real-world motion planning for the PR2 that requires considering all degrees of freedom at the same time.",

In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD system by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge to managing the MoD system effectively is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and prediction. This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithm for real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and prediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our Gaussian process (GP)-based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a fine balance between predictive power and time efficiency. We theoretically guarantee its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be distributed among the MoD vehicles, hence achieving efficient and scalable demand prediction. Though our decentralized active sensing strategy is devised to gather the most informative demand data for demand prediction, it can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service the mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world mobility demand data shows that our proposed algorithm can achieve a better balance between predictive accuracy and time efficiency than state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In this paper, we propose a functional gradient optimization technique for autonomously generating legible motion. Our algorithm optimizes a legibility metric inspired by the psychology of action interpretation in humans, resulting in motion trajectories that purposefully deviate from what an observer would expect in order to better convey intent. A trust region constraint on the optimization ensures that the motion does not become too surprising or unpredictable to the observer. Our studies with novice users that evaluate the resulting trajectories support the applicability of our method and of such a trust region. They show that within the region, legibility as measured in practice does significantly increase. Outside of it, however, the trajectory becomes confusing and the users' confidence in knowing the robot's intent significantly decreases.",

We define a metric on this space allowing us to formalize \u00e2\u0080\u0098nearby\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grasp/shape configurations and we discuss continuous deformations of such configurations. We work in particular with surfaces with cylindrical coordinates and analyse the stability of a popular L^1 grasp quality measure Q_l under continuous deformations of shapes and grasps. We experimentally determine bounds on the maximal change of Q_l in a small neighbourhood around stable grasps with grasp quality above a threshold. In the case of surfaces of revolution, we determine stable grasps which correspond to grasps used by humans and develop an efficient algorithm for generating those grasps in the case of three contact points. We show that sufficiently stable grasps stay stable under small deformations. For larger deformations, we develop a gradient-based method that can transfer stable grasps between different surfaces. Additionally, we show in experiments that our gradient method can be used to find stable grasps on arbitrary surfaces with cylindrical coordinates by deforming such surfaces towards a corresponding \u00e2\u0080\u0098canonical\u00e2\u0080\u0099 surface of revolution.",

        "abstract": "Stereo visual odometry has received little investigation in high altitude applications due to the generally poor performance of rigid stereo rigs at extremely small baseline-to-depth ratios. Without additional sensing, metric scale is considered lost and odometry is seen as effective only for monocular perspectives. This paper presents a novel modification to stereo based visual odometry that allows accurate, metric pose estimation from high altitudes, even in the presence of poor calibration and without additional sensor inputs. By relaxing the (typically fixed) stereo transform during bundle adjustment and reducing the dependence on the fixed geometry for triangulation, metrically scaled visual odometry can be obtained in situations where high altitude and structural deformation from vibration would cause traditional algorithms to fail. This is achieved through the use of a novel constrained bundle adjustment routine and accurately scaled pose initializer. We present visual odometry results demonstrating the technique on a short-baseline stereo pair inside a fixed-wing UAV flying at significant height (~30-100m).",

        "abstract": "Efficiently solving nonlinear least squares (NLS) problems is crucial for many applications in robotics. In online applications, solving the associated nolinear systems every step may become very expensive. This paper introduces online, incremental solutions, which take full advantage of the sparse-block structure of the problems in robotics. In general, the solution of the nonlinear system is approximated by incrementally solving a series of linearized problems. The most computationally demanding part is to assemble and solve the linearized system at each iteration. In our solution, this is mitigated by incrementally updating the factorized form of the linear system and changing the linearization point only if needed. The incremental updates are done using a resumed factorization only on the parts affected by the new information added to the system at every step. The sparsity of the factorized form directly affects the efficiency. In order to obtain an incremental factorization with persistent reduced fill-in, a new incremental ordering scheme is proposed. Furthermore, the implementation exploits the block structure of the problems and offers efficient solutions to manipulate block matrices, including a highly efficient Cholesky factorization on sparse block matrices. In this work, we focus our efforts on testing the method on SLAM applications, but the applicability of the technique remains general. The experimental results show that our implementation outperforms the state of the art SLAM implementations on all tested datasets.",

        "abstract": "Much recent work in robot learning from demonstration has focused on automatically segmenting continuous task demonstrations into simpler, reusable primitives. However, strong assumptions are often made about how these primitives can be sequenced, limiting the potential for data reuse. We introduce a novel method for discovering semantically grounded primitives and incrementally building and improving a finite-state representation of a task in which various contingencies can arise. Specifically, a Beta Process Autoregressive Hidden Markov Model is used to automatically segment demonstrations into motion categories, which are then further subdivided into semantically grounded states in a finite-state automaton. During replay of the task, a data-driven approach is used to collect additional data where they are most needed through interactive corrections, which are then used to improve the finite-state automaton. Together, this allows for intelligent sequencing of primitives to create novel, adaptive behavior that can be incrementally improved as needed. We demonstrate the utility of this technique on a furniture assembly task using the PR2 mobile manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Humans cast a substantial influence on their environments by interacting with it. Therefore, even though an environment may physically contain only objects, it cannot be modeled well without considering humans. In this paper, we model environments not only through objects, but also through latent human poses and human-object interactions. However, the number of potential human poses is large and unknown, and the human-object interactions vary not only in type but also in which human pose relates to each object. In order to handle such properties, we present Infinite Latent Conditional Random Fields (ILCRFs) that model a scene as a mixture of CRFs generated from Dirichlet processes. Each CRF represents one possible explanation of the scene. In addition to visible object nodes and edges, it generatively models the distribution of different CRF structures over the latent human nodes and corresponding edges. We apply the model to the challenging application of robotic scene arrangement. In extensive experiments, we show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art results. We further use our algorithm on a robot for placing objects in a new scene.",

While most fusion strategies to date rely on filtering schemes, the visual robotics community has recently turned to non-linear optimization approaches for tasks such as visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), following the discovery that this comes with significant advantages in quality of performance and computational complexity. Following this trend, we present a novel approach to tightly integrate visual measurements with readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in SLAM. An IMU error term is integrated with the landmark reprojection error in a fully probabilistic manner, resulting to a joint non-linear cost function to be optimized. Employing the powerful concept of keyframes we partially marginalize old states to maintain a bounded-sized optimization window, ensuring real-time operation. Comparing against both vision-only and loosely-coupled visual-inertial algorithms, our experiments confirm the benefits of tight fusion in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

Combining this technique with usual sampling-based methods gives rise to a family of new motion planners that can appropriately handle kinodynamic constraints while avoiding the complexity explosion and, to some extent, the conceptual difficulties associated with a move to the state space.",

Typical semantic mapping approaches augment metric maps with higher-level properties of the robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surroundings (e.g., place type, object locations), but do not use this information to improve the metric map. The novelty of our algorithm lies in fusing high-level knowledge, conveyed by speech, with metric information from the robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low-level sensor streams. Our method jointly estimates a hybrid metric, topological, and semantic representation of the environment. This semantic graph provides a common framework in which we integrate concepts from natural language descriptions (e.g., labels and spatial relations) with metric observations from low-level sensors. Our algorithm efficiently maintains a factored distribution over semantic graphs based upon the stream of natural language and low-level sensor information. We evaluate the algorithm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance and demonstrate that the incorporation of information from natural language increases the metric, topological and semantic accuracy of the recovered environment model.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning in high dimensional state spaces, such as for mobile manipulation, is a challenging problem. Constrained manipulation, e.g. opening articulated objects like doors or drawers, is also hard since sampling states on the constrained manifold is expensive. Further, planning for such tasks requires a combination of planning in free space for reaching a desired grasp or contact location followed by planning for the constrained manipulation motion, often necessitating a slow two step process in traditional approaches. In this work, we show that combined planning for such tasks can be dramatically accelerated by providing user demonstrations of the constrained manipulation motions. In particular, we show how such demonstrations can be incorporated into a recently developed framework of planning with experience graphs which encode and reuse previous experiences. We focus on tasks involving articulation constraints, e.g. door opening or drawer opening, where the motion of the object itself involves only a single degree of freedom. We provide experimental results with the PR2 robot opening a variety of such articulated objects using our approach, using full-body manipulation (after receiving kinesthetic demonstrations). We also provide simulated results highlighting the benefits of our approach for constrained manipulation tasks.",

Some recent approaches to imitation learning provide strong theoretical performance guarantees. However, there remain crucial practical issues, especially during the training phase, where the training strategy may require execution of control policies that are possibly harmful to the robot or its environment. Moreover, these algorithms often require more demonstrations than necessary to achieve a good performance in practice. This paper introduces a new approach called Maximum Mean Discrepancy Imitation Learning that uses fewer demonstrations and safer exploration policy than existing methods, while preserving strong theoretical guarantees on performance. We demonstrate empirical performance of this method for effective navigation control of a social robot in a populated environment, where safety and efficiency during learning are primary considerations.",

        "abstract": "Biped walking is a complex task, but usually with a natural limit-cycle behavior when walking on an even ground. However, perturbations during walking can make the robot fall. Several works addressed the issue of measuring the robustness to disturbances, and most methods study the effect of a single perturbation. But when walking, the disturbances can be multiple, such as walking on rough terrains. The metastability is a concept that helps studying the case of multiple disturbances. The performance measure is the expectation of the time during which the robot can keep balance. However, until today, only two methods permit to measure this metrics: the discretization of all the state-space and the Monte-Carlo sampling. The former one cannot address high dimensional state-space and the latter is too much time-consuming when the falls are rare. We propose here a solution for walkers with high-dimensional states, even when falls are very rares. The novelty of this method is to rely on the property that limit-cycle walkers may return to the limit-cycle several times before to fall. This method is even extended to the cases of bifurcations or chaos. We illustrate the performance of the approach with a simulated high-dimensional actuated walking system.",

Effective use of gestures by speakers improves not only the listeners' comprehension of the spoken material but also their perceptions of the speaker. How might robots use gestures to improve human-robot interaction? What gestures are most effective in achieving such improvements? This paper seeks answers to these questions by presenting a model of human gestures and a system-level evaluation of how robots might selectively use different types of gestures to improve interaction outcomes, such as user task performance and perceptions of the robot, in a narrative performance scenario. The results show that robot deictic gestures consistently predict users' information recall, that all types of gestures affect user perceptions of the robot's performance as a narrator, and that males and females show significant differences in their responses to robot gestures. These results have strong implications for designing effective robot gestures that improve human-robot interaction.",

This paper proposes a motion planning approach for the reliable 6-dimensional quasi-static manipulation with an aerial towed-cable system. The novelty of this approach lies in the use of a cost-based motion-planning algorithm together with some results deriving from the static analysis of cable- driven manipulators. Based on the so-called wrench-feasibility constraints applied to the cable tensions, as well as thrust constraints applied to the flying robots, we formally characterize the set of feasible configurations of the system. Besides, the expression of these constraints leads to a criterion to evaluate the quality of a configuration. This allows us to define a cost function over the configuration space, which we exploit to compute good-quality paths using the T-RRT algorithm. As part of our approach, we also propose an aerial towed-cable system that we name the FlyCrane. It consists of a platform attached to three flying robots using six fixed-length cables. We validate the proposed approach on two simulated 6-D quasi-static manipulation problems involving such a system, and show the benefit of taking the cost function into account for such motion planning tasks.",

In this paper, we address the problem of detecting and learning socio-spatial relations between individuals and to track their group formations. Opposed to related work, we track and reason about multiple social grouping hypotheses in a recursive way, assume a mobile sensor that perceives the scene from a first-person perspective, and achieve good tracking performance in real-time using only 2D range data. The method, that relies on an extended multi-hypothesis tracking approach, also improves person-level tracking in two ways: the social grouping information is fed back to predict human motion over learned intra-group constraints and to support data association by adapting track-specific occlusion probabilities. Both measures lead to an improved occlusion handling and a better trade-off between false negative and false positive tracks. In experiments with a mobile robot and on large-scale outdoor data sets, we demonstrate how the approach is able to model social grouping and to improve person tracking by a significant reduction of track identifier switches and false negative tracks.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, robots interact more frequently with a dynamic environment outside limited manufacturing sites and in close proximity with humans. Thus, safety of motion and obstacle avoidance are vital safety features of such robots. We formally study two safety properties of avoiding both stationary and moving obstacles: (i) passive safety, which ensures that no collisions can happen while the robot moves, and (ii) the stronger passive friendly safety in which the robot further maintains sufficient maneuvering distance for obstacles to avoid collision as well. We use hybrid system models and theorem proving techniques that describe and formally verify the robot's discrete control decisions along with its continuous, physical motion. Moreover, we formally prove that safety can still be guaranteed despite location and actuator uncertainty.",

Starting at S, the robot has to cover an unknown planar environment containing obstacles, and return to S with the cable fully retracted. The paper ?rst establishes an optimal off-line tethered coverage methodology, then introduces the TC (Tethered Coverage) algorithm that performs online tethered coverage using position and local obstacle detection sensors. The performance of the TC algorithm is measured by its competitiveness, determined by measuring its total online path length, l, relative to the optimal off-line solution l_opt. The paper establishes that the TC algorithm has a competitive performance of l\u00e2\u0089\u00a42(L/D)l_opt.

        "abstract": "Auction and market-based mechanisms are among the most popular methods for distributed task allocation in multi-robot systems. Most of these mechanisms were designed in a heuristic way and analysis of the quality of the resulting assignment solution is rare. This paper presents a new market-based multi-robot task allocation algorithm that produces optimal assignments. Rather than adopting a buyer's \"selfish\" bidding perspective as in previous auction/market-based approaches, the proposed method approaches auctioning from a merchant's point of view, producing a pricing policy that responds to cliques of customers. The algorithm uses price escalation to clear a market of all its goods, producing a state of equilibrium that satisfies both the merchant and customers. The proposed method can be used as a general assignment algorithm as it has a time complexity (O(n^3 lg n)) close to the fastest state-of-the-art algorithms (O(n^3)) but is extremely easy to implement. As in previous research, the economic model reflects the distributed nature of markets inherently: in this paper it leads directly to a decentralized method ideally suited for distributed multi-robot systems.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous manipulation in unstructured environments presents roboticists with three fundamental challenges: object segmentation, action selection, and motion generation. These challenges become more pronounced when unknown manmade or natural objects are cluttered together in a pile. We present an end-to-end approach to the problem of manipulating unknown objects in a pile, with the objective of removing all objects from the pile and placing them into a bin. Our robot perceives the environment with an RGB-D sensor, segments the pile into objects using non-parametric surface models, computes the affordances of each object, and selects the best affordance and its associated action to execute. Then, our robot instantiates the proper compliant motion primitive to safely execute the desired action. For ef?cient and reliable action selection, we developed a framework for supervised learning of manipulation expertise. We conducted dozens of trials and report on several hours of experiments involving more than 1500 interactions. The results show that our learning-based approach for pile manipulation outperforms a common sense heuristic as well as a random strategy, and is on par with human action selection.",

By having the possibility to replace the type of transmission at the ankles level, it was possible to repeat the very same experiment in two different conditions: (1) Using series elastic actuators (SEA); (2) Replacing the elastic elements with rigid transmissions. The experiments consisted in perturbing a balanced posture with an impulsive force. Perturbations were applied in two different scenarios: hitting the robot on the upper body and at the support platform, thus acting above and under the actuated joint. The applied perturbations were controlled to be repeatable and the static stiffness of the rigid and elastic actuators were tuned to match. With these assumptions, static responses were the same in the two conditions; differences appeared only during the dynamic response and are motivated by different proportions between active and passive stiffness. In both scenarios, results show that series elasticity simplifies the role of the balancing controller by low pass filtering the dynamics of the zero moment point,consistently observing a more stable balance recovery with SEAs through all the experiments.",

In this paper we present a novel method for real-time camera tracking and 3D reconstruction of static indoor environments using an RGB-D sensor. We show that by representing the geometry with a signed distance function (SDF), the camera pose can be efficiently estimated by directly minimizing the error of the depth images on the SDF. As the SDF contains the distances to the surface for each voxel, the pose optimization can be carried out extremely fast. By iteratively estimating the camera poses and integrating the RGB-D data in the voxel grid, a detailed reconstruction of an indoor environment can be achieved. We present reconstructions of several rooms using a hand-held sensor and from onboard an autonomous quadrocopter. Our extensive evaluation on publicly available benchmark data shows that our approach is more accurate and robust than the iterated closest point algorithm (ICP) used by KinectFusion, and yields often a comparable accuracy at much higher speed to feature-based bundle adjustment methods such as RGB-D SLAM for up to medium-sized scenes.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to control a wearable knee joint exoskeleton driven through the wearer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention. A realistic bio-inspired musculoskeletal knee joint model is used to control the exoskeleton. This model takes into account changes in muscle length and joint moment arms as well as the dynamics of muscle activation and muscle contraction during lower limb movements. Identification of the model parameters is done through an unconstrained optimization problem formulation. A control law strategy based on the principle of assistance as needed is proposed. This approach guarantees asymptotic stability of the knee joint orthosis and adaptation to human-orthosis interaction. Moreover, the proposed control law is robust with respect to external disturbances. Experimental validations are conducted online on a healthy subject during flexion and extenion of their knee joint. The proposed control strategy has shown satisfactory performances in terms of tracking trajectory and adaptation to human tasks completion.",

The overall mission specification consists of a temporal logic statement over a set of static, a priori known requests, and a servicing priority order over a set of dynamic requests that can be sensed locally. Our approach is based on two main steps. First, we construct an abstraction for the motion of the vehicle in the environment by using input output linearization and assignment of vector fields to the regions in the partition. Second, a receding horizon controller computes local plans within the sensing range of the vehicle such that both local and global mission specifications are satisfied. We implement and evaluate our method in an experimental setup consisting of a quadrotor performing a persistent surveillance task over a planar grid environment.",

        "abstract": "We propose an incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm that generates maximally informative trajectories for guiding mobile robots to observe their environment. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information metric (e.g., variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e.g., fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed Rapidly-exploring Information Gathering (RIG) algorithm extends ideas from Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRGs) and combines them with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient optimization of information gathering while also allowing for operation in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our approach, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed approach finds optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an approach for the stability analysis of mechanical part disassembly considering part motion in the presence of physical forces such as gravity and friction. Our approach uses linear complementarity to analyze stability as parts are moved out of the assembly. As each part is removed from the assembly along a specified path during disassembly, we compute the contact forces between parts in the remaining assembly; positive contact forces throughout the disassembly process imply the disassembly sequence is stable (since the parts remain in contact with one another). However, if any contact force becomes zero and the part that is being taken out induces motion of other parts in the remaining subassembly, we conclude the disassembly sequence is unstable. Thus, we are able to simulate the entire disassembly sequence considering physical forces and part motion, which has not previously been done. We then show the influence of part motion on the selection of stable disassembly sequences. In contrast to prior work on disassembly which has focused either on planning part motions based on only geometric constraints, or on analyzing the stability of an assembly without considering part motions, we explore the relation between part motion and the selection of stable disassembly sequences. Since we track the motion of all parts in an assembly, instability inducing motions can be identified and prevented by introducing appropriate fixtures, by selecting alternative disassembly sequences, or by changing the motion paths. We also describe when the presence of physical forces can make assembly and disassembly asymmetric, i.e., disassembly is not the reverse of assembly.",

        "abstract": "Human fingertip and its derivatives in robotics possess an inhomogeneous structure with skin, tissue, bone, and nail; which causes troublesome for construction of a precise model that can represent almost mechanical characteristics, especially during sliding motion. Commonly, models in a virtual haptic environment are frictionless, thus attempts to display tactile sensations are still remained unsolved. We have proposed a Beam Bundle Model for modeling of a human fingertip during pushing and sliding action with friction, especially stick-to-slip transition, to overcome mentioned issues. In order to construct its three-dimensional non-homogeneous structure, we took sequential series of magnetic resonant images, which bring consecutive cross-sectional layers of the human fingertip with distribution of skin, tissue, bone, and nail. Simulation results show a twofold aspect. Firstly, it can generate not only normal force distribution caused by pushing, but also response of friction force during sliding. Secondly, and more interestingly, the model dynamically produces localized displacement phenomenon on the contact area during stick-to-slip phase, which indicates how slippage erodes the contact area before the total slippage of the fingertip occurs. This research helps to assess the sliding process of the human fingertip, including how and when the slippage occurs on the contact surface. This model may also act as a platform for studying tactile perception of the fingertip, as well as being a virtual environment for haptic interfaces.",

        "abstract": "We present a new, generic approach to the calibration of depth sensor intrinsics that requires only the ability to run SLAM. In particular, no specialized hardware, calibration target, or hand measurement is required. Essential to this approach is the idea that certain intrinsic parameters, identified here as \\textit{myopic}, govern distortions that increase with range. We demonstrate these ideas on the calibration of the popular Kinect and Xtion Pro Live RGBD sensors, which typically exhibit significant depth distortion at ranges greater than three meters. Making use of the myopic property, we show how to efficiently learn a discrete grid of 32,000 depth multipliers that resolve this distortion. Compared to the most similar unsupervised calibration work in the literature, this is a 100-fold increase in the maximum number of calibration parameters previously learned. Compared to the supervised calibration approach, the work of this paper means the difference between A) printing a poster of a checkerboard, mounting it to a rigid plane, and recording data of it from many different angles and ranges - a process that often requires two people or repeated use of a special easel - versus B) recording a few minutes of data from unmodified, natural environments. This is advantageous both for individuals who wish to calibrate their own sensors as well as for a robot that needs to calibrate automatically while in the field.",

We describe a fully-functional, integrated system with a focus on robust visual-inertial state estimation, and demonstrate the quadrotor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to autonomously travel at speeds up to 4 m/s and roll and pitch angles exceeding 20 degrees. The performance of the proposed system is demonstrated via challenging experiments in three dimensional indoor environments.",
