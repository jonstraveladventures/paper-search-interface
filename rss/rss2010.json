        "abstract": "Designing a localization system for a low-cost\r\nrobotic consumer product poses a major challenge. In previous\r\nwork, we introduced Vector Field SLAM, a system for\r\nsimultaneously estimating robot pose and a vector field induced\r\nby stationary signal sources present in the environment. In this\r\npaper we show how this method can be realized on a low-cost\r\nembedded processing unit by applying the concepts of the Exactly\r\nSparse Extended Information Filter. By restricting the set of\r\nactive features to the 4 nodes of the current cell, the size of the\r\nmap becomes linear in the area explored by the robot while the\r\ntime for updating the state can be held constant under certain\r\napproximations. We report results from running our method on\r\nan ARM 7 embedded board with 64 kByte RAM controlling a\r\nRoomba 510 vacuum cleaner in a standard test environment.",

        "abstract": "It has long been established that simple springmass\r\nmodels can accurately represent the dynamics of legged\r\nlocomotion. Existing work in this domain, however, almost\r\nexclusively focuses on the idealized Spring-Loaded Inverted\r\nPendulum (SLIP) model and neglects passive dissipative effects\r\nunavoidable in any physical robot or animal. In this paper, we\r\nextend on a recently proposed analytic approximation to the\r\nstance trajectories of a dissipative SLIP model to analyze stability\r\nproperties of a planar hopper with a single rotary actuator at\r\nthe hip. We first describe how a suitably chosen torque controller\r\ncan compensate for damping losses, maintaining the same energy\r\nlevel across strides and hence reducing the return map to a\r\nsingle dimension. We then identify and characterize equilibrium\r\npoints for this return map under a fixed leg placement policy and\r\nshow that \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncontrolled\u00e2\u0080\u009d asymptotic stability is feasible for this\r\nenergy-regulated system. Subsequent presentation of simulation\r\nevidence establishes that the predictions of this approximate\r\nmodel are consistent with the exact plant model.

        "abstract": "A central problem in artificial intelligence is to\r\nchoose actions to maximize reward in a partially observable,\r\nuncertain environment. To do so, we must learn an accurate\r\nmodel of our environment, and then plan to maximize reward.\r\nUnfortunately, learning algorithms often recover a model which\r\nis too inaccurate to support planning or too large and complex for\r\nplanning to be feasible; or, they require large amounts of prior\r\ndomain knowledge or fail to provide important guarantees such\r\nas statistical consistency. To begin to fill this gap, we propose a\r\nnovel algorithm which provably learns a compact, accurate model\r\ndirectly from sequences of action-observation pairs. To evaluate\r\nthe learner, we then close the loop from observations to actions:\r\nwe plan in the learned model and recover a policy which is nearoptimal\r\nin the original environment (not the model). In more\r\ndetail, we present a spectral algorithm for learning a Predictive\r\nState Representation (PSR). We demonstrate the algorithm by\r\nlearning a model of a simulated high-dimensional, vision-based\r\nmobile robot planning task, and then performing approximate\r\npoint-based planning in the learned model. This experiment\r\nshows that the learned PSR captures the essential features of the\r\nenvironment, allows accurate prediction with a small number of\r\nparameters, and enables successful and efficient planning. Our\r\nalgorithm has several benefits which have not appeared together\r\nin any previous PSR learner: it is computationally efficient and\r\nstatistically consistent; it handles high-dimensional observations\r\nand long time horizons by working from real-valued features of\r\nobservation sequences; and finally, our close-the-loop experiments\r\nprovide an end-to-end practical test.",

In order to\r\nimprove the robustness to noise and false point correspondences\r\nit is common to incorporate the constraint that the robot moves\r\nover a planar surface, as is the case for most indoor and outdoor\r\nmapping applications. We propose a novel estimation method\r\nthat determines the full likelihood in the space of all possible\r\nplanar relative poses. The likelihood function can be learned\r\nfrom existing data using standard Bayesian methods and is\r\nefficiently stored in a low dimensional look up table. Estimating\r\nthe likelihood of a new pose given a set of correspondences\r\nboils down to a simple look up. As a result, the proposed\r\nmethod allows for very efficient creation of pose constraints for\r\nvision based SLAM applications, including a proper estimate\r\nof its uncertainty. It can handle ambiguous image data, such\r\nas acquired in long corridors, naturally. The method can be\r\ntrained using either artificial or real data, and is applied on\r\nboth controlled simulated data and challenging images taken in\r\nreal home environments. By computing the maximum likelihood\r\nestimate we can compare our approach with state of the art\r\nestimators based on a combination of RANSAC and iterative\r\nreweighted least squares and show a significant increase in both\r\nthe efficiency and accuracy.",

The purpose of this paper\r\nis to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental samplingbased\r\nalgorithms with provable optimality properties. The first\r\ncontribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that,\r\nunder mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned\r\nby RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as\r\nthe number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is\r\nconsidered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG),\r\nand it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG\r\nconverges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of\r\nRRG is introduced, called RRT, which preserves the asymptotic\r\noptimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT.\r\nThe analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections\r\nbetween sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the\r\ntheory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational\r\ncomplexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations\r\nrequired by both the RRG and RRT algorithms is asymptotically\r\nwithin a constant factor of that required by RRT.",

A possible approach to\r\nsolve this problem consists of reducing the number of actuators\r\nthus resulting more efficient, simpler and reliable than their fully\r\nactuated alternatives. Reducing control inputs seems to inspire\r\nalso biological systems and in particular motor control of human\r\nhands, which share with robotic hands the large number of DoFs.\r\nRecent studies demonstrated that a few control variables, named\r\npostural synergies, are able to account for most of the variance\r\nin the patterns of hand movements and configurations of hands.\r\nThis paper focuses on hands with postural synergies. Reducing\r\nthe number of control inputs, from fully actuated joints to few\r\nsynergies, might reduce the dimension of the force and motion\r\ncontrollability subspaces thus compromising the dexterity of the\r\ngrasp, however, this is not true in general but strongly depends\r\non how synergies are distributed.

However, in many cases, the robot currently\r\nneeds to learn a new elementary movement even if a parametrized\r\nmotor plan exists that covers a similar, related situation. Clearly,\r\na method is needed that modulates the elementary movement\r\nthrough the meta-parameters of its representation. In this paper,\r\nwe show how to learn such mappings from circumstances to\r\nmeta-parameters using reinforcement learning. We introduce an\r\nappropriate reinforcement learning algorithm based on a kernelized\r\nversion of the reward-weighted regression. We compare\r\nthis algorithm to several previous methods on a toy example and\r\nshow that it performs well in comparison to standard algorithms.\r\nSubsequently, we show two robot applications of the presented\r\nsetup; i.e., the generalization of throwing movements in darts, and\r\nof hitting movements in table tennis.

The\r\nsearching mission is accomplished as soon as the robot receives\r\na signal from the target. However, the robot cannot perceive\r\nthe signal unless the target is within its limited sensing range.\r\nTherefore, the time to search the target is inherently random\r\nand hence unknown despite its importance in many searching\r\nand rescue applications. Here we propose the expected searching\r\ntime (EST) as a metric to evaluate different robot motion plans\r\nunder different robot configurations. We derive a closed form\r\nsolution for computing the EST. To illustrate the EST model,\r\nwe present two case studies. In the first case, we analyze two\r\ncommon motion plans: a slap method and a random walk. The\r\nEST analysis shows that the slap method is asymptotically faster\r\nthan the random walk when the searching space size increases.\r\nIn the second case, we compare a team of n  low-cost equally configured\r\nrobots with a super robot that has the sensing range\r\nequal to that of the summation of the n  robots. The EST analysis\r\nshows that the low-cost robot team takes \u0398(1/n) time and the\r\nsuper robot takes \u0398(1/\u221an) time as n\u2192\u221e. In both cases, our\r\nEST model successfully demonstrates its ability in assessing the\r\nsearching performance. The analytical results are also confirmed\r\nin simulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new and comprehensive method\r\nof modeling robots having highly flexible members such as\r\nflexure joints. An accurate model of large deformation bending is\r\nimportant for precisely describing the configuration of the\r\nflexible member. Additionally, the accuracy of the Jacobian and\r\nHessian of the forward kinematics are critically important at\r\nlarge angles for predicting the deformation and the stiffness of\r\nthe joint under load. The model introduced here is based on the\r\nassumption that the curvature of a beam in bending is smooth,\r\nand thus can be approximated by low-order, orthogonal\r\npolynomials. This produces a parameterized description of\r\nflexure motion that can be used as a joint model when expressed\r\nin Denavit-Hartenberg form, as a transformation from one rigid\r\nlink to the next in a serial manipulator. We will show that with\r\nonly three parameters, this model faithfully reproduces the\r\nelastic deformation of a flexure hinge predicted by the continuum\r\nmodel, even for large angles, without requiring numerical\r\nintegration or many finite elements. It can also be used to\r\ncompute the compressive buckling load of the flexure as\r\npredicted by the continuum model.",
