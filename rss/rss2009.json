        "abstract": "Over the last years, object recognition has become\r\na more and more active field of research in robotics. An\r\nimportant problem in object recognition is the need for sufficient\r\nlabeled training data to learn good classifiers. In this paper\r\nwe show how to significantly reduce the need for manually\r\nlabeled training data by leveraging data sets available on the\r\nWorld Wide Web. Specifically, we show how to use objects from\r\nGoogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3D Warehouse to train classifiers for 3D laser scans\r\ncollected by a robot navigating through urban environments.\r\nIn order to deal with the different characteristics of the web\r\ndata and the real robot data, we additionally use a small set\r\nof labeled 3D laser scans and perform domain adaptation. Our\r\nexperiments demonstrate that additional data taken from the 3D\r\nWarehouse along with our domain adaptation greatly improves\r\nthe classification accuracy on real laser scans.",

Unfortunately, computing the ML solution is\r\noften prohibitively expensive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is especially true during loop\r\nclosures, which often necessitate adjusting all parameters in a\r\nloop. In this paper we note that it is precisely the choice of a single\r\nprivileged coordinate frame that makes bundle adjustment costly,\r\nand that this expense can be avoided by adopting a completely\r\nrelative approach. We derive a new relative bundle adjustment,\r\nwhich instead of optimizing in a single Euclidean space, works\r\nin a metric-space defined by a connected Riemannian manifold.\r\nUsing an adaptive optimization strategy, we show experimentally\r\nthat it is possible to solve for the full ML solution incrementally\r\nin constant time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even at loop closure. Our system also operates\r\nonline in real-time using stereo data, with fast appearance-based\r\nloop closure detection.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robotics-inspired method\r\nto enhance sampling of native-like protein conformations when\r\nemploying only amino-acid sequence. Computing such conformations,\r\nessential to associate structural and functional information\r\nwith gene sequences, is challenging due to the high-dimensionality\r\nand the rugged energy surface of the protein conformational\r\nspace. The contribution of this work is a novel two-layered\r\nmethod to enhance the sampling of geometrically-distinct lowenergy\r\nconformations at a coarse-grained level of detail. The\r\nmethod grows a tree in conformational space reconciling two\r\ngoals: (i) guiding the tree towards lower energies and (ii) not oversampling\r\ngeometrically-similar conformations. Discretizations of\r\nthe energy surface and a low-dimensional projection space are\r\nemployed to select more often for expansion low-energy conformations\r\nin under-explored regions of the conformational space.\r\nThe tree is expanded with low-energy conformations through\r\na Metropolis Monte Carlo framework that uses a move set of\r\nphysical fragment configurations. Testing on sequences of seven\r\nsmall-to-medium structurally-diverse proteins shows that the\r\nmethod rapidly samples native-like conformations in a few hours\r\non a single CPU. Analysis shows that computed conformations\r\nare good candidates for further detailed energetic refinements by\r\nlarger studies in protein engineering and design.",

        "abstract": "Multi-fingered manipulation systems are important\r\nin the study of robotics. These are also challenging systems, in\r\npart because of the loop closure constraints required of several\r\n(virtual) loops each formed by two fingers and the grasped object.\r\nMost existing work describes system configurations using joint\r\nparameters, in which loop closure constraints are expressed by\r\nhighly nonlinear equations. Such a formulation amounts to an\r\nimplicit parametrization of the configuration space (CSpace)\r\nas a lower-dimensional semi-algebraic subset embedded in a\r\nhigher-dimensional ambient joint parameter space. The non-zero\r\ndifference between the two dimensions is the codimension of\r\nCSpace as seen in the given parametrization.\r\nIn this paper, we point out that, quite generally, parametrizations\r\nleading to lower codimensional configuration spaces provide\r\nmulti-faceted advantages over those producing higher codimensions.\r\nFor two example manipulation system\u00e2\u0080\u0094a 3-fingered hand\r\nand a planar star-manipulator with any number of fingers\u00e2\u0080\u0094\r\nwe present explicit parameterizations, which are effectively of\r\ncodimension 0. We base these parametrizations on our recently\r\ndeveloped construction trees of simplices (such as triangles and\r\ntetrahedra) for multi-object systems; such a tree gives simplexbased\r\nparametrers on CSpace, in which loop closure constraints\r\nbecome simplex formation constraints (such as triangle\r\ninequalities and Cayley\u00e2\u0080\u0093Menger determinant constraints). Both\r\nexample systems are very difficult to deal with using joint angle\r\nparameters. Our results here further demonstrate the generality\r\nand effectiveness of the simplex-based approach.",

As yet, 3D needle steering has not\r\nbeen demonstrated in the presence of tissue deformation and\r\nuncertainty, despite the application of progressively more sophisticated\r\nplanning algorithms. This paper presents a feedback\r\ncontroller that steers a needle along 3D helical paths, and varies\r\nthe helix radius to correct for perturbations. It achieves high\r\naccuracy for targets sufficiently far from the needle insertion\r\npoint; this is counterintuitive because the system is highly underactuated\r\nand not locally controllable. The controller uses a model\r\npredictive control framework that chooses a needle twist rate such\r\nthat the predicted helical trajectory minimizes the distance to the\r\ntarget. Fast branch and bound techniques enable execution at\r\nkilohertz rates on a 2GHz PC. We evaluate the controller under\r\na variety of simulated perturbations, including imaging noise,\r\nneedle deflections, and curvature estimation errors. We also test\r\nthe controller in a 3D finite element simulator that incorporates\r\ndeformation in the tissue as well as the needle. In deformable\r\ntissue examples, the controller reduced targeting error by up to\r\n88% compared to open-loop execution.",

        "abstract": "To effectively navigate in their environments and\r\naccurately reach their target locations, mobile robots require\r\na globally consistent map of the environment. The problem of\r\nlearning a map with a mobile robot has been intensively studied in\r\nthe past and is usually referred to as the simultaneous localization\r\nand mapping (SLAM) problem. However, existing solutions to the\r\nSLAM problem typically rely on loop-closures to obtain global\r\nconsistency and do not exploit prior information even if it is\r\navailable. In this paper, we present a novel SLAM approach\r\nthat achieves global consistency by utilizing publicly accessible\r\naerial photographs as prior information. Our approach inserts\r\ncorrespondences found between three-dimensional laser range\r\nscans and the aerial image as constraints into a graph-based\r\nformulation of the SLAM problem. We evaluate our algorithm\r\nbased on large real-world datasets acquired in a mixed in- and\r\noutdoor environment by comparing the global accuracy with\r\nstate-of-the-art SLAM approaches and GPS. The experimental\r\nresults demonstrate that the maps acquired with our method\r\nshow increased global consistency.",

We present\r\ntwo new algorithms capable of generating such relay chains, one\r\nbeing a dual ascent algorithm and the other a modification of the\r\nBellman-Ford algorithm. As the priorities between the number\r\nof steps in the relay chain and the cost of the chain may vary, we\r\ncalculate chains of different lengths and costs and let the ground\r\noperator choose between them. Several different formulations\r\nfor edge costs are presented. In our test cases, both algorithms\r\nare substantially faster than an optimized version of the original\r\nBellman-Ford algorithm, which is used for comparison.",

Our objective is to\r\nenable human-robot interaction by allowing a robot to follow\r\nbehind a human moving in (up to) six degrees of freedom.\r\nIn particular, we have developed a system to allow a robot\r\nto detect, track and follow a scuba diver by using frequencydomain\r\ndetection of biological motion patterns. The motion of\r\nbiological entities is characterized by combinations of periodic\r\nmotions which are inherently distinctive. This is especially true\r\nof human swimmers. By using the frequency-space response of\r\nspatial signals over a number of video frames, we attempt to\r\nidentify signatures pertaining to biological motion. This technique\r\nis applied to track scuba divers in underwater domains, typically\r\nwith the robot swimming behind the diver. The algorithm is able\r\nto detect a range of motions, which include motion directly away\r\nfrom or towards the camera. The motion of the diver relative\r\nto the vehicle is then tracked using an Unscented Kalman Filter\r\n(UKF), an approach for non-linear estimation. The efficiency of\r\nour approach makes it attractive for real-time application onboard\r\nour underwater vehicle, and in future applications we\r\nintend to track scuba divers real-time with the robot.

Our approach has been\r\nimplemented and evaluated on real data of complex objects.\r\nPractical experiments demonstrate, that our approach is able\r\nto learn object class models autonomously that are consistent\r\nwith the true classifications provided by a human. It furthermore\r\noutperforms unsupervised method such as hierarchical clustering\r\nthat operate on a distance metric.",

The paper provides two contributions. The first one is\r\nthe analytical computation to derive the part of the system which\r\nis observable when the robot accomplishes circular trejectories.\r\nThis computation consists in performing a local decomposition of\r\nthe system, based on the theory of distributions. In this respect,\r\nthis paper represents the first application of the distribution\r\ntheory in the frame-work of mobile robotics. Then, starting from\r\nthis decomposition, a method to efficiently estimate the parameters\r\ndescribing both the extrinsic bearing sensor calibration\r\nand the odometry calibration is derived (second contribution).\r\nSimulations and experiments with the robot e-Puck equipped\r\nwith encoder sensors and a camera validate the approach.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems that can create and use visual maps\r\nin realtime have obvious advantages in many applications, from\r\nautomatic driving to mobile manipulation in the home. In this\r\npaper we describe a mapping system based on retaining stereo\r\nviews of the environment that are collected as the robot moves.\r\nConnections among the views are formed by consistent geometric\r\nmatching of their features. Out-of-sequence matching is the key\r\nproblem: how to find connections from the current view to other\r\ncorresponding views in the map. Our approach uses a vocabulary\r\ntree to propose candidate views, and a strong geometric filter\r\nto eliminate false positives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 essentially, the robot continually\r\nre-recognizes where it is. We present experiments showing the\r\nutility of the approach on video data, including map building in\r\nlarge indoor and outdoor environments, map building without\r\nlocalization, and re-localization when lost.",
