        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Periodic deformations of organs and soft tissues are complex, repetitive disturbances for surgeons manipulating robotic interfaces in computer-assisted surgery. They are due to respiratory movements or heart beats, and they have to be manually compensated for by the surgeon whenever accurate gestures are needed, as it is the case in cardiac or robotized laparoscopic surgery. This work presents a repetitive model predictive control scheme for the cancellation of fast periodic motions by a robot arm, which is controlled by visual servoing at 500 Hz by means of a high-speed camera. The problem we address is to keep a constant distance in the camera images from a surgical tool's tip to the organ surface. Contributions of the control input to reference tracking and to the fast-disturbance rejection are split and computed separately to ensure that the surgeon's interaction on the robot bas no influence on the cancellation performance. The system is tested in a laboratory experiment with an experimental surgical arm and in in vivo conditions on a living pig with a standard surgical robot. Results show the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed control scheme.",

A robust and computationally cheap blob detection algorithm is proposed and results are provided to demonstrate its performance in extracting targets from cluttered scenes.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to calibrate sets of kinematics and dynamic parameters of human arm or leg from its captured points via many behaviors. If both sets are successively identified, we can easily generate dynamic animation of human such as handling, pitching, walking, running and so on. In addition, we can straightforwardly touch a virtual arm or leg while feeling reactive force/moment by a haptic rendering (tactile feedback display). In robotics, many types of algorithms have been proposed for calibrating kinematics and dynamic parameters of robotic manipulator. They are meaningless for calibrating a human arm or leg as follows: (1) we do not know any control scheme and feedback gain. (2) we do not know any torque of each actuator. (3) we do not know any set of good initial parameters of kinematics and dynamics. To overcome these, we propose a probabilistic algorithm to calibrate sets of kinematics and dynamic parameters of a human arm or leg from its successive captured points. The calibration algorithm based on GA (Genetic Algorithm) does not require any set of good initial set of kinematics and dynamic parameters.",

The method solves a linear complementarity problem (LCP) at each step. We show that the algorithm can be obtained as the stiff limit of fixed time-step schemes applied to regularized contact models. We do not perform collision detection. Instead, a noninterpenetration constraint is replaced by its linearization, which, together with a judicious choice of the active constraints, guarantees geometrical constraint stabilization without the need to perform a reduction of the time step to detect new collision or stick-slip transition events. Partially elastic collisions are accommodated by a suitable modification of the free term of the LCP.",

        "abstract": "A multi-model based approach to fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of internal sensor for mobile robot is proposed. Three failure modes (hard failure mode, noise failure mode, and scale failure mode) of the sensor are handled; on the hard failure the sensor output is stuck at a constant value. The noise failure causes the sensor output with large noise. On the scale failure the gain (scale) of the sensor output differs from the normal. The detection and diagnosis of the hard/noise failure (HNFDD) is based on the variable structure interacting multiple-model (VSIMM) estimator; changes of the failure modes are modeled as switching from one mode to another in a probabilistic manner. The mode probabilities, which are estimated based on a bank of Kalman filters, provide the fault decision. The detection and diagnosis of the scale failure (SFDD) is achieved via single-model based Kalman filters, each of which is based on a model matching to a failure mode of particular sensors; the fault decision is made by comparing the model conditional estimates in the sensor gain. The proposed FDD algorithm is implemented on our skid-steered mobile robot with five internal sensors (four wheel-encoders and one yaw-rate gyro). Experimental results show the property of the FDD algorithm.",

Once a perturbation is initiated, data describing a subject's ability to balance is recorded and analyzed. We introduce a novel perturbation device that can translate and rotate its base in any direction within a 2D plane. This robust perturbation envelope will expand researchers' abilities in the study of upright balance and balance recovery. The heart of the design is the use of four powered casters as the platform's transmission system. The casters' offset insures that the Jacobian matrix describing the system's planar motion is non-singular. A rapid embedded programming method is used to develop the control system. By controlling the orientation and speed of each caster, translation, rotation, or combined perturbations can be easily implemented.",

        "abstract": "An important assumption underlying virtually all approaches to multi-robot exploration is prior knowledge about their relative locations. This is due to the fact that robots need to merge their maps so as to coordinate their exploration strategies. The key step in map merging is to estimate the relative locations of the individual robots. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot map merging under global uncertainty about the robot's relative locations. Our approach uses an adapted version of particle filters to estimate the position of one robot in the other robot's partial map. The risk of false-positive map matches is avoided by verifying match hypotheses using a rendezvous approach. We show how to seamlessly integrate this approach into a decision-theoretic multi-robot coordination strategy. The experiments show that our sample-based technique can reliably find good hypotheses for map matches. Furthermore, we present results obtained with two robots successfully merging their maps using the decision-theoretic rendezvous strategy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In planetary exploration, when collecting a rock, it is important how to get information of the surface around a sample. Usually, surface information is brought by a special sensor such as laser range finder and stereo camera. These sensors, however, need more weight and power consumption and are used for only one function such as the surface measurement. And furthermore, there are some difficulties to use those sensors in some situation, for example, a high brightness environment. In this research, we apply Shadow Range Finder: SRF, which can make good use of a shadow for the measurement of surface information under the direct sunlight. SRF is robust for above-mentioned environment, and a shadow would be recognized in the case of a halation. The measurement by SRF uses a single camera installed on a manipulator, and a link of a manipulator, which produce its shadow. The principle of SRF is same as laser range finder, and a shadow is used for scanning slit instead of a laser. In this paper, experimental results of actual objects are shown, and we discusses about accuracy improvement for measurement data, considering an umbra and a penumbra caused by surface light source. Finally, we apply this method to tele-sampling by a manipulator on a rover system.",

It shows a gain in performance and a better task error especially when working in proximity of singular configurations. It is particularly suitable for autonomous systems where an offline trajectory control scheme is often not applicable.",

The electromyogram (EMG) signals of muscles in forearm and upper-arm of the exoskeleton's user and the wrist force are also used as input information for the controller. By applying the EMG signals as main input signals to the controller, automatic control can be realized for the physically weak persons without manipulating any equipment.

In this system, we basically use a sliced 2-D configuration plane because of no occlusion. In general, an enormous number of such planes exist in seven dimensional configuration space. To select some fruitful planes from all the planes, we develop a human support system based on efficient path finding and obstacle evaluating algorithms in each 2-D plane. The efficiency of this human computer cooperation system is compared with that of the model-based path-planning algorithm A*. Selecting a near-optimal path in our system is absolutely faster than calculating its optimal path by A*. This means that a human ability understanding a task is quite powerful especially for a seven-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator.",

In order to analyze the deformation effect, we first describe the dynamic relation of a two-fingered object manipulation using soft fingertips. From the dynamic relation, we show that the fundamental deformation effect of soft fingertips is essential for soft-fingered manipulations. A dynamic manipulation control method considering the deformation effect is also proposed. Simulation results show that the deformation effect of soft fingertips during the manipulation process is crucial for stable manipulation. Finally, we conclude that the deformation effect of soft fingertips is desirable to be properly considered in a manipulation control law for successful soft-fingered manipulation tasks.",

Its sensory channels comprising vision, audition, haptics, and force sensing are used to extract perceptual information about speech, gestures and gaze of the operator, and object recognition. The anthropomorphic robot arm makes goal-directed movements to pick up and hand over objects. The human operator may mechanically interact with the arm by pushing it away (haptics) or by taking an object out of the robot's gripper (force sensing). The design objective has been to exploit the human operator's intuition by modeling the mechanical structure, the senses, and the behaviors of the assistant on human anatomy, human perception, and human motor behavior.",

On the way to the successful planning, deployment and operation of the module, computer generated and animated models are being used to optimize performance. Under contract of the German Space Agency DLR, it has become IRF's task to provide a Projective Virtual Reality System to provide a virtual world built after the planned layout of the COLUMBUS module enabling astronauts and scientists to practice operational procedures and the handling of experiments. The possibility for distributed multiuser access to the virtual lab and the visualization of real-world experiment data comprise the key features of the system. Through the ability to share the virtual world, cooperative operations can be practiced easily and trainers and trainees can work together more effectively in the shared virtual environment. The ability to visualize real-world data will be used to introduce measured experimental data into the virtual world online in order to allow realistic interaction with the science reference model hardware: The user's actions in the virtual world are translated into corresponding changes of the inputs of the science reference model hardware; the measured data is then in turn fed back into the virtual world. In order to provide astronauts and scientists with an even more complete insight into various aspects of COLUMBUS and the ISS, the simulation of the COLUMBUS module is currently being extended to include the entire International Space Station. This paper describes the background and the developed features which allow the creation of a virtual world that provides users with the feel of being on board the ISS.",

However, conventional remote-controlled construction machine is larger than ordinary ones and limited in types and numbers, so there is a problem that the transportation to the destructed sites takes time and is troublesome. Therefore, the development of the remote-control system using a robot, which can be easily installed in ordinary construction machine, is desired. We have been developing the pneumatic humanoid type robot arm, which can be installed in any models of construction machine, and realizing remote control of construction machine with the aim of easy installation and portability. In consideration of portability, the lightweight pneumatic artificial rubber muscle (PARM) was adopted as the actuator. In this research, we realized the remote control of the construction machine using the pneumatic robot that has 6 degree of freedom using the fiber knitted type PARM. We experimented in order to measure the static characteristic of the fiber knitted type PARM. Then we did experiment on the remote control of the construction machine. Experimental results show the developed system is availability in remote control of a construction machine.",

The control architecture is based on a robust reactive wall-following behaviour. To make it purposeful we provide driving hints derived from an approximate nodal-map. For most of the time, the vehicle is driven with weak localization (odometry). This need only be improved at intersections where decisions must be made-a technique we refer to as opportunistic localization. The truck has achieved full-speed autonomous operation at an artificial test mine, and subsequently, at a operational underground mine.",

To acquire stability on uneven terrain in landing, the robot is designed by legs which widely spread like spiders. The legs are consists of 4-bar linkage and driven by a pair of pneumatic cylinders which momentarily produce high power and speed. At this time, basic performance of the pneumatic cylinder is verified for the jumping use. Moreover the one leg model is developed and examined its jumping and landing performances.",

        "abstract": "We are working on mapping multi-channel neural spike data, recorded from multiple cortical areas of an owl monkey, to corresponding 3D monkey arm positions. In earlier work on this mapping task, we observed that continuous function approximators (such as artificial neural networks) have difficulty in jointly estimating 3D arm positions for two distinct cases-namely, when the monkey's arm is stationary and when it is moving. Therefore, we propose a multiple-model approach that first classifies neural spike data into two classes, corresponding to two states of the monkey's arm: (1) stationary and (2) moving. Then, the output of this classifier is used as a gating mechanism for subsequent continuous models, with one model per class. In this paper, we first motivate and discuss our approach. Next, we present encouraging results for the classifier stage, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), and also for the entire bimodal mapping system. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the results and suggest future avenues of research.",

Motivated by the operation of biological systems and utilizing some constraints for each of the above mentioned tasks, we are aiming at design of a robust, robotic hand-eye coordination system. Hand-eye coordination tasks we consider here are of the basic fetch-and-carry type useful for service robots operating in everyday environments. Objects to be manipulated are, for example, food items that are simple in shape (polyhedral, cylindrical) but with complex surface texture. To achieve the required robustness and flexibility, we integrate both geometric and appearance based information to solve the task at hand. We show how the research in human visuo-motor system can be facilitated to design a fully operational, visually guided object manipulation system.",

Many researchers have tried to obtain closed-form solutions of 3-and 6-DOFs parallel robots, i.e., planar, Delta, Stewart platform and Hexapod robots, in a single variable polynomial equation. Indeed, there are just few effort have been devoted in the past to 4-DOFs parallel robot. Therefore, we focus on the forward kinematics of a 4-DOFs parallel robot H4. Solutions of the forward kinematic yields a 16/sup th/ degree polynomial in a single variable which indicates that there may be up to 16 different configurations for the travelling plate for a given set of motor's angle. The results are presented via a numerical example.",

In this paper, control policies for both kinematic and simple dynamical systems are developed. This work assumes that the initial velocities are somewhat aligned with the desired velocity vector field.

        "abstract": "In this paper a method of mobile robot navigation based on rough mereology is presented, that can be useful in translating spatial expressions in natural language into low level spatial descriptions. In our paper we apply a geometry of solids, that takes disks as a geometrical primitive and the relation \"to be a part in degree\", as a basis to build more complicated geometrical notions. In specifying to which degree one region is the part of another the rough membership function is applied. To determine regions we use a sonar system, that consists of one omni-directional ultrasonic transmitter located on the robot and a set of receivers located in the robot space'. By measuring time of flight of pulse from the transmitter to a receiver we determine the distance between them, as well as receiver regions-disks with centers in receiver positions and radii equal to measured distances. The reflected pulse determines the distance to the nearest wall or obstacle and defines the non-collision region-a disk with radius equal to measured distance. In navigation tasks we do not treat the robot as a point, but we replace it with a non-collision region. We propose a scheme for converting natural language control into physical descriptions. This scheme can be used in dynamical systems (e.g., mobile robot navigation). Finally, we present results of simulation and real world experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the obstacle detection algorithm based on the consecutive range sensor scanning scheme and the probabilistic navigation for an mobile robot. For a known environment, a mobile robot scans the environment using the range sensor which can rotate 360/spl deg/. The environment is rebuilt using nodes of two adjacent walls, and an obstacle is detected by comparing characteristic points of both the known environment and the scanned data set. It is very useful for detecting the moving obstacle. By comparing two data sets, the movement of an obstacle is extracted. Furthermore, the consecutive scanning data set provides obstacle information in unknown environment. Geometric comparison between the two consecutive data sets is used to detect the obstacles and the algorithm is presented with both simulation and experimental results. After the obstacle information is extracted from the consecutive scanning, the path is rebuilt by checking the collision probability.",

As a part of the national project of rescue robot system, we are investigating a method for constructing a 3-D map of rubble by teleoperated mobile robots. We are also planning to build an intuitive user interface for teleoperating robots and navigating in a virtualized rubble model using the obtained 3-D model. In this paper, some preliminary research results are introduced. We did some design studies of laser range finders that can be mounted on a mobile robot and can get the range data of the rubble around the robot. Then, we formulated a 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building) algorithm and conducted some simulation studies. Lastly, we proposed a novel motion canceling camera system and confirmed its validity by experiment.",

        "abstract": "Building on existent robotics knowledge to model and simulate anthropomorphic kinematics is an appealing approach, because sound knowledge gained in the fields of multi-robot and multi-agent systems can be applied. This provides-with little additional effort-the \"new human\" with capabilities ranging from natural arm movement up to the coordinated operation of his arms and the cooperation between multiple anthropomorphic kinematics. The same general hierarchical control structure that has successfully been used to control multi-robot systems for space and industrial application has therefore been enhanced to incorporate the newly required capabilities. The enhancements focus on a new approach to on the one hand consider human extremities as articulated robots which are mechanically connected to make up the body-and on the other hand to provide a control strategy to move the full body correctly under equilibrium conditions. We provide an overall control structure that preserves the capabilities of the single robots and introduces \"sensible couplings\" to move the body as a whole in a naturally looking way. As described in the paper, this work is currently being applied to several application fields in industry up to the simulation of astronauts' work on the International Space Station.",

        "abstract": "The motion of free-floating space robots is characterized by nonholonomic, i.e., non-integrable rate constraint equations. These constraints originate from principles of conservation of linear and angular momentum. It is well known that these rate constraints can also be written as input-affine drift-less control systems. Trajectory planning of these systems is extremely challenging and computation intensive since the motion must satisfy differential constraints. However, under certain conditions, these drift-less control systems can be shown to be differentially flat. The property of flatness allows a computationally in-expensive way to plan trajectories for the dynamic system between two configurations as well as develop feedback controllers. Nonholonomic rate constraints for free-floating planar open-chain robots are systematically studied to determine the design conditions under which the system exhibits differential flatness. Under these design conditions, the property of flatness is used for trajectory planning and feedback control under perturbations in the initial state.",

We consider, as an example, the estimation of game states in autonomous robot soccer. We show that many factors other than the choice of algorithms determine the performance of the estimation systems. We propose empirical investigations and learning as necessary tools for the development of successful state estimation systems.",

The newly introduced Shape Feedback M-S Gripper (SPADE GRIPPER) for detecting and removing mines is composed of three unilateral position controls without bilateral force control, can work stably in such an unknown environment. The mechanical design and the operation principle of SPADE GRIPPER and several experiments are performed to examine its validities.",

        "abstract": "We have been developing a \"muscle suit\" that provides muscular support to the paralyzed or those otherwise unable to move unaided, as well as to manual workers. The muscle suit is a garment without a metal frame and uses a McKibben actuator driven by compressed air. Because actuators are sewn into the garment, no metal frame is needed, making the muscle suit very light and cheap. Most medical and welfare apparatuses have been developed for the caregiver rather than for the patient in need of nursing, detracting from the patient's sense of self-sufficiency and generally discouraging the patient. With the muscle suit, the patient can willfully control his or her movement. The muscle suit is very helpful for both muscular and emotional support. In this paper, we propose an armor-type muscle suit in order to overcome issues of a prototype system and then show how abduction motion, which we believe is the most difficult motion for the upper body, is realized. Moreover, we propose an easy control method in which the wearer uses pressure differential signals.",

Bio-mimetic research of such skillful human motor behavior is important not only for deeper understanding of human sensations and nervous control functions but also for developing of higher level robots. In this paper, we first formulate the basic model of multipoints whole body interaction between a robot manipulator and its object. We then study three control approaches by considering the limitations of force feedback, the complexity of control algorithms. As an example, we consider a 2-link planar manipulator that operates a circle object with dynamic arm friction. We show a computer simulation algorithm, and compare the results of each control methods, numerically.",

We deal with one arm type space robot based on the Reconfigurable Brachiating space Robot (RBR). We conduct a micro-gravity flight experiment of the RBR, and we identify kinematical and dynamical parameters of the robot arm. Then, we conduct numerical simulations of 6 DOF robot arm dynamics under the constraint within a two-dimensional plane. It is assumed that the robot arm moves on a large space structure using handrails attached to the structure. When the handrail slowly vibrates due to flexibility of the large structure, then the robot behavior is influenced by its fluctuation. In this paper, we show the simulation results of brachiating motion and discuss the flexibility effects to the robot motion.",

        "abstract": "We consider the effect of exploration policy in the context of the autonomous construction of a visual map of an unknown environment. Like other concurrent mapping and localization (CML) tasks, odometric uncertainty poses the problem of introducing distortions into the map which are difficult to correct without costly on-line or post-processing algorithms. Our problem is further compounded by the implicit nature of the visual map representation, which is designed to accommodate a wide variety of visual phenomena without assuming a particular imaging platform, thereby precluding the inference of scene geometry. Such a representation presents a requirement for a relatively dense sampling of observations of the environment in order to produce reliable models. Our goal is to develop an online policy for exploring an unknown environment which minimizes map distortion while maximizing coverage. We do not depend on costly post-hoc expectation maximization approaches to improve the output, but rather employ extended Kalman filter (EKF) methods to localize each observation once, and rely on the exploration policy to ensure that sufficient information is available to localize the successive observations. We present an experimental analysis of a variety of exploratory policies, in both simulated and real environments, and demonstrate that with an effective policy an accurate map can be constructed.",

The robot is modelled with classical Lagrange equation which leads to an inverse dynamic model linear with respect to the parameters. Assuming the error additive on input (motor torque), the problem is expressed in a bounded error context. The ellipsoidal method is applied in a factorised form in order to guarantee numerical stability. Experimental results are exhibited for a fully parallel robot with 4 degrees of freedom.",

        "abstract": "Today's robot applications often include multi-robot multi-user environments which are planed thoroughly in 3D before installation. The key to gain the maximum benefit out of the already available models it is to reuse them for other purposes than only robot-simulation. One of these aspects surely is the training of future operators of the cell which is important especially for environments that are difficult to access for training. For example a production line in the automotive industry may not be shut down for a day of emergency-training. In this paper we will show how to reuse already modelled robot cells and mechanisms of the Cosimir simulation-system in emergency-training. We present an approach for graphical visualisation and simulation of fire. We show how to get realistic impressions of fire using advanced particle-simulation and how to use the advantages of particles to trigger states in a modified cellular automata used for the simulation of fire-behaviour. By this we can have a simulated fire developing and reacting on other fires and different substances as water, CO/sub 2/ or oxygen. It turns out that the mechanisms implemented for fire-simulation are also valuable for robot-simulation. So there is a mutual benefit between the robot-simulation and the simulation of fire. The methods proposed in this paper have been implemented and successfully tested on Cosimir, a commercial robot-and VR-simulation-system.",

The novelty of this research is therefore the development of a systematic algorithm to extract the model parameters of a harmonic drive transmission in the robot arm to facilitate model-based control. We have chosen the elbow pitch joint (joint 4) of the PA-10 robot arm for estimation and modeling purposes. We have done several experiments to identify the various parameters of the harmonic drive system. We conclude with a sample trajectory tracking task whereby the feedback torque required to do trajectory tracking with and without the parameter identification of the HDT is significantly different.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an evaluation of joint configurations of a robotic finger based on kinematic analysis. The evaluation is based on an assumption that the current control methods for the fingers require that the contact state specified by the motion planner be maintained during manipulation. Various finger-joint configurations have been evaluated for different contact motions. In the kinematic analysis, the surface of the manipulated object was represented by B-spline surface and the surface of the finger was represented by cylinders and a half ellipsoid. Three types of contact motion, namely: 1) pure rolling, 2) twist-rolling, and 3) slide-twist-rolling are assumed in this analysis. The finger-joint configuration best suited for manipulative motion is determined by the dimension of manipulation workspace. The evaluation has shown that the human-like fingers are suitable for maintaining twist-rolling and slide-twist-rolling but not for pure rolling. A finger with roll joint at its fingertip link, which is different from human fingers, proved to be better for pure rolling motion because it can accommodate sideway motions of the object. Several kinds of useful finger-joint configurations suited for manipulating objects by fingertip surface are proposed.",

The proposed approach is based on first expressing the kinematic and force constraints in terms of equalities and inequalities in variables of the object and hand configurations, and then formulating and solving grasp feasibility as a constrained global optimization problem. An example is provided to illustrate the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A feedback control method of Omni-Directional Vehicles (ODV) is proposed by using a caster type odometer. The odometer which is called the Two Wheels Caster Type Odometer (TWCTOdometer) is specially designed for ODVs. Driving wheels of typical ODVs are easy to slip. When an odometer is connected directly with the shafts of driving wheels, the slip of the driving wheels causes much dead-reckoning error. Thus the TWCTOdometer is attached independently to the driving wheels of the ODV in order to avoid the influence of slips of the driving wheels. The TWCTOdometer has a characteristic of passive omni-directional motion, which is to follow the omni-directional motion of the ODV. The ODV's current position and orientation are estimated accurately from the measurement values of the TWCTOdometer. The proposed control method uses the estimated current position and orientation that allow the accurate trajectory control of the ODV along desired trajectories. Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed control method by using the TWCTOdometer.",

        "abstract": "In domains such as robotic rescue, robots must plan paths through environments that are complex and dynamic, and in which robots have only incomplete knowledge. This will normally require both diversions from planned paths as well as significant re-planning as events in the domain unfold and new information is acquired. In terms of a representation for path planning, these requirements place significant demands on efficiency and flexibility. This paper describes a method for flexible binary space partitioning designed to serve as a basis for path planning in uncertain dynamic domains such as robotic rescue. This approach is used in the 2003 version of the Keystone Fire Brigade a robotic rescue team. We describe the algorithm used, make comparisons to related approaches to path planning, and provide an empirical evaluation of an implementation of this approach.",

Because the position control performs the grasping, it is not necessary to change the control rule accompanying the approach/grasp phase. The control system is, therefore, stable. Grasped objects may slip from fingertips when the mass of the objects and the posture of the robot's hands change. To avoid this problem, the friction coefficient is identified in real time. We believe that objects begin to slip when the friction coefficient value exceeds the maximum coefficient of friction. Using this coefficient as a threshold value, the grasping force is increased by increasing joint compliance. Our proposed control system was applied to a multifingered hand, and its efficacy and usefulness was verified.",

In this paper we study if the basic quality criterion for grasps, the force-closure property, is in principle easy or difficult to reach. We show that it is not necessary to generate optimal grasps, due to a certain quality measure, for real robot grasping tasks where an average quality grasp is acceptable.

Human motion can be divided into two classes, reflex and voluntary movement. Reflex is suppressed by voluntary movement. In the proposed method, a robot hand's grasping control corresponds to human reflex and manipulation control corresponds to voluntary movement. We constructed a controller composed of a manipulation controller, grasping controller and suppresser. The grasping controller has fast feedback but can only execute simple motion. The manipulation controller has slow feedback, and can execute complex motion. Finally, the validity of the hierarchical method is confirmed by computer simulation of various tasks, i.e. grasping, manipulation, and re-grasping motion.",

A horizontal velocity of super ball after an impact depends on the angular velocity before the impact where it doesn't slip at the contact point. Our robot model consists of an elastic spherical shell with such an impact condition and of an internal rotary input. Assuming the perfectly elastic impact in a vertical direction, a feedback control strategy for generating the horizontal velocity after an impact by the rotary input during flying phase is derived. Simulation results show that some hopping motion is achieved by the proposed method. In addition, this paper shows the possibility and necessary condition that a climbing motion with impacts against two parallel vertical planes is achieved.",

        "abstract": "We build on previous work, on the development of a computer controlled wheelchair equipped with a suite of sensors and a novel interface for human-robot interaction. In this paper, we present experimental results and usability studies for the wheelchair. The architecture for human-robot interaction is hierarchical, with the lowest level corresponding to trajectory control, the intermediate level being behavioral and the highest level involving the composition of behaviors and navigation. Our experimental results illustrate the benefits of a shared-control paradigm where the human operator selects the appropriate behavior(s) or goals while the software is responsible for executing behaviors and generating safe trajectories. Experiments with human users highlight advantages of augmentation in wheelchairs.",

The interactive robot soccer game bas been developed to let humans join in the game dynamically and entertain them more. Accordingly, cooperation strategy between humans and autonomous robots is very important for making the game more realistic. Autonomous robots move to their destination depending on the current positions of other robots and the ball. These destinations based on situation will be learned with the fuzzy Q-learning method through playing the game with human operators. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed strategy for the cooperation between humans and robots, the simulation with a modeled human operator and the game with real human operators have been carried out.",

It is known that ISS is related to smooth stabilizability, however this relation cannot exclude the possibility of non smoothly stabilizable systems enjoying ISS properties. In fact, it is shown that in a certain topology that seems to suit the nonholonomic nature of the mobile robot, and by applying a particular control law, the closed loop system can be rendered locally ISS. Apart from any possible theoretical ramifications, this result encourages an ISS-based stability analysis of groups of mobile robots.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, much has been studied on the colonoscope because it is a very important tool for diagnosing colon cancer which is the second leading cause of cancer in the developed countries. During the course of colonoscopy, the colonoscope need to be inserted to the tortuous colon of patients. This is a procedure often painful for the patient and complex for the surgeon. In order to solve this problem, a new flexible actuator of a colonoscope capable of avoiding the injury to the patients has been developed for autonomous colonoscope in our lab. In this paper we mainly deal with the modeling and parameter identification of our flexible actuator in order to design a controller that can automatically detect the contact between the surgical instruments and the intestine. First a mathematical model of the actuator was deduced and linearised from previous research, then a direct identification approach was studied for the continuous-time system, using continuous-time ARX (CARX) model and the Levenberg Marquardt (L-M) algorithm. Finally, the experiment setup and the identification of the parameters of the actuator are described and the results are compared with the data obtained from classical frequency response method. Experimentation has proved the continuous-time method to be very effective for our system identification.",

As for the theoretical investigation, impedance matching is discussed for the case in which the robot hand under impedance control approaches and collides with a passive target, and a specific impedance value is defined to yield the matching. The impedance matching is understood to give a criteria if the contact is maintained with a target, or the target is pushed away. Experiments are carried out using two robot manipulators as a motion simulator of the chaser and target. Through the experiments, the concept of the impedance matching is verified, and a satellite capture operation is demonstrated using the strategy that an impedance controlled probe is inserted into the thruster nozzle cone of the target.",

Greedy mapping moves the robot from its current location on a shortest path towards a closest unvisited, unscanned or informative location, until the terrain is mapped. Previous work has resulted in upper and lower bounds on its worst-case travel distance but there was a large gap between the bounds. In this paper, we reduce the gap substantially by decreasing the upper bound from /spl Oscr/;(|V|/sup 3/2/) to /spl Oscr/;(|V|ln|V|) edge traversals, where |V| is the number of vertices of the graph. This upper bound demonstrates that the travel distance of greedy mapping is guaranteed to be small and thus suggests that greedy mapping is indeed a reasonable mapping method. The guaranteed good performance of greedy mapping is robust in that it holds for different versions of greedy mapping, regardless of sensor type and sensor range.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a bone-mountable surgical robot system for hip surgery and its in vitro experiments with cadavers. The system eliminates the need for obtaining CT scan data by adopting gauge-based, bone-mounting registration method and is designed to replace only the broaching procedure, which is known to be the most error-prone procedure in the manual surgery. The performance of this system is evaluated with specimen of six human cadavers. X-ray images and photographed image of femurs are utilized for measuring the difference between the implant and the anatomical axes. As this deviation implies how the gait pattern of the operated patient may be influenced by the surgery, the amount of deviation is used as the indicative of system performance. The nominal differences of anteversion angle, valgus-varus angle, and flexion-extension angle are 0.02/spl plusmn/2.73/spl deg/, 0.98 /spl plusmn/0.39/spl deg/ and 0.51/spl plusmn/0.87/spl deg/, respectively. In case of the change in leg length after the surgery, the nominal error is -0.88/spl plusmn/1.26 mm. Experimental results show that the performance of the developed system is comparable to other surgical robots that use preoperative planning with CT scan data.",

        "abstract": "GVG has been effectively used as a sensor based navigation tool using 360/spl deg/ sensor data. For mobile guide robot applications, however, we can only use 180/spl deg/ sensor data and the robustness of the navigation algorithm is critical for successful applications. For that purpose, the robot should be equipped with three capabilities. Those are 1) incremental GVG construction, 2) robust GVG navigation and 3) navigation strategy that just uses half of the sensor scan, i.e. 180/spl deg/. In this paper, we propose a GVG navigation algorithm that has above 3 capabilities. We firstly propose a method that can estimate the invisible 180/spl deg/ range from previous range data. Moreover, we suggest a way of robust GVG navigation algorithm by using a sensor data matching technique. The simulation result validates that the proposed algorithm can incrementally and robustly navigate the semi-unstructured map by using 180/spl deg/ sensor scan.",

In this paper, we propose an entropic information metric for the above purpose where entropy is used to quantify the probabilistic uncertainty in sensor measurements. We present results using data obtained from field trials on an unmanned vehicle to substantiate the utility of the proposed metric.

The human sharing the working area with the robot led to integrate the field of human factors in the development. Hence, the human component has to be integrated in the early steps of the development process. Regards to the complexity of today's robotic application, and to the requirements of a teamwork, we choose UML as the language. This paper focuses on the UML modeling contribution to the human factors analysis of a medical robot. A first section presents the function allocation and task analysis step, and a second section deals with human error. Each section is illustrated by a case study of a system for robotic tele-echography (ultrasound scan examination).",

The user's intention is transfered to the wheelchair via the HCI, and then the wheelchair is controlled to the intended direction. Additionally, the wheelchair can detect and avoid obstacles autonomously using sonar sensors. By combining HCI into the autonomous functions, it performs safe and reliable motions while considering the user's intention. The experimental results in the crowded environment show that the proposed robotic wheelchair is feasible for the disabled and the elderly with severe motor disabilities.",

        "abstract": "As robots enter the human environment, there are increasing needs for novice users to be able to program robots with ease. A successful robot programming system should be intuitive, interactive, and intention aware. Intuitiveness refers to the use of intuitive user interfaces such as speech and hand gestures. Interactivity refers to the system's ability to let the user interact preemptively with the robot to take its control at any given time. Intention awareness refers to the system's ability to recognize and adapt to user intent. This paper focuses on the intention awareness problem for interactive multi-modal robot programming system. In our framework, user intent takes on the form of a robot program, which in our context is a sequential set of commands with parameters. To solve the intention recognition and adaptation problem, the system converts robot programs into a set of Markov chains. The system can then deduce the most likely program the user intends to execute based on a given observation sequence. It then adapts this program based on additional interaction. The system is implemented on a mobile vacuum cleaning robot with a user who is wearing sensor gloves, inductive position sensors, and a microphone.",

A key feature of the proposed system is that the body is not securely connected to the sheet and the contact region between the body and the sheet changes dynamically during manipulation. The use of a soft flexible sheet and the untethered nature of manipulation, makes the system particularly well suited to handling the human body. We present an application to a rehabilitation bed for repositioning a bedridden patient to alleviate secondary ailments such as bedsores. In order to prevent injury to the patient's fragile skin, it must be ensured that the patient does not slip on the sheet during repositioning. We model the system and present a no-slip condition based on system parameters. The model is used to develop a closed loop control strategy for coordinating the motions of multiple actuators of the prototype bed. The prototype bed can successfully reposition test subjects using the control strategy developed.",

The micromanipulation system is an in-parallel actuated planar manipulator based on five single DOF flexure joints connecting five supposedly rigid links to each other. Numerical results provided show that there exist practical operation ranges of the manipulator yielding both a suitable set of joint serve gains as well as a diagonal Cartesian stiffness matrix. The stiffness model can be used to predict the reaction forces arising from part misalignment and the task forces during the execution of micro tasks, such as micromanufacturing and microassembly. The determination of the forces is also useful for many applications such as designing micro fixtures and micro end effectors sustainable to task forces.",

        "abstract": "A planning method for linear object manipulation including knotting/raveling in the three-dimensional space is proposed. Firstly, topological states of a linear object are represented as finite permutations of crossing points including the crossing type of each crossing point. Secondly, transitions among the topological states are defined. They correspond to operations that change the number of crossing points or crossing point permutation. Then, we can generate possible sequences of crossing state transitions, that is, possible manipulation processes from an initial state to a given objective state. Thirdly, a method for determination of grasping points and their moving direction is proposed in order to realize derived manipulation processes. Furthermore, criteria for evaluation of manipulation processes are introduced in order to reduce the candidates of manipulation plans. Finally, it is demonstrated that our developed system based on the above method can generate manipulation plans for raveling from an overhand knot.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the results and implications of our experimental study into the parameter identification and the position error modelling of a Motoman SK 120 robot manipulator for kinematic calibration. The true values of the parameters and the coefficients of the error model are estimated, in the least-squares sense, from the position data of 85 identification configurations of the manipulator measured by a high precision laser tracking system. The proposed error model is utilised to calculate the expected position errors for an exemplary Cartesian space trajectory. These errors are then corrected using a first order approximation of the inverse kinematic model. The results prove that the established model is accurate enough to represent position error of the manipulator without needing further experimental position data. This work contributes to previously published work from the point of view of being a simple and systematic approach to the self-calibration of robotics systems with minimum experimental data.",

This data structure offers a robust framework for robot navigation, avoiding the need of a complete geometric map or explicit localization, by building a minimal representation based entirely on critical events in online sensor measurements made by the robot. There are two sensing requirements for the robot: it must detect when it is close to the walls, to perform wall-following reliably, and it must be able to detect discontinuities in depth information. It is also assumed that the robot is able to drop, detect and recover a marker. The navigation paths generated are optimal up to the homotopy class to which the paths belong, even though no distance information is measured.",

In reality-based modeling, we are interested in modeling tissues as accurately as possible by determining the mechanical properties experimentally and developing a predictive model that is self consistent with the experimentally-determined properties. In this paper, we present the newly developed hardware and software to characterize the mechanical response of pig liver during (ex-vivo) cutting. The macroscopic cutting force-displacement curve shows repeating self-similar units of localized linear loading followed by sudden unloading. The sudden unloading coincides with onset of localized crack growth. This experimental data was used to determine the self-consistent local effective Young's modulus of the specimens to be used in finite element models. Results from plane-stress and plane-strain finite element analyses reveal that the magnitude of the self-consistent local effective Young's modulus varies within close bounds.",

Partial slip is important information for precision grip of humans, because the human controls grasping force by detecting expansion of the partial slip area. Therefore, a device that displays partial slip will make it easier for remote controlled mechanical hands to grasp objects, irrespective of the friction coefficient between the mechanical hand and object. To design the device displaying partial slip, we analyzed the deformation of a finger when in contact with a rigid plate using a finite element model. We also analyzed the deformation of the finger section model when in contact with the device that displays partial slip. As a result of the analyses, it is confirmed that there is a possibility in displaying partial slip using a tactile display device, which stimulates the finger through deformation of an elastic body.",

In some applications, including security and military, a user might command a mobile robot in the field using a wearable computer. The wearable computer may have a small display that would make information delivery difficult. Also, full video feedback from the robot may not be available due to radio bandwidth limitations. One solution is to have the user interact with a virtual model of the robot environment (available from other sources). We designed an interface to interact with such a model, using a small display. The user controls the robot by gesturing with a single hand. The gestures are sensed using an instrumented glove and a 6 DOF (degree of freedom) magnetic tracker mounted on the user's hand. The interface was tested using two different tasks: a 6 DOF manipulation task and a visualization task which was primarily 3 DOF. For comparison, a simple, 2 DOF input device was also implemented. It was found that the 6 DOF input device was clearly superior for the manipulation task, but results were inconclusive for the visualization task.",

We report on methods and experiments interpreting speech and laser scanner signals in the spoken dialogue management system of the autonomous tour-guide robot RoboX, successfully deployed at the Swiss National Exhibition (Expo.02). A correct interpretation of a user's (visitor's) goal or intention at each dialogue state is a key issue for successful speech-based interaction in voice-enabled communication between robots and visitors. We introduce a Bayesian network approach for combining noisy speech recognition results with noise-independent data from a laser scanner, in order to infer the visitors' goal under the uncertainty intrinsic to these two modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by simulation based on real observations during experiments with the tour-guide robot RoboX at Expo.02.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a performance measure, the actuation efficiency, which describes the imbalance between the end-effector accelerations achievable in different directions of non-redundant robotic manipulators. A key feature of the proposed measure is that in its development the unitary differences between linear and angular accelerations are treated in a physically meaningful manner. The measure also indicates oversized actuators, since this contributes to the imbalance in achievable accelerations. The development of this measure is based on the formulation of the Dynamic Capability Hypersurface. The shape of this hypersurface is a weak indicator of the level of imbalance in achievable end-effector accelerations.",

As an example, in this research, we are developing a system for browsing books from remote places through the Internet with a robot. In order to do browsing operations, the robot has to recognize the alignment state of a bookshelf itself and to pick up a book correctly. This paper also describes the developed sensor for recognizing the posture of a book and the plan for extractional operation in the environment of a general library. In addition, we conducted experiments by the developed system, and summarize the consideration about this system.",

There are already commercial systems available for clinical use which, however, still have some limitations and drawbacks. Most of them can only be applied in a very narrow application range and it is not possible to use them in less or minimal invasive surgery because they need large incisions for a rigid bone fixation to avoid patient movements. This paper presents a new modular surgical assistant system. The surgical robot, which is one part of the system, is position controlled by a navigation system to detect and compensate small patient movements automatically. By this approach optimal tool position can be maintained ail the time during the surgery without additional rigid bone or patient fixation. A modular tool system and an open modular software architecture facilitates an easy adjustment to support various surgical procedures especially in less invasive surgery.",

The PRP system attempts to decrease programming time by predicting the waypoints of a robot program based on previous examples of user behavior.

Accuracy in vehicle localization can be obtained in realtime from a RTK GPS sensor. Several control laws, relying on this sensor, have been previously designed and provide satisfactory results as long as vehicles do not slide. However, sliding has to occur in agricultural tasks (sloping fields, curves on a wet land, ...). The challenge addressed in this paper is to preserve vehicle guidance accuracy in such situations. A nonlinear adaptive control law is here designed. Simulation results and field experiments, demonstrating the capabilities of that control scheme, are reported and discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a network system and an algorithm for a rescue robot to obtain its position under collapsed area. The network system consists of communication tags put dynamically by the rescue robot in its rescue activities. According to the temporary tags, the system constructs temporary communication infrastructure and obtains geometrical information of the area. In particular, to get the position of the rescue robot, our algorithm employs \"angle\" obtained from Omni-directional Sensor mounted on the communication tag. The use of the \"angle\" information leads a significant decrease in the error in estimating tags' location. In this paper, the feasibility of our system and algorithm is confirmed with the simulation.",

With the expanding space activities, more and more space systems have become essential elements providing services of telecommunication, Earth observation and navigation to support our daily lives. With the expanding space activities, more and more satellites are being injected into wrong orbits for their missions and stranded due to failures of rockets. There is a potential need to rescue them by capturing and towing them to the appropriate orbits. Manipulator capture using visual servoing is one of the most promising ways to capture a stranded satellite that does not have a special mechanical interface or a visual marker on it. A study is now being conducted to design a manipulator-based capturing system, taking into account the special aspects of space such as lighting and available computing power. The first results of an experimental study are presented with an explanation of the experimental system in this paper.",

The robot device is designed as a 3 DOF mechanism supporting the subject under the buttocks. The device is driven by an electrohydraulic servosystem capable to operate in a position or in force control mode. The evaluation of the standing-up assistive device was accomplished in rising trials of a paraplegic subject. In the experiments the position control approach was employed. The results proved that the device can be efficiently used for training and evaluation of standing-up maneuver. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed which generates the reference value of the man/machine interaction force to be tracked by the robot force controller. The simulation results proved an adequate and robust performance. In this manner, the novel robot device can be utilized in the \"robot driven\" or the \"patient driven\" standing-up training.",

Both frictional and frictionless cases are considered. This algorithm starts to search a form-closure grasp front a random grasp using an efficient local search procedure until encountering a local minimum. The local procedure is based on the powerful ray-shooting technique and searches in the direction of reducing the distance between the convex hull corresponding to the grasp and the origin of the wrench space. When the distance reaches a local minimum value, the algorithm decomposes the problem into sub-problems according to the existence conditions of form-closure grasps. A search tree whose root represents the original problem is employed to guide the searching process. The sub-problems are represented as children of the root node and the same procedure is recursively applied to the children. Theoretical analysis has been conducted on completeness and computational complexity of the algorithm. The efficiency of this algorithm is demonstrated by numerical examples.",

This is difficult because (1) needle insertion causes soft tissues to displace and deform, and (2) it is often difficult or impossible to obtain precise imaging data during insertion. We are developing a sensorless planning system for needle insertion that incorporates numerical optimization with a soft tissue simulation based on a dynamic FEM formulation that models the effects of needle tip and frictional forces using a 2D mesh. In this paper we describe a sensorless planning algorithm for radioactive seed implantation that computes needle insertion offsets that compensate for tissue deformations. We apply the method to seed implantation during permanent seed prostate brachytherapy to minimize seed placement error in simulation without relying on real-time imaging.",

        "abstract": "Wheel chair bound persons need assistance since there are many steps or curbs or other obstacles blocking their path in the roadways and walkways. Therefore, we are proposing a power assist wheel chair robot, which enables a wheel chair bound person to climb over steps of up to about 10 centimeters in height without assistance. By using the proposed wheel chair robot, a user can maintain inverse pendulum control after raising its front wheels. Then, a user can move forward to the step maintaining the inverse pendulum control, and can climb over the step using the DC motor force of rear wheel shafts. We have presented previously the front wheel raising scheme using rear wheel shaft movement. The inverse pendulum control has been conducted successfully. However, a rider on the robotic wheel chair felt a small shock since the front wheels were raised quickly. A new front wheel raising and lowering scheme is proposed in order to raise and lower the front wheels gently. The proposed scheme uses the rider's seat movement. The raising speed could be slowed down about 20 times, and the overshoot could be decreased about 5 times.",

To enhance the speech quality, a novel adaptive beamformer composed of a delay-and-sum beamformer, adaptive blocking filters (ABFs) and adaptive cancelling filters (ACFs) is proposed. While the adaptive generalized sidelobe canceller (AGSC) connects the ABF and the ACF in feedforward, the proposed adaptive beamformer has them in feedback. The advantages of the proposed structure are the robustness to the steering vector errors and cross-talks and the reduced number of filter taps that gives the same speech quality compared to the AGSC with a larger number of filter taps. The experimental results show that the proposed structure is superior to the AGSC in objective and subjective evaluations. Speech recognition result shows that the proposed robust adaptive beamformer guarantees the recognition performance even in a low SNR and highly reverberant environment.",

The approach consists of solving a series of subproblems where each part in the stack is pushing the parts ahead of it. The solutions to these subproblems are sets of stable motions, and their intersection is the set of stable motions for the entire stack. The motion of multiple parts depends on the exact locations of the centers of mass and the relative masses of the parts. If either or both of these is unknown, it is still possible to calculate a conservative set of motions guaranteed to be stable by using a center of mass uncertainty region.",

        "abstract": "Achieving adequate force control is an important problem in the application of robotics technology to manufacturing tasks. One approach to this problem is the use of passive compliance. A number of methods have been proposed for designing a passive compliance mechanism with a prescribed spatial stiffness or compliance matrix using a parallel or serial connection of elastic devices. If the spatial stiffness or compliance matrix is isotropic, the constituent elastic devices are simple in the sense that they are strictly translational or rotational. Non-isotropic stiffness and compliance matrices require the use of elastic screw devices that couple translation and rotation. These screw devices are of a more complicated nature than the simple elastic devices that are sufficient for the isotropic case. In this article the authors demonstrate how these screw devices can be eliminated by using a hybrid connection of parallel and serial configurations consisting of only simple elastic devices. This method can be used to achieve any prescribed non-isotropic stiffness or compliance matrix.",

In this paper, a wearable stimulation device that can produce various distributed stimuli on human skin in response to hand movements was developed using ICPF (Ionic Conducting Polymer gel Film) actuators. Characteristics of touch feel of roughness were measured using vibratory stimulation. The results showed that the threshold amplitude under active touch were smaller than under passive touch. A stimulation method which generate selective stimuli to sense receptors in accordance with velocities and accelerations of hand motions was proposed. It was confirmed experimentally that some kinds of pattern of driving waves express touch feels in response to hand movements.",

These arenas allow direct comparison of robotic approaches, objective performance evaluation, and can ultimately provide a proving ground for field-able robotic systems such as those used at the World Trade Center collapse. International robot competitions using these arenas require robots to negotiate complex and collapsed structures, find simulated victims, and generate human readable maps of the environment. A performance metric is presented which quantifies several pertinent robot capabilities and produces an overall score used to evaluate and compare robotic implementations. Future directions for the arenas and the competitions are also discussed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Haptic interaction with a virtual object establishes a kinesthetic sensation to the user. It is well accepted that to better perceive a given virtual object, it is relevant to yield some surface properties of the object, for instance the shape through the normal contact force, the roughness by the sliding friction, and the texture as a combination of both of them. On this problem, force control is the key issue. This problem has been highlighted three decades ago, when there was not available any good haptic display. Since then, a number of methods on force feedback have been proposed to convey these features, wherein the main scheme is based on the penalty method. However, when the object is deformable, the penalty method cannot compute properly the shape and roughness since the contact force ignores the inherent deformation of the object. In contrast, if the contact force is computed using the constrained Lagrangian, this force depends on the dynamic deformation of the object. In this paper, a constrained Lagrangian-based oriented framework is proposed to compute the contact force dynamically, in such a way that it can easily realize these effects over implicit dynamical objects. This powerful scheme can produce these effects seamlessly. Experimental results using PHANTOM on deformable and undeformable virtual objects are presented and discussed.",

To realize this mission, it is important to map environment information, and also the mapping requires localization simultaneously. (This is called \"SLAM problem\".) In this research, we use three-dimensional map by laser range finder, and we also estimate its location in a global map using correlation technique.

The kinematic configuration and joint stiffness values of the grasper were varied in order to maximize grasper workspace for a wide range of target object size. The results show a near-optimal result around the spring-rest angles of 25 and 45 degrees for the base and intermediate joints, respectively, when the joint stiffness ratio (base/intermediate) was small.",

This paper presents the design of a novel tracking controller for a mobile robot by integrating the neural dynamics model into a conventional feedback controller. The proposed controller is capable of generating real-time smooth velocities, and driving the mobile robot to track desired trajectories. It resolves the speed jump problem existing in some previous tracking controllers. Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the control system and the convergence of tracking errors to zero. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by simulation and comparison studies.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous driving system can assist to prevent the traffic accidents caused by the negligence of the driver. Obstacle detection and warning mechanism plays an important role in this research field. In this paper, we adopt the computer vision technology because of its large detecting range and abundant information when compared to other kinds of sensors. The proposed system is suitable for both the simplified environment such as freeway and the urban environment with complex background. Thus, the result here improves traffic safety not only for drivers, but also for all pedestrians on the road.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel design of indoor airship having a passive wheeled mechanism and its stationary position control. This wheeled blimp can work both on the ground using wheeled vehicle part and in the air using the floating capability of the blimp part. The wheeled blimp stands on the floor keeping its balance using a caster-like passive wheel mechanism. In tele-guidance application, stationary position control is required to make the wheeled blimp naturally communicate with people in standing phase since the stationary blimp system responds sensitively to air flow even in indoor environments. To control the desired stationary position, a computed torque control method is adopted. By performing a controller design through dynamic analysis, the control characteristics of the wheeled blimp system have been found and finally the stable control system has been successfully developed. The effectiveness of the controller is verified by experiment for the real wheeled blimp system.",

        "abstract": "Many applications have used a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), such as in virtual and mixed realities, and tele-presence. The advantage of HMD systems is the ease of feeling a 3D world in the display of animation or movies. However, the field of view (FOV) of commercial HMD systems is too narrow for feeling immersion. The horizontal FOV of many commercial HMDs is around 60 degrees, significantly narrower than that of humans. In this paper, we propose a super wide field of view catadioptrical head-mounted display consisting of an ellipsoidal and a hyperboloidal curved mirror. The horizontal FOV of the proposed HMD is 180 degrees and includes the peripheral view of humans. It increases reality and immersion of users. As well, the central region (60 degrees) of the FOV can measure 3D distances using stereoscopics.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute and visualize the workspace of a multifingered robotic hand manipulating an object in the planar case. Based on optimization models, our approach is numerical, in which the kinematic feasibility of a grasp at a given position is determined first, and then the range of rotation at this position is computed. The algorithm and its effectiveness are illustrated by examples. It is possible to extend our approach to the spatial case.",
