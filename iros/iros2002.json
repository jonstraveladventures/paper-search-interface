        "abstract": "This paper describes a bilateral force reflecting teleoperation system to wipe a floor surface in a remote manner. This teleoperation system consists of three subsystems - a two degree-of-freedom(dof) master manipulator, a two dof slave manipulator, and a real-time control system. The human operator performs a series of floor wiping tasks controlling the slave manipulator through the master manipulator. A position-force control algorithm is proposed to control the slave manipulator's movement, and the contact force occurring between the end-effector of the slave manipulator and the floor surface during wiping. Experiments are performed for evaluating the performance of the developed teleoperation system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we compare many kinds of randomized algorithms and simultaneously inspect their data to calibrate an impulse force between two rigid bodies. One is an object handled by a manipulator tip, and another is an object fixed in a 3-D environment. A real impulse is obtained from an experiment via a six degrees-of-freedom force/moment sensor mounted on a tip of a seven degrees-of-freedom manipulator. As contrasted with this, a virtual impulse is quickly calculated in our impulse model. It consists of two classic models. One is Hertz's contact force model and another is Coulomb's friction force model. Each of extended randomized algorithms always minimizes the difference between real and virtual forces in order to get a better impulse model. In general, the randomized algorithm works well if and only if a set of correspondences between practical (true) and virtual (false) forces has high quality. Therefore, we carefully evaluate the correspondences and eliminate a few bad ones. Since our impulse model is not so complicated, it can be well calibrated from a few but good correspondences.",

        "abstract": "A distributed and cooperative fault-clearing strategy for a team of object lifting robots is introduced It is assumed that one of the robots misses a portion of its lifting power and the robots must redistribute the load among themselves to perform their task. Two distributed and cooperative methods for the load reallocation among the position-controlled robots without requiring them to change their grasp positions are introduced. The first method benefits from the existing redundancy in the number and in the lifting power of the robots. In the second method, the object is tilted in order to move the ZMP (Zero Moment Point) away from the faulty robot and, consequently, redistributing the load. Difficulties in controlling ZMP movements are pointed out. Therefore, the second fault clearing procedure is designed such that the ZMP position is controlled without resorting to sophisticated or centralized control algorithms. The stability of the proposed methods is discussed. Simulation results are given to support the developed methods.",

In this framework, a controller consists of constraint solving components distributed in a network of embedded processors. Constraint solvers are goal oriented deliberative agents that can be used as control regulators or as information retrievers. The framework is built on the attribute/service model (ASM), a middleware for coordinating actuators, sensors and tasks in distributed real-time embedded systems. The communications and coordination among the services are realized via shared attributes. Examples of controlling a modular self-reconfigurable robot are illustrated in the paper.",

        "abstract": "A parallel robot, due to its closed-loop structure, normally has two Jacobian matrices: the inverse and forward Jacobian matrices. Conventional methods for singularity analysis of planar parallel robots are based on analysis of the ranks of the two Jacobian matrices. The inverse singularity has been well studied as the inverse Jacobian matrix always has a simple diagonal form. However, the forward singularity analysis is somehow complicated, partially because some essential geometric relations may be occulted in the formulation of the forward Jacobian matrix. This paper focuses on the forward singularity analysis of a class of 3-RRR planar parallel robots with various actuation schemes. A simple geometric approach based on the concept of instantaneous center is proposed. By analyzing the instantaneous mobility of the moving platform when all the active joints are locked, the necessary and sufficient geometrical conditions for the forward singularity configurations are readily identified. It has been shown that this simple geometrical approach can be employed for singularity analysis of various planar parallel robots and mechanisms.",

The potential field method is one of the main approaches to path planning, and the use of harmonic functions allows the definition of potential fields without local minima and with the ability to be incrementally updated. Constrained motion planning copes with the planning of motions in cluttered environments with low clearances and high uncertainties. The robust, adaptive and reactive behavior of the harmonic functions approach suits the requirements of constrained motion planning.

In our previous works, we developed a compact 6-DOF haptic interface as a master device which achieved an effective manual teleoperation. The haptic interface contains a modified Delta parallel-link positioning mechanism. Parallel mechanism is usually characterized by a high stiffness, however, it is reduced by elastic deformations of both parts and bearings. Therefore, to study such a parallel mechanism, we analyzed stiffness in a parallel mechanism, including elastic deformation of both parts and bearings. Key points of our method are a modeling of bearings, a modeling of a elasticity coefficient of a passive axis in a bearing and a modeling of a parallel mechanism. Finally, we show that our stiffness analysis method of a parallel mechanism is high reliability and precision.",

        "abstract": "Autonomy is a key enabling factor in the advancement of robotics for remote exploration. As the level of resources devoted to this effort continues to increase, it has become equally important to provide simulation tools and environments to scientists in which to test the autonomy algorithms. While industrial robotics benefits from a variety of high quality simulation tools, researchers developing autonomy software are still dependent primarily on block-world simulations. The Mission Simulation Facility (MSF) project addresses this shortcoming by providing a simulation toolkit that will enable developers of autonomous control systems to test their Systems' performance against integrated, standardized simulations of NASA mission scenarios. The MSF provides a distributed architecture that connects the autonomous system to a set of simulated components replacing the robot hardware and its environment.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for a very simple architecture of an induction-motor (IM) servo drive using only one single neuron (SN) as an online self-tuning artificial neural network (ANN). The action of this controller is similar to an adaptive PI-controller. The adaptation of the proposed controller is achieved by self-tuning for both weight and bias of the SN. Also, using an adaptive learning rate insures adaptation to overcome uncertainty and nonlinearity of the plant. Based on an indirect field-oriented vector control algorithm, the ANN speed tracking controller is developed and integrated with the adaptive hysteresis current-controlled pulse-width modulation (PWM) inverter to offer a high performance IM-drive. The complete drive system is implemented in a real time using a digital signal processor (DSP) controller board DS1102 on a laboratory 1-hp IM. Using the experimental rig, the performance of the proposed drive is evaluated under various speed trajectories. The test results validate the efficacy of the proposed simple controller for precise speed and position tracking of IM drive. Furthermore, the use of SN makes the drive system robust, accurate, and insensitive to parameter variations. Also, the controller contributes towards time consumption reduction through the real-time DSP control algorithm.",

Firstly we discuss the essence of dynamic walking using a passive walker on a gentle slope. In the second, we propose a simple and effective control law which imitates the energy behavior in every cycle considering the ZMP condition and other factors of the active walker. The control strategy is formed by the feature of mechanical energy dissipation and restoration. By the effect of the proposed method, the robot can exhibit natural and reasonable walk on a level ground without any gait design in advance. The validity of the proposed method is examined by numerical simulations and experiments.",

Then, once the task is defined, it can be easily executed over the real scenario (running online). To get its main goal (i.e. task specification) working in real life scenarios, the system incorporates automatic object recognition and visually-guided grasping among others capabilities.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of tracking multiple targets using a network of communicating robots and stationary sensors. We introduce a region-based approach which controls robot deployment at two levels. A coarse deployment controller distributes robots across regions using a topological map and density estimates, and a target-following controller attempts to maximize the number of tracked targets within a region. A behavior-based system is presented implementing the region-based approach. Intensive simulations were performed to investigate the correlation between our approach and the degree of occlusion in the environment. The region-based approach shows better performance than a 'naive' local-following strategy when the environment has significant occlusion. We performed real-robot experiments to validate the system. These experiments open up a new line of research, which suggests that an optimal ratio of robots to stationary sensors may exist for a given environment with certain occlusion characteristics.",

In this paper, we describe a software framework for distributed telerobotic systems exploiting advanced CORBA features, including Asynchronous Method Invocation and real-time priorities. The framework allows development of portable multithreaded client-server applications supporting concurrent and preemptable actions in the target robot system, and has been evaluated in a laboratory setup including a robot manipulator and two cameras accessible by multiple clients.",

There is a need to define, from the software point of view, a generic robot. The Orocos project was started to address this problem. It aims at developing a set of robotics software in particular domains and, as a first step, will define a software framework to do that. This paper presents the future evolutions of G/sup en/oM (component generator) which we propose as a programming framework in the context of the project. G/sup en/oM proposes the definition of generic components that are used to implement robotics functionalities (vision, control, motion planning, ...), and the paper presents the definition of those components. They have been designed so that they can be connected together and externally controlled to form a modular functional layer on robots. We have defined three main entities of which components are made: a set of algorithms, an execution engine, and a communication library. The paper explains their role and presents a formal description language that let us achieves a real decoupling between code of the components (the algorithms) and the execution engine.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a biped robot named TOKAI ROBO-HABILIS 1. It has some particular mechanisms in the joints, by which it moves with the combination of active driving by the DC motors and passive rotation of the joints, called active/passive hybrid walking. It is essentially the identical way of walking to those of human. As a result, it walks with a subsequently small energy consumption compared to any conventional biped walking robots that walk with driving all of joints actively by actuators. This paper describes at first the mechanisms of TOKAI ROBO-HABILIS 1. Its computer simulation shows the control strategy and the energy consumption for various walking patterns. It follows to show the walking experiments.",

The resulting robotic system is composed of an anthropomorphic arm/hand system and visual and tactile sensors. Grasp planning, control and learning have been achieved by a neural approach, inspired by a model of the inter-connections among the brain areas involved in grasping, as formulated by neurophysiologists. After a description of objectives and specifications for the robotic platform, the system is illustrated and experimental results are reported. Finally, the results are discussed as a starting point for current activities, involving the development of novel human-like robotic components and the implementation of more sophisticated learning schemes.",

These experiments have been inspired by neuroscience research on real rats. In spite of the enormous potential of whiskers, they have to date not been systematically investigated and exploited by roboticists. Although the transduction mechanism is simple and straightforward, and the whiskers are currently used in a passive way only, the dynamics of the sensory signals resulting from the interaction with various textured surfaces is complex and has a rich information content. The experiments provide the foundation for future work including active sensing, whisker arrays, and cross-modal integration.",

Knee stretching posture contributed to the former in general and a search algorithm based on the computer simulation enabled to find a feasible control to the given task.",

A number of powerful collision detection algorithms are currently available to the research community although their relative capabilities and performance cannot be easily compared due to the many factors involved. We have experimentally evaluated collision detection packages within the context of motion planning for rigid and articulated robots in 3D workspaces. Artificial and realistic problems have been chosen as benchmarks to assess package behavior with different object models. Reported experimental results should help the user in choosing the appropriate collision detection package. In this paper we also present the framework we exploited in our planner to allow pluggable distance computation functions and keep the code simple and easy to maintain.",

Firstly, general considerations on the cable-actuated structures and their application potential are provided and then the Dexter structure peculiarities are accurately analyzed in order to develop proper control solutions. Starting from the analysis of the limitations of the compliance control schemes in Cartesian space and in joint space, previously implemented and experimentally validated on the Dexter arm, a novel control strategy, named impedance-compliance controller, is developed. The proposed control strategy tries to combine the benefits of a compliance control scheme in Cartesian space with the benefits of an impedance control scheme in the operational space by compensating the dynamics of the sole proximal joints. The impedance-compliance controller is capable to achieve accurate smooth motions while guaranteeing functional control of the whole structure, even though a greater computational complexity is required The last section of the paper, dedicated to the experimental results, points out the differences with the previously experimented control solutions anti provides some proofs of the increased Dexter functionality.",

Unlike previous volumetric approaches, we also find a virtual contact point on the surface in order to derive a penalty force that is consistent with the real geometry of the object, without introducing force discontinuity. We also demonstrate that other surface properties such as friction and texture can be added elegantly. The resulting technique is fast (a constant 1000 Hz refresh rate) and can handle large geometry models on low-end computers.",

The algorithm deploys robots one-at-a-time, with each robot making use of information gathered by the previous robots to determine the next deployment location. The deployment pattern is designed to maximize the area covered by the robots' sensors, while simultaneously ensuring that the robots maintain line-of-sight contact with one another This paper describes the basic algorithm and presents results obtained from a series of experiments conducted using both real and simulated robots.",

In this paper, feedback model-based compensation of friction is used for servomechanism set point and tracking tasks. Basic friction models are tested and their influence on system response is examined using describing function analysis. Analytical predictions are compared to simulations and experimental results. Various control laws using friction compensation are compared experimentally. Results showed that for both types of tasks, the best response is obtained by a model-based control law with friction compensation using the general kinetic friction model.",

        "abstract": "Tactile array displays provide the Human Operator (HO) of a telepresence or Virtual Environment (VE) system with detailed tactile shape information on his/her fingertips. In previous work, an ideal specification profile for tactile array displays has been derived from human physiology and the biomechanics of human touch. Existing hardware developments still have tremendous shortcomings compared to such a specification profile. However, evaluation strategies have too often neglected the specificity of the particular application: in many application classes tactile display quality is mainly characterized by a subset of specification parameters, while other parameters play a rather subsidiary role. This paper suggests an application-specific evaluation approach associating the display quality of certain scenario properties under certain task conditions with corresponding hardware specification parameters. Results can help to design future tactile actuator arrays providing application-optimized display performance. The evaluation approach is exemplified by an experimental investigation of the spatial pin resolution of tactile array displays. Experiments were based on four separate tactile actuator systems driven in eight different resolution configurations.",

ZMP is mostly used as standard evaluation of stability of humanoid robot, and balance control is conducted by controlling ZMP position so that it is always in convex hull of the foot-support area. To simplify the design of controller, it is mainly used as one mass inverted pendulum model which represents lower body of humanoid robot model. However this model causes system to become non-minimum phase and performance limitation of the system occurrs, because of the presence of Waterbed effect in frequency domain and unavoidable undershoot in time domain. This paper proposes ZMP feedback control using two masses inverted pendulum model which represents lower and upper body of humanoid robot and creates minimum phase system. The design of the controller based on the proposed model using linear quadratic by considering output is described and confirmed using simulation.",

        "abstract": "Behaviour coordination is a notorious problem in mobile robotics. Behaviours are either in competition or collaborating to achieve the goals of a system, which leads to requirements for arbitration and/or fusion of control signals. In most systems the arbitration is specified in terms of \"events\" that denote positions or sensory input. The detection of these events allows discrete switching between groups of behaviours. In contrast, the fusion of behaviours is often achieved using potential fields, fuzzy rules, or superposition. In most cases, the underlying theoretical foundation is rather weak and the behaviour switching results in discrete changes in the overall system dynamics. In this paper, we present a scheme for behaviour coordination that is grounded in the dynamical systems approach. The methodology provides a solid theoretical basis for analysis and design of a behaviour coordination framework. This framework is demonstrated in the context of a domestic robot for fetch-and-carry type tasks. It is here shown that behaviour coordination can be analyzed as an integral part of the design to facilitate smooth transition and fusion between behaviours.",

Standard probabilistic roadmap methods (PRM) have been successfully used to answer such feasibility problems. These methods provide, at the most a single solution but do not provide a complete overview of the possible motions which have to be evaluated in a complete engineering task. We focus here on the open question of building probabilistic roadmaps which can provide an exhaustive list of all the solutions which can not be distorted from one to another while staying collision free. We call such roadmaps homotopy preserving probabilistic roadmap (HPPR). We propose a new algorithm for creating HPPR.",

Currently, bi-ped walking humanoid robots are designed manually on trial-and-error basis. Thus, engineers have to design control program for apriori designed morphology, neither of them shown to be optimal within a large design space. We propose evolutionary approach that co-evolves the morphology and controller. Two steps of co-evolutions were achieved in a precision dynamics simulator. One is for obtaining the optimal lengths of links using simple multi-link model and the other is for obtaining the optimal geometry of servomotor which is often used for radio control car. Finally, unexpected optimal solutions were discovered. This indicates that a complex design task of biped humanoid can be performed automatically using evolution-based approach, thus varieties of humanoid robots can be designed in speedy manner.",

An H/sub /spl infin// framework is used for the slow subsystem controller design, instead of robust PID synthesis introduced in the literature. Linear identification techniques are used to represent the nonlinear dynamics of the system into a linear model plus multiplicative uncertainty. An H/sub /spl infin// controller is designed in the framework of composite control, in order to optimize the required control effort, along with satisfying robust stability and desirable performance. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is compared with other methods through a simulation study. The comparison results show a significant improvement in control effort, while satisfying both stability and performance requirements.",

The robot plans the next sensing action to maximally reduce the expected C-space entropy, also called the maximal expected entropy reduction, or MER criterion. The expected C-space entropy computation, however, made two idealized assumptions. The first was that the sensor field of view (FOV) is a point; and the second was that no visibility (or occlusion) constraints are taken into account, i.e., as if the obstacles are transparent. We extend the expected C-space entropy formulation where the sensor FOV is a beam and furthermore, it is subject to visibility constraints, as is the case with real range sensors. Planar simulations show that this new formulation results in more efficient exploration.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we calibrate Mirtich's approach (1996) for computing a collision impulse by two kinds of randomized algorithms, and then apply the model for an air hockey game. Mirtich proposed a smart dynamic simulation called impulse-based simulation. He considers twin goals of physical accuracy and computational efficiency. The simulation can accurately model complex dynamic system in real-time. However, whether his impulse-based model is reasonable or not has not been investigated at all by any experimental result. For example, his impulse model requires the dynamic friction coefficient /spl mu//sub D/ and the coefficient e of restitution in advance. However, they strongly depend on shape and material of colliding objects. Because of noise and error of sensing, it is difficult for us to measure the parameters exactly. For this reason, in this paper, we calibrate these by using two kinds of randomized algorithms based on many reductions of momentums before and after the collision. Each momentum (multiplying mass and velocity) can be easily obtained by measuring relative linear velocities and angular velocities before and after the collision. They are practically and easily measured by a smart imaging of two objects. The air hockey game designed consists of two PC with two joysticks including force feedback, which are connecting each other by the fast Ethernet.",

The novel feature of the planner is that it uses a powerful local planner to produce highly connected roadmaps and path optimization to maintain the rapid query processing by a fast local operator. While most previous approaches obtain good roadmaps by advanced sampling methods, the presented approach concentrates on the method used to connect the samples. Empirical results show that the new approach outperforms the more traditional approach of using fast local planners in capability to produce roadmaps with only few connected components. Statistical analysis is used to identify features important for the efficiency of the local planners.",

First, an inverse model of the multi-DOF ultrasonic motor is developed using our prior knowledge in ultrasonic motors and neural network technique in order to deal with the redundancy and non-linearity of driving characteristics. Second, a novel control method using the inverse model is proposed. Then, motion control tests are conducted to confirm the ability of the proposed control method. The results confirm that the rotor can be rotated around arbitrary rotational axis using the inverse model, and that the proposed control method does work successfully.",

Each agent has one policy and one action value function: the former is for action execution based on the action value function updated in the previous stage, and the latter is for learning based on the episodes experienced by the current policy. This makes all agents behave based on the fixed policies, so that the non-Markovian problem can be avoided except for the update periods that depend on the learning progress of each agent. In order to avoid the local maxima due to such asynchronous renewal of action value functions, optimistic action values are given initially, which helps to avoid the exploration process being trapped in local maxima. The experimental results applied to one of the cooperative tasks in a dynamic, multiagent environment, RoboCup, is shown and a discussion is given.",

        "abstract": "High-speed assembly makes strict demands on path and trajectory planning systems. In such systems the stages of path planning, trajectory planning, and 'low-level' control are normally separated, which admits functional simplicity but may not produce the most useful trajectories. Our active motion planner merges these levels by building a low-level controller into a potential-field planning loop. The input to the planner is a coarse set of via-points; the planner incorporates a goal that moves between these via-points, as in our previous work. The active motion planner produces relatively smooth paths; furthermore, by adjusting the relative gains of the active force (i.e., internal controller) and potential field terms the planner is able to avoid many of the local minima traps that bedevil potential field techniques. The combined planner is illustrated using a (simulated) PUMA robot arm.",

These behaviors, called perceptual-motor primitives, serve as a substrate for linking a system's perception of human activities and the ability to perform those activities. We present a data-driven method for deriving perceptual-motor action and behavior primitives from human motion capture data. In order to find these primitives, we employ a spatio-temporal non-linear dimension reduction technique on a set of motion segments. From this transformation, motions representing the same action can be clustered and generalized. Further dimension reduction iterations are applied to derive extended-duration behaviors.",

Its mechanical structure consists of a rigid inverted T-shape mounted on four compliant feet. An upright \"T\" structure is connected to this by a rotary joint. The horizontal beam of the upright \"T\" is connected to the vertical beam by a second rotary joint. Using this two degree of freedom mechanical structure, with simple reactive control, the robot is able to perform hopping, walking and running gaits. During walking, it is experimentally shown that the robot can move in a straight line, reverse direction and control its turning radius. The results show that such a simple but versatile robot displays stable locomotion and can be viable for practical applications on uneven terrain.",

In general, various techniques for a bilateral master-slave type of remote control seem applicable to a remote sports system. This is basically true; but it is also true that there are special issues to be solved inherent in a remote sports system. For instance, players at different locations are masters and also slaves, so the relationship between them must be completely symmetrical. It is important to clarify what information players must communicate and how the environment of each side should be identified. As a part of this approach, we built a remote \"arm-wrestling\" system in our laboratory. In the present paper, we explain the prototype system and describe some experimental results for verifying whether or how techniques for many types of master-slave based remote control systems proposed so far are effective. We also suggest some future subjects toward a remote arm-wrestling system with a better and more realistic presence.",

We were able to simulate four sensations (the visual, auditory, cutaneous and olfactory sensations) of a human five senses by developing WE-3 (W_aseda E_ye No.3_) series since 1995. However, the robot system of WE-3 has become too complex and big from added improvements. Therefore, in 2002, we developed a new human-like head robot WE-4 (W_aseda E_ye No. 4_). We newly added a waist to WE-4, and realized emotional expression with not only the face, but also the upper-half part of the robot body. Also, WE-4 is smaller and lighter from revisions in mechanisms of the robot head In this paper we describe the mechanical features of the human-like head robot WE-4.",

The procedure reverses the standard stability analysis approach by searching for a control function to fit a pre-defined Lyapunov function. In order to improve the applicability of this procedure, a new second-order extension to Lyapunov's second method is proposed, allowing a stable schema to be defined directly in terms of actuator force demands. We propose a synthesis procedure called direct Lyapunov design, which searches for motor schema maps whose set points satisfy the second-order theorem. The procedure has been applied to a simple subsumption architecture controller for an inverted pendulum simulation, yielding stable behaviour.",

        "abstract": "Multiple impedance control (MIC) is an algorithm that enforces designated impedance on all cooperating manipulators, the manipulated object, and the moving base, if applied to a space (or mobile) robotic system. It has been shown that the MIC algorithm can also satisfy force-tracking requirements in object manipulation tasks. In this paper, the disturbance rejection characteristics of this algorithm applied to complicated space free-flying robotic systems is studied. The results of this analysis reveal that the effect of disturbances substantially reduces through appropriate tuning of the controller mass matrix gain. Using MAPLE and MATLAB tools, a system of three manipulators mounted on a space free-flyer with eight D.O.F. is simulated in which a Remote Center Compliance (RCC) is attached to the second end-effector, subjected to force and torque disturbances applied on several points. The simulation results reveal the merits of the MIC algorithm in terms of disturbance rejection characteristics, i.e. negligibly small errors in both position and force tracking in the presence of significant disturbances.",

For that, a multi-chain mechanical model of a human body and a general control architecture are proposed. The main originality lies in the use of ankle and hip strategies postural movement notion (physiological notion) to ensure the biped dynamic equilibrium. The principle is based on behavioral rules using limiting conditions and \"equilibrium classes\". This notion is introduced at the \"coordinator level\" of our architecture and called the AHS (Ankle and Hip Strategy). It contributes to maintain the equilibrium even in the presence of a rough perturbation acting on the minimization of the roll and pitch angles in function of the task constraints and choosing in real time the strategy to adopt. Finally, we illustrate the whole strategy through an hip strategy example related to the standing posture under perturbations.",

The approaches differ by the various assumptions about what can be perceived and communicated by the robots, the strategies used to make the robots move in formation, the ability to deal with obstacles and to switch formations. After suggesting criteria to characterize problems associated with robot formations, this paper presents a distributed approach based on directional visual perception and inter-robot communication. Using a pan camera head, sonar readings and wireless communication, we demonstrate that robots are not only able to move in formation, avoid obstacles and switch formations, but also initialize and determine by themselves their positions in the formation. Validation of our work is done in simulation and with Pioneer 2 robots.",

Individual robot has a specific range of signal communication to detect other robots. According to the information about the location of one or two robots detected by the signal communication within the range, the robot takes an action such as proceeding forward or turning left/right at each time step. Implementing this action selection algorithm to each of the robots, we carry out the computer simulation of global behaviors in the multiple robots system, and we find that there exists a certain condition under which the circle formation emerges in the multiple robots system. To investigate the effects of the robot population involved and the size of the simulation area on the characteristics of the circle formation, the computer simulation was made and it clarified that the emergence of the circle formation in the multiple robots system is strongly influenced by the robot population density rather than to the robot population and the simulation area size.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an investigation of three communication schemes which may be used in a distributed robotic system, two based on implicit forms of communication (mechanical interaction and vision) and one on an explicit form of communication (infrared signaling). To support the discussion, we have chosen a concrete case study concerned with locating and pulling sticks out of an arena floor, a task successfully achieved only through collaboration between two robots. Communication schemes, among other system features, heavily influence the rate of successful collaborations, the metric adopted to evaluate the performance of the robotic team. Results collected using an embodied simulator show that, as a function of the system constraints (e.g., number of robots, hardware and behavioral parameters,) solutions based on more complex individuals do not necessarily lead to an improved team performance. Although the stick pulling is a simple case study without any practical application, it presents all the main difficulties of designing and controlling scalable, distributed robotic systems, characterized by subtle, nested effects between individual and group behavior or hardware and software parameters. We believe that embodied simulations are a key level of implementation in helping us understand these subtle mechanisms, achieve further abstraction, and optimize the system before any real hardware solution is implemented.",

        "abstract": "Recently the activity of robots has been remarkable, and robots are branching out into general environment such as home or office. Although robots are active, planners uniquely decide the action method of robots when robots operate missions. Therefore, the most suitable approach is not assured. So, in this report we propose a method that we evaluate robots' actions from the viewpoint of both reliability and time, when robots operate missions. Then we calculate the most suitable approach for robots. To be concrete, by using a diagram we evaluate robots' actions and calculate the most suitable approach. In addition, we evaluate them not from all the actions immediately, but from the action units by making an evaluation index. So, we can shorten the time for evaluation. Finally, we realize the operations by a real robot with the most appropriate approach.",

In previous work, we explored general algorithms for locomotion and self-replication and their instantiations to systems in which modules move over the surface of the robot. In this work, we present several algorithms applied to the Crystal robot-two new distributed locomotion algorithms designed specifically for unit-compressible actuation, as well as the adaptation of a generic division algorithm to the Crystal. We also present the integration of a locomotion algorithm with a distributed goal recognition algorithm developed previously. This allows the robot to reconfigure and recognize the achievement of its goal, all without the use of a central controller. We have instantiated all of these algorithms on the Crystal hardware, and we present results of our experiments. These experiments empirically verify the utility of our distributed algorithms on a self-reconfiguring system.",

The decided guard positions can then be used as control points in the path of a mobile robot that autonomously inspects a workspace. It is assumed that each of the guards (or the mobile robot that visits the guard positions in some order) is equipped with a panoramic camera of 360 degrees field of view. However, the camera has limited visibility, in the sense that it can observe with sufficient detail objects that are not further than a predefined visibility range. The method seeks to efficiently produce solutions that contain the smaller possible number of guards. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally efficient and that, although suboptimal, decides a small number of guards.",

The incompletely restrained wire-suspended mechanism has a merit that it enables three dimensional positioning and orientating of suspended object with simple mechanism using a small number of wires. However it also has a drawback that the manipulated object is easy to swing as seen in overhead crane which is one of the simplest incompletely restrained mechanism. For this reason, anti-sway control method for incompletely restrained type mechanisms is needed. A key point of our method is exact linearization using inverse dynamics of the system. Feedback control method with exact linearization and measuring method for the suspended object are presented, and effectiveness of proposed methods are shown by an experiment.",

Through judicious choice of the sequence of individual control actions based on state feedback, we construct a control strategy that stabilizes the sphere to its desired configuration.

We have been studying on biped leg-wheeled system to realize flexible locomotion in our daily, life environment. This paper describes the design concept of the self- contained biped leg-wheeled system and its locomotion concept. The system has three locomotive modes - 4-wheeled locomotive mode, 2-wheeled locomotive mode, stair negotiation mode. In the first mode, it can travel quickly and steer like a car with its four wheels contacting the ground In the second mode, it can travel and steer like a wheeled inverted pendulum with two wheels contacting the ground In the stair negotiation mode, it can negotiate the stairs with front and rear wheels continuously in contact with the horizontal and vertical surfaces of stairs. In this mode torque control of both wheels while maintaining the posture of the system is the key to successful negotiation. The control scheme and method for stair negotiation, which can be applied generally to a leg-wheeled system, are introduced The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated by a successful experiment of the lift-up motion of the wheel using a biped leg-wheeled system developed in the authors' previous research.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, control schemes for haptic interface for micromanipulation systems is mainly discussed. We have proposed a tele-micromanipulation system, which enables human operators to operate micro tasks, such as assembly or manufacturing, without feeling stress. This paper focuses on the haptic sense, which gives the operators the feeling of presence. The mechanical instrument applied in the human interface device usually has a reasonable immanent friction. This friction must be compensated in a way that the operator should not feel this friction force but the force from the manipulated environment. The main contribution of this paper is a direct model based chattering free sliding mode friction estimator and compensator for a mechanical instrument. Experimental results are presented.",

This scheme combines the gain scheduled H/sub /spl infin// theory with LMI approach to design a continuous gain scheduled H/sub /spl infin// controller, which is applicable to systems with fast state variations so that the deficiency of the conventional gain scheduled controllers is overcome, with the use of Taylor series fitting. Fuzzy control is then incorporated so chat the designed controller possesses the characteristics of a fast response for large errors and a well-damped response for small errors. The system thus always has a good dynamic performance along with the variations of the system states. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller.",

In contrast to these approaches in which monolithic CPG circuits are employed to control locomotion, in this study a polymorphic neural circuit is employed instead, allowing the dynamic change of its properties according to the current situation in real time. To this end, the concept of neuromodulation has been introduced. To verify the feasibility of this approach, this concept has been applied to the control of a 3-D quadruped robot. Simulations have been carried out and the results have showed that the proposed method appropriately changes the walking pattern according to the current situation in real time.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of teleoperating a mobile robot using shared autonomy: an on-board controller performs obstacle avoidance while the operator uses the manipulandum of a haptic probe to designate the desired speed and rate of turn. Sensors on the robot are used to measure obstacle range information. We describe a strategy to convert such range information into forces, which are reflected to the operator's hand, via the haptic probe. This haptic information provides feedback to the operator in addition to imagery from a front-facing camera mounted on the mobile robot. Extensive experiments with a user population show that the added haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in several ways (reduced collisions, increased minimum distance between the robot and obstacles) without a significant increase in navigation time.",

One previously reported and two new (one adaptive and one non-adaptive) force scaling algorithms are reviewed. Extensive comparative experiments quantify the performance of all three algorithms and show that the new adaptive force scaling algorithm significantly outperforms both its non-adaptive counterpart as well as the previously reported set-point-regulator based force scaling algorithm over a wide range of user applied input force trajectories and force scale factors.",

However, Vanecek's method is linear in the number of faces in the object, which is unpractical for large models. This paper suggests to add some geometrical information to hierarchies of bounding volumes, typically used in collision detection, and perform conservative back-face culling at the bounding-volume level in constant time. The method described in this paper can be applied to complement any kind of bounding-volumes hierarchy and allows a trade-off between memory and speed. Preliminary experimental results suggest that the method allows a significant speed-up, especially in close proximity situations.",

This will lead to the development of a system for building dynamic walking robots. Assuming that a hopping module can be controlled by a spring and a DC motor, we placed a built-in learning system in the module that consists of reinforcement learning (RL) for identification and layered neural networks (NN) for generalization. By using this learning system, we simulated autonomous adjustment control in order to obtain the optimum DC motor angular velocity, which enables the module to hop to an arbitrary height. As a result, we can design a regulator that has the advantage of both RL and NN, and have laid the foundation for further developments to apply the algorithms of learning to practical walking robots.",

Most of the human motion in daily life, including a \"lift-up an object\" motion, is complex and the performance index are regarded to vary during the motion. Lift-up an object motion is generated by solving inverse kinematics. The experimentally measured trajectory of the hand is given and the rest of the degree of freedom is determined by optimizing a performance index that blends several sub-functions. The coefficients for each sub-function are identified through the motion generation simulation.",

To cope with extremely fast motions that arise in the environment, a visual system capable of perceiving the motion of several objects at 60 fields per second was developed. We have designed a suitable error recovery scheme for our vision system to ensure successful game playing over longer periods of time. To increase the learning rate of the robot it is given domain knowledge in the form of primitives. The robot learns how to perform primitives from data collected while observing a human. The robot control system and primitive use strategy are also explained.",

The human motion data is acquired from a motion capture system consisting of 8 cameras and 8 PC clusters. Then the whole motion sequence is divided into motion elements and clustered into groups according to the correlation of end-effector trajectories. We call these segments 'motion primitives'. New dance motions are generated by concatenating these motion primitives. We are also trying to make a humanoid dance these original or generated motions using inverse-kinematics and dynamic balancing techniques.",

Although free-joint manipulators under gravity are namely pendulum systems, there is difference that pendulums are controlled to the gravitational equilibriums and these free-joint manipulators are controlled to the other configuration. Dynamical behaviors under vibrational input to the first joint are analyzed via averaging analysis. It is clarified that dynamical stabilization onto a configuration other than the gravitational equilibriums can be realized using a kind of artificial potential produced by vibrational input against gravity. Passive impedance property is clarified for the dynamically stabilized systems to an external disturbance and an impedance force control method to attenuate desired impedance property is proposed.",

One such hexapod robot called Whegs I is described. Mechanisms in its design permit it to move over various terrains and climb over small obstacles in a manner similar to a cockroach. It uses one motor for propulsion and two small servos for steering. Its appendages, called whegs, consist of three evenly spaced spokes. Passive compliance in its axles permits its nominal tripod gait to adapt to irregular terrain and evolve to co-activation for climbing. Basic locomotion control is implemented in its, mechanical design. A benefit of this mechanical simplicity is that its control system is also simplified. Drawbacks to the simplifications include the inability to change the body's posture and decrease overhead clearance. Some of these problems will be addressed in future versions without compromising the basic design.",

In spite of its importance, still few studies have explicitly investigated this mutual interaction. In light of these facts, in this paper, the interaction between controllers and their embodiments is investigated. To do so, a synthetic approach is employed. More specifically, an embodiment performing a passive-dynamic-walking function is taken as a practical example, and its locomotion controller that can walk on flat terrain is evolved using a genetic algorithm. Simulations have been carried out and the results have showed that passive-dynamic-walking embodiments provide significantly high evolvability. This strongly suggests that \"appropriate\" embodiments allow us to increase the efficiency of developing their controllers.",

        "abstract": "We designed an inter-module cooperation architecture that enables the collaborative development of interactive robots. In the bazaar-like development model, each module is developed by an individual developer and the total system is developed by the cooperation of these developers. To realize smooth collaboration of these developers under bazaar-like model, inter-module cooperation architecture is required to avoid the confliction of modules and select the appropriate modules according to the situations and the tasks. For this aim, we introduce a priority based cooperation mechanism for modules. The priority for each module under the various situations is, described in a situated-priority description script (SPDS). Flexible module selection is realized by the modification of the SPDS under the various situations and the tasks. We also evaluate the efficiency of proposed architecture through the development of the multi-modal conversation robot.",

The robot system is constructed by attaching modules (e.g. camera or mobile mechanism) to objects or a working environment distributively. The attached modules achieve tasks through cooperation, after constructing the system. Assuming that the system is constructed in different environments depending on tasks, the system is not expected to have knowledge of environment for autonomous behaviors. According to this, we propose a simple interface with instructing tasks on multi displayed images of cameras which are attached in unknown wider working area. The main features of the interface are as follows: (1)Indication of over lapped view of cameras for support human recognition of working area, (2) Easy precise operation by pointing environmental features on captured images. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our interface and the whole robot system.",

Singularities are avoided through a damped least-squares formulation of the inverse kinematics problem. A direct approach for selecting the damping factor is proposed. The redundant degree of freedom (DOF) is used to keep the manipulator in the most manipulable position and within the joint limits. In addition, all the redundancy resolution is performed whilst feeding back information to the operator who can help to improve the performance and robustness of the whole system.",

The kinematics equations presented in this paper allow a general geometrical formation of mobile robots to be maintained while the group as a whole travels an arbitrary path. It is possible to represent a formation of mobile robots by a single entity with the same type of nonholonomic constraint as the individual members. Thus, any path-planner or control method may be used with the formation as would be applied to an individual robot. Equations are developed for changing the geometrical formation and hardware results are presented from the Stanford MARS Testbed.",

        "abstract": "Force and torque induced by motions of a mobile manipulator affect dynamically the objects being carried. If the induced inertia force and torque are bigger than the static friction force and torque, the carrying objects start slipping on the mobile manipulator. As the result, the movement of one carrying object may cause the collapse of all carrying objects, since the start of slipping makes the acceleration of the mobile robot increase, interferes with accurate traveling operations and is dangerous. The final purpose of this research is to propose a navigation controller for the mobile manipulator that prevents the carrying objects from slipping. As a first step, we propose a model of an n-link Power Wheeled Steering (PWS) mobile manipulator including the slipping motion of many carrying objects. Using the proposed model, the dynamical influences of slipping are analyzed and the model is justified through several simulations.",

A computationally simple class of task space regulators consisting of a transpose Jacobian controller plus an integral term including a function of task space position error, is proposed. These regulators require very little information regarding the robot dynamic equations or the payload and ensure (based on the Lyapunov stability theory) that the task space position error is asymptotically convergent. The performance of the proposed control strategy is illustrated through computer simulation for a direct-drive arm of a SCARA type manipulator.",

By comparison, existing techniques optimize high-level plans, but fail to optimize the low-level motion controls. We use policy search in a high dimensional control space to find plans that lead. to measurably better motion planning. Our experimental results suggest that our approach leads to superior robot motion than many existing techniques.",

To model the potential (magnetic) field by Maxwell's Equations that completely eliminate the local minima problem, which is exhibited in most artificial potential methods, such as Harmonic functions based methods. However, the proposed model is superior to the Harmonic one because it is easily extendable to 3D, the time dimension is modeled by default which means it is a suitable model for time-varying environments, computations are less and hence faster, and most important it eliminates the \"flat-regions\" problem. In this work, electrical currents are assumed to be floating in a cluttered environment with obstacles. The obstacles are assigned zero conductivity whereas the goal point is assigned the highest electrical conductivity. The magnetic field induced by the electric currents is used to find a free path between the start and goal points. Simulation results reflects the validity and the potential of the proposed model.",

Effective coordination of these swarms requires development of control strategies based on emergent behavior. We have developed a rule-based, decentralized control algorithm that relies on constrained randomized behavior and respects UAV restrictions on sensors, computation, and flight envelope. To demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have created a simulation of an air vehicle swarm searching for and mapping a chemical cloud within a patrolled region. We then consider several different detection and mapping strategies based on emergent behavior. We then establish an inverse linear relation between the size of the swarm and the time to detect the cloud, regardless of the size of the cloud. Further, we also show the size of the swarm has a linear relation with the successful detection of the cloud.",

        "abstract": "A novel control methodology for master-slave systems using passive force feedback has been proposed by the authors. The methodology solves the conventional problems of previously developed master-slave systems with force feedback, such as oscillations, complex structures and complicated control algorithm. In the present paper a multi-fingered exoskeleton haptic device (master hand) with passive force feedback function is developed. First, the exoskeleton master hand with three fingers (12 degrees of freedom) is designed and implemented. Each finger of the master hand consists of a link mechanism with elastic-shaft joints and clutches. Using link mechanisms, the master hand measures fingertip positions and angles of index finger middle finger and thumb. Furthermore, it also enables passive force feedback to an operator by the same link mechanism used for the geometric measurements. Then, a virtual reality system of human hand is constructed using the master hand and the control methodology. Using the system, sensory evaluations are conducted on human subjects to confirm the usability of the developed master hand and the possibility of the control methodology in the virtual reality system. As a result, the subjects possibly recognize the stiffness of the objects in the virtual environment.",

Our prior work has dealt with a pair of robots that estimate one another's position using visual tracking and coordinated motion. Here we extend these results and consider a richer set of sensing and motion options. In particular, we focus on issues related to confidence estimation for groups of more than two robots.",

In the microgravity environment, hopping mobility is a possible choice for enhancing a new mobility of the robot. The proposed robot can hop and land without bounding in the microgravity environment using the spring mechanism. Furthermore, at the moment of hopping, the wheels are pressed to the ground, so the rover can obtain the horizontal velocity by rotating the wheels. The wheels are also used for the attitude control in the air. The simulation of hopping with horizontal velocity is performed and the equation of kinematics of the rover is developed.",

The proposed technique is able to lead a stratified system along a restricted class of reference trajectories while the earlier approach aimed only to reach a final state without influencing the trajectory. The suitable class of reference trajectories is still restricted because they should go through a sequence of connected integral submanifolds. A highly oscillatory sequence (HOS) of inputs is built in the method to produce a sequence of trajectories converging to the reference trajectory. The major benefit of the new concept in comparison with the conventional approach emerges when obstacle avoidance is required in the configuration space. The method is demonstrated on a simple model of a hexapod robot.",

Instead of simply receiving data at a single point, we actively give perturbations to the system and measure the response from the system. Correlating the input and the output, we can formulate the correlation function and useful information to guide the mobile robot such as gradient can be obtained from this function. This algorithm is applied to the obstacle avoidance in mobile robot navigation and the experimental results are provided.",

The gait-transition time is reduced by carefully designing the foot position of the crawl gait and the rotation gait while limiting the feet in rectangular reachable motion ranges.

        "abstract": "A methodology for computing the maximum velocity profile for a planned trajectory of the robot is described in this paper. The profile is computed considering the robot and environment dynamics as well as the constraints of the sensing apparatus. The mobile objects can be arbitrary in number and their direction and velocity of motion is not known. The only known information about the moving objects is the maximum velocity they can possess. The robot that moves with the computed velocity profile can assure from its side that it would not collide onto any of the numerous moving objects that could intercept its future trajectory. The methodology has been incorporated onto a motion planner for a nonholonomous robot and the results presented. The motivation here is to facilitate the process of having safe and understanding robots. Hence the planned velocity profiles are in general conservative though the robot could perhaps do better on-line. However at planning time the robot's immobility before collision is guaranteed.",

A fast motion pattern generation technique that follows the desired ZMP is adopted. In order to satisfy the control input given online, subsequent motion patterns are updated and connected in a stable manner to the old ones while executing. During the creation of motion trajectories online, the commanded motion parameters are checked and modified automatically considering the performance limitations of the hardware. As an example application, we have implemented a one step cycle control system on the Humanoid H7. Experiments controlling the upper body motion and walking direction using a joystick interface are explained to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Multirobot coordination, if made efficient and robust, promises high impact on automation. The challenge is to enable robots to work together in an intelligent manner to execute a global task. The market approach has had considerable success in the multirobot coordination domain. This paper investigates the effects of introducing opportunistic optimization with leaders to enhance market-based multirobot coordination. Leaders are able to optimize within subgroups of robots by collecting information about their tasks and status, and re-allocating the tasks within the subgroup in a more profitable manner. The presented work considers the effects of a leader optimizing a single subgroup, and some effects of multiple leaders optimizing overlapping subgroups. The implementations were tested on a variation of the distributed traveling salesman problem. Presented results show that global costs can be reduced, and hence task allocation can be improved, utilizing leaders.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the ever increasing demand for higher performance and lower cost, there have been growing efforts to conduct mechanical and control system designs concurrently rather than sequentially. Indeed, the area of mechatronics has sprung forth largely motivated by the desire to consider the mechanical control system design as an integrated process rather than disjointed pieces. In this paper, we present a case study of the optimal mechanical design of a rotary inverted pendulum by incorporating the control objectives involving disturbance tolerance and domain of attraction. These objectives are converted to two related metrics, controllability and unstable pole location of the open-loop system, which can be computed efficiently and do not depend on the chosen control algorithm. Since the optimization is multi-objective, and does not possess a unique optimum, a family of Pareto designs is generated. The original objectives in terms of disturbance rejection and domain of attraction are then evaluated in simulation and experimentation along the Pareto optimal solutions to provide the quantitative trade-offs of different designs.",

In the latter case, the potential is calculated on partial versions of the map represented on an occupancy grid, and it indicates safe paths towards the unexplored regions. Here, we show that exploration based on potentials functions calculated from boundary value problems works fairly well in sparse environments provided that we no longer use harmonic potentials. We propose different families of potentials that improve the exploration process in this kind of environment, while keeping the important property of not having dynamical local minima.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an observer-based adaptive control scheme for robot manipulators, for which we have both unmeasured velocity and uncertain parameters. Using the observer backstepping method, a reduced-order adaptive velocity observer can be designed independently from the state-feedback controller, which uses damping terms to compensate the presence of the estimation error in the tracking error dynamics. The resulting closed-loop system is semiglobally asymptotically stable with respect to the estimation error and tracking errors. Furthermore a simulated example shows the performance of the control scheme applied to a two-link manipulator.",

The effects of design parameters of the controller on the closed loop response are investigated.

        "abstract": "Biped robots have specific dynamical constraints and stability problems which reduce significantly their motion range. In these conditions, motion planning used for mobile robots cannot be applied to biped robots. In this paper, the path planning problem is seen as finding a sequence of footholds in a 3D environment, keeping robot stability, motion continuity and working within the structural constraints of the biped. The designed path planner contains two parts : The first one determines a reference path which maximises success rate in view of biped capabilities. This reference track is computed by the well know A* search in the graphs algorithm. The second part of the path planner is a path tracking algorithm which makes the robot follow the reference track. Simulation results concern the anthropomorphic 15 degrees of freedom robot BIP2000.",

We make use of Pascals's Principle and volume conservation as boundary conditions to obtain a static solution due to an externally applied pressure. We believe that the state of such an object is a result from effects of the surface tension (generally in any direction) and the pressure of the internal fluid (normal to the surface). By allowing such liberty, large deformations such as stretching, bending and twisting can be simulated without much change to the initial formulation of the physical model.

This endeavor complements our efforts in developing manipulation planning algorithms. Indeed, we are convinced that a higher level of problems complexity, and particularly those involving multiple robots and multiple objects, will be accessible thanks to the introduction of a symbolic reasoning level. The resolution scheme relies on probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs) and on a reasoning level that adaptively controls the construction and extension of a number of roadmaps. We consider this symbolic level as a step towards a systematic approach to integrate task planning and geometric planning in better conditions than through a gross, and somewhat, artificial hierarchical decomposition. This paper describes the main ingredients of the proposed framework, and its first results.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a tactile feel display of virtual reality for subtle fine touch of clothes. The device developed using soft high polymer gel actuators could express subtle differences of touch of clothes, especially rough materials such as a towel and denim. Considering the superiority of vision in the multimodal sensational perception, a virtual tactile feel display integrated with visual information which express more real touch of cloth was proposed. In order to evaluate the influence of visual information adding to the tactile feel quantitatively, a factor analysis was performed using adjective pair scales. Factor analysis applied to the real materials showed that the roughness factor is highly correlated with the visual sensation although the softness factor is relatively independent from image information. The same analysis applied to the artificial tactile feel showed more complex results. It was confirmed that vision could help the recognition of tactile feel only when the characteristics of the material was expressed well by visual information although could also mislead tactile perception when visual information was not appropriate. The superiority of visual information was also evaluated by applying wrong visual information different from the artificial tactile feels.",

First, based on the dynamics of this nonlinear hybrid system, we derive a simple control law to ensure the total energy preservation and continuation. Simulation results show that the robot can hop from the wide set of initial conditions. The generated hopping gaits are found to be quasi-periodic orbits, which can be seen in some Hamiltonian systems. Next, we propose a simple parameter adaptation law to asymptotically stabilize the quasi-periodic gaits to the periodic gaits of arbitrary period, and spring stiffness adaptation law to minimize control inputs. Simulation results show that the robot eventually hops without any control inputs, especially for 1-periodic gait. We believe that the controllers we invented have much potential for energy-efficient control of legged running robot.",

Previous robotics simulators were limited to verify dynamic motions such as walking, or to plan or learn in a simple environment. However, our system is able to simulate vision based behavior, i.e. motion and perception behavior, of a robot as a whole, since it can simulate both dynamics and collisions in the environment. We regard the real-time aspect of the simulation as important so that so that users can develop vision based behavior rapidly and efficiently. We employ a Common Interface API to share behavior software between real and virtual robots. Moreover, visual processing functions such as color extraction and depth map generation are available. As a result, vision based behavior consisting of local map generation, planning and navigation of the humanoid in simulation is presented. We also show that software developed in the simulation environment is applicable to real robots.",

In this paper, a novel biologically inspired neural network approach is proposed for complete coverage path planning with obstacle avoidance of a cleaning robot in a nonstationary environment. The dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley's (1952) membrane equation. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. Thus the computational complexity linearly depends on the neural network size. The proposed model algorithm is computationally efficient, and can also deal with changing environment. Simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of planning collision-free complete coverage robot path.",

This is the problem of planning a path through a continuous domain Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are a recently developed representation on which fast continuous domain path planners can be based. In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.",

The derivation of desired velocity signals which feed a vehicle's speed controller and conform to the velocity and acceleration limits of the vehicle is presented. A safe operating area, for the individual wheels of a vehicle is derived in acceleration-velocity space. A trajectory planner which produces correct displacement, velocity and acceleration, profiles as a function of time is derived. These trajectories drive the vehicle to its target, while always keeping within the defined safe operating acceleration-velocity limits.",

It does so by defining a Gauss frame on the surfaces of both objects in the points that are closest to each other. Then it describes how the Gauss frames move as the objects move relative to each other. This is called the contact kinematics. The contact kinematics detect when two objects touch, then describe how they roll and slide over and along each other, and then detect when they get loose again. With the contact kinematics a dynamic screw bondgraph model is built. This dynamics model is verified in two simulations. The first simulation shows two objects of nontrivial curvature, eggs, rolling over each other. The second shows a robotic hand manipulating an object.",

        "abstract": "Ingyu Park et al. (2001) investigated an unmanned bicycle system but did not consider the lateral motion of mass. In this paper, we derive a simple kinematic and dynamic formulation of an unmanned electric bicycle with load mass balance system which, plays important role in stabilization. We propose a control algorithm for the self stabilization of unmanned bicycle by using nonlinear control based on the sliding patch and stuck phenomena. In deriving the above control algorithm, we assume that the load mass is located in the middle of the mass balance system. We then propose a control strategy to turn the bicycle system left or right by moving the center of load mass left and right respectively. In the computer simulations, we adopt a low pass filter for the real implementation of the proposed control law which bring. about the chattering problem. From the computer simulation results, we can show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",

We are concerned here with the specifications of a range sensor specifically design for the task. Such sensor has special requirements: it has to guarantee detection and response, and it has to guarantee throughput, providing information ail a rate in proportion to robot velocity. An analysis is presented which allows the selection of the sensor requirements for collision avoidance tasks in mobile robots. The design takes into account robot dynamics, it is compatible with fast motion-only the indispensable environment zones are explored-and avoids unnecessary velocity reductions. Experiments show the possibilities and limitations of the approach.",

Together with the task frame formalism (TFF), it forms the basis to easily model, implement and execute robotic tasks in an uncalibrated workspace, using traded, hybrid or shared vision/force control. This paper emphasizes shared control in which both vision and force simultaneously control a given task frame direction. Our work shows the usefulness and feasibility of a range of tasks using shared control. Moreover, it offers a framework based on the TFF to distinguish between different (and partly new) forms of shared control. Each basic form is illustrated by a robotic task with shared control in one direction. In addition, an extension to classify multi-dimensional shared control tasks is presented. As shown by the experimental results, the tasks at hand benefit from the shared control approach.",

        "abstract": "To operate over a long period of time, autonomous mobile robots must have the capability of recharging themselves whenever necessary. In addition to be able to find and connect to a power source, robots must also consider taking actions to preserve and share energy in an environment where energy is a limited resource. Coordination is then required to ensure the survival of the group and the accomplishment of the robots' tasks. This paper explores these issues by allowing robots to predict and reason about their energetic capabilities, as individuals and as a group. The approach described allows robots to determine when to recharge, when to change their activity level and how long they should recharge. Validation of the work is done in simulation to demonstrate the versatility of the approach for different numbers of robots and power sources. Experiments with Pioneer 2 robots are also reported.",

        "abstract": "How do multiple robots self-organize into global patterns based on local communications and interactions? This paper describes a theoretical and simulation model called \"Digital Hormone Model\" (DHM) for such a self-organization task. The model is inspired by two facts: complex biological patterns are results of self-organization of homogenous cells regulated by hormone-like chemical signals, and distributed controls can enable self-reconfigurable robots to performance locomotion and reconfiguration. The DHM is an integration and generalization of reaction-diffusion model and stochastic cellular automata. The movements of robots (or cells) in DHM are computed not by the Turing's differential equations, nor the Metropolis rule, but by stochastic rules that are based on the concentration of hormones in the neighboring space. Experimental results have shown that this model can produce results that match and predict the actual findings in the biological experiments of feather bud formation among uniform skin cells. Furthermore, an extension of this model may be directly applicable to self-organization in multirobot systems using simulated hormone-like signals.",

The model of N-axis flexible joint manipulators is derived and reformulated in the form of singular perturbations, and the integral manifold is used to separate fast dynamics from slow dynamics. A composite control algorithm is proposed for the flexible joint robots, which consists of two main parts. Fast control, u/sub f/, which guarantees that the fast dynamics remains asymptotically stable, and the corresponding integral manifold remains invariant. Slow control, u/sub s/, itself consists of a robust PID design based on the rigid model, and a corrective term designed based on the reduced flexible model. The stability of the overall closed loop system is proved to be UUB stable, by Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control law is verified through simulations. It is shown that the proposed control law ensures robust stability and performance, despite the modeling uncertainties.",

This concept generalises human/humanoid body motion as successive transitions of \"envelopes\", where body dynamics is exploited and high level control input is adopted only at the \"nodes\", where the body is unstable and control input is necessary. Dynamical rising is chosen for our experiment and full body motion is measured. By evaluating the coordination between joint angles, we have seen variation of motion and corresponding envelope volume (stable region within the phase space). Also, by analysis in the phase space (including variables both of positions and their time derivatives), we have seen variations not only according to boundary conditions for the motion (i.e., adopting physical restriction) but also according to experience. Our results suggest that the body dynamics have rich complexity in phase space. Within an envelope, small nodes may exist to give variation and controllability without damaging stability.",

        "abstract": "To carry out a stable haptic interaction with a dynamic virtual environment containing several moving and/or deformable bodies is challenging. To achieve this, we present a collision detection algorithm based on a segmentation of the space with a regular voxel grid. Interpenetration is quickly estimated using a sphere decomposition of the bodies. Thereafter, we use the voxel grid as a still image of the environment to provide a fast intermediate model that computes the force feedback. It thus enables to simulate the environment at a slow rate (10-100 Hz) while controlling the haptic device at the required frequency (about 1 kHz).",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with a neural network adaptive controller designed for constrained redundant robot manipulators. The controller has been determined using extended cartesian space to ensure minimum joint positions of the robot and to take into account mechanical constraints like joint limitations. The proposed approach guarantees a good minimization of any performance criterion, subject to either equality or inequality constraints while achieving the end-effector task. It verifies the repeatability property for closed or cyclic trajectories and avoids the computation of the inverse or pseudoinverse Jacobian extended matrix. Several neural networks are used to approximate separately the elements of the dynamical model of the robot manipulator written in cartesian space. Adaptation laws are derived for each network to ensure stability of the closed loop system. Simulations results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed controller.",

Currently, the RTTs (roundtrip time or we can call it delay) are mostly treated as given conditions in application level. In this paper, after a statistical analysis of the huge RTT time series collected densely in a few continuous days using some linear and nonlinear methods, it is found that the RTT time series has a rather high degree of linear correlation between observations. It could be inferred that there is no high nonlinear dependence among observations. Thus, RTT is linearly predictable. We use the MEP (maximum entropy principle) method developed to predict next RTT value (one step ahead) and the results confirm our findings.",

It is assumed that all of the joints of the manipulator are capable of regulating their joint stiffness mechanically, not by the software feedback using force/torque information. The particular mechanism for regulating the joint stiffness, called the NonLinear Elastic Module (NLEM) is introduced on the antagonistically driven joint system. A new formula for controlling the stiffness ellipsoid of the end-point is derived Although the shape of the stiffness ellipsoid is essentially determined by the configuration of the joints and the posture of the manipulator, the computer simulation demonstrates the volume and the shape of the stiffness ellipsoid can be substantially regulated by using the proposed formula. Next, the optimal posture of the redundant manipulator suited for an associated task is investigated from the viewpoint of the stiffness ellipsoid An anthropomorphic type seven DOF manipulator is taken as a simulation model.",

This kind of manipulator system may restrict the direction of the end-effector's force depending on which joints are set to passive ones. In the case of operating and transferring a common object, this restriction may give a less effective force and excessive internal force to the object. To use driving force effectively, the question of which joints are set to passive ones must be considered. Therefore, we show the effect of the joint configurations by case studies.",

Using QLPV model data several local TS linear models were identified using recursively the subtractive clustering method with specified error criteria. The identified TS local models resulted in a family of LTI models, which are equivalent to the linearised QLPV models. The T-S blended model synthesis resulted in a close approximation to the non-linear model dynamics.",

The research is motivated by previous work focusing on representation and reasoning methods for modeling modular robotics systems. We look specifically at self-configuring networked robotic agents. The proposed model combines the notions of a task factory that generate task modules and a pool of modules representing robotics components such as sensors and effectors. A number of successively more complex scenarios are used to illustrate the concepts. These have been implemented and tested experimentally. The paper describes the experimental implementation.",

We have developed a \"teaching by demonstration in VR\" system that automatically generates a robot program to work in the red world after a task is demonstrated by an operator in the virtual world. This system generates a program that detects each contact state extracted from demonstration in VR and produces it by skillful motion primitives. We find that some types of motion that are included in the recorded motion given by a human operator in the VR in teaching stage cannot be realized in the execution stage if the robot tries to do the same task by using the human demonstration data even on a contact state level. In this paper, based an our observation that a human has the skill wherein contact state transitions are made non-deterministically, we propose a method of dealing with one of the important non-deterministic motions, \"non-deterministic search type motion\" Experimental results show the feasibility of the method.",

We focus on the role of the human spine and muscle-driven system. By having a flexible spine, a humanoid will have safety and many degrees of freedom to realize a variety of postures. By driving joints by tension-controllable tendons, flexibility of the joints can be controlled. We developed a whole-body tendon-driven flexible-spine humanoid named \"Kenta\". This paper describes the design and control of Kenta, focusing on the design of the spine. The spine consists of ten joints, vertebrae and rubber disks, ribs, and forty muscles equipped with tension sensors. We also propose control methods of the spine. One uses a geometric virtual robot model and another is based on direct teaching. Using these methods, some whole-body motions are presented.",

Two different strategies are adopted for the optimization: the quadratic programming method and the PD control.

The actuator relocation is related to the location where the actuator is mounted, and the actuated joint and transmission ratio of actuators with gears. The actuators can be located far from the joint they control if an appropriate transmission such as a pulley, gear and linkage is used, which is general in industrial serial robots. Since parallel robots consist of several serial legs, it is necessary to study the effect on the J/sub q/ and J/sub x/ when the actuator in each leg of the parallel robot is mounted remotely and the actuation joint is driven through a transmission. First, we describe the effect of both transmission ratios and actuator location on Jacobian isotropy and singularity. We illustrate the effect of actuator relocation on kinematic isotropy performance with examples. This actuator relocation can be used to optimize the kinematic performance of parallel robots.",

        "abstract": "Although extensive work about robot path planning has been carried out, there is still a need for fast, practical and general-purpose motion planners. New applications of robots, outside the known and fixed environment of a factory, will increase the need for such planners. In these situations it will be necessary to cope with very variable and complex environments and with direct human interaction. A new approach for n-degree-of-freedom robot motion planning, based on the concept of visibility tetrahedra and the use of genetic algorithms combined with local search methods, is presented in this paper. The proposed approach has been successfully tested over several selected experiments, obtaining fast planning even for complex situations.",

        "abstract": "Substantial progress has been made recently towards designing, building and test-flying remotely piloted Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) and small UAVs. We seek to complement this progress in overcoming the aerodynamic obstacles to flight at very small scales with a vision-guided flight stability and autonomy system, based on a robust horizon detection algorithm. In this paper, we first motivate the use of computer vision for MAV autonomy, arguing that given current sensor technology, vision may be the only practical approach to the problem. We then describe our statistical vision-based horizon detection algorithm, which has been demonstrated at 30 Hz with over 99.9% correct horizon identification. Next, we develop robust schemes for the detection of extreme MAV attitudes, where no horizon is visible, and for the detection of horizon estimation errors, due to external factors such as video transmission noise. Finally, we discuss our feedback controller for self-stabilized flight, and report results on vision-based autonomous flights of duration exceeding ten minutes.",

Humanoid robots are physically similar to humans and usually possess a large number of degrees of freedom. By using hints from the shifting of the focus of attention for body motions between the joints of the human body during task executions, we propose a switching command based teleoperation system in which the operator selects only the necessary point of the humanoid robot's body for manipulation. In this paper, we present the implementation of this switching command based teleoperation system and experimental results using this system to teleoperate the humanoid robot HRP-1S developed in the Humanoid Robotics Project of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.",

        "abstract": "Since humanoid robots have a number of degrees-of-freedom in general, a pattern-based approach of the motion control reduces its difficulty. It is necessary, however, to absorb and compensate disturbances in order to maintain the stability of robots in the real world. We developed a balancing method for humanoid robots with a little modification of predesigned motion trajectories. The method proposed has an advantage that it is allowed to choose any combination of joints as modified properties, so that it has enough flexibility, being applicable for various types of robots and motions. It consists of two phases; in the first phase, the referential COG displacement is decided in accordance with both the short-term and the long-term absorption of disturbances. And in the second phase, the COG is manipulated with the whole-body cooperation, using the COG Jacobian. We verified the validity of the method with some simulations.",
