We propose a new method called \"support value\" to solve correspondence problems. Geometric constraints are added to reduce the ambiguities in stereo matching. Left/right consistency check is used to increase the confidence for matching results. Post-processing helps remove the outliers and make original dense disparity map smooth and reliable. The three-dimensional characteristics can be reconstructed by perspective projection. Finally, the 3D image reconstruction algorithm is successfully applied to a micro manipulation system for cell image reconstruction by a simpler and more friendly way.",

        "abstract": "In minimal-invasive surgery surgeons are generally confronted with complex scenario and sometimes they have to overcome unexpected pathologies or life-threatening injuries. Therefore there is a demand for realistic training without risk to the patient. Since a decade ago there have been research activities on virtual reality surgery simulators with haptic feedback with the goal to provide an alternative to traditional training methods on animals or cadavers. Haptic feedback is a key feature for every surgery simulator for the training of hand-eye coordination. In this paper a 4-dof haptic device is presented for hysteroscopy, the examination and treatment of the uterine cavity through the vagina. Specifications are presented, and kinematics as well as force transmission are analyzed. The realized prototype, result of a systematic design process, is based on a 2-dof spherical manipulator with low inertia and a 2-dof serial extension, which allows the use of slightly adapted original instruments. With difference to common surgery simulators tool insertion and complete removal can be performed. The performance of the prototype is shortly discussed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we compare two major structures of MSD (mass-spring-damper) particle models. One is the lattice (hexahedral) structure, and the other is the truss (tetrahedral) structure. They (especially, the truss structure) have been frequently used for representing elastic and/or visco-elastic object. The MSD model efficiently calculates shape deformation of the above materials. In addition, in order to maintain shape precision of each deformation, we carefully calibrate coefficients of damper and spring of Voigt part and a coefficient of damper of the other part in the basic MSD element under many surface points capturing a real rheologic object. A genetic algorithm is used for probabilistic calibration. After the comparison, we get the following properties: (1) the lattice structure has too many elements for calculating force propagation. Therefore, it precisely leads shape deformation with the help of the local (feedforward) volume constant condition. (2) The truss structure does not have enough elements for propagating internal forces, therefore, in order to keep a reasonable volume by expanding its virtual rheology object, we need the global (feedback) volume constant condition. (3) The global condition is time consuming, but can directly control the total volume of virtual rheology object. On the other hand, the local one is quick, but directly expands only a part (voxel) of the virtual object. Therefore, the volume and shape in the lattice structure with the local condition are better than those in the truss structure including the global one. (4) The number of MSD elements in the lattice structure is about two times larger than that in the truss one. Therefore, the former calculation is about two times slower than the latter one. As contrasted with this, the global volume constant condition is strictly two times or slower than the local one. As a result, calculation time of the lattice structure with the local condition is smaller than that of the truss s... Show More",

Gesture recognition algorithm uses a combination of gesture contour geometry and a non-dimensional quantity derived using the contour curvatures. The gestures are identified in a position and orientation independent manner. The developed gesture recognition system is implemented on a wheelchair. Two different modes of operations, namely, the manual mode and the autonomous mode are provided for the user. In manual mode the user continuously interacts with the wheelchair. In autonomous mode the user action is limited to choosing a desired destination by pointing to a zone of a known map displayed on the back-lit surface. Results are presented to show the performance of the wheelchair in both modes.",

The end version prototype will operate with bare hand/finger interaction to serve virtual reality applications, psychological and psychophysics studies on haptic perception, and computer haptics including combined texture/kinesthetic rendering algorithms. The proposed concept is an alternative design that brings together different actuation technologies in order to replicate, with high-fidelity, haptic sensation. Other potentials, such as the possibility to blend the haptic and the visualization spaces, are also demonstrated by this concept.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a new mechanical birth simulator (BirthSIM). Currently available birth simulators provide manikins that include new-born head and maternal pelvis but they do not produce the movements of the new-born in the mother's pelvis. Furthermore available maternal pelvis do not include interface pressure and are not enough realistic to simulate maternal pelvic muscles. In summary, these simulators do not help students to practice the gestures they should safely use to help the new-born in normal and at-risk situations of delivery. The originality of our mechanical birth simulator, is to provide a system to mimic the last step of the instrumental delivery, to insure a safe training of junior obstetricians and to test new techniques in obstetrics practice. The new mechanical birth simulator is composed of three parts: a physical new-born head and a maternal pelvis manikin, an interface pressure system, and a pneumatic actuator that develops an active resistance. Driven by a computer, the simulator can simulate the contractions, the interface pressure applied in the new-born head and mimic birth complications.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) challenges the surgeon's skills due to his separation from the operation area, which can be reached with long instruments only. Therefore, the surgeon loses access to the manipulation forces inside the patient. This reduces his dexterity when performing the operation. A new compact and lightweight robot for MIS is presented which allows for the measurement of manipulation forces. The main advantage of this concept is that no miniaturized force sensor has to be integrated into surgical instruments and inserted into the patient. Rather, outside the patient a standard sensor is attached to a modified trocar, which allows for the undisturbed measurement of manipulation forces. This approach reduces costs and sterilizability demands. Results of first force control experiments are presented to show the feasibility of the concepts.",

We consider that sensors may interact with each other only to maintain the network topology. Because transmitting sensoring data over the network to a remote base is a very power consuming operation, we deploy mobile robots through the sensor field in order to collect such information. We present a multi-target, dynamical, potential field strategy where a robot is attracted to the sensors that have less remaining data storage capacity. Moreover, the robot is also attracted to other sensors in its path without compromising its principal mission. Our controllers guarantee the robot will never get stuck in undesirable local minima. Simulated examples with a single robot collecting data in a sensor field illustrate the elegancy of the methodology.",

        "abstract": "In order to enhance dexterity of a robot hand, it is said that the robot should be designed to have a redundant number of degrees-of-freedom(D.O.F.). However, in redundant robotic systems, the inverse kinematics from task-description space to joint space becomes ill-posed. Therefore the problem of determination of joint motions becomes difficult. In order to avoid this ill-posedness, many methods have been proposed, most of which introduce an additional input term calculated from minimization of some intentionally introduced artificial index of performance. This paper treats a 4-D.O.F. redundant handwriting robot by using a novel and simple control method and resolving the problem of such ill-posedness based on sensory feedback in task-coordinates. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated through computer simulation and a preliminary experiment.",

The purpose of this paper is to analyze which level of gravity is optimum for each mechanism, and which mechanism or parameter is optimum for each level of gravity. First, a classification of locomotion mechanism is described. Next, the speed of hopping and wheeled robots is compared. Finally, some simulation studies are performed to analyze the detailed mobility of wheeled robots.",

        "abstract": "The robot technology (RT), along with rapid growth of information technology (IT), are being developed as the next generation of future technology. Current robots require advanced technology, such as soft computing, human-friendly interface, interaction technique, speech recognition, object recognition etc. unlike the industrial robots of the past. Most recently, cellular phone (CP) has been one of the most important technologies in the IT field, and it is situated in a position of great importance industrially and economically. To produce the best CP in the world, a new technological concept and its advanced implementation technique is required, due to the extreme level of competition in the world market. Therefore, this paper develops new technological concepts such as the robotic cellular phone (RCP) in which a synergy effect can be generated by merging RT and IT. RCP, CP having personal robot services, will be an intermediate hi-tech personal machine between one CP a person and one robot a person generations. RCP infra consists of RCP/sup Mobility/, RCP/sup Interaction/, RCP/sup Integration/ technologies. For RCP/sup Mobility/, human-friendly motion automation and personal service with walking and arming ability are developed. RCP/sup Interaction/ ability is achieved by modeling an emotion-generating engine and RCP/sup Integration/ that in miniature integrates the robotic modules into CP is developed with application service programs. By joining intelligent algorithms and CP communication network with the three base modules, a RCP system is constructed. This paper presents the definition, the basic theory and experiment results of the RCP sub-technologies. We confirm a good performance of the RCP through the results.",

        "abstract": "Transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is a common treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, the damage to the mucous membrane of the urethra leads to the complications. This paper reports a tubular organ resection manipulator for transurethral resection of the prostate which can minimize damage to the mucous membrane of the urethra using a prostate displacement mechanism and a continuous perfusion-resection mechanism. The manipulator has an arm, a cutter and a drill at the endeffector, and has 4 degrees-of-freedom: bending the arm, translating the cutter, rotating the drill and rotating the endeffector. The arm displaces the prostate, and the cutter is inserted linearly into the prostate and removes enlarged tissue by drilling. Combination of the arm and cutter enables the manipulator to remove sufficient volume of enlarged prostate through small incision on the urethra, thus minimizing the damage to the urethra. After finishing one plane cutting, the manipulator rotates its body and removes another part of the prostate gland. In performance experiments, each mechanism (bending motion, insertion, and body rotation) had high repeatability within 1.0 degree and within 0.1 mm. In phantom study, the manipulator could displace gelatin model accurately with sufficient power, and could reach and remove wide range of sample tissue (589.2 mm/sup 2/ in one procedure). These results showed that the manipulator can displace the prostate and remove sufficient volume of the prostate tissue through a small incision on the urethra.",

For this purpose a novel controller algorithm, two graphical user interfaces for teaching and simulating purposes are developed. A 3 DOF haptic display that is developed in our laboratory is used for force feedback. Several user tests are performed to validate how the developed MTS helps for skill improvement. The effects of adding acoustic feedback and the advantages of using a 3 DOF haptic display instead of 1 DOF are investigated.

The tactile sensors are embedded on the soles of a humanoid robot for the acquisition of the ground reaction force distributions. The tactile sensor consists of a pressure conductive rubber sheet put between upper and lower electrode arrays and was able to measure the reaction forces from 0.00 MPa to 0.05 MPa at all of the sensing elements. Force distribution data including 30 /spl times/ 16 points can be obtained at a period of 20 ms by using RTLinux. It is shown that the ground reaction force distributions can experimentally be obtained by a humanoid robot \"HOAP-I\" and the locus of ZMP along walking of a humanoid robot is given. This information is useful for constructing feedback control loops or generating a new walking gait.",

Two prototypes were developed to demonstrate the potential of the active link mechanisms. Developed interface devices are an active tetrahedron and an active icosahedron. Nine-DOF micro spherical joints and pressure control pneumatic cylinders were developed to realize the active tetrahedron, while fifteen-DOF micro spherical joints and intelligent pneumatic cylinders were developed for the active icosahedron. The tetrahedron successfully realizes \"virtual touch\"; the operators feel actions, forces, and shapes of the virtual objects in PC and also move and deform them. Real time PMI is realized by building the developed devices into MSC.Visual-Nastran4D. MSC.VisuaI-Nastran4D is a mechanism analysis software, which can make motion analysis in real time. The active icosahedron also realized dynamic interaction with virtual objects in PC, showing the potential of the devices as a haptic interface.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient method to grasp an unknown planar object (disk-like object) using a three-fingered Barrett band. First, active contour models are extracted from the images taken by Biclops, a dual camera directed vision system. The centroid of each active contour model is computed, employed in triangulation, and used as an estimate of a 3-D centroid point of the object. To compute precisely where the gripper will go and how to configure the gripper to grasp the object, the active contour models are also used in a polar coordinate frame to extract concave and convex sections of the model. The proposed algorithm attempts to place the thumb in concave sections of the object, with the remaining two fingers place such that a grasp quality metric is maximized. As a consequence, the geometric properties of the object itself can improve the quality of grasp. In this work, the gripper contact is modeled as a surface rather than a point. This makes the interaction between the object and the gripper more realistic. Only a small set of inflection points are chosen as potential grasping locations. Thus the complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear as opposed to cubic if all the points on the object boundary are chosen as potential grasping locations.",

        "abstract": "An active vision system can control the gaze direction of mounted vision sensors and can overcome many shortcomings of other passive vision systems, which have fixed vision sensors. Furthermore, most visual servoing approaches are concerned with a vision sensor or a passive stereo vision system which has fixed relative coordination between two cameras. In this paper, the problem of controlling a motion by visual servoing with an active stereo vision system is addressed. The main goal is to track the object with our active vision system. Firstly, we discuss how to stack image Jacobians in an active stereo vision system and how to control the active stereo cameras based on images. Next, we introduce our active vision system, which has a fast and simple system architecture that uses a high-speed serial communication bus (IEEE 1394a). It is manipulated by a distributed and jerk-bounded control algorithm to ensure smooth system motion. Finally, simulation and experimental results show both the validity of the proposed definition of the stacked Jacobian to control the system and the feasibility of the proposed the control method.",

In this paper, we describe a concurrent map-building and localization (CML) system developed within the appearance-base robot localization paradigm. This allows us to combine the good features of appearance-base localization, such as simple sensor processing or robustness, without having to deal with its inconveniences. In our CML system, both the robot's position and the map are represented using Gaussian mixtures. Using this kind of representation, we can deal with the global localization problem while being efficient both in memory and in execution time.",

The technique is based on converting abstract optimization problems to parametric optimization problems using direct methods. In this approach, the state and control variables are expanded in finite numbers of Legendre polynomials and the kinematics of cooperative system as well as performance index of optimization problem are approximated. Application of this method results in the transformation of nonlinear differential and integral expressions into nonlinear algebraic expressions. The optimal states are then determined by solving a set of nonlinear equations in Legendre coefficients. The approach is applied to a cooperative manipulator system consisting of two 3-DOF serial manipulators jointly carrying an object. The results are compared with those obtained from solving a two point boundary value problem, as an abstract optimization approach.",

It is a frontier-based method that allows a robot to follow in the obscuring shadow of objects despite their dynamics, and take advantage of more opportunistic cover if it becomes available. An analysis of our approach in off-line modeling and experiments conducted in simulation and outdoor environments demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving high quality solutions for stealthy navigation.",

The system performance is also tested and evaluated through preliminary experiments with plastic bones and cadaver limbs. It is shown that this system has enough positioning accuracy and stability with a compact robot structure, and it can dramatically decrease the operating time.

In the carrying mode the robotic system defines constraints for the user's possible movements when manually guiding the object (and robot arm). Thus, instead of using a complex recognition process for interpreting the user's intention the robot determines the next action on basis of the defined constraints and the measured tactile sensor data. The defined constraints only allow the human partner to manipulate the carried object during the carrying procedure in the manner of a water hand pump. In this way, so-called in-place-translations of the object in all directions are possible, while the human partner maintains full control over orientation and position of the object.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for control of constrained multibody systems based on a projected inverse-dynamics control scheme. The main advantage of the controller is that it works for constrained systems, which have joints with no actuator (passive joints), e.g. parallel manipulators. Also the controller minimizes actuation force, while it does not require the constraint equations be linearly independent. Therefore, the controller can cope with redundant constraint or singular configuration. It follows with development of a complementary controller for control of constraint force.",

A pulse modulated driving voltage excites temporal distribution of standing SAW. The distribution generates friction shift on the surface of a SAW substrate. When the surface with burst SAW is explored, the friction shift can be perceived as tactile sensation at mechanoreceptors in the finger skin. For real reproduction of tactile sensation, the burst frequency was controlled according to measured rubbing motion. We discussed the control parameters and their arrangement. Required parameters and their tuning for the tactile display were investigated.",

        "abstract": "This work is devoted to planning and execution of complex missions in robotics. Robotics has evolved from an industrial, repetitive framework to application domains with much more variability of tasks, with increasing complexity in uncertain environment. This is clearly the case for service robotics for example, but even industrial robots have now to work in environment not totally calibrated for the task they have to perform. The result is that the classical decomposition in static ordered local tasks cannot apply in presence of such a variability. It has a poor dynamic performance and cannot cope with uncertainties. Our work is organized around a complex mission: \"Go to the blackboard and write\" for mobile manipulators that have capabilities of locomotion and manipulation. It is a simple and intuitive example of a complex mission that relies on different sensors, exhibits different operating modes and needs to switch between different feedbacks and set-points. Our approach is based on hybrid dynamical systems. It is focused on dynamical sequencing of control laws that ensures good transients, robustness and allows to update the mission at every transition from one mode to another. Simulations have been realized with Matlab Simulink and Stateflow toolboxes and an experimental validation has been developed within the controller on the H/sub 2/bis nonholonomic mobile manipulator.",

In the method, sub-optimal parameters are obtained through repetitive simulations of assembly operations in order to estimate the cycle time because it is difficult to calculate the cycle time analytically. We apply the method to peg-in-hole operations and show experimental results using the control parameters obtained through the method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the detection and localization of grey regions in color images is addressed. This work has been developed in the scope of the robotized laparoscopic surgery, specifically for surgical procedures occurring inside the abdominal cavity. Since very few works have been already published about that purpose, some existing algorithms have been selected and brought together to achieve a robust color segmentation, as fast as possible. The foreseen application is a good training ground to evaluate these algorithms since main difficulties came from the complexity of the scene, the moving background due to breathing motion, the high surface reflectance, the non-uniform and time-varying lighting conditions. Nevertheless, to achieve the image segmentation suitable for robot control, we propose a new approach, without markers, based on a recursive thresholding of the histogram of a new purity color attribute and region growing. The main contribution of this work is threefold and consists in: the definition of a new color purity component, a selection of reliable, fast and robust existing video processings for the above-mentioned application areas, improving some existing video processings to enhance color properties either to homogenize regions and to emphasize the saturation feature of chromatic pixels. The usefulness of the proposed set of sequential processings has been successfully validated with image sequences of an endoscope to efficiently extracting boundaries of a cylindrical needle-holder with a sampling rate of 5 Hz.",

        "abstract": "In most spine surgeries, the physician directly performs the surgical operation with help of specially designed surgical tools along with off-line CT images and possibly with fluoroscopic images that provide the on-line status of current surgical operation for patient However, the surgical procedure generally requires accurate operational skills and intuition of the physician. Sometimes, trifling errors or misjudgments during surgical operation could result in unrecoverable damages to patients. To cope with these problems, robotic technology has been incorporated into the surgical operations in various levels. In this paper, a robotic system for percutaneous spine surgery, called SPlNEBOT, is developed. The expected roles of SPINEBOT are to provide the guide for the K-wire, to help the physician to locate and orient the position of surgery more accurately, and to compensate for respiration movement of the patient's body during operation. A preliminary experiment has been conducted with a mockup environment of surgical operation. The experimental results confirm that the SPINEBOT is not only able to guide by accurately pointing and orienting the specified location, but also successfully compensate the emulated respiratory movement of the patient.",

As developed, the cut plane is determined by a 5 degree-of-freedom mechanism and the femur and tibia are cut by moving two translational and one rotational degrees of freedom, a system that provides a cutter path which avoids cutting the ligament.

So far most researchers focus on the upper limb exoskeletons.

An exoskeleton foot is designed to measure the human and the exoskeleton's ZMP. Using the measured human ZMP as the reference together with the human leg position signals, the exoskeleton's ZMP is modified by trunk compensation. Test prototypes and initial experiment results are also demonstrated.",

A power assisting system must reflect a human operator's intentions and control the assisting motors to generate required driving power. A power assisting system for the walking chair must provide a constant output velocity though human driving has variations of velocity. It must also provide a stable driving torque so that the user does not suffer any discomfort. Therefore, we proposed two types of mechanisms for power combination and compared them through experiments. Finally, we proposed a hybrid power assisting system based on the combination of two types of mechanisms, and experimentally investigated the system's effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Robots are developed to perform myriad kinds of complex tasks. To enhance the system performance, tasks should be optimally distributed among robots or subsystems of a single robot. Applied to mobile manipulators, optimal task distribution can be obtained by implementing an optimal redundancy resolution approach. A lot of work has been done in this area with a priori-specified tasks. However, for tele-operated mobile manipulator systems, tasks are generated on-line by the operator, and task requirements vary significantly and are not known a priori. This renders static task distribution schemes unsuitable for achieving optimal performance and mandates the use of online modification of optimal task distribution algorithms. This paper proposes a new optimal task distribution method for tele-operated mobile manipulators. In this method, task dexterity indices, which describe the task requirements are generated online. Based on these indices, the criterion function for optimal performance is constructed using physical programming. The solution obtained by this algorithm is more suitable for varying tasks, and has a better defined physical meaning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Kinematically redundant manipulators have been proven to offer certain advantages over more heavily constrained systems. One such advantage is the extra degrees-of-freedom can be used for other tasks such as maintaining a posture which affords higher acceleration capability in the direction of the desired motion. However certain issues arise when considering the control of these mechanisms due to the lack of invertability of the rectangular Jacobian matrix. Here this issue is addressed by augmenting the rectangular Jacobian with a characterization of the null space motions. This approach allows for a gradient-based control scheme, based upon the dynamic capability equations, to increase or maintain the local performance capability of a manipulator as it performs some task. Simulation results of the application of this control scheme to a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator are given to illustrate the control's advantages on a highly redundant system.",

        "abstract": "When we use a tactile sensor, sensing mechanism and restoration of texture from electric sensing signals are important issues. The objectives of this research are to design a new texture sensing system and to develop a new signal processing algorithm which can restore various texture. The new texture sensing system is designed to get texture with high resolution and wide velocity range, which uses a PVDF sensor and has fixing components for several types of objects in precise condition. Next, a new signal processing algorithm is developed to restore texture. In the previous researches, forward model is needed and then it is inverted by using some regularized inversion formula in frequency domain, where there exist problems such as amplification of noise due to ill-posedness, modeling uncertainty due to orientation and position of PVDF films and silicon rubber, and difficulty to add nonlinear terms into model in frequency domain. While, in this paper, we model directly the relation containing transient-state from measured signals to texture by using model structure of multi-input multi-output nonlinear autoregressive moving average and a time domain least squares estimation. The direct modeling can be done by the use of F/T sensor which is not used in the previous researches. Finally the several texture is experimentally reconstructed from sensing signals using the developed signal processing algorithm.",

This work takes place in the context of minimally invasive surgery where the tool is telemanipulated by the surgeon through a penetration point: the trocar fixed on the patient. The algorithm is based on the dynamic control in the operational space of a redundant robot: the total control torque is decoupled into a task behavior torque and a posture behavior torque. By minimizing the contact force applied to the trocar (or equivalently, by forcing to zero the distance between the instrument passing through the trocar and the current location of the trocar), we compute the posture behavior torque guaranteeing that the trocar constraint is satisfied. Simulation results highlight the performance of this algorithm for various trajectories such as straight lines and circles.",

This paper explores how the robot's physical presence influences a person's perception of these characteristics. The first study reported here demonstrates the differences between a robot and an animated character in terms a person's engagement and perceptions of the robot and character. The second study shows that this difference is a result of the physical presence of the robot and that a person's reactions would be similar even if the robot is not physically collocated.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of update rate on the perceived quality of haptic virtual textures, focusing on one type of perceived instability called \"buzzing.\" Buzzing refers to the high-frequency noises that may emanate from a force-feedback device during haptic texture rendering. We first present a simulation of a haptic texture rendering system that explicitly models the sampled-data nature of the system. The simulation shows that a slow haptic update rate can significantly increase the high-frequency noise in the reconstructed force command sent to the haptic interface. This noise may excite the structural resonance of the haptic interface and result in a high-frequency buzzing at the interaction tool that a user holds. A subsequent psychophysical experiment, conducted over a wide range of update rate (250 Hz - 40 kHz), has confirmed the simulation results. The results show a 278% increase in the maximum stiffness (0.325 - 0.904 N/mm over the update rates tested) that could be used for rendering perceptually \"clean\" virtual haptic textures. These results argue for haptic update rates that are much higher than the widely-accepted value of 1 kHz. Considering that an application requiring hard surface rendering needs a stiffness value of at least 0.8 - 1.0 N/mm, we recommend a haptic update rate in the range 5-10 kHz for perceptually stable haptic texture rendering.",

        "abstract": "Some of manufacturing tasks such as sawing task often require continuous impulsive motion. In case of sawing task, such impulsive motions can be observed between the teeth of the saw and the object being sawn. The amount of the external impulse exerted on the object is treated as an important control parameter in the sawing task. The purpose of this work is to show the efficacy of sawing task by using a dual-arm. For this, a new concept of effective mass is introduced to model the impact phenomenon in the sawing task. Using this concept, the external impulse model of sawing tasks is suggested. The optimal sawing region is identified in which the amount of external impulse is maximized. It is demonstrated through simulation and experiment that the dual-arm exhibits better sawing performance over a single arm in aspects of external impulse.",

Convenience is enhanced by reducing both the amount of software to be written and the amount of measurements to be made to a minimum. The path dependent nature of odometry can be exploited to reduce the amount of ground truth information to as little as a single known point. Existing odometry and covariance estimation functions themselves would be used to extract first order parameter variation. Linearization would be performed about the approximate available trajectory rather than the unknown ground truth one. While multiple trajectories would be required to calibrate variance models, it would not be required that they be the same or even similar. The technique is general enough to apply to any form of odometry and it is general enough to be used for the extraction of unknown parameters of either systematic odometry models or stochastic error models. The derivation and experimental validation of the technique are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of computing frictional 4-fingered force-closure grasps of three-dimensional objects. The proposed approach searches for force-closure grasps from a collection of sampled points on the object's surface. Unlike most other works, the approach is not limited to the objects with a certain class of shapes. It can be applied to an object in any shape since only the object's surface points and corresponding surface normal at the points are needed. The efficiency of the approach arises from a heuristic for search space pruning which is based on ability to efficiently locate regions in three dimensional space where friction cones intersect and a randomized test for checking force-closure condition. The proposed approach is implemented and preliminary results are presented.",

Such performance indexes might be used for optimization purpose. At first, the operational force polytope is established. It is the accurate representation of admissible operational forces from the kinetostatic analysis point of view. A way to efficiently compute it is given. The obtained description of the polytope is the same as in (Krut S. et al., March-April 2004), but regarding forces. As a consequence the reader is free to use any of the indexes introduced in (Krut S. et al., March-April 2004). From the authors' point of view the \"maximum operational isotropic force\" is well adapted to characterize parallel wire-driven manipulators' force behavior. The way to compute it is established. At last, this index is computed for several parallel wire-driven manipulators.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present successful strategies for forgetting cases in a case-based reasoning (CBR) system applied to autonomous robot navigation. This extends previous work that involved a CBR architecture, which indexes cases by the spatio-temporal characteristics of the sensor data, and outputs or selects parameters of behaviors in a behavior-based robot architecture. In such a system, the removal of cases can be applied when a new situation unlike any current case in the library is encountered, but the library is full. Various strategies of determining which cases to remove are proposed, including metrics such as how frequently a case is used and a novel spreading activation mechanism. Experimental results show that such mechanisms can increase the performance of the system significantly and allow it to essentially forget old environments in which it was trained in favor of new environments it is currently encountering. The performance of this new system is better than both a purely reactive behavior-based system as well as the CBR module that did not forget cases. Furthermore, such forgetting mechanisms can be useful even when there is no major environmental shift during training, since some cases can potentially be harmful or rarely used. The relationship between the forgetting mechanism and the case library size is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present singularity-free fully-isotropic planar parallel manipulators (PPMs) with three degrees of mobility. The moving platform has three planar degrees of freedom (DoFs), which are two planar translations and one rotation around the axis perpendicular to the plane of translations. A method is proposed for structural synthesis of four families of fully-isotropic PPMs based on the theory of linear transformations. A one-to-one correspondence exists between the actuated joint velocity space and the external velocity space of the moving platform. The Jacobian matrix mapping the two vector spaces of fully-isotropic PPMs presented in this paper is the identity 3 /spl times/ 3 matrix throughout the entire workspace. The condition number and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix being equal to one, the manipulator performs very well with regard to force and motion transmission capabilities. As far as we are aware this paper presents for the first time solutions of singularity-free fully-isotropic PPMs.",

To realize the functions of human locomotion on biped robots, we should know the fundamental aspects of human foot mechanisms through intensive observations of human locomotion. We proposed a novel mechanical shoe with 2-DOF toe parts, which move independently and are able to constrain human foot in various ways. Wearing the mechanical shoes, three subjects were measured on their walking speed, toe joint angles, and center of pressure. They were walking in straight, zigzag and slalom courses. Through these observations, we show that a biped robot with the proposed toe mechanism could potentially walk faster than conventional ones.",

        "abstract": "The main purpose of this study is to deal with a sudden change of dynamics in link systems, not by using integrated systems of different software, but by using a single solution scheme based upon a single theory. An algorithm for the general-purpose expression of structural connectivity is developed and implemented into the parallel solution scheme, which was previously proposed and successively applied to the feed-forward control of link mechanisms under various boundary conditions. The algorithm expresses the connectivity of link members explicitly, regardless of the structural complexity. The parallel solution scheme calculates the inverse dynamics of link systems with equations of motion expressed in the dimension of force. It enables us to obtain numerical torque values in parallel by using a matrix-form equation separated into terms of different parameters. Therefore, the connectivity of link members can be expressed explicitly by one of the matrices, the member length matrix. We describe the forming process of the matrix and verify the validity of the calculated torque values, by presenting simple numerical results and experimental results for complex systems such as multibranch link systems. It is confirmed that a sudden structural change of link systems is dealt with only by a revision of input data, which makes it highly reliable in fail-safe systems.",

In this paper, such normalized tool vectors from 3-axis CL data are generated for a polishing robot. The resultant CL data allow the polishing robot based on an industrial robot to realize a teaching-less operation of position and force. The present robot can also control the polishing force consisting of the contact and kinetic friction forces. During the polishing of a mold, a position feedback loop has a delicate contribution to the force feedback loop in Cartesian space so as not to make the tool deviate from the desired trajectory. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed robot have been proved by actual polishing experiments using an aluminum mold with curved surface.",

The proposed methods provide singularity-free integration, unlike the Euler-angle method, while the integration always evolves on the underlying manifold structure, unlike the quarternion method.

The tip control should be carefully designed when the dynamics of the manipulator and the flexible body are coupled such as humanoids. The measure is used to determine the redundant degrees of freedom of the manipulator based on the RAC (robust arm configuration) concept. The proposed measure evaluates the global robustness of arm configuration by mixing each RAC-measure for individual vibration mode. The redundancy of the manipulator is determined for a desired tip trajectory based on the proposed measure. As a result, a high-gain tip position control can be applied without considering the base flexibility. The validity is confirmed by a feedback-based continuous tracking for a 4 DOF human-like redundant manipulator mounted on a 3 DOF flexible body.",

This paper investigates an alternate intraocular surgical technique based on the use of wireless microrobots guided by external magnetic fields. Issues investigated include the effects of magnetic and viscous drag forces faced by magnetic microrobots in the vitreous humor and the 3D visual servoing of these microrobots using a single microscope view. A new active defocused tracking method is proposed for visually servoing the microrobot along the optical axis of the microscope. This method uses a purposely defocused view of the microrobot to unambiguously resolve depth while servoing. Experimental results demonstrating the method with a microrobot visually servoed in 3D at 60 Hz using a single microscope view are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at advancing micromanipulation technology with in situ polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric force sensing during microassembly and packaging process. Based on the previously developed PVDF 1-D sensor, by employing the parallel beam structure, a novel 2-D force sensor with relatively high natural frequency and sensitivity is optimally designed. The sensor can detect micro force and force rate signals, which can be fed back so as to greatly, improve the reliability of microassembly. Preliminary calibration and experimental results on assembly of surface MEMS devices both verified the performance of the new 2-D sensor that demonstrates a high sensitivity and a resolution in the range of /spl mu/N. Ultimately the technology would provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated micro-manufacturing processes for batch assembly of micro devices.",

The system cannot build interaction between human. And the agent processes information all by itself, which cannot utilize relationship with human or other agents. Therefore, we focus attention on ontology technology. Human can communicate with other that combined with a situation and body language. This is because human has the ontology. The agent created the ontology from observed human motion and situation, and communication with human or other agents use ontology.

This display varies the compliance of the sheet in the normal direction by changing the bias tension of the sheet: tightly stretched sheet feels hard, and loosely stretched sheet feels soft Hence a user can feel compliance of various virtual objects when he pushes the sheet. This sheet is also used as a rear projection screen; an LCD projector projects the image on the sheet from its back. When the user's finger pushes the sheet, the position and deformation of the pushed point are measured by stereo vision. The deformation of the virtual object is calculated by FEM, and the graphical model of the deformed object is generated. The user sees both the image of the object projected on the sheet and his own finger pushing the image. As a result, the proposed visual and haptic display allows users to feel like pushing virtual soft objects with their fingers directly. It is ascertained that the developed display can generate variable compliance and simulate the compliance of a real soft object. Human subjects feel like seeing and pushing a virtual object directly.",

For this reason, in this paper, the relationship between a slave robot and the uncertain remote environment is proposed as the impedance to generate the virtual force to feed back Io the operator. For the control of a teleoperated mobile robot equipped with camera, the teleoperated mobile robot take pictures of remote environment and sends the visual information back to the operator over the Internet. Because of the limitation of communication bandwidth and narrow view-angles of camera, it is not possible to watch the environment clearly, especially shadow and curved areas. To overcome this problem, the virtual force is generated according to both the distance between the obstacle and robot and the approaching velocity of the obstacle. This virtual force is transferred back to the master over the Internet and the master, which can generate force, enables a human operator to estimate the position of obstacle in the remote environment. By holding this master, in spite of limited visual information, the operator can feel the spatial sense against the remote environment. This force reflection improves the performance of a teleoperated mobile robot significantly.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, inverse dynamics of the H4 robot is addressed. Dynamics of parallel robots is one of a very complicated subject. Especially, for the real time control of the parallel robot, it is an important issue. The actuating torque would depend not only on a given trajectory but also on the mass properties of the arms, the rods, travelling plate, and external forces. Dynamics are useful for computer simulation, the design of suitable control equations, and the evaluation of the kinematic design of parallel robots. The detailed dynamic equations for the H4 robot are derived using Newton-Euler method. In the last section, the effect of the rod inertia is introduced using comparative study of those methods whether the inertia of the light rod can be negligible or not in the fast motion.",

        "abstract": "The precise positioning of the end-effector of a binary manipulator requires many modules. In this case, most of the existing algorithms require impractically large memory size for the real-time calculation of the binary positions of all joints. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new inverse kinematics algorithm using an optimization method. The key idea of the present method is to formulate the integer-variable inverse kinematics problem as a real-variable optimization problem in which the real-valued design variables are pushed towards the permissible binary values. Since the proposed algorithm is very efficient, the inverse kinematics of three-dimensional manipulators can be solved in real time. Furthermore, some manipulation considerations such as operation power minimization can be easily incorporated into the present new formulation.",

        "abstract": "A cable-driven parallel manipulator (CDPM) possesses a number of promising advantages over the conventional rigid-link manipulators, such as the simple and lightweight mechanical structure, high-loading capacity, and large reachable workspace. However, due to the unilateral driving capability of the flexible cables, most of the well-developed modelling and analysis methods for conventional rigid-link mechanisms cannot be directly applied to CDPM. This paper focuses on the kinematics and singularity analysis of a specific type of CDPM, i.e., a completely restrained planar CDPM. Following an analytical approach, the forward displacement analysis leads to solve a fourth order polynomial equation. Hence, the solutions can be determined efficiently in symbolic forms. To verify the effectiveness of this method, a computation example is provided, in which four real solutions are found out. It is realized the Jacobian-based singularity analysis, where all cables are treated as rigid links, is incomplete for the CDPM. Based on the concept of the instantaneous center and taking into account the cable-tension condition, a new geometrical singularity analysis method is proposed, which is able to effectively identify all forward singularity configurations for a completely restrained planar CDPM.",

Although many such features may be visible in a given view of the robot's environment, only a few such features are necessary to estimate the robot's position and orientation. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically selecting, from the entire set of features visible in the robot's environment, the minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose the world into a small number of maximally sized regions such that at each position in a given region, the same small set of features is visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic formulation of the problem and prove that it is NP-complete. Next, we introduce a number of approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both synthetic and real data.",

It can be used to generate cyclic movements for a robot system which has to solve complex tasks. The system is laid out in such a way that multiple motion dimensions, or degrees of freedom of the robot, are represented independent of each other; therefore, an extension to higher-dimensional problems is easily possible. Guiding the robot by holding its end-effector, the user teaches simple movement primitives forming the basis for a more complex task. Each movement primitive is represented in the system using an oscillator combined with a learned nonlinear mapping. These primitives are then optimally combined to a complete solution to the posed problem. Said optimality is obtained using simulated annealing with the A* global search algorithm. Our approach is demonstrated on the problem of wiping a table, but can be used for many typical problems in service and household robotics.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for learning a set of models of visual features which are invariant to scale and translation in the image domain. The models are constructed by first applying the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to a set of training images, and matching the extracted features across the images, followed by learning the pose-dependent behavior of the features. The modeling process avoids assumptions with respect to scene and imaging geometry, but rather learns the direct mapping from camera pose to feature observation. Such models are useful for applications to robotic tasks, such as localization, as well as visualization tasks. We present the model learning framework, and experimental results illustrating the success of the method for learning models that are useful for robot localization.",

It can be avoided by using virtual reality technology. Using the simulated environment in virtual reality, the operator can practice, explore and prevent the problems that occur during implementation. We proposed a concept of a physically behaved microrobotic workcell in virtual environment for microassembly teaching. In a first part, implementation of physical behaviors of virtual objects into VR for micro-task teaching is introduced. A virtual microworld is exactly reconstructed from the CAD-CAM databases of the real environment and simulates contact and elastic robotic interactions, virtual sensing of position and force, etc. Then, the virtual workcell is simulated and an example of micro-task teaching is given. The implementation includes view tracking using virtual force feedback, visual and audio rendering in virtual microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "The architecture of the conventional home automation system is usually centralized and thus causes many problems, e.g. lots of network traffic, heavy computation load, and poor fault tolerance. Another problem with the architecture is that there exists a variety of different home control networks incompatible with one another, which makes it difficult to integrate them in order to provide high level management functions in a home automation system. Besides the problems mentioned above, the most serious problem with a home automation system is its dynamically changing environment. Such frequently changing situation of the peripherals disallows straightforward configuration and maintenance of the home automation system. In this paper, we propose a mobile agent based integrated control architecture for home automation system, which is able to solve the problem mentioned above. This architecture is a distributed one, reducing the network traffic and computation load by delegating the management function to each control node. To integrate various kinds of home control network, we use computer network as the backbone and apply the concept of gateway to facilitate different networks to communicate with one another. Finally, we take advantages of the characteristics of mobile agent to cope with the problem of the dynamic environment and to enhance the fault tolerance mechanism.",

A sphere is considered here as a manipulated object. The control law is designed based on integration of voluntary and reflex movements considering the system's redundancy. The voluntary task for holding the object is realized by impedance control at the four contact points with the object using the contact force information from the sensitive skin. The reflection on the other hand is introduced as a regulation problem of the direction between the points of end-effectors and elbows. The solution for the redundant control is formulated and derived from the optimization point of view. The validity of the proposed method is investigated by numerical simulations.",

In this paper, the authors focus on a new type of automatic bendable tip while keeping the advance of the colonoscope in the colon by endoscopist. The main purpose of this tip is to make the colonoscope overcome acute intestinal bends and make easier the progression of the colonoscope for the surgeon. Firstly, we model our current prototype tip, named EDORA (distal extremity with automatic orientation). Next, the parameters of the system are estimated by using the Levenberg-Margquardt's algorithm. Finally, by using the maximum of the sensitivity function a gain margin specification is made. A set point for a position controller is designed, thus the tip can stay in the middle of the colon with disturbance rejection due to the manipulation of the colonoscope. In the same time, this controller has been designed to make the tip have some degrees of compliance to reduce the contact force due to the undesirable contact with the colon. Simulation and experimental results for the controller would be presented by emulating the real environments.",

A vision sensor guiding a capturing manipulator toward a satellite can have difficulty recognizing a target covered with shining foil in rapidly changing lighting conditions.

Therefore, it is necessary to be able to detect system limits, to abort a task, or to change a strategy In order to avoid catastrophic failure.

        "abstract": "Standard reinforcement learning methods are inefficient and often inadequate for learning cooperative multi-agent tasks. For these kinds of tasks the behavior of one agent strongly depends on dynamic interaction with other agents, not only with the interaction with a static environment as in standard reinforcement learning. The success of the learning is therefore coupled to the agents' ability to predict the other agents behaviors. In this study we try to overcome this problem by adding a few simple macro actions, actions that are extended in time for more than one time step. The macro actions improve the learning by making search of the state space more effective and thereby making the behavior more predictable for the other agent. In this study we have considered a cooperative mating task, which is the first step towards our aim to perform embodied evolution, where the evolutionary selection process is an integrated part of the task. We show, in simulation and hardware, that in the case of learning without macro actions, the agents fail to learn a meaningful behavior. In contrast, for the learning with macro action the agents learn a good mating behavior in reasonable time, in both simulation and hardware.",

We present implementation expertise in update timing for performance improvement and show that a system of subsumption architecture is convertible to online updateable one.

Here we present and compare two methods of online visual odometry suited for planetary rovers. Both methods use omnidirectional imagery to estimate motion of the rover. One method is based on robust estimation of optical flow and subsequent integration of the flow. The second method is a full structure-from-motion solution. To make the comparison meaningful we use the same set of raw corresponding visual features for each method.

In the method presented here, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for optimizing the potential field. The chromosome of each individual encodes parametrizations for the potential field generated by waypoints, obstacles, and goals. The waypoints themselves are obtained through a Voronoi tessellation of the environment in which the robot is operating. It is demonstrated that the algorithm allows a robot to navigate safely and efficiently through spaces with many obstacles, even in cases where these are placed in a strongly unfavorable way. Furthermore, the results from simulations were implemented successfully in an actual Khepera robot. Using a slightly simplified navigation procedure, in which the robot comes to a standstill between successive steps in the navigation, the Khepera robot managed to navigate through one of the most difficult environments used in the simulations. Finally, the paper briefly describes a different implementation of potential field navigation, in the path planning adaptation submodule of a more advanced simulated mobile robot (VirBot).",

Based on this problem, the aim of this paper is to describe a surgical instrument which can serve as an extension of the surgeon's fingers. A piezoelectric sensor array attached to the instrument's end effector provide tactile information, which is sent to the surgeon's fingers via a tactile display to provide a feeling of the shape and hardness of the tissue. The sensor array is 24 mm /spl times/ 8 mm and consists of 30 piezoelectric sensors, while the tactile display constitutes of 30 micro motors adding up to a total size of 32 mm /spl times/ 18 mm /spl times/ 45 mm.",

        "abstract": "Beside a quantity of well-known positive characteristics parallel robots also obtain a couple of negative properties limiting their efficient use in certain application areas nowadays. Additional sensors integrated in the passive joints provide the possibility to overcome several of these limitations simultaneously thus leading towards an increasing overall system performance. In detail, different control functions, necessary for fast, precise and safe robot operation like calibration, workspace monitoring and position control can be improved. To tap the potential of the concept of passive joint-sensors, algorithms to evaluate the additional sensor information for certain control functions and an approach to determine the necessary sensor resolution for a class of parallel robots are developed. Different sensor configurations are investigated and compared due to computational efficiency and resolution demands. Based on these requirements, we report on the development of new inductive micro sensors for angle measurement capable for integration, e.g. into rotary joints of high-performance parallel robots. Basic design and process technologies of the single sensor components as well as first measuring results are described.",

The topic includes the analysis of passive running gaits and their orbital stabilization. For one-legged robot, two stabilizing controllers that asymptotically stabilize periodic passive gaits are derived. In particular, the second controller is based on \"energy-preserving principle\" and its original form generates interesting quasi-periodic running gaits, which can be seen in Hamiltonian system. The controller is extend to a planar biped robot with torso, which does not have any passive running gaits. Combining simple attitude controller at stance phase generates stable periodic running gaits. For a planar quadruped robot, with an advanced gait searching algorithm, some fundamental properties of the passive running gaits, such as stability or symmetry, are observed.",

When a mobile robot works in the constructed environments such as indoor, it is very effective and reasonable to attach landmarks on the environment for the vision-based navigation. In that case, it is important for the robot to decide its motion automatically. Therefore, we propose a motion planning method that optimizes the efficiency of the task, the danger of colliding with obstacles, and the accuracy and the ease of the observation according to the situation and the performance of the robots. We also introduce multiple landmark-observation strategies to optimize the motion depending on the number and the configuration of visible landmarks in each place.",

The algorithm is based on measuring the reduction in path cost that would be caused by taking a sensor reading from candidate locations. The planner uses this measure in order to decide where to take the next sensor reading. Ideally, one would like to evaluate a path based on a map that is as close as possible to the true underlying world. In practice, however, the map is only sparsely populated by data derived from sensor readings. A key component of the approach described in this paper is a mechanism to infer (or \"hallucinate\") more complete maps from sparse sensor readings. We show how this hallucination mechanism is integrated with the planner to produce better estimates of the gain in path cost occurred when taking sensor readings. We show results on a real robot as well as a statistical analysis on a large set of randomly generated path planning problems on elevation maps from real terrain.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the haptic interface system (one of a variety of force display devices) has attracted great interest as a new virtual reality technology, stimulating vigorous research. Most reports deal with methods of constructing a haptic interface system or the development of new devices having with a particular mechanism, and the various methods suitable for force display. However, it is also necessary to clarify the relationship between the virtual dynamics characteristics of a system and a human being's feelings in order to present the accurate force sensation from virtual environment. In this paper, we evaluate the force sensations experienced by human beings with the psychological experiments that examine perceptual illusion phenomena, including the horizontal-vertical illusion and the size-weight illusion. These results show that perceptual illusions occurring in a real environment can be also reappeared in a virtual environment. Therefore, perceptual illusions may have the potential for application to virtual reality. Moreover, the characteristics of perceptual illusions can be examined by changing the virtual dynamics parameters of the haptic interface. Finally, this paper shows that the haptic interface is a very effective tool for the investigation of perceptual illusions.",

        "abstract": "A robot soccer match poses an interesting problem in planning: the planning of coordinated motion of individual players as a team, against the opponent players the next move of which is not known a priori, in such a way as to achieve the common goal, i.e. winning the match. The outcome of a soccer match depends largely on how well the motions of individual players of a team are coordinated against those of the opponent. The technical challenge lies in formulating such coordination strategy together with computational formalism that allows a real-time search for an optimal coordinated motion of individual players. In this paper, we propose the concept of the \"controllable zone\" of a player or a team, representing the area or the set of field positions that the player or the team can occupy before the opponents at time t. A systematic way of computing various forms of controllable zone is presented. Based on the formalism of controllable zone, it is possible to identify whether a team should be in an offensive or a defensive mode, and which strategy among shooting, capturing, dribbling, and passing is desirable for the team at time t. The coordinated motions of individual players are then determined in such a way as to optimize the strategic scores associated with controllable zones. The proposed paradigm is applied to a real environment for animated simulation: 3/spl times/3 FIRA World Cup micro robot soccer match, to evaluate its performance.",

The difficulty of this new system lies in the haptic display function allowing to teach gesture interaction skill to obstetricians/midwifes students. This paper deals only on the feasibility of such a system. First, the system is presented and its \"nominal ingredients\" described in generic terms. Simple models of women pelvis, fetus and muscles have been considered. Pilot force feedback delivery is simulated and experienced; results are discussed.",

In our sensing model, the pursuer is only able to detect discontinuities in depth information (gaps), and it is able to find all of the evaders without any explicit localization or geometric information, by using a gap navigation tree. The strategy is based on growing an evader-free region, by reading \"exploration\" schedules from the gap navigation tree, that is constructed online. We prove that a pursuer with k + 1 sentries can clear any environment that could be cleared by k pursuers using the algorithm in L.J. Guibas et al.

        "abstract": "Dynamic scene perception is very important for autonomous vehicles operating around other moving vehicles and humans. Most work on real-time camera based object tracking from moving platforms has used sparse features or assumed flat scene structures. We have recently extended a real-time, dense stereo system to include real-time, dense optical flow, enabling more comprehensive dynamic scene analysis. We describe algorithms to robustly estimate 6-DOF robot egomotion in the presence of moving objects using dense flow and dense stereo. We then use dense stereo and egomotion estimates to identify other moving objects while the robot itself is moving. We present results showing accurate egomotion estimation and detection of moving people and vehicles under general 6-DOF motion of the robot and independently moving objects. The system runs at 18.3 Hz on a 1.4 GHz Pentium M laptop, computing 160/spl times/120 disparity maps and optical flow fields, egomotion, and moving object segmentation. We believe this is a significant step toward general unconstrained dynamic scene analysis for mobile robots, as well as for improved position estimation where GPS is unavailable.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The stereo SFM combining stereo and motion is a useful vision cue to estimate both the motion of the cameras and the structure of a scene with an absolute scale factor. Most of the works related to the stereo SFM have used both motion correspondence and stereo correspondence. Because it is information redundancy to use these two correspondence simultaneously, they can give accurate results. However, the methods to solve the stereo correspondence problem are not yet reliable enough to have been used in practical applications, while the motion correspondence problem is easy to solve. Therefore, if an absolute scale factor can be acquired by only using motion correspondence without stereo correspondence, it is not necessary to use stereo correspondence for accuracy at the cost of reliability. This paper shows that the scale factor can be determined by using only motion correspondence. Moreover, it is shown that the degenerate cases reported in this paper are all the cases and can be easily avoided. This fact is verified from the two theorems and the simulation results. This paper also describes an implementation of the proposed algorithm. This implementation uses multiple images acquired continuously when a stereo camera moves in a scene and is formulated to be a recursive form for real-time applications. Some peculiar implementation techniques contribute to fast convergence rate and good stability in spite of large initial uncertainty. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses a method to accelerate reinforcement learning. Firstly defined is a concept that reduces the state space conserving policy. An algorithm is then given that calculates the optimal cost-to-go and the optimal policy in the reduced space from those in the original space. Using the reduced state space, learning convergence is accelerated. Its usefulness for both DP (dynamic programming) iteration and Q-learning are compared through a maze example. The convergence of the optimal cost-to-go in the original state space needs approximately N or more times as long as that in the reduced state space, where N is a ratio of the state number of the original space to the reduced space. The acceleration effect for Q-learning is more remarkable than that for the DP iteration. The proposed technique is also applied to a robot manipulator working for a peg-in-hole task with geometric constraints. The state space reduction can be considered as a model of the change of observation, i.e., one of cognitive actions. The obtained results explain that the change of observation is reasonable in terms of learning efficiency.",

However, the smooth control of humanoid robots requires a continuous high-dimensional state space. In this paper, to treat the state space, we proposed an adaptive allocation method of basis functions for reinforcement learning. Grid or incremental allocation methods have previously been proposed for allocation of basis functions. However, these methods may result in the curse of dimensionality, and a fall into local minima. On the other hand, our method avoids local minima, which are assessed by the trace of activity of basis functions. That is, if the current state is determined to have fallen into a local minimum, our method eliminates a basis function, which most affects the state. Moreover our method learns with a low number of basis functions because of the elimination process. In order to confirm the effectiveness of our method, by using computer simulation, a humanoid robot learned the motion of standing up from a chair. This motion was enabled with a small number of basis functions.",

        "abstract": "Since sensors have limited range and coverage, mobile robots often have to make decisions on where to point their sensors. A good sensing strategy allows a robot to collect information that is useful for its tasks. Most existing solutions to this active sensing problem choose the direction that maximally reduces the uncertainty in a single state variable. In more complex problem domains, however, uncertainties exist in multiple state variables, and they affect the performance of the robot in different ways. The robot thus needs to have more sophisticated sensing strategies in order to decide which uncertainties to reduce, and to make the correct trade-offs. In this work, we apply a least squares reinforcement learning method to solve this problem. We implemented and tested the learning approach in the RoboCup domain, where the robot attempts to reach a ball and accurately kick it into the goal. We present experimental results that suggest our approach is able to learn highly effective sensing strategies.",

        "abstract": "Robots that never need any calibration of their kinematics, their actuators or their sensors promise great advantages in terms of maintenance cost, robustness and adaptability. Here we propose an approach for calibration-free vision based navigation in networks of corridors. The underlying concepts are based on the utilization of laws of projective geometry that always apply, regardless of camera characteristics, and in some cases on learning by doing. Our approach is based on a vehicle-mounted camera looking into an approximately forward direction as the main sensor and a qualitative knowledge of the appearance of objects of interest, such as floors and walls of corridors. The skills developed on the basis of the approach were intensively tested and have proved their effectiveness, adaptability and robustness under real-world conditions in two different office environments and with two robots, a humanoid personal robotic assistant, HERMES and a transportation robot, ATHENE II.",

        "abstract": "Proposed in this paper is a component for extracting low-dimensional rotation invariant feature vectors directly from omnidirectional camera images. The component is based on higher-order local autocorrelation (HLAC) functions, but with a modification that makes the extraction result in rotation invariant representations. As the component provides a static mapping to feature vectors, it requires no setup or learning phase and is well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios where input distributions can be nonstationary. Experiments with an actual robot system are presented and results show that the extracted feature vectors manage to capture structures in the environment. When used as the perceptual component of a sequential Monte Carlo localizer, the location of the robot can be tracked without access to long-range distance sensors. Important limitations and suitable uses for the extracted representations are also discussed.",

Therefore, RFID system would be useful in a problem of mobile robot self-localization, if tags are distributed in the environment, and if the robot is equipped with a RFID reader to communicate with the tags. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning-based localization with a RFID system by using support vector machine (SVM). In order to obtain various training data for SVM learning, a number of synthesized sensor data are generated from limited amount of real sensor data. We also propose a method that enables a user to easily place tags in effective locations. In experiments with a mobile robot, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Hyper-redundant manipulator has more degrees of freedom than the least necessary to perform a given task, thus it has the features of overcoming conventional industrial robot's limitation such as improving its kinematics and dynamic performances. Crucial as it is, effective control of hyper-redundant manipulator is difficult for its redundancy. A novel shape control technique based on the concept of variable structure regular polygon and subsystem has been proposed. This technique, using variable structure regular polygon and neural networks models, is completely capable of solving the control problem of a planar hyper-redundant manipulator with any number of links following any desired path. With regular polygon side number's variety and its shape's transformation, the manipulator's configuration changes accordingly and moves actively to perform the task form point to point or following a path. Compared with other methods to our knowledge, this technique has such superiorities as fewer control parameters, higher precision and less computation. Simulation of a six-link modularized manipulator's inspection work in a bottle-like concave has demonstrated that this control technique is available and effective.",

The inputs of the deformable model come from the treatment of the collision. We propose to focus on the contact restitution between deformable objects to guarantee \"physical and perceptual realisms\" of the haptic feedback. Signorini, in 1933, proposed a physical model of contact for deformable objects interacting with rigid static bodies (Signorini, S, 1933). This paper shows that the Signorini's model extents to contacts between two deformable objects using Gauss-Seidel resolution of complementarity problems. An interactive resolution of the overall formulation is presented and experienced on deformable objects using the finite linear-elements method.",

To track the landmark model, Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm is applied by using gradient descent. Then, by adopting reasonable assumption for indoor environments, a quick localization method for mobile robots from correspondent landmark is proposed in a linear technique. Experimental results that demonstrate the robustness of the method with respect to image illumination and noises are also presented.

The point-to-plane variant of ICP is used for local alignment, including weightings that favor nearby points and a novel outlier rejection strategy that increases the robustness for this class of data while eliminating the burden of user-specified thresholds. Global consistency is imposed on cycles by optimally distributing the cyclic discrepancy according to the local fit correlation matrices.

Stimulated by interactions between robot and user, this mechanism constructs and updates the association between the user's situation and tasks so that the robot could adapt to user's behaviors related to the robot's tasks effectively. For the user adaptation, radial basis function networks (RBFN) and associative learning algorithms are used. The proposed mechanism is applied to CRF3 (character robot face 3) system to prove its feasibility and effectiveness.",

Therefore soft robots, which mean robots with passively (or mechanically) compliant joints, become more and more important. In this work we analyze what Cartesian stiffness at the tool center point one can achieve with a passively compliant, redundant robot with variable joint stiffness. We restrict this work to the special case of uncoupled joint stiffness only, as coupling of joint stiffness seems to be mechanically difficult to realize. Finally we discuss a Cartesian controller, which incorporates the compliance of the joints and ensures the correct stiffness behavior also for high displacements from the desired position.",

The stability analysis simulation reveals that these conditions have significant influence on the stability of the system. In order to investigate the usefulness of the stability analysis simulation, a verification experiment using a Mitsubishi PA-10 robot arm was carried out. Experimental results illustrate that the investigated stability analysis is useful and effective to simulate and reveal the stability of the human-robot cooperative task system.",

First, a soft-fingered grasping task is modeled and formulated. A stability analysis is presented using formulated equations. We also show that grasping force converges to a constant value that is independent of fingertip dynamics. Using a soft-fingered hand mechanism that we built, we confirm that grasping force can easily be regulated by controlling saturated P. Second, through simulation, we verify the effect of fingertip dynamics on sampling time. We investigate the dependency of fingertip dynamics and sampling time on graspability. In addition, we build a variable dynamics fingertip (VDF) to confirm the simulation results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, steering characteristics of a rigid wheel (tire) on loose soil is investigated. Based on terra-mechanic analysis, the lateral force characteristics of a driving wheel is modeled as a function of slip ratio and slip angle. The model suggests that the lateral force decreases according to the increment of the slip ratio and increases according to the increment of the slip angle. Such characteristics are confirmed and evaluated by experiments using simulated lunar-surface soil, called lunar regolith simulant. The proposed model is validated with the experimental results in reasonable precision. A model that properly predicts the lateral force can be useful for future practical issues, such as controlling the steering motion of a vehicle for following a desired trajectory in the operational phase, and also to compare the feasibility and/or stability of candidate steering maneuvers in the motion planning phase.",

        "abstract": "A method for probabilistic registration of stereo vision and sonar sensor data within 2.5D maps is presented. Both sensor modalities have characteristics which can limit available localisation information. Resulting localisation estimates can be inaccurate and can also vary widely within and between samples. Such errors are not so prohibitive in pure localisation problems, but prove catastrophic in SLAM applications. Fusion of vision and sonar data while considering height of objects in the environment is implemented to reduce such noise by taking advantage of localisation cues from both modalities. In addition, an approximation of the variance within localisation estimates is used to form a measure of localisation confidence. This measure of belief can inform the mapping task so sensor data sampled from uncertain robot poses can be integrated into the map with a reduced probability. This process not only results in improved maps, but subsequently in more accurate localisation estimates.",

While conventional force displays are active systems with actuators and therefore may become inherently dangerous, passive force displays, which use only passive elements, are an effective methods for assuring safety. However, passive type systems have some directions and link postures, which are hard to present force. To this problem, a method for improvement of controllability using redundant couple of brakes had been suggested. It was able to be considered this method made it possible to display various force directions and various postures of virtual objects. The purpose of this study was, for further improvement of controllability of systems with redundant couples of brakes, design and development of more generalized redundant mechanism by adding another element of design freedom. Moreover, improvement of force display-ability by reducing equivalent inertia was also aimed. In this paper, the developed system was outlined and basic experiments with it discussed.",

        "abstract": "Building a mobile service robot for home and office environments that incorporates skilled interaction capabilities is a challenging task. The control system has to consider various demands: first, it has to manage unstructured and dynamic environments. Second, as humans are around, aspects of safety are of particular importance. This implies that the system has to be highly reactive. Third, the robot also has to be capable of carrying out dialogs to be taught or instructed. Altogether, this requires a highly integrated control framework. In this paper we present an agent-based architecture for our mobile robot BIRON in order to realize sophisticated human-robot interaction. The architecture is built in a modular fashion and controlled by a central execution supervisor using an event queue to handle asynchronous events. This execution supervisor contains an augmented finite state machine which is specified in XML and thus is highly generic. Similarly, the communication between all modules is based on XML. The overall system, therefore, is easily maintainable and extensible, as the architecture's design allows us to add new modules to the system without requiring major modifications on existing components.",

        "abstract": "Motion vision (visual odometry, the estimation of camera egomotion) is a well researched field, yet has seen relatively limited use despite strong evidence from biological systems that vision can be extremely valuable for navigation. The limited use of such vision techniques has been attributed to a lack of good algorithms and insufficient computer power, but both of those problems were resolved as long as a decade ago. A gap presently yawns between theory and practice, perhaps due to perceptions of robot vision as less reliable and more complex than other types of sensing. We present an experimental methodology for assessing the real world precision and reliability of visual odometry techniques in both normal and extreme terrain. This paper evaluates the performance of a mobile robot equipped with a simple vision system in common outdoor and indoor environments, including grass, pavement, ice, and carpet. Our results show that motion vision algorithms can be robust and effective, and suggest a number of directions for further development.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive robotic surgery systems has entered daily practice in dedicated clinical centers. Especially heart surgery profits from this new technique, due to a higher accuracy compared to conventional endoscopic interventions. Nevertheless some drawbacks have restricted a broader acceptance of these devices. The most urgent issues are lack of haptic feedback and prolonged operation time. Our research project tackles both topics, on the one hand by adding high fidelity force-feedback, on the other hand by automating recurrent manipulation tasks. These features have been integrated into the Endo[PA]R (endoscopic partially-autonomous robot) system, an open evaluation platform for robotic surgery. The setup comprises two low-payload robots equipped with sensorized surgical instruments and a third robot carrying a stereo camera system. Trocar kinematics, enabling surgical manipulation through small incisions, has been implemented for all robotic arms. In order to ensure operation close to reality, a thorax and heart phantom for surgical training was used in the experiments. Stereo vision is provided via a head-mounted display and force-reflective input devices are employed for user interaction. The system was evaluated by surgeons and it was capable of performing autonomous knot-tying.",

According to the condition of environments, the robot can select its motion algorithm among four types of navigation strategy. Also, we emphasized the manageability of a robot's knowledge base for human friendly interactions. The robot's knowledge base can be extended or modified intuitively enough to be managed by non-experts. In order to show the feasibility and effectiveness of our system, we also present experimental results of the navigation system and some experiences on practical installations.",

        "abstract": "As robot technology is evolving and creating a social community between humans and robots, it is necessary to research and develop a new type of intelligence, which we refer to as \"social intelligence''. Social intelligence enables natural and socially appropriate interactions. Its importance is gaining a growing interest among not just the human-computer interaction researchers but also robot technology researchers and developers. This article discusses the definition, importance, and benefits of social intelligence in human and robot collaborative systems. The virtual social environment is employed to implement an experimental social intelligence system because of its low cost and high flexibility. Software robots (i.e. agents) with the social intelligence model have been implemented by featuring an emotion model and a personality model under the virtual environment. The social intelligence model that handles affective responses is based on the theories of personality, emotion, and human-media interaction such as cognitive appraisal theory and media equation. The experiment was conducted with the virtual learning collaborative system to examine the effect of the social intelligence model in the collaborative system. The data showed that the users had more positive impressions about the usefulness and the application and learning experience when the cooperative agent displayed some social responses with personality and emotions. It should be noted here that the cooperative agent did not provide any explicit assistance for the human user such as giving clues and showing answers, and yet the user's evaluation on the usefulness of the learning system was influenced by the social agent. The data also suggested that the cooperative agent contributed to the effectiveness of the learning system.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an original method to compute the relative motion of an uncalibrated stereo rig in urban environments from features lying on the road. The extraction of significant reliable features on the road remains the critical step of this method. We nevertheless detect them according to the stereo constraints and an a priori knowledge on the scene. The motion between two frames of the stereo rig is considered as rigid: the homography computation is enforced by the redundancy of the feature locations in multiple views. The method has been tested on video sequences recorded from a test vehicle that was driven in an urban environment. Promising results from these experiments are presented.",

        "abstract": "Real world robot applications have to cope with large variations in the operating conditions due to the variability and unpredictability of the environment and its interaction with the robot. Performing an adequate control using conventional control techniques, that require the model of the plant and some knowledge about the influence of the environment, could be almost impossible. An alternative to traditional control techniques is to use an automatic learning system that uses previous experience to learn an adequate control policy. Learning by experience has been formalized in the field of reinforcement learning. But the application of reinforcement learning techniques in complex environments is only feasible when some generalization can be made in order to reduce the required amount of experience. This work presents an algorithm that performs a kind of generalization called categorization. This algorithm is able to perform efficient generalization of the observed situations, and learn accurate control policies in a short time without any previous knowledge of the plant and without the need of any kind of traditional control technique. Its performance is evaluated on the trajectory tracking control with simulated DC motors and compared with PID systems specifically tuned for the same problem.",

Inspired by human-style tutelage, we situate the learning problem within a dialog in which social interaction structures the learning experience, providing instruction, directing attention, and controlling the complexity of the task. We present a learning mechanism, implemented on a humanoid robot, to demonstrate that a collaborative dialog framework allows a robot to efficiently learn a task from a human, generalize this ability to a new task configuration, and show commitment to the overall goal of the learned task. We also compare this approach to traditional machine learning approaches.",

This paper then considers the generalization and unification of dynamic gait generation methods by introducing variable virtual gravity concept and some solution formulas as well as essential mechanical energy orbits. As two leading methods, energy tracking control and virtual passive dynamic walking are considered, and we analyze the control performances of robust stability and energy-efficiency criterions by numerical simulations. Finally we discuss the application possibility of the methods to actual walking machines from the ZMP point of view.",

Because of the strong nonlinear characteristic of the oil pressure system, conventional classic methods produce the flattery delay to the target orbit.

The sliding mode control has strong robustness to parameter change or disturbance, and the preview control prevents the flattery delay by using a future target value. In this paper, we design a preview sliding mode controller, which incorporate the advantages of both control theory, and so improves control performance.",
