The haptic device used in this research is a two degree of freedom (DOF) Pantograph planar device. Force sensing is employed to detect the user indentation of motion while assistive impedance based techniques were used to develop a clumsy motion suppression control system. The erratic motion suppression techniques and the experimental system setup were evaluated in two dimensional tracking tasks using a human subject with failure of the gross coordination of the upper limb muscle movements resulted by a disorder named dasiaMuscle Ataxiapsila. The preliminary results obtained from these experiments depict that the proposed system can be used to enhance the motion coordination for muscle ataxia impaired subjects in two dimensional tracking tasks, similar to computer mouse interactions.",

        "abstract": "Perceiving human faces is one of the most important functions for human robot interaction. The active appearance model (AAM) is a statistical approach that models the shape and texture of a target object. According to a number of the existing works, AAM has a great success in modeling human faces. Unfortunately, the traditional AAM framework could fail when the face pose changes as only 2D information is used to model a 3D object. To overcome this limitation, we propose a 3D AAM framework in which a 3D shape model and an appearance model are used to model human faces. Instead of choosing a proper weighting constant to balance the contributions from appearance similarity and the constraint on consistent 2D shape with 3D shape in the existing work, our approach directly matches 2D visual faces with the 3D shape model. No balancing weighting between 2D shape and 3D shape is needed. In addition, only frontal faces are needed for training and non-frontal faces can be aligned successfully. The experimental results with 20 subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

This paper describes a design of bipedal robot and feed forward controller that realize multi-modal locomotion by tuning appropriate leg compliance on individual locomotion. In order to tune physical leg compliance, we adopt rotational joints driven by antagonistic McKibben pneumatic muscles. Experimental results show that proper leg compliance provided by joint compliance and leg posture achieves a walking from standing and a sequential jumping. These results suggest that tunable leg compliance is powerful mechanism for bipedal robot to provide human-like multi-modal locomotion.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A human face provides a variety of different communicative functions such as identification, the perception of emotional expression, and lip-reading. For these reasons, many applications in robotics require tracking and recognizing a human face. A novel face recognition system should be able to deal with various changes in face images, such as pose, illumination, and expression, among which pose variation is the most difficult one to deal with. Therefore, face registration (alignment) is the key of robust face recognition. If we can register face images into frontal views, the recognition task would be much easier. To align a face image into a canonical frontal view, we need to know the pose information of a human head. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method for modeling a human head as a simple 3D ellipsoid. And also, we present 3D head tracking and pose estimation methods using the proposed ellipsoidal model. After recovering full motion of the head, we can register face images with pose variations into stabilized view images which are suitable for frontal face recognition. By doing so, simple and efficient frontal face recognition can be easily carried out in the stabilized texture map space instead of the original input image space. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a simple ellipsoid model, 3D head tracking experiments are carried out on 45 image sequences with ground truth from Boston University, and several face recognition experiments are conducted on our laboratory database and the Yale Face Database B by using subspace-based face recognition methods such as PCA, PCA+LAD, and DCV.",

In 3D multifingered caging, position-controlled robot hands can constrain objects and transport them, and force control is not necessary. Furthermore, even a robot hand with low degrees of freedom can constrain an object to manipulate. We show some examples of 3D multifingered caging. Then, we derive sufficient conditions for caging objects, and propose a method to plan configurations of a robot hand for caging with the sufficient conditions.",

We utilize edge points to represent detailed object shape. The 3D model is composed of the 3D points reconstructed from image edge points using structure-from-motion technique. A 2D model consists of an image in the input image sequence, edge points in the image, and the camera pose from which the image was taken. Each edge point has a SIFT descriptor for edge-point matching. The scale space analysis is done to obtain scale-invariant edge points.",

The algorithm satisfies the upper bounded curvature constraint and the continuous curvature requirement. In this work greater attention is placed on the computational complexity in comparison with other path-planning considerations. The rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) algorithm is used for the generation of collision free waypoints. The unnecessary waypoints are removed by a simple path pruning algorithm generating a piecewise linear path. Then a path smoothing algorithm utilizing cubic Bezier spiral curves to generate a continuous curvature path that satisfies the minimum radius of curvature constraint of UAV is implemented. The angle between two waypoints is the only information required for the generation of the continuous curvature path. The result shows that the suggested algorithm is simple and easy to implement compared with the Clothoids method.",

In this approach, the GPS pose is Kalman filtered using wheel odometry and inertial data and tightly integrated into a Monte Carlo localization based on 3D laser range data and a line feature reference map. By applying to this kind of sensor fusion, global localization as well as precise position tracking in close distance to buildings is enabled where only poor GPS observations are available. Following the description of the localization system, real world experiments demonstrate the functionality of the presented approach.",

We propose a commuted sliding mode control law that exploits the epipolar geometry. The major contribution of the paper is the design of a control law that solves the problem of passing through a singularity induced by the epipoles maintaining bounded inputs. Moreover, the designed control is able to drive the robot to the target even when it just starts on the singularity. The proposed approach does not need a precise camera calibration due to the robustness of the control system under uncertainty in parameters. It also ensures entire correction of both orientation and lateral error even with noise in the image. The effectiveness of our approach is tested via simulations.",

Our simulation is intended to determine how different muscles groups are acting on different joints in producing adequate static maximal fingertip forces and moments. The model is then modified to simulate injured fingers with extensor mechanism loss. We investigated two common pathologies that affect the extensor mechanism, i.e., Mallet and Boutonniere lacerations. We used a biomechanical model based on robotic principles and an optimization technique to solve the muscular redundant problem over the 3 joints of the forefinger system. The role of each tendon was quantified in the case of the healthy finger as well as in the pathological one. We showed, in particular, that the loss of strength in the finger can be regained by an increase of the tension in the interosseous tendons; however, this increase can be a source of instability in the pinch task.",

        "abstract": "We present a new behavior selection system for human-robot interaction that maps virtual buttons overlaid on the physical environment to the robotpsilas behaviors, thereby creating a clickable world. The user clicks on a virtual button and activates the associated behavior by briefly illuminating a corresponding 3D location with an off-the-shelf green laser pointer. As we have described in previous work, the robot can detect this click and estimate its 3D location using an omnidirectional camera and a pan/tilt stereo camera. In this paper, we show that the robot can select the appropriate behavior to execute using the 3D location of the click, the context around this 3D location, and its own state. For this work, the robot performs this selection process using a cascade of classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with an assistive object-fetching application. Through empirical evaluation, we show that the 3D location of the click, the state of the robot, and the surrounding context is sufficient for the robot to choose the correct behavior from a set of behaviors and perform the following tasks: pick-up a designated object from a floor or table, deliver an object to a designated person, place an object on a designated table, go to a designated location, and touch a designated location with its end effector.",

Based on this estimation, the robot can decide if the terrain is safe and may be traversed securely, or if the terrain is potentially dangerous and must be avoided or traversed carefully. This paper presents a terrain classification approach which fuses terrain predictions based on image data with predictions made by a vibration-based method. Using color images, the robot classifies terrain in front of it. When the robot later traverses the classified area, it uses vibration data to verify its former prediction. Our experiments on 14 different terrain types show that by fusing both predictions, the classification rates are significantly larger than predictions based on data from a single sensor alone.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. A nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mapping process that can be used for autonomous applications like obstacle avoidance and trajectory planning. The process is real-time capable, and works in full 3-D environments. The mapping starts with building an occupancy grid out of sensor data. Within this grid, single objects are recognized and their polygonal shapes are calculated. The model for object shape representation is rather rough and uses only right prisms and horizontal floor planes. This makes the shape calculation very fast. The extracted objects are not complex so that an external application will be fast as well. As a special application, the approach is tested on an aerial vehicle using a stereo camera system.",

Hence, a rigorous formation theory is obtained essentially based on the differential structure of the formation system. With this result, a case design using a Lyapunov based control complying with the proposed formation theory is provided to demonstrate the capability and feasibility of the proposed framework. Finally, the wander-mode simulation with three WMRs is conducted while the formation configuration may be changing on-line. It is believed that the present results can be further extended to many applications involving the nonlinear multi-agent system.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel antenna and system architecture for mobile manipulation based on passive RFID technology operating in the 850 MHz - 950 MHz ultra-high-frequency (UHF) spectrum. This system exploits the electromagnetic properties of UHF radio signals to present a mobile robot with both wide-angle dasiaperipheral visionpsila, sensing multiple tagged objects in the area in front of the robot, and focused, high-acuity dasiacentral visionpsila, sensing only tagged objects close to the end effector of the manipulator. These disparate tasks are performed using the same UHF RFID tag, coupled in two different electromagnetic modes. Wide-angle sensing is performed with an antenna designed for far-field electromagnetic wave propagation, while focused sensing is performed with a specially designed antenna mounted on the end effector that optimizes near-field magnetic coupling. We refer to this RFID system as dasiafoveatedpsila, by analogy with the anatomy of the human eye. We report a series of experiments on an untethered autonomous mobile manipulator in a 2.5D environment that demonstrate the features of this architecture using two novel behaviors, one in which data from the far-field antenna is used to determine if a specific tagged object is present in the robotpsilas working area and to navigate to that object, and a second using data from the near-field antenna to grasp a specified object from a collection of visually identical objects. The same UHF RFID tag is used to facilitate both the navigation and grasping tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an optimal gait generation framework using virtual constraint and learning optimal control. In this method, firstly, we add a constraint by a virtual potential energy to prevent the robot from falling. Secondly, we execute iterative learning control (ILC) to generate an optimal feedforward input. Thirdly, we execute iterative feedback tuning (IFT) to mitigate the strength of the virtual constraint automatically according to the progress of learning control. Consequently, it is expected to generate an optimal gait without constraint eventually. Although existing ILC frameworks require a lot of experimental data under the same initial condition, the proposed method does not need to repeat experiments under the same initial condition because the virtual constraint restricts the motion of the robot to a symmetric trajectory. Furthermore, it does not require the precise knowledge of the plant system. Finally, some numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "A gauge-invariant formulation for deriving the equations of motion of constrained or unconstrained multi-body systems (MBS) in terms of (reduced) quasi-velocities is presented. We show that the square-root factorization of mass matrix and hence the quasi-velocities are not unique, rather they are related by unitary transformations. Subsequently, we show that a particular transformation leads to significant simplification of the dynamic modeling. In this formulation the equations of motion are decoupled from those of constrained force and each system has its own independent input (that is not attainable by other formulations). This allows the possibility to develop a simpler force control action that is totally independent from the motion control action. Moreover, the square-root of the mass matrix is used to transform disparate units into homogeneous units for all the reduced quasi-velocities making the formulation suitable for hybrid force/motion control of robots.",

In this paper, we propose a generic modular embedded system architecture called SMARbot (Stevens modular autonomous robot), which consists of a set of hardware and software modules that can be configured to construct various types of robot systems. These modules include a high performance microprocessor, a reconfigurable hardware component, wireless communication, and diverse sensor and actuator interfaces. The design of all the modules in electrical subsystem, the selection criteria for module components, and the real-time operating system are described.

Finally, an approach which computes per-section endpoints given only a final-section endpoint provides a complete solution to the multi-section inverse kinematics problem. The results of implementing these algorithms in simulation and on a physical continuum robot are presented and possible applications are discussed.",

We apply this control to ball catching task by a robot arm. This approach contains the processes: 1. To achieve the control of robot arm 3D motion using visual observation, we employ no information to reconstruct 3D space from the 2D images, and only define the goal of the task in the image planes. 2. Then we apply the control to achieve all the 2D defined tasks simultaneously. 3. If all the respective goal defined in images are accomplished simultaneously, the 3D task can be interpreted to be achieved. Further more, in the proposed method, we estimate the Jacobian on-line to combine the image motion and 3D motion of the robot arm without the prior knowledge of the arm and camera structures for hand-eye and camera calibrations. The actual experiments show the feasibility of the proposed method for visual control of the ball catching robot.",

        "abstract": "In continuation of our previous work on visual, appearance-based localization in manually built maps in this paper we present a novel appearance-based, visual SLAM approach. The essential contribution of this work is, an adaptive sensor model which is estimated online and a graph matching scheme to evaluate the likelihood of a given topological map. Both methods enable the combination of an appearance-based, visual localization concept with a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) as state estimator to a real-world suitable, online SLAM approach. In our system, each RBPF particle incrementally constructs its own graph-based environment model which is labeled with visual appearance features (extracted from panoramic 360deg snapshots of the environment) and the estimated poses of the places where the snapshots were captured. The essential advantages of this appearance-based SLAM approach are its low memory and computing-time requirements. Therefore, the algorithm is able to perform in real-time. Finally, we present the results of SLAM experiments in two challenging environments that investigate the stability and localization accuracy of this SLAM technique.",

In this paper, we analyze the handshake motion between humans and propose a handshake approaching motion model and a shake-motion leading model based on the analysis. In the handshake approaching motion model, a robot can generate handshake approaching motion that is accepted psychologically by humans using the second-order lag element and the dead time element from trajectory of human hand. Furthermore, a shake-motion leading model generates a leading motion in order to transit from approaching motion to shaking motion. A handshake robot system that adopts these proposed models is developed. The effectiveness of these models is demonstrated by sensory evaluation using the handshake robot system.",

        "abstract": "Tensegrity structures appeared in the science community about half a century ago, but they have already been applied to several heterogeneous research fields, such as architecture, civil engineering, space and even biology. Such structures keep a stable volume in space due to an intricate balance of forces between a disjoint set of rigid elements (bars) and a continuous set of tensile elements (cables). The use of tensegrity structures in robotics is still new and there exist only a handful of works about this subject. Some of their main features such as light weight, flexibility, energetic efficiency and redundancy, make them interesting candidates for both mobile robots and manipulators. In this paper, a new method to detect and avoid both internal collisions between the structure members and external collisions with the environment is presented. In this way, we are providing a fundamental tool to develop more complete form-finding procedures and path-planning strategies for tensegrity structures.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a solution to the problem of steering a group of real omnidirectional mobile robots along a given path, while maintaining a desired formation pattern. This problem can be divided into a leader agent subproblem and a follower agent subproblem such that a leader agent follows a given path and each follower agent tracks a trajectory, estimated by using the leaderpsilas information. In this paper, we exploit nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) as a local control law for real-world experiments due to its advantages of taking the robot constraints and future information into account. To solve the path following problem for the leader agent, we propose to integrate the rate of progression of a virtual vehicle to be followed along that path into the local cost function of NMPC. After the open-loop optimization problem is solved, the optimal rate of progression at each time step in the future is obtained. This information and the leaderpsilas current state are broadcasted to all follower agents. With respect to a desired formation configuration and a reference path, each follower agent can estimate its own reference trajectory by using the leaderpsilas information and its time stamp. NMPC is also employed as a local control law to steer the follower agent to track that reference trajectory. Our approach was validated by experiments using three omnidirectional mobile robots.",

In dynamic and highly populated environments, this problem presents a complex and computationally demanding task. It can be divided in sub-problems such as robotpsilas relative motion compensation, feature extraction, measurement clustering, data association and targetspsila state vector estimation. In this paper we present an innovative approach that addresses all these issues exploiting various probabilistic and deterministic techniques. The algorithm utilizes real laser-scanner data to dynamically extract moving objects from their background environment, using a time-fading grid map method, and tracks the identified targets employing a joint probabilistic data association with interacting multiple model (JPDA-IMM) algorithm. The resulting technique presents a computationally efficient approach to already existing target-tracking research for real time application scenarios.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Position sensors using magnetic effects, such as magnetic encoders (MEs), are increasingly used in many industrial applications. These include motor control, electro-mechanical braking systems, and precision measurement systems. The magnetic encoders generally provide a pair of sinusoidal signals dephasing 90\u00b0 to each other. Unfortunately, the signals obtained are not ideal, in that they always exist with the DC offsets, different amplitudes, phase-shifts and waveform distortions. These are further compromised by noise and changes in operating conditions. This paper proposes an approach for real-time correcting and tracking ME signals based on the Advanced Adaptive Digital Phase-Locked Loop (AADPLL) technique. AADPLL provides a robust filtering characteristic as well as a wideband of input frequency. It can effectively filter noise and improve the accuracy of ME signals. AADPLL also takes advantage of tracking high-speed input signals without time-lag, unlike traditional filters. A quadrature pulse interpolator is introduced to obtain high resolution. This interpolator uses look-up tables (LUTs) to store pulse-out values in one period of MEs signals. These LUTs are reduced in size for easy implementation in Digital Signal Processor (DSP) hardware platforms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we show that a biped robot can walk dynamically using a simple control technique inspired from human locomotion. We introduce four critical angles that affect robot speed and step length. Our control approach consists in tuning the PID parameters of each joint for increasing stability of the walk. This method could be easily implemented in real time because it needs acceptable calculation time. We validated the control approach to a dynamic simulation of our 14DOF biped called ROBIAN. A comparison with human walking is presented and discussed. We prove that we can maintain robot stability and walk cycle\u2019s repetition without referencing a predefined trajectory or detecting the center of pressure. Results show that the walk of the biped is very similar to human one. A power consumption analysis confirms that our approach could be implemented on the real robot ROBIAN.",

        "abstract": "The development of assistive technologies, especially mobility devices, has an important impact on the daily activities and social participation of elderly people. The authors have developed a new mobility aid, ldquoTread-Walkrdquo, which extends mobility activities, maintains body function and maintains natural walking appearance. In the current research, we designed and developed a more natural operation system based on human walking movements. The new system concept is to use separate treadmill belts to measure the acceleration/deceleration force of each leg and use it as the input signal to change the direction of the system. This new device, ldquoTread-Walk 2rdquo, permits the user to walk naturally while a servo motor amplifies his normal walking speed. Its main components are a treadmill with two belts, two middle driving wheels, and four omni-directional casters. Sensors in the treadmill detect forward and backward reaction forces that are applied to the surfaces of the belts during walking. These forces for each leg are recognized as signal of the userpsilas intention to change direction and are used to turn the vehicle. These sensors also control the rotational speed of the driving wheel motors. Preliminary evaluations indicate that this turning system is both safe and effective for use by elderly people.",

As a result of its structural compliance, the meso-manipulator results particularly suitable for a rehabilitative application: after having coupled the manipulator to a common cloth-glove joined to the mobile platform of the robot, the patientpsilas finger can be driven to the required movement. As external loads can also be imposed to the involved tendons, the realized motion parts performed by the robot and by the patient can be quantified. In this way, the surgeon can constantly monitor the therapy trend, but also the patient has an objective quantification of his/her improvement.",

The contact wrench sum (CWS for short) is used as the criterion to judge if the contact between the robot and the environment is strongly stable under the sufficient friction assumption, where the contact points are not coplanar and the normal vectors at the points are not identical. It is confirmed that the proposed pattern generator can make the robot walk as desired in dynamics simulations and experiments, and the motions can be improved by a hand position control and using waist joints.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of the driving environment is essential for robotic vehicles to comply with traffic rules while autonomously traversing intersections. However, due to limited sensing coverage and continuous changes in driving conditions, rigidly-mounted sensors may not guarantee coverage of all regions of interest, all the time. Unobserved regions around intersections increase uncertainty in driving conditions. This paper describes a dynamic sensor planning method that searches for the optimal angles of two pointable sensors to maximally cover relevant unobserved regions of interest. The obtained angles are used to adjust the orientations of the pointable sensors and hence reduce uncertainty around intersections. Simulation results show that the sensor planning method increases the percentage of covered area. In addition to the sensor pointing problem, we provide an initial discussion of how to reason about occlusions in an urban environment. Occlusions caused by structures and other environmental features can increase uncertainty in driving environments. An occlusion handling method is used to detect these occlusions and enable our vehicle to model the presence of occluded regions. An awareness of occlusions enables safer driving decisions.",

        "abstract": "We present a visual servoing scheme enabling non-holonomic mobile robots with a fixed pinhole camera to reach and follow a continuous path on the ground. The controller utilizes only a small set of features extracted from the image plane, without using the complete geometric representation of the path. The scheme is position-based, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis is carried out. The performance of our control design is experimentally validated on a car-like robot equipped with a pinhole camera.",

The system recognizes arbitrary timed speech with position information in a noisy housing environment. The microphone array is attached to the ceiling, and localizes sound source direction in azimuth and elevation, then separates multiple sound sources using delay and sum beam forming (DSBF) and frequency band separation (FBS) algorithm. We implement the sound localization and separation method on our 32 channel microphone array. The separated sound source is recognized using an open source speech recognizer. These sound localization, separation and recognition functions are implemented as online processing in real world. We define four indices to evaluate the performance of the recognition system, and the efficiency in a noisy environment or with distant sound sources is confirmed from experiments in varied conditions. Finally, an application for a mobile robot interface is reported.",

Although Sampling Based Motion planning algorithms have shown success in many robotic problems, problems that exhibit ldquonarrow passagerdquo properties involving kinodynamic planning of high dimensional vehicles like aerial vehicles still present computational challenges. In this work, to solve the kinodynamic motion planning problem of an unmanned helicopter, we suggest a two step planner. In the first step, the planner explores the environment through a randomized reachability tree search using an approximate line segment model. The resulting connecting path is converted into flight way points through a line-of-sight segmentation. In the second step, every consecutive way points are connected with B-Spline curves and these curves are repaired probabilistically to obtain a dynamically feasible path. Numerical simulations in 3D indicate the ability of the method to provide real-time solutions in dense and complex environments.",

In this paper, we extend this approach to a more generic procedure handling simultaneously constraints in joint space and in task space by combining directly the probabilistic representation of the task constraints with a simple Jacobian-based inverse kinematics solution. Experiments with two 5-DOFs Katana robots are presented with manipulation tasks that consist of handling and displacing a set of objects.",

With the sketch interface, the user draws a rough map to give navigation tasks to robots. Because sketched maps often suffer from various inaccuracies and large errors in landmarks, we discuss what kinds of uncertainties in the rough maps would mainly have effects on navigating a robot. The effects of such inaccuracies on robot navigation are analyzed in simulated environments. A quantitative navigability measure of rough maps is then developed based on the analysis. Experimental results are also presented for validating the navigability measure.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an alternative formulation for the Bayesian feature-based simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem, using a random finite set approach. For a feature based map, SLAM requires the joint estimation of the vehicle location and the map. The map itself involves the joint estimation of both the number of features and their states (typically in a 2D Euclidean space), as an a priori unknown map is completely unknown in both landmark location and number. In most feature based SLAM algorithms, so-called dasiafeature managementpsila algorithms as well as data association hypotheses along with extended Kalman filters are used to generate the joint posterior estimate. This paper, however, presents a recursive filtering algorithm which jointly propagates both the estimate of the number of landmarks, their corresponding states, and the vehicle pose state, without the need for explicit feature management and data association algorithms. Using a finite set-valued joint vehicle-map state and set-valued measurements, the first order statistic of the set, called the intensity, is propagated via the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, from which estimates of the map and vehicle can be jointly extracted. Assuming a mildly non-linear Gaussian system, an extended-Kalman Gaussian Mixture implementation of the recursion is then tested for both feature-based robotic mapping (known location) and SLAM. Results from the experiments show promising performance for the proposed SLAM framework, especially in environments of high spurious measurements.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robotic walker system with standing and walking assistance function. Our system focuses on domestic use for aged person who needs nursing in their daily life. Our key ideas are two topics. The first topic is combination of standing assistance function and walking assistance function. In previous works, many assistance devices are specialized in only \u201cstanding-up operation\u201d or \u201cwalking operation\u201d. However, in their daily life, elderly person needs standing, walking and seating assistance continuously by a same device. Our developing assistance system can support both operations by a small sized mechanism with low cost for domestic use. The second topic is steady standing assistance operation using an assistance manipulator and an active walker. In order to use the remaining physical strength of the patient, it is required to maintain the patient\u2019s body posture which enables him to use own strength easily. According to the patient\u2019s posture during standing up, our proposed system selects more appropriate device and controller, and realizes the standing assistance with steady posture of the patient based on the nursing specialists. The performance of our proposed system is verified by experiments using our prototype.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle following can be achieved by minimizing the relative information (Kullback-Leibler or K-L distance), between the estimated poses of leader and follower vehicles by formulating the vehicle following system as an optimization problem. The aim is to search for an optimal control action for the follower vehicle in the admissible control command space. Relative information is used as a metric in the search space and for evaluating the expected performance of vehicle following. With this metric, and based on the assumption that both vehicle pose (position and orientation) distributions are Gaussian functions, the K-L distance of the vehicle following system can be computed. With a series of admissible actions, such as steering and velocity commands, for the follower vehicle at each pose prediction step, and by minimizing the K-L distance, an optimized action for the follower vehicle can be obtained. The proposed vehicle following algorithm has been tested and the performance of the follower vehicle when the leader undergoes various kinds of maneuvers has been analyzed. Results using this new method, as compared to classical methods, have shown the advantages of this method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a beat-counting robot that can count musical beats aloud, i.e., speak \u201cone, two, three, four, one, two, \u2026\u201d along music, while listening to music by using its own ears. Music-understanding robots that interact with humans should be able not only to recognize music internally, but also to express their own internal states. To develop our beat-counting robot, we have tackled three issues: (1) recognition of hierarchical beat structures, (2) expression of these structures by counting beats, and (3) suppression of counting voice (self-generated sound) in sound mixtures recorded by ears. The main issue is (3) because the interference of counting voice in music causes the decrease of the beat recognition accuracy. So we designed the architecture for music-understanding robot that is capable of dealing with the issue of self-generated sounds. To solve these issues, we took the following approaches: (1) beat structure prediction based on musical knowledge on chords and drums, (2) speed control of counting voice according to music tempo via a vocoder called STRAIGHT, and (3) semi-blind separation of sound mixtures into music and counting voice via an adaptive filter based on ICA (Independent Component Analysis) that uses the waveform of the counting voice as a prior knowledge. Experimental result showed that suppressing robot\u2019s own voice improved music recognition capability.",

        "abstract": "Musical beat tracking is one of the effective technologies for human-robot interaction such as musical sessions. Since such interaction should be performed in various environments in a natural way, musical beat tracking for a robot should cope with noise sources such as environmental noise, its own motor noises, and self voices, by using its own microphone. This paper addresses a musical beat tracking robot which can step, scat and sing according to musical beats by using its own microphone. To realize such a robot, we propose a robust beat tracking method by introducing two key techniques, that is, spectro-temporal pattern matching and echo cancellation. The former realizes robust tempo estimation with a shorter window length, thus, it can quickly adapt to tempo changes. The latter is effective to cancel self noises such as stepping, scatting, and singing. We implemented the proposed beat tracking method for Honda ASIMO. Experimental results showed ten times faster adaptation to tempo changes and high robustness in beat tracking for stepping, scatting and singing noises. We also demonstrated the robot times its steps while scatting or singing to musical beats.",

The robotic emotion was entrained to human emotion by using a vector field of dynamics. The robotic facial expression using a communication robot ldquoKamin_FA1rdquo was realized dynamically based on the robotic emotion. In the experiment of communication, the human impression was changed by the strength of synchronization of robot.

The conventional robotic catapults based on the closed elastica are robotic elements for generating impulsive motions by utilizing the snap-through buckling. In a typical robotic catapult, the two ends of an elastic strip are fixed to a free joint and an active joint, respectively. Here we found that by adding only the high stiffness at the free joint, compared to the conventional type, more elastic energy can be stored and release surely without loss of a characteristic of generating impulsive motion repeatedly. By utilizing the high stiffness endpoint, we develop a faster impulsive swimming robot than the conventional one.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A key requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications is the attitude stabilization of the aircraft, which requires the knowledge of its orientation. It is now well established that traditional navigation equipments, like GPS or INS, suffer from several disadvantages. That is why some works have suggested a vision-based approach of the problem. Especially, catadioptric vision is more and more used since it permits to gather much more information from the environment, compared to traditional perspective cameras, and therefore the robustness of the UAV attitude estimation is improved. Rotation estimation from conventional and catadioptric images has been extensively studied. Whereas interesting results can be obtained, the existing methods have non-negligible limitations such as difficult features matching (e.g. repeated texture, blurring or illumination changing) or a high computational cost (e.g. vanishing point extraction or analyze in frequency domain). In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a top-down approach for estimating the rotation and extracting the vanishing points in catadioptric images. This new framework is accurate and can run in real-time. To obtain the ground truth data, we also calibrate our catadioptric camera with a gyroscope. Finally, experimental results on a real video sequence are presented and compared to the ground truth data obtained by the gyroscope.",

If numerous metrics have already been defined for on-road vehicles, few approaches are suitable for fast motions in a natural environment (mainly due to tire/ground contact specificity and variability). This paper proposes an algorithm dedicated to the estimation and prediction of one metric, namely lateral load transfer (LLT), in order to anticipate rollover situations on an irregular and natural ground. It is based on a vehicle dynamic model, used jointly with a backstepping observer. It allows to take into account tire/ground contact nonlinearities and variability, which impact the rollover tendency. The efficiency of the metric is investigated through advanced simulations and full scale experiments on a Kymco quad bike.",

These robots are modeled as homogeneous, distributed robots, with only one simple short range sensor. Our simple robots are tasked to form and hold a desired swarm shape, independent of the total number of agents. If this shape is damaged by the removal of some of the robots, the remaining agents will recover the former shape, but on a smaller scale. These shapes can also have a pattern such as a picture or drawing displayed on them by controlling the individual robots color, symbolically representing the differentiation of agents within the swarm. This pattern will resize to fit the existing swarm. With the ability to synchronize in time, the swarm gains the ability to change the pattern displayed, resulting in a moving image.",

Our approach presents a hierarchical scheme that relies on the ldquostabilityrdquo of a subset of features given by a sensor to perform an initial robust classification based on unsupervised techniques. The obtained results are used as labels to train a set of supervised classifiers, which can be then combined to improve the final classification accuracy. The proposed architecture is general and can be instantiated in a variety of ways, using different sensors and classifiers. The applicability and validity of the proposed architecture is evaluated for a particular realization based on range and visual information that achieves 83% accuracy without using manually labeled data. Experimental results also demonstrate how accuracy can be maintained through self-training capabilities when working conditions change.",

In our previous work , we have introduced the map match SLAM approach for mapping with sonar range readings: Extending the grid-based Rao-Blackwellized particle filter SLAM approach, in Map Match SLAM, a local map is maintained by each particle in addition to the global map. The local map is used to represent the most recent observations, and weighting of the particles is done based on the compliance of the local and the global map. In this paper, we show how RBPF SLAM can also be applied for mapping and path reconstruction with a stereo camera or a single monocular camera, respectively. By mapping with completely different sensors such as sonar, stereo, or monocular cameras, we prove the wide range applicability of RBPF SLAM and our map match SLAM computational framework.",

        "abstract": "The face is such a salient feature of a person that it plays a crucial role in physical, psychological, and emotional makeup. Hence facial paralysis, which is the loss of voluntary muscle movement of one or both sides of the face, apart from making physical disturbances, can also be an alarming and depressing event in onepsilas life. Although therapeutically and surgery based treatment methods are available, they can work on temporary paralysis only. Facial uplifts done on permanently paralyzed patients will only attempt to reduce the facial asymmetry of a neutral faces. Despite facial paralysis been fairly common, over the years only a very limited amount of effort has been put in to the development of supporting systems for facial paralyzed patients and it is also virtually zero in the robotics field. This paper discusses a novel method; an expressive mask based on robotics technology while giving strong references to human anatomy. The developed robot mask uses artificial muscles based on soft actuators as they can closely model natural muscles while producing silent actuations. With 6 artificial muscles, tests were done on one side of the face of a healthy human. We also explain the suitability of proposed artificial muscles through preliminary experiments and conclude by underlining its suitability as a worthy candidate.",

Moreover, robust loop closure detection procedure is the other consequence of this method. Experiments with a low-cost IEEE 1394 webcam and a range finder illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in drift-free SLAM at loop closing motions in unstructured environments.",

        "abstract": "The ability of autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robots to rapidly and accurately predict their mobility characteristics is an important requirement for their use in unstructured environments. Most methods for mobility prediction, however, assume precise knowledge of environmental (i.e. terrain) properties. In practical conditions, significant uncertainty is associated with terrain parameter estimation from robotic sensors, and this uncertainty must be considered in a mobility prediction algorithm. Here a method for efficient mobility prediction based on the stochastic response surface approach is presented that explicitly considers terrain parameter uncertainty. The method is compared to a Monte Carlo-based method and simulations show that the stochastic response surface approach can be used for efficient, accurate prediction of mobile robot mobility.",

The formation control problem is successfully posed as a synchronization control problem, and the concept of synchronization error is created for measuring the formation control effect. A decentralized trajectory tracking controller is developed with feedback of both position and synchronization errors, formed with a combination of feedforward, feedback and a saturation control, without significant use of robot models. It is proven that this synchronization controller guarantees both position and synchronization errors to converge to zero. The rotary control, in the form of a computed torque control, ensures that the robot is always oriented towards its desired position to assist the formation control in translation. Experiments were performed on three mobile robots in a formation switch task. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous formation control approach.",

We use three types of sensors mounted on a regular game table. The movement of a game rod is measured by an optical distance sensor. Its turning is observed by a magnetic rotary encoder. Two laser measurement systems are synchronized to determine the position of the ball. The raw sensor data is smoothed by an approach using multi-model Kalman filter. We developed several software modules for the system. The modules provide a basis for the future research.",

The assistant system designs control signals such that the helicopter tracks the reference signals. The proposed system has the following four functions: automatic takeoff and landing, control channel selection, flight in a desired area, and automatic motion generation. They enables beginners to control an unmanned helicopter. The system provides real actions of unmanned helicopters. This is the main difference from flight simulators.",

The first 4 axis model is described here but more complete models are already planned: a 7 axis model as well as portable versions. Its back-drivable, high efficiency, low inertia actuators provide a high capacity (around 40 N continuous effort at the hand) and allow hybrid force-position control without requiring any force sensor. Its first application is currently a research program in rehabilitation (BRAHMA project) and professional use is already in view. Assistance tasks for disabled persons (carrying a bottle) are also typical tasks to be performed by ABLE as well as intuitive telerobotics, haptic device for VR, and sport training, etc. Furthermore, its versatility and simple design allow industrial versions to become soon available.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in 2\u00bdD and 3D hybrid microassembly using MEMS snap fasteners and die-level bonding for interconnects, makes possible the miniaturization of exciting new small robots configured for various functions, such as flying, crawling, or jumping. ARRIpede is one example of a \u201cdie\u2014size\u201d crawling microrobot constructed by assembly and die stacking. It consists of a MEMS die \u201cbody\u201d, in-plane electrothermal actuators, vertically assembled legs, and an electronic \u201cbackpack\u201d to generate the necessary gait sequence. The robot has been designed using a stick-slip simulation model for a target volume of 1.5cm x 1.5cm x 0.5 cm, a 3.8g mass, and velocities up to 3 mm/s. Even though work remains to be completed in packaging the robot, we demonstrated that the robot design is sound by experimentally evaluating the leg actuation force, the payload carrying capacity, the power consumption, and the manipulation ability of an inverted ARRIpede prototype. A configuration that carries a payload approximately equal to its own weight shows excellent steering ability. A reasonable match between simulations and experiments is noted, for example, when the legs are actuated at 45 Hz and 10V, the crawling velocity of the microrobot was experimentally measured to be 0.84mm/s or 18.7 \u03bcm per step, while the simulated leg displacement was 18.5 \u03bcm per step. The prototyped \u201cconveyor\u201d mode had a maximum measured linear velocity in excess of 1.5mm/s, while consuming approximately 500 mW of power. We expect that for achieving lower speeds, such as 0.15 mm/s, the power consumption can be reduced to a few mW, enabling untethered operation.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current telesurgical robotic systems are designed to be used exclusively in stationary environments. The ability of a robotic master and slave system to monitor and correct for acceleration induced movement errors would enable conduct of delicate medical procedures onboard moving vehicles. Such operations, without compensation, would be complicated by unintended movement of the surgeonpsilas hands and master controls, causing potentially dangerous response of the surgical robot manipulators. In caring for astronauts on long haul interplanetary missions, it is essential to compensate for alterations in gravitational acceleration when delivering telesurgical or autonomous robotic therapy in the microgravity of space or on non-terrestrial planetary surfaces. This paper introduces new work focused on compensating for unintended master and slave manipulator motion resulting from accelerations of the environment within which they are operated. Experimental results from vehicular operation show how induced motion can be reduced by introduction of dynamic electronic balancing of the master manipulator device and the addition of variable damping proportional to vehicle acceleration. A surgical master console and robot were operated in the micro-gravity and variable gravity of the NASA C-9 airborne parabolic laboratory. Robot kinematics data and surveys of surgeon and astronaut users show that compensating for different gravitational conditions improves usability of the system. Further experiments using an elevator as a motion platform demonstrate the effectiveness of acceleration compensation.",

In this contribution, stereo-vision is used to generate a number of minimal-set motion hypothesis. By using EM-SE(3), which involves expectation maximization on a local linearization of the rigid-body motion group SE(3), a distinction can be made between inlier and outlier motion hypothesis. At the same time a robust mean motion as well as its associated uncertainty can be computed on the selected inlier motion hypothesis. The data-sets used for evaluation consist of synthetic and large real-world urban scenes, including several independently moving objects. Using these data-sets, it will be shown that EM-SE(3) is both more accurate and more efficient than RANSAC.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an action planning algorithm and its evaluation method based on dynamic simulation for a novel type of hybrid leg-wheel rover for planetary exploration. Hybrid leg-wheel robots are recently receiving a growing interest from the space community to explore planets, since they offer an appropriate solution to gain improved speed and mobility on unstructured terrain. However, in order to fully reach the hybrid mechanismpsilas potential, it is necessary to establish an optimal way to define when to use one over the other locomotion mode, depending on the soil conditions and topology. Even though this step is crucial, little attention has been devoted to this topic by the robotic community. The switching of motion mode, that is either wheel or leg are the actions to be planned, that we are considering in this paper. We aim at generating the safest and the least energy demanding path to reach a point of scientific interest. In order to define the optimal path with the set of switching actions required for the robot to follow it, the authors developed an action planning algorithm and a path evaluation method based on a four steps approach. First, an optimal candidate path on a rough terrain is generated based on topology and specificationspsila criteria functions. Then switching actions are defined along this path depending on the hybrid robotpsilas performances in each motion mode. The next step is a dynamic simulation of the robot controlled to follow the path. Finally, the path is evaluated based on the energy profile spent by the actuators and calculated by the simulation. Demonstrations for the proposed technique are addressed along with a discussion on characteristics of the candidate path and the energy profile of the robot.",

        "abstract": "In environments which possess relatively few features that enable a robot to unambiguously determine its location, global localization algorithms can result in multiple hypotheses locations of a robot. In such a scenario the robot, for effective localization, has to be actively guided to those locations where there is a maximum chance of eliminating most of the ambiguous states - which is often referred to as dasiaactive localizationpsila. When extended to multi robotic scenarios where all robots possess more than one hypothesis of their position, there is the opportunity to do better by using robots apart from obstacles as dasiahypotheses resolving agentspsila. The paper presents a unified framework accounting for the map structure as well as measurement amongst robots while guiding a set of robots to locations where they can singularize to a unique state. The appropriateness of our approach is demonstrated empirically in both simulation & real-time (on Amigobots) and its efficacy verified. Extensive comparative analysis portrays the advantage of the current method over others that do not perform active localization in a multi-robotic sense.",

        "abstract": "Passive-dynamic walkers are mechanical devices that walk down a slope without motors or controllers. In this paper we present our research in two distinctive parts. First, a design improvement on the classical four-legged passive-dynamic walking machine and second, an investigation on the timing of different stages in the human walking cycle and comparison of the results with the results obtained from our walker. We built a four-legged passive-dynamic walking machine with its inner and outer legs connected rigidly two by two, making it equivalent to a biped machine from a dynamics point of view. It features a new mechanism for an active release of the locked extended knee instead of using the more common knee-locking via suction cups mechanism. We conducted a series of experiments with this modified walker in which we counted the steps it made while walking down an incline. We compared the results with a previous design of the knee-locking mechanism that used permanent magnets. The improved model made an increased number of successful walks down the slope from which we concluded that the new active release mechanism is more reliable and easy to use and set up. For the walking cycle investigation, we put visual markers on a person walking casually down the same slope that we used for the walker experiments. We took a video of that person and measured the times between different events in one walking cycle. We calculated the average time intervals and made a comparison between the test subject and our walker within one cycle. We feel the timings derived from this investigation can be used to make the gait of our walker more human-like.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to autonomously extract object features that describe their dynamics from active sensing experiences. The model is composed of a dynamics learning module and a feature extraction module. Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB) is utilized for the dynamics learning module, learning and self-organizing the sequences of robot and object motions. A hierarchical neural network is linked to the input of RNNPB as the feature extraction module for extracting object features that describe the object motions. The two modules are simultaneously trained using image and motion sequences acquired from the robotpsilas active sensing with objects. Experiments are performed with the robotpsilas pushing motion with a variety of objects to generate sliding, falling over, bouncing, and rolling motions. The results have shown that the model is capable of extracting features that distinguish the characteristics of object dynamics.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we talk about compliant bistable mechanisms, a class of mechanical systems that benefit from both compliance, allowing easy fabrication at small scales, and bistability, which brings two passive and stable positions. These properties make them first-class candidates for micro-switches, but also several other robotics appliances. We focus on the actuation of a simple class of bistable mechanisms, the compressed bistable beams, using an innovative smart material, the MFC (for macro-fiber composite). This kind of bistable system is made of a buckled beam, while the MFC is a piezo-based actuator, which can accept large extension deflections (up to 0.5% with a piezo technology). We discuss the impact of the actuator position, and show that it has a major impact on the system response and the switching excitation level. This helps to build more powerful systems and/or reduce the actuator size.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive nonlinear controller is proposed that can couple impedance-type haptic devices with admittance-type virtual environments. The controller, which takes into account the nonlinear dynamics of the haptic device and parametric uncertainty in the userpsilas arm dynamics, replaces the natural dynamics of the interface with that of a mass-type virtual tool. The transparency and stability of the proposed haptic control system is investigated using a Lyapunov analysis. Low-pass filtering of the hand force measurement in a discrete-time implementation of the controller is shown to significantly reduce the lower bound on achievable synthesized inertia. The theoretical results are supported by experiments in which the proposed adaptive controller exhibits a far superior performance by reducing the haptic device interfering dynamics and rendering highly rigid contacts, when compared to a conventional spring-damper coupler.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, automatic path tracking of a four-wheel-steering vehicle in presence of sliding is addressed. The attractive feature of such a steering system is that, despite of sliding phenomena, both lateral and angular deviations can be explicitly controlled. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated that high-precision path tracking on a low grip terrain can be achieved with two-wheel-steering vehicles. However, in this case, only the lateral deviation is kept satisfactorily close to zero, the angular deviation is non null in order to compensate for sliding effects. In this paper, previous adaptive control laws are extended to the case of four-wheel-steering mobile robots with the aim to servo both lateral and angular deviations. Relying on an extended kinematic model, a backstepping control approach, which considers successively front and rear steering control, has been designed. Real world experiments have been carried out on a low adherent terrain with a four-wheel-steering vehicle equipped with a single RTK-GPS. This demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed control law and its robustness in real all-terrain conditions.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with reflexes against sudden obstacles for humanoid robots, which are combined with a proposed piecewise-linear pattern generator. The reflex action consists of modulating the motors\u2019 commands by the outputs of the force sensors located under the robot legs, and through a given primitive neural network previously proposed. Eventually, the primitive reflex is modified by the afferent signals to be more adaptable and robust against sudden obstacles. The final reflex structure enables the response of the sensory signals to be coordinated and modulated with locomotion controller\u2019s outputs to achieve an intended stabilizing behavior of the robot. The effectiveness of the proposed reflex is demonstrated by experiment using Fujitsu\u2019s humanoid robot HOAP-3. It is shown that the primitive reflex movement previously proposed becomes robust against sudden obstacle that hits the robot sole plate at different locations. The proposed reflex system, therefore, contributes towards the safer interaction of the humanoid robot with the environment.",

The basic position control approach for the robot has been extended to patient-cooperative strategies. These strategies provide more freedom and allow patients to actively influence their training. However, patients are likely to need additional support during patient-cooperative training. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on iterative learning control that shapes a supportive torque field. The torque field is supposed to assist the patient as much as needed in performing the desired task. We evaluated the algorithm in a proof-of-concept experiment with 3 healthy subjects. Results showed that the amount of support was automatically adapted to the activity and the individual needs of the subjects. Furthermore, the support improved the performance of the subjects.",

(2) Automatic checking system for adhesion state was not developed. (3) Automatic micro manipulation system was not developed. Considering the above, in this paper, we propose a method to automatically check adhesion state by vision. Firstly, we develop a method to estimate the amplitude of the oscillation using the blur resulted from the oscillation. We call the estimated amplitude AIV (amplitude indicating value).

        "abstract": "This video shows the functionalities of a 3 serial DOF robotic arm. Each DOF is actuated with a patent pending Differential Elastic Actuator (DEA) [1,2]. Compared to the abundantly studied Series Elastic Actuator [3,4], DEA uses a differential coupling between a high impedance mechanical speed source and a low impedance mechanical spring. Possible implementations of a mechanical differential include the use of a standard gearbox, harmonic drive, cycloidal gearbox, bar mechanism, cable mechanism and all other mechanism that implement a differential function between three mechanical ports. For the implementation reported in this video, we used a harmonic drive for a very compact design. A passive torsion spring (thus the name Elastic), with a known impedance characteristic corresponding to the spring stiffness, is used, with an electrical DC brushless motor. A non-turning sensor connected in series with the spring measures the torque output of the actuator. Figure 1 shows our detailed implementation design, and Figure 2 illustrates one DEA.",

FIPA standard protocols implemented by the JADE library provide the standard functionality for a number of tasks. Robot behaviors are built upon the Player middleware. Such components provide off-the-shelf tools which allow a straightforward implementation of indoor localization and navigation tasks for a team of mobile robots. Such integration combines proven mobile robot algorithms with a distributed infrastructure, and extends the capabilities from a robot alone to a whole team of robots, thus allowing the development of cooperative applications. As a proof of concept, an auction-like goal assignment task is presented: the robot team is given a goal, and each robot proposes an estimated cost for achieving it, then the best proposal is selected. Most of the control flow is automated by the standard interaction protocols. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of combining both frameworks, for a practical yet sound development of multi-robot applications.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the usage of persistent point feature histograms for the problem of aligning point cloud data views into a consistent global model. Given a collection of noisy point clouds, our algorithm estimates a set of robust 16D features which describe the geometry of each point locally. By analyzing the persistence of the features at different scales, we extract an optimal set which best characterizes a given point cloud. The resulted persistent features are used in an initial alignment algorithm to estimate a rigid transformation that approximately registers the input datasets. The algorithm provides good starting points for iterative registration algorithms such as ICP (Iterative Closest Point), by transforming the datasets to its convergence basin. We show that our approach is invariant to pose and sampling density, and can cope well with noisy data coming from both indoor and outdoor laser scans.",

The objective of this testbed is to show the advantages of helicopters that use an active helideck upon landing on and taking off from ships or from offshore structures. Active-helideck compensates simulated movements of a ship at sea. The main goal of this study is to maintain the robot\u2019s end effector (helideck) in a quasi-static position in accordance to an absolute inertial frame. Compensation is carried out through the coordinate action of its six prismatic actuators in function of an inertial measurement unit. Moreover, the simulation of the sea movement is done by a parallel robot called ship platform with three degrees of freedom. The ship platform is built with a vertical oscillation along the z axis, i.e. heave, and rotates on remaining axes, i.e. roll and pitch. Active helideck is able to compensate simulated movements by considering the ship as an inertial frame as observed in the experiment.",

The approach is based on formulating an inverse kinematics problem under an inexact context. This procedure permits to deal with the avoidance of obstacles with an appropriate and easy to compute null space vector; whereas the avoidance of singularities is attained by the proper pseudo inverse perturbation. Here the computation of the inverse kinematics problem is performed by a properly trained ANN and including a null space vector for obstacle avoidance which is also realized by another properly trained ANN. The approach is tested on the simulation of a planar redundant manipulator performing some obstacle avoidance tasks. From the results obtained, the approach compares favorably with the numerical approach.",

Current solutions to the indoor localization problem are either both unreliable and inaccurate, or very expensive. In this paper we propose, design and build a low-cost, robust and accurate indoor localization system using laser light sources. The system calculates the coordinates of a robotic arm by using triangulation algorithms with precisely measured values of the angles of the receiver with respect to the three laser emitters. A system of three rotating lasers and receiver unit was built and deployed in the wing of an aircraft. Using this system, a robotic arm could be localized accurately within error margins defined approximately by Gaussian distributions centered at the object\u2019s true coordinate values and with standard deviations of 0.19 mm, 0.11 mm and 0.34 mm in the x, y and z coordinate directions respectively. The system was also used to detect vertical drop in the robotic arm due to its weight as it extends to perform fitting operations on the skin of the wing. Feedback from the laser localization system was used to adjust the position of the tip of the robotic arm in order to perform a sequence of high precision docking tasks within the aircraft wing",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development of an active tactile sensor using fluid. Measurement of stiffness and surface conditions, such as sliminess, smoothness, and others, of body tissue is discussed. This sensor is made of a silicone balloon catheter. The balloon is contacted with a soft object and expanded by using fluid. In the process of the expansion, the balloon pushes the object and the contact surface of the balloon slips or sticks. These phenomena depend on stiffness and surface conditions of the object. The expansion can be evaluated by measuring the flow of the fluid. The balloon that is a sensing element is very soft and flexible and does not need electricity. This sensor is available as a medical sensor since it provides safety for human. Experiments using the sensor are carried out on soft samples with various stiffness and surface conditions. It is confirmed that the sensor output are different from each sample. Furthermore, some experiments under different conditions on inner pressure and load are conducted. The results show that the sensor has a potential to measure stiffness and surface conditions.",

Due to the nature of real-world environments such as houses and offices, where the appearance keeps changing, the internal representation may become out of date after some time. To solve this problem the robot needs to be able to adapt its internal representation continually to the changes in the environment.

        "abstract": "Robotic cell microinjection is a technique that employs an automatic method to insert substances into a single living cell with a fine needle. Most available microinjection methods are based on position/velocity tracking, which make it incapable of controlling the injection force. The uncontrolled injection force, however, may destroy the cell and lead to the death of the cell. In this paper, a new adaptive force tracking algorithm within the impedance control framework is proposed to control the injection force applied on the cell. A target impedance is specified in the inner-loop and a trajectory modifying controller is design in the outer-loop for time varying ramp force tracking. The adaptive technique is also used to compensate for the uncertainty of the cell membranepsilas stiffness, the convergence of the system is provably guaranteed. Experiments performed on a laboratorial robotic cell injection system demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper is focused on an adaptive vision system for the guidance of a robot to intercept a non-cooperative target satellite with unknown dynamics parameters. A Kalman filter is developed to reliably estimate the states of the object as well as all of its inertial parameters\u2014namely, the moment-of-inertia ratios, the center-of-mass location, and the orientation of the principle axes\u2014from vision information. The estimates are then used to optimally plan the motion of the manipulator. The optimization performance index includes the time of travel and the weighted norms of the end-effector velocity and acceleration, and it is subject to the conditions that the robot end-effector and the satellite gasping point arrive at the rendezvous point with the same velocity and that the interception occurs within the robot reach. The variational method is used to find the optimal path, which turns out to be the solution of a fourth-order differential equation. Subsequently, a closed-form solution is obtained. The solution to the optimal terminal-time problem is also obtained from the Hamiltonian of the entire system. Experiments are conducted by using a robotic arm to move a satellite mockup according to orbital mechanics and measuring the satellite pose by a laser camera system. The results demonstrate a successful grasping even though the inertial parameters are not known by the control system.",

The results revealed that bipedal humanoid robot performing emotionally positive actions induced the activation of the left orbitofrontal cortex, which is associated with emotional empathy, whereas wheel-drive humanoid robot performing the same actions elicited a lesser response. These results demonstrate that humans more readily empathize with a bipedal humanoid robot based on the ability to simulate human-like body movements.",

Several models have been proposed whose complexity depends on the desired accuracy. An evergreen model, which is very often cited and used, is the one proposed by Dugoff et al. in 1970. Despite its simplicity it returns a very good characterization of the phenomena acting on a wheel and has the undoubt advantage of being obtained on the basis of physical considerations. In this paper the original model is revised in order to solve some inconsistencies. Two models have been proposed where the variables conventionally used to characterize the wheel forces, i.e., slip s and side slip alpha, are replaced with a new vectorial variable. A more accurate estimate of the wheel forces has been obtained by removing one simplifying approximation of the original model. Comparisons are proposed between the Dugoff model and the new models.",

However, due to their small size, MAVs are very susceptible to wind gusts and other atmospheric disturbances. These disturbances cause the video from an MAV to have a significant amount of movement, making the video frames difficult to watch and disorienting to the user. In addition, the context of the video (where and at what orientation are the objects being observed) is often as important as the video itself. To overcome the video movement problem and present location context to the user, we present a method for creating a mosaic from the frames of the video while simultaneously geo-referencing the mosaic. We demonstrate results using a 5-foot fixed-wing MAV.",

        "abstract": "An Inevitable Collision State (ICS) for a robotic system is a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the system is, a collision eventually occurs. ICS can be used for both motion planning (to reduce the search space) and reactive navigation (for obvious safety reasons, a robotic system should never ever move to an ICS). ICS are particularly suited for navigation in dynamic environments since they take into account the future behaviour of the moving objects. Using ICS in practice is difficult given the intrinsic complexity of their characterization. The main contribution of this paper is a generic and efficient ICS-Checker, ie an algorithm that determines whether a given state is an ICS or not, for planar robotic systems with arbitrary dynamics moving in dynamic environments. The efficiency is obtained by applying the following principles: (a) reasoning on 2D slices of the state space of the robotic system, (b) precomputing off-line as many things as possible, and (c) exploiting graphics hardware performances. The ICS-Checker has been applied to two different robotic systems: a car-like vehicle and a spaceship. It has also been integrated in a reactive navigation scheme to safely drive the car-like vehicle.",

In the case of sinusoidal motions, the concept of resonance can be easily applied to determine an optimal stiffness. This paper tries to extend resonance to deal with periodic motions composed of multi-frequency components. For this purpose, we define a cost function, which represents an amount of actuator torque. Next, an optimal stiffness is defined as the stiffness that minimizes the cost function. The relationship between the optimal stiffness and the desired motions is analytically derived. Based on the preparations, we propose two types of controller. These controllers generate the desired motions using the least amount of actuator torque as possible by optimizing the stiffness adaptively. The controllers work well without using parameters of the objective systems. Stability and effectiveness of the stiffness optimization are proved mathematically. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "We present the executive component of the GNOSYS cognitive agent architecture that is responsible for regulating the behaviour of a robotic agent. The system handles a number of problems such as: the execution of multiple goals, dynamic priorities of goals, opportunistic execution, elimination of non-converging goals and other issues. We provide the basic ideas behind the current design and explain the various mechanisms that allow a complex but flexible behaviour for a robotic agent. Simulation results provide not only evidence for efficiency of the design but also help clarify the operation in a variety of problems. Experiments with a real robot in the laboratory are also presented. We conclude with a brief comparison to other existing systems and comments on future work.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic positioning is an important application for marine vehicles that do not have the luxury of anchoring or mooring themselves. Such vehicles are usually large and have arrays of thrusters that allow for controllability in the sway as well as the surge and yaw axes. Most smaller boats however, are underactuated and do not possess control in the sway direction. This makes the control problem significantly more challenging. We address the station keeping problem for a small autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with significant windage. The vehicle is required to hold station at a given position. We describe the design of a weighted controller that uses wind feed-forward to complement a Line-Of-Sight guidance controller to achieve satisfactory performance under slow-varying moderate wind conditions. We test the control system in simulation and in field trials with a twin-propeller ASV. Experiments show that the controller works very well in moderate wind conditions allowing the ASV to keep station with a position error of approximately one vehicle length.",

        "abstract": "The development of new medical therapies often require experiments on small animals. In order to improve the medical protocol during treatments with needles, we propose a new robotic needle insertion system using CT-scan imaging and visual servoing. The biologist defines the skin entry point and the target to be reached in the CT-image. The needle target is then expressed in the robot frame thanks to a 3D registration between the 3D structured light reconstruction of the animal bed and the 3D model obtained from the CT-scan data. Finally the needle pointing is performed thanks to a 2D visual servoing. This approach is independent of the needle model and allows a high positioning accuracy: less than 0.5 pixel for the tip of the needle and less than 10-3 rad for the direction. Experiments show promising results: a needle with a diameter of 0.72 mm can be inserted through two holes with diameters of 2 mm.",

Secondly, improved methods of solving the inverse kinematics of the EMU spacesuit arm including flexible joints are proposed.

        "abstract": "The standard control problem of the pendubot refers to the task of stabilizing its equilibrium configuration with the highest potential energy. Linearization of the dynamics of the pendubot about this equilibrium results in a completely controllable system and allows a linear controller to be designed for local asymptotic stability. For the under-actuated system, the important task is therefore to design a controller that will swing up both links and bring the configuration variables of the system within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. This paper provides a method for swing-up control based on a series of rest-to-rest maneuvers of the first link about its vertically upright configuration. The rest-to-rest maneuvers are designed such that each maneuver results in a net gain in energy of the second link. This results in swing-up of the second link and the pendubot configuration reaching the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. A four-step algorithm is provided for swing-up control followed by stabilization. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.",

Changes of Illumination, viewpoint and scale level are examples for those changes. In addition, the system must be robust for partially occluded cases. To satisfy those requirements, we propose the system with novel modeling and matching methods. Moreover, our system can show better performance by adjusting parameter based on environmental conditions. Through lots of tests for different environmental changes, our system is shown to be partially invariant to illumination and viewpoints. Moreover, our system verifies its robustness for various scale levels and partially occluded cases. Consequently, service robots can identify objects efficiently in environmental changes by adopting the recognition system we proposed.",

Methods that act on three different spaces are analyzed: at displacements, at velocities and at accelerations levels. For the first two levels features of different criterions for the redundancy coordination, based on kinematic performance indexes will be briefly presented. At the accelerations level it will be presented an original method based on the working frequency of the device. This algorithm automatically switches between two different approaches: at low working frequencies it is preferred a solution that optimizes the dexterity feature of the system, whereas at high frequencies a method that reduces the required motor torques.",

        "abstract": "Simulation of robots in a virtual domain has multiple benefits, including serving as a training tool for end users and serving as a tool for robot testing and development. USARSim (Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation) is a simulation tool that is being used to accomplish these goals. It is based on the Unreal Tournament 2004 gaming engine, which approximates the physics of how a robot interacts with its environment. A family of robots that can benefit from simulation in USARSim are Whegs\u2122* robots. Developed in the Biorobotics Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Whegs\u2122 robots are highly mobile ground vehicles that use abstracted biological principles to achieve a robust level of locomotion, including passive gait adaptation and enhanced climbing abilities. This paper describes a Whegs\u2122 robot model that was constructed and benchmarked in USARSim. The model was given the same kinds of physical characteristics found in real Whegs\u2122 vehicles. With these traits in place, a validation study was performed for the simulation by comparing the rotational body motions of the virtual and real robot. Specifically, we examine the robot\u2019s Pitch and Roll ranges and frequencies (found to be about 10 degrees to 12 degrees and 5.5 Hz respectively). By altering the simulation parameters in a physically relevant way, the virtual robot\u2019s performance was moved to be more in line with these values.",

An overview of the major design characteristics of such robots and their influence on the feasibility of a stable limit cycle is presented. It is shown that robots which are fully powered by ankle actuation require a mass ratio of at least 10:1 between the upper and lower limb to obtain sufficient ground clearance during the swing phase at a wide range of walking speeds. The effect and necessity of the offset in the footshapes of many passive dynamic walkers is shown and the influence of the moment of push off on the required energy injection is treated. The results of the analysis are supported by simulations with a dynamic model of such a robot. The simulated model exhibits a very natural looking gait and walks with a wide range of velocities at low mechanical cost of transport. Simulation results are provided which confirm that pushing off before the swing leg collides with the floor is energetically more efficient than pushing off after the impact as also known from previous literature.",

Likewise, the structure of robot should be better fitted the locomotion in the working environment. This paper derives an optimal structure of the quadruped robot, which minimizes the sum of joint torques of the robot. Minimization of the joint torque allows to reduce the joint acceleration in walking motion, and hence to reduce energy consumption. Numerical simulation analyzed joint torques in each limb length and slope angle under walking on a slope. The optimal rate of rear leg length (RRL) is derived by the simulation as the physical structure. Our analysis suggests that the joint torque will increase as the slope angle becomes steeper in the case that the rear legs are shorter than forelegs. On the other hand, the joint torque will decrease as the slope angle is declined in the case that the forelegs are shorter than the rear legs. Experimental results validated the simulation analysis.",

        "abstract": "Segment-based maps are emerging as an efficient way to represent the environments in which mobile robots operate. When compared to grid-based maps, maps composed of line segments usually need less space to be stored. However, very little effort has been devoted to methods that allow to reduce the size of segment-based maps by removing redundant line segments that represent the same object in the environment. This problem is usually addressed with rather ad hoc methods that are embedded in mapping systems. In this paper, we put forward the problem of reducing the size of segment-based maps by presenting a survey of the existing methods and by experimentally evaluating some of them. Our results can be used to set out some guidelines for the development of a general approach to reducing redundant line segments in maps.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we employ Fung\u2019s viscoelastic model discussed by Tiezzi and Kao to study the experimental data presented by Sakamoto et al. for grasping viscoelastic objects using a parallel-jaw gripper. The viscoelastic contact modeling presented in this paper is characterized by two separate responses: elastic response and temporal response. Two main and intriguing results were found in the modeling and analysis of experimental data. The first is the consistency on the normalized coefficients for the curve fitting of the temporal response during the relaxation period of the grasping. Such consistency suggests that the proposed model is applicable to the grasping task at hand. The other result is the generic pattern of the elastic response deduced from the experimental data. The pattern of elastic response represents different physical significance of grasping which involves viscoelastic contact interface.",

Obtaining good results typically requires carefully hand-engineering the trade-offs between different terms in the cost function. In practice, it is often much easier to demonstrate a few good trajectories. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm which - when given access to a few trajectory demonstrations - can automatically infer good trade-offs between the different costs. In our experiments, we apply our algorithm to the problem of navigating a robotic car in a parking lot.",

Simulation results validate the approximation for bearings-only geolocalization of a stationary target and tracking of an uncertain moving target.",

This research studies on learning and performing tool-use manipulation tasks. For tool-use manipulations, understanding the relation between tool motion and whole body motion is crucial. In this paper, a tool-use motion model is designed with tool knowledge and body motion knowledge. The authors propose a method which enables a humanoid robot to associate whole body motion from tool knowledge by adopting the mimesis method from partial observations [1]. When a specific tool trajectory of a tool-use motion is given, appropriate hand motion is associated. From the calculated hand motion, appropriate whole body motion is associated successively. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a humanoid robot.",

In this preliminary study we demonstrate the effectiveness of the system as a whole and the intuitive interface in particular. Congruent with previous findings, results confirm that having a human in the loop improves task performance, especially with larger numbers of robots.

The goal of this paper is to develop a method for automatic calibration of a catadioptric camera so that it can be easily run before mounting the camera on the UAV or even during the flight to deal with vibrations or shocks. Whereas existing works can provide interesting results, they suffer from several practical limitations (manual line extraction, inaccurate conic fitting, calibration pattern, camera motion, execution time, etc...) and therefore cannot be applied in our application. The proposed algorithm aims to determine the most probable calibration that verifies some geometric constraints induced by catadioptric projection. In order to efficiently maximize this probability, we use a particle filtering approach. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Most of the existing camera calibration toolboxes require the observation of a checkerboard shown by the user at different positions and orientations. This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic detection of checkerboards, described by the position and the arrangement of their corners, in blurred and heavily distorted images. The method can be applied to both perspective and omnidirectional cameras. An existing corner detection method is evaluated and its strengths and shortcomings in detecting corners on blurred and distorted test image sets are analyzed. Starting from the results of this analysis, several improvements are proposed, implemented, and tested. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to consistently identify 80% of the corners on omnidirectional images of as low as VGA resolution and approaches 100% correct corner extraction at higher resolutions, outperforming the existing implementation significantly. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several test image sets of various resolution, distortion, and blur, which are exemplary for different kinds of camera-mirror setups in use.",

In a sequential approach to reconstruction from video streams, we show how adding prior knowledge about camera motion improves reconstruction accuracy, obtaining a more precise trajectory estimation and preventing failures over time. We add a smoothing penalty on camera trajectory and the smoothing parameter, usually fixed by trial and error, is automatically estimated using Cross-Validation. The method is substantiated by experimental results on synthetic and real data. They show that it improves accuracy and stability in the reconstruction process, preventing several failure cases.",

        "abstract": "In an electric bicycle, two strategies are taken up to stabilize the running motion of a bicycle. One is the control of its center of gravity (CG), and the other is the control of its steering angle of handle. In general, the control of the CG is used a pendulum. In addition, the motion of a bicycle often possesses a lean angle with respect to vertical direction. In this situation, the proposed system contains three outputs: steering angle, lean angle, and pendulum angle, these will affect the dynamic balance of an electrical bicycle. The proposed control generating the handle torque and pendulum toque is called variable structure under-actuated control (VSUAC). The motivation of using the VSUAC is that the system uncertainties of a bicycle are often huge due to different ground conditions and a gust of wind. Merely use an ordinary proportional-derivative-integral (PID) control or other linear controls often can not have good robust performance. Finally, the compared simulations for the electrical bicycle among ordinary PID control, modified proportional-derivative control (MPDC), and VSUAC confirm the usefulness of our proposed control.",

Here we define visual segmentation as the problem of isolating all portions of an image that belongs to a physically coherent object. The term near-symmetric is used as our method can segment objects with some non-symmetric parts, such as a coffee mug and its handle. Using bilateral symmetry this problem is solved autonomously and robustly through the aid of physical action provided by a robot manipulator. Our proposed approach does not require prior models of target objects and assumes no previously collected background statistics. Instead, our approach relies on a precise robotic nudge to generate the necessary object motion to perform segmentation. Experiments performed on ten objects show that our model-free approach can autonomously and accurately segment a variety of objects. These experiments also indicate that our segmentation approach is not adversely affected when operating in cluttered scenes and can segment multi-coloured and transparent objects in a robust manner.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a bio-inspired neural network providing planning capabilities in autonomous navigation applications. The proposed architecture (hippocampus model) learns, recognizes and predicts transitions between places for any system able to provide a localization gradient from the current position to each learned place. The recurrent synapses of a cognitive map (prefrontal cortices model) encoded the spatio-temporal connectivity of the performed transitions. Particular transitions of interest (goal transitions) are associated to the satisfaction of drives. While planning, the diffusion of an activity from the goal transitions in the cognitive map allows to compute a proximity gradient to the goal from each learned transition. The shortest plan of transition to reach the goal is computed by merging the cognitive map information and the prediction of the possible transitions (nucleus accumbens). In parallel, a sensory-motor learning between the performed transitions and the corresponding movements occurs and enables to physically execute the proposed plan (cerebellum). Refinements (active forgetting capabilities) are proposed for the cognitive map building. The whole system is experimented on a real robot which autonomously learns a stable representation of its environment during a long random walk and proves to be able to return to the goal from any position of the environment.",

This problem, which can arise even if the beacons are far from the platform, can cause catastrophic failure of the filter.We consider three strategies to overcome this difficulty: applying inequality constraints, the use of truncated second order filters, and a reparameterisation using the negative logarithm of depth. We show that both a simple inequality method and the use of truncated second order filters are successful. However, the most robust performance is achieved using the negative log parameterisation.",

Our ldquobarge-in-ablerdquo system consists of two stages: (1) cancellation of robot speech and (2) recognition of the separated user speech under the ldquosemi-blind situationrdquo. The semi-blind situation is where a robotpsilas speech signal is known but a userpsilas speech signal is not. The first stage is achieved by using an adaptive filter based on time-frequency domain Independent Component Analysis, because that can separate robot speech more robustly against noise than conventional echo cancellers. To improve performance in online processing, we utilized known source normalization and the exponentially weighted stepsize method. The second stage is achieved by automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on the missing feature theory which provides robust recognition by exploiting the reliability of speech features distorted due to noise and/or separation. The semi-blind situation simplifies the estimation of such reliabilities. Experiments demonstrated that our system improved word correctness of ASR by 10.0%.",

A formal Bayesian framework is introduced, which enables recursive estimation of a dynamic environment model and action selection based on this estimate. Existing methods are combined to produce a working implementation of the proposed framework. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is deployed to address the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem and combined with recursive conditional particle filters in order to track people in the vicinity of the robot. In this way, a complete model is provided, which is utilized for selecting the actions of the robot so that its uncertainty is kept under control and the likelihood of achieving its goals is increased. All developed algorithms have been applied to the domain of the autonomous city explorer robot and results from the implementation on the robotic platform are presented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an imitation learning framework to generate multiple behaviors with balance control by recognizing human behaviors while estimating the ground reaction force. In our proposed method, a part of captured human motion data is recognized as one particular behavior that is represented by a linear dynamical model. Therefore, our method has small dependence on a classification criteria defined by an experimenter. Based on the behavior recognition method with the ground reaction force estimation and by combining the different recognized behaviors, it is possible to generate many different motion sequences while taking balance into account. First, we approximate a human motion pattern by using linear dynamical models. Then, we can recognize and generate different behavior sequences by switching linear dynamical models. We apply the proposed method to a four-link simulated robot model. Two different squat motions are recognized from motion capture data and the four-link robot generated four different combined squat behaviors from two different squat motions. To show generalization performance, we apply our imitation learning framework to the four-link robot models that have different weights.",

In this paper, we present a new controller for bilateral teleoperators based on the wave variable control method which provides superior force tracking performance compared to the traditional wave-variable-based method. Additionally, this method also improves the phase delay induced by the latency in the communication network. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the performance of this new controller.",

First we analyzed a fuzzy logic based methodology for offering suitable gait for an amputee, followed by formulating a suitable algorithm for designing a CPG, based on Rayleigh\u2019s oscillator. Using the oscillator we presented a number of simulation results which showed the behavior of knee angles and hip angles and determined the stable limit cycles of the network, and compared them with the captured gaits of an individual. Subsequently, we presented a methodology about how to use CPG outputs for calculating the damping profile for controlling a prosthetic device called AMAL (Adaptive Modular Active Leg).",

A key aspect of this system it the ability to combine online user input and autonomous planning to enable the execution of stable grasping tasks. While user input can ultimately be of any modality, the system is being designed to adapt to partial or noisy information obtained from grasp-related activity in the primate motor cortex. First, principal component analysis is applied to the observed kinematics of physiologic grasping to reduce the dimensionality of hand posture space and simplify the planning task for on-line use. The planner then accepts control input in this reduced-dimensionality space, and uses it as a seed for a hand posture optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing. We present two applications of this algorithm, using data collected from both primate and human subjects during grasping, to demonstrate its ability to synthesize stable grasps using partial control input in real or near-real time.",

        "abstract": "Many planning approaches adhere to the two-tiered architecture consisting of a long-range, low fidelity global planner and a short-range high fidelity local planner. While this architecture works well in general, it fails in highly constrained environments where the available paths are limited. These situations amplify mismatches between the global and local plans due to the smaller set of feasible actions. We present an approach that dynamically blends local plans online to match the field of global paths. Our blended local planner generates paths from control commands to ensure the safety of the robot as well as achieve the goal. Blending also results in more complete plans than an equivalent unblended planner when navigating cluttered environments. These properties enable the blended local planner to utilize a smaller control set while achieving more efficient planning time. We demonstrate the advantages of blending in simulation using a kinematic car model navigating through maps containing tunnels, cul-de-sacs, and random obstacles.",

Instead of building one global consistent map, aimed by the most common SLAM techniques, we compute a set of local metrical maps and fuse them to a graph-like structure resulting in a topological map. Thus, our approach does not require a global metrical map consistency. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for closing spatial loops. Loop closing means, that a subset of the edges of the graph representing the topological map forms a cycle. To this end we describe a very efficient enhancement of the well-known RANSAC technique for actively recognizing regions explored by the robot previously. This improvement exploits the theory of the birthday attack whose mathematical background is known from cryptography. A fast sample-based scan matcher is employed to compute the local maps. We derive the covariance of the current robot pose from the sample distribution in order to perform a recognition only when loop closing is very likely. Our approach has been implemented and experimental results show its excellent performance.",

        "abstract": "Both the extent and accuracy of force application in atomic force microscope (AFM) nanomanipulation are significantly limited by the nonlinearity of the commonly used optical lever with a nonlinear position-sensitive detector (PSD). In order to compensate the nonlinearity of the optical lever, a nonlinear calibration method is presented. This method applies the nonlinear curve fit to a full-range position-voltage response of the photodiode, obtaining a continuous function of its voltage-related sensitivity. Thus, Interaction forces can be defined as integrals of this sensitivity function between any two responses of photodiode voltage outputs, instead of rough transformation with a single conversion factor. The lateral position-voltage response of the photodiode, a universally acknowledged puzzle, was directly characterized by an accurately calibrated force sensor composed of a tippless piezoresistive force sensor, regardless of any knowledge of the cantilevers and laser measuring system. Experiments using a rectangular cantilever (normal force constant 0.24 N/m) demonstrated that the proposed nonlinear calibration method restrained the sensitivity error of normal position-voltage responses to 3.6% and extended the force application range.",

Optical flow sensors offer a different kind of odometer as compared with the wheel encoder. Using multiple sensors, it is possible to reduce the effect of measurement uncertainties. Since all sensors are mounted on a rigid body, their measurement data must obey a certain relation. This relation is utilized in this paper and mathematical formulations are developed to realize the computation. It is shown that the calibration procedure can be cast as an optimization problem given measurement data. Further, the rigid-body relation is formulated as a null-space constraint using the calibrated parameters. During operation, unreliable sensor measurements can be removed by accessing the error distance to the null space. Experimental results are presented to support the proposed methods.",

Mobile robots able to classify an odour could navigate to a specific source or isolate high concentration areas in applications such as environmental monitoring. A key aspect to classification is to be able to process the data collected while moving the robot and using a simple and compact sensor system. In order to achieve this, we present a classification algorithm that is based on the transient response from the sensors. An analysis of how classification results vary with regards to the movement of the robot is provided and subsequently the experimental validations show that the classification performance depends more on how the robot traverses the odour plume and the quality of the transient than on the distance from the source location. The experimental validation has been done in a large unmodified indoor environment.",

Using a lightweight robot that was especially designed for interactive and cooperative tasks, we show how reactive control strategies can significantly contribute to ensuring safety to the human during physical interaction. Several collision tests were carried out, illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. While a subjective \u201csafety\u201d feeling is experienced by users when being able to naturally stop the robot in autonomous motion, a quantitative analysis of different reaction strategies was lacking. In order to compare these strategies on an objective basis, a mechanical verification platform has been built. The proposed collision detection and reactions methods prove to work very reliably and are effective in reducing contact forces far below any level which is dangerous to humans. Evaluations of impacts between robot and human arm or chest up to a maximum robot velocity of 2.7 m/s are presented.",

The proposed algorithm consists of two main parts: recognizing walking people and collision-free path planning. For the recognition of randomly changing human walking motion, a people tracking method using laser range finder (LRF) is utilized. Robust people tracking could be achieved by embedding a new biped model with a walking frequency tracker, which can estimate the frequency of human walking motion and generate it continuously even in the case of no measurement owing to occlusion. For the other part, collision-free path planning, an iterative forecast and planning method with the concept of configuration space including space and time is employed. The position and velocity of walking people, given from people tracking algorithm, are exploited in path planning part as the information of obstacles that the robot have to avoid. The proposed method has been implemented on a real robot. It is also demonstrated with some experiments the tracking of multiple walking humans and robot navigation in indoor environment.",

Addition of wind display evolves the Treadport Virtual environment into a highly immersive virtual environment called Treadport Active Wind Tunnel (TPAWT). Experiments on a scaled model of the TPAWT show that headwind flow stream diverges at the user. Pitot tube sensors placed at a particular region of converged flow in the scaled TPAWT provide measurements with lower noise. Open loop experiments on a scaled model of TPAWT show that there exists a relationship between speed measured at this region of converged flow and the wind speed at the user position. Using this relationship, the wind speed at the user can be estimated. We use this relation and combine previously used speed and angle controllers based upon the small gain theorem with a dynamic extension and conditional angular rate-switching control. Finally, we simultaneously control wind speed and headwind angle.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a combined scheme in which adaptive beamforming and acoustic echo canceller are integrated in order to achieve a robust full-duplex speech interface between user and mobile robot. In particular, this paper addresses the situation in which an echo signal and the userpsilas voice are propagated from the same direction toward a linear array of microphones. We propose a cascading scheme that uses an acoustic echo canceller followed by an adaptive beamformer. By using the system output to adapt echo canceller, and by controlling the adaptive mode of each adaptive filter in the beamformer and in the echo canceller, we can recover the original speech, which would otherwise have remained contaminated by both noise and echoes. In addition, a double-talk detector is proposed so that effective acoustic echo cancellation may be attained without generating error divergence when the userpsilas voice and the echo are present simultaneously. Representative experimental results with real data demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a issue that the reliable and the inexpensive communication method in swarm robotics. The ants forage for preys by using pheromone trails. They lay down the pheromone trails between preys and a nest. By detecting the trail pheromone, they can find the preys. Though they do not have excellent intelligence, they can communicate with each other and cooperate by adding information to the environment, like a pheromone. This communication method has a merit that an agent does not need to memorize the place of the preys. We consider to answer the issue that \u201cHow do the swarm robots communicate using pheromone trail?\u201d. We construct a swarm behavior simulator and develop swarm robots that communicate using the pheromone trail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the communication using the pheromone trail by computer simulations and experiments using swarm robots. To realize this purpose, we design a swarm behavior algorithm, based on 4 perceptual signs (stimuli) and 3 effector signs (actions). In the simulations, an experimental field is discretized by computational grids, and evaporation and diffusion are phenomena of the pheromone modeled by discretized equations. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the simulation. Simulation result shows that proposed algorithms act effectively. Based on the simulation results, we set three robots, one nest and one prey in the flat experimental field. We observe three robots\u2019 behavior and the state of the environment for 20 minutes. The robots laid down the pheromone trail between the nest and the prey, and reinforced the pheromone trail many times. This fact means that swarm robots can realize the function of the chemical, indirect, plastic and local communication like ants by using the pheromone trail.",

In this method, torque control is accomplished by converting desired joint torques into instantaneous increments of joint position command. For each joint, the transformer was modeled based on the identification of the individual motor controller. This framework was experimentally implemented on the Honda ASIMO which is controlled by the traditional position controlled system. Decoupled task dynamics by the Operational Space Control was applied to realize compliant posture control and accurate task control. The paper presents the experimental results of the implementation which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. This proposed approach provides higher performance in compliant and safe motion which is required for motion in contact with the environment and human.",

In this paper, optimization methods are discussed to calculate the economical control currents, so as to reduce the power consumption.We divided the working space into grids and used a filament-based algorithm to compute the magnetic field at grid centers, which proved to be fast and accurate.

We report the design, modeling, and implementation of the controller on a simple pick-and-place manipulator and on an industrial robot loading heavy shells within the magazine of a naval vessel. The proposed controller demonstrates the ability to adapt to varying actuator performance and rapidly changing sea states. Future work involves the implementation and testing of the controller during actual naval operations.

When applying this technique to a multiple-robot system, the entire system should focus its work on one subtask at a time to prevent interference from robots working on conflicting subtasks simultaneously. We present a behavior-based approach to the task-sequencing problem for decentralized multiple-robot systems requiring only local inter-robot communication. Consensus is used to prevent premature task sequencing. Our algorithm is compared to globally-communicative and communication-free strategies. The proposed task-sequencing behavior is found to be efficient with respect to time and energy requirements, and could be applied to many existing decentralized multiple-robot systems.",

The objective of this study is to reveal the characteristics in human force sensations, which are difficult to examine in a real environment. Further, we aim to apply the perceptual mechanisms to multimedia applications as the final target. In this study, we particularly examine the weight discriminative powers for various weight changes. Expanding our previous study, we compare the difference thresholds for the weight addition and removal during a goal-directed lifting. A statistical analysis implies that our weight discriminative power for the weight addition tends to improve in the deceleration process. As for the weight removal, the weight discriminative power declines in the deceleration process due to the inertia effect in the vicinity of the target height. In addition, this study tries to reveal the weight perception when the load force is gradually changed. The result implies that the time variation in the load force holds the tremendous potential to enable us to experience attractive force sensations and haptic illusions.",

The regular dynamic equation is used to model the ideal behavior, while wavelets are used to learn the joint friction. The friction may be coupled, such that it is a function of the velocity of multiple joints. Furthermore, a system identification method has been designed to improve contact force estimation, using manual hand excitation in addition to motor excitation. The hybrid dynamic equation was implemented for the PHANTOM Omni haptic device (SensAble Technologies, MA, USA), and experiments were performed to compare using manual excitation with using motor excitation only. The results showed that manual excitation improved contact force estimation performance, with improvements in the relative RMS values ranging from 21% to 35%.",

        "abstract": "A mobile service robot should have the ability to carry out multiple practical tasks. However, most mobile mobile service robots have been designed to carry out a specific task. Hence it has been difficult to design a navigation framework for multiple navigation tasks. In this paper, we will design and implement a navigation framework for multiple tasks using the GSPN (Generalized Stochastic Petri-Nets). The GSPN-based navigation framework has several advantages, such as performance analysis and dynamic system analysis. Furthermore, such a design can process system events in realtime. Also, the typical problem of a hybrid control system, namely the synchronization and scheduling between reactive layer and high-level planner can be solved using the GSPNpsilas event monitoring ability using the timed transition and immediate transition. Finally, the idle time and activation time of the tasks can be predicted under the GSPN-based navigation framework. In this paper, firstly, the transportation task and patrol task are implemented. Then, a navigation framework is designed using the GPSN. The proposed GSPN-based navigation framework is verified in the human co-existing environments by experiments. The results showed that the proposed navigation scheme can be used practically in real environments.",

        "abstract": "This work focuses on the implementation of a vision-based motion guidance method, called virtual fixtures, on admittance-controlled human-machine cooperative robots with compliance. The robot compliance here refers to the structural elastic deformation of the device. The high mechanical stiffness and non-backdrivability of a typical admittance-controlled robot allow for slow and precise motions, making it highly suitable for tasks that require accuracy near human physical limits, such as microsurgery. However, previous experiments have shown that even small robot compliance degraded virtual fixture performance, especially at the micro scale. In this work, control methods to minimize the effect of robot compliance on virtual fixture performance were developed for admittance-controlled cooperative systems. Based on a linear model of the robot dynamics, we applied a Kalman filter to integrate the measurements obtained from the camera and encoders to estimate the robot end-effector position. A partitioned control law was used to achieve end-effector trajectory following on the desired velocity commanded by the admittance and virtual fixture control laws. The effectiveness of the Kalman filter and the controller was validated on a one degree-of-freedom admittance-controlled cooperative testbed.",

In the conventional control algorithm, we only considered to support the user to walk on the level ground and assumed that horizontal components of Ground Reaction Force (GRF) could be neglected. In this paper, we especially focus on the support of walking on slope, and estimate slope angle based on sensor signals from accelerometer and force sensors. By using the estimated slope angle, horizontal components of GRF are calculated and we apply it to the calculation method using the human model. The proposed method is applied to Wearable Walking Helper and the experimental results illustrate the validity of it.",

First, ways of exploiting odometry sensor redundancy is discussed. Then a criterion for exploiting the torque redundancy is proposed to make larger the margin of driving force, and fundamental simulations and experiments are done to show the control characteristics of the developed mobile platform.",

        "abstract": "A novel control architecture for parallel robots is introduced to fully exploit the advantages of these robots on high-speed and precision operation. A closed form of the dynamic model of parallel robots is difficult to obtain, due to the complex kinematic relations of these kind of mechanism. However, with the use of the extra data provided by sensors placed in strategic passive joints, kinematic and dynamic modelling can be simplified. The dynamic model can be used to implement advanced control techniques to improve the efficiency of parallel robots. In this paper, monoarticular and multiarticular control techniques are implemented on a 5R parallel robot, showing that the use of extra sensor data leads to a better and accurate control.",

        "abstract": "The modified transpose Jacobian (MTJ) algorithm is a recently proposed algorithm used in manipulator control. Based on an approximated feedback linearization approach the MTJ does not need to a priori knowledge of the plant dynamics. In this paper, this scheme is extended to the complicated control problem of underactuated robots in Cartesian space. Based on the notion of transpose effective Jacobian, this new proposed algorithm is called modified transpose effective Jacobian (MTEJ) algorithm. The MTEJ control law employs stored data of the control command in the previous time step, as a learning tool to yield an improved performance, with no substantial need to a priori knowledge of the plant dynamics. Therefore, unlike a model-based algorithm, it is almost not affected by inaccuracies in mass properties. The gains of the proposed MTEJ can be selected more systematically, and do not need to be large, hence the noise rejection characteristics of the algorithm are improved. Obtained results show an improved performance compared to that of the transpose effective Jacobian and even model-based algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents locomotion control strategies for a novel, multi-legged hopping robot named ldquorobotic all-terrain surveyorrdquo (RATS). This conceptual robot has a spherical body roughly the size of a soccer ball, with 12 legs equally distributed over its surface. The legs are linear pneumatic actuators (1-DOF), oriented such that their axes of motion are normal to the surface of the body. While the 12-legged robot is still in design, we have experimented with a planar 5-legged prototype to study the control problem in a simpler form. Our control solutions overcame the constraint that the legs are at a fixed orientation with respect to the body by inducing the body to roll. This approach allows the legs to be positioned sequentially at a desired angle with respect to the ground surface, exploiting the symmetric configuration of the system. Successful gaits for running and jumping over obstacles based on the rolling concept are presented in this work. Physical experiments with the 5-legged device validate the control approaches and demonstrate the performance of the system and its potential for the future.",

Our concept of a control system design is that a control law should be based on the friction force as a real snake is. Both the motion equation of the robot and the friction force are derived by the Projection Method proposed by W. Blajer. The friction model is evaluated in the cost function of the control system design based on state dependent Riccati equation. As a result a derived control law takes the friction effect into account. We also build an experimental system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.",

The Capsubot could move by exerting friction force through movement of inside mass. This paper shows theoretical analysis and experimental verification of the locomotion for the Capsubot. In the experiment, the motion of inner mass is generated by coils and a magnet. Displacement of the Capsubot is measured by laser sensor and also position of the inside mass is measured. Using the developed test system, the motion of the developed Capsubot is experimentally compared with the one of the theoretical model.",

In case of conventional probabilistic methods such as EKF, they give the most probable estimation rather than guarantee any deterministic values or boundary for true position of the robots. To comply with such cases as at least boundary of robot position should be guaranteed, we propose a CP-based method that can handle the cases and gives a boundary containing true robot position value. To be specific, we apply the constraint propagation technique to localizing a set of mobile robots equipped with wheel encoders, gyro meters, and GPS receivers. Fusing the data and applying CP, we can get improved accuracy for localizing the robots. Also, by introducing the correlation between GPS data in common workspace to the sensor fusion framework, we further improve the localization accuracy for multiple robot cases. Several simulation results showing that the proposed method improves localization performance considerably compared to conventional methods will be shown.",

A different navigation strategy is applied to the leader of the formation and to the rest of robots of the team. The leader plans the trajectories by using a two-level path planner with obstacle avoidance capabilities. The motion of the follower robots is controlled by the virtual structure, which adapts to the environment while the leader is tracked, taking into account the kinodynamic constraints of the vehicles. The system is evaluated in experiments carried out in simulations, some of them made in a realistic and complex urban scenario, and with real robots.",

Two coordination algorithms are demonstrated here based upon front and rear axles. An error coordinate system is applied to an ideal point on the robot that will be driven to a reference posture or target for motion control. Posture regulation, path following, and trajectory tracking capability is provided by a kinematic motion controller. Axle motion of the robot is then coordinated using a steering ratio and compliant constraints. The allowable steering ratios are established considering path curvature, steering angle limitations, and steering stability. Coordination algorithms are finally evaluated in simulation and experiment on the CFMMR.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of exploring an unknown environment with a team of mobile robots. The key issue in coordinated multi-robot exploration is how to assign target locations to the individual robots such that the overall mission time is minimized. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distribute the robots over the environment that takes into account the structure of the environment. To achieve this, it partitions the space into segments, for example, corresponding to individual rooms. Instead of only considering frontiers between unknown and explored areas as target locations, we send the robots to the individual segments with the task to explore the corresponding area. Our approach has been implemented and tested in simulation as well as in real world experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the overall exploration time can be significantly reduced by considering our segmentation method.",

        "abstract": "The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm can be applied to the robotic path planning problem and performs well in challenging, dynamic domains. Traditional RRT methods use a binary cost function and they select portions of the tree for expansion based on the Euclidean distance to the target. However, in outdoor navigation, the relative cost of terrain can also provide useful input to a planning algorithm that traditional RRT methods cannot take advantage of. We present the Metric Adaptive RRT (MA-RRT), which integrates planning and fast execution for generating paths over a cost map. The MA-RRT algorithm considers underlying cost of a path when calculating the distance function for tree expansion. A heuristic value is also used for determining distance from a point to the target and an adaptive mechanism is employed for adjusting the heuristic on-line. We have implemented our approach in offline simulations and in outdoor robot experiments, and show that the MA-RRT algorithm can improve upon the quality of the path returned when cost is considered. The trade off between cost consideration and runtime performance is also presented.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for finding paths for multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) such that the sum over their lengths is minimum as they cover a 3D terrain (represented as height fields). The paths are constrained to lie beneath an exposure surface to ensure stealth from enemy outposts. The exposure surface is also computed as a height field. The algorithm greedily clusters the terrain such that gain in visibility per distance would be higher for intra-cluster points than points across clusters. Paths generated on clusters formed by such a per distance visibility metric are reduced by more than 25% over other related decoupled methods. The method is extended to cover terrains with partial visibilities. The advantage of the coupled metric extends under constrained visibility also. We again show performance gain by comparing with an existing decoupled algorithm that solves a similar problem of minimum distance terrain coverage with constrained visibility. The paper reveals that decomposing the terrain based on visibility first and then distance is always better than the other way round to cover the terrain in shorter distances.",

The crawler mechanism is of circular cross-section and has active rolling axes at the center of the circles. Conventional crawler mechanisms can support massive loads, but cannot produce sideways motion. Additionally, previous crawler edges sink undesirably on soft ground, particularly when the vehicle body is subject to a sideways tilt. The proposed design solves these drawbacks by adopting a circular cross-section crawler. A prototype has been developed to illustrate the concept. Motion experiments confirm the novel properties of this mechanism: sideways motion and robustness against edge-sink. Motion experiments, with a test vehicle are also presented.",

This paper presents an algorithm able to perform obstacle detection with small computational cycles, and extremely robust against outliers. To reduce the computational cost, foveation, i.e. space-variant image resolution adaptation, is employed. To reduce sensitivity to outliers, two voting filters are presented. Experimental results on two different stereo vision heads show that the proposed algorithm is able to perform at 10 Hz. Even in the presence of a low signal-to-noise ratio, caused by the use of a partially damaged lens, the algorithm is able to distinguish obstacles from the background.",

        "abstract": "In performing various kinds of tasks, body representation is one of the most fundamental issues for physical agents (humans, primates, and robots). Especially during tool-use by Japanese macaque monkeys, neurophysiological evidence shows that the representation can be dynamically reconstructed by spatio-temporal integration of different sensor modalities so that it can be adaptive to environmental changes [1]. However, to construct such a representation, an issue to be solved is how to associate which information among various sensory data. This paper presents a method that constructs cross-modal body representation from vision, touch, and proprioception. When the robot touches something, the activation of tactile sense triggers the construction process of the visual receptive field for body parts that can be found by visual attention based on saliency map and consequently regarded as the end effector. Simultaneously, proprioceptive information is associated with this visual receptive field to construct the cross-modal body representation. The computer simulation results are comparable to the activities of parietal neurons found in the Japanese macaque monkeys. Various conditions are also investigated so that what kind of information is important to generate the same results as findings in neurophysiology.",

The decentralized coordination is based on a control policy for planning the collision-free motion, which takes into account kinematics and safety constrains. Besides this, in order to avoid deadlocks in critical zones, such as doors and corridors, a set of hazardous zones is defined, where mutual exclusion should be ensured. In order to consider the performance of the whole system, transportation tasks are allocated to the more appropriate member of the multi-robot team by a centralized auction. The interaction of AGVs operating under different collision conditions has been tested and evaluated in a real industrial setting. The primary contribution of this paper is to show empirically that the presented decentralized approach is viable, effective and safety for coordinating physical multi-robot systems in industrial environments.",

A deep belief network is trained with unsupervised data and a reconstruction criterion to extract features from an input image, and the features are used to train a realtime classifier to predict traversability. The online supervision is given by a stereo module that provides robust labels for nearby areas up to 12 meters distant. The approach was developed and tested on the LAGR mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "The Arctic seafloor remains one of the last unexplored areas on Earth. Exploration of this unique environment using standard remotely operated oceanographic tools has been obstructed by the dense Arctic ice cover. In the summer of 2007 the Arctic Gakkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) was conducted with the express intention of understanding aspects of the marine biology, chemistry and geology associated with hydrothermal venting on the section of the mid-ocean ridge known as the Gakkel Ridge. Unlike previous research expeditions to the Arctic the focus was on high resolution imaging and sampling of the deep seafloor. To accomplish our goals we designed two new Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) named Jaguar and Puma, which performed a total of nine dives at depths of up to 4062m. These AUVs were used in combination with a towed vehicle and a conventional CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) program to characterize the seafloor. This paper describes the design decisions and operational changes required to ensure useful service, and facilitate deployment, operation, and recovery in the unique Arctic environment.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper deals with static behaviour modelling of Parallel Kinematic Machines (PKMs). Due to their high dynamic abilities, PKMs are subjected to high inertial and cutting loads while machining. These loads generate structure deflection, and thus tool pose defects. The aim of this article is to present a predictable model of PKMs. This model could be useful to optimize part positioning in the workspace or adapt machining strategies in order to minimize the influence of structure deflections. The proposed model takes into account legs and joints compliances. Considering the geometry of most of parallel architectures, the legs are modelled as beams. The focus, here, is particularly on joint models. In the literature, when the compliance of joints is considered, it is always modelled with a constant stiffness. In this paper, a different approach is proposed, based on a technical analysis of the joints and non linear models are chosen. Models proposed are applied to an existing PKM: the Tricept. The parameters of this model (i.e. the stiffness of the joints) are then identified, thanks to experimental stiffness measurements done on a ABB 940 Tricept robot. Finally, a second architecture is studied. This machine is overconstrained even if it is very close to the Tricept architecture. The same modelling method is applied and the static behaviours of the two machines are compared. Thus, the effect of overconstraint on static behaviour is analysed.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of new applications in cardiac robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), a demand for the design of efficient motion compensation systems was created. In this context, vision-based techniques seem to be a practical way to retrieve the motion of the beating heart since they do not require the introduction of additional sensors in the limited workspace. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for tracking the heart surface which incorporates two novelties. The first is a Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) parametric model for the heart surface deformation that allows us to better track regions of the heart surface with little texture information which undergo large non-rigid deformations. The second novelty is the incorporation of a performing illumination compensation algorithm to cope with arbitrary illumination changes and increase tracking robustness.We also extend this framework for 3D tracking, to enable full compensation of the heart motion. Extensive experiments conducted on in-vivo and ex-vivo heart images attest the notable performance of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A shell is a body enclosed between two closely spaced and curved surfaces. Classical theory of shells [38], [33], [16] assumes a parametrization along the lines of principal curvature on the middle surface of a shell. Such a parametrization, while always existing locally, is not known for many surfaces, and deriving one can be very difficult if not impossible. This paper generalizes the classical strain-displacement equations and strain energy formula to a shell with an arbitrary parametric middle surface. We show that extensional and shearing strains can all be represented in terms of geometric invariants including principal curvatures, principal vectors, and the related directional and covariant derivatives. Computation of strains and strain energy is also described for a general parametrization. The displacement field on a shell is represented as a B-spline surface. By minimization of potential energy, we have simulated deformations of algebraic surfaces under applied loads, and performed experiments on an aluminum soda can and a stretched cloth using a three-fingered Barrett Hand. The measured deformations on each object match those in the simulation with good accuracy. The presented work is an initial step in our research on robot grasping of deformable objects.",

        "abstract": "The Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering SLAM (RBPF-SLAM) still suffers from a large-loop or nested-loop closure due to a lack of hypotheses. This makes the filter optimistic and results in the RBPF to be a short term solution. This paper provides an important insight to the current resampling scheme and proposes an approach to delaying the resampling decision until the loop closing. A discussion about the issue of preserving the importance weight is also presented with developing the weight-smoothing method. This approach is a necessary step for the RBPF-SLAM, but to the best of our knowledge, no literature deals with this concept. Since the delayed resampling maintains the possible hypotheses, the filter consistency is significantly improved. Moreover since the resampling takes the loop closure into account, the required number of particles can be proportional to the loop size of the environment. The computational burden, caused by the resampling process, is also drastically reduced due to the delaying decision. Experimental results in large-scale environment with large and nested loops illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

The feasibility demonstration will be performed on the thermonuclear experimental Tokamak: Tore Supra, located in Cadarache facilities. The manipulator developed by the interactive robotics unit of CEA-LIST will be used for close inspection intervention tasks in a Tokamak. The robot must meet severe specifications: small diameter, long reach with a 9.5 m cantilever length, high dexterity to move in a Torus shape environment and able to carry a 10 kg payload on its end effector. As the robot must be introduced without breaking the machine conditioning, it has to cope with the vacuum and temperature constraints: Ultra High Vacuum (10-6 Pa) and 120degC in use, 200degC during baking phase. This long reach multi-link carrier has 10 DOF (9 rotary joints and 1 prismatic joint). It is composed of 5 modules and a precise guiding and pushing system (the deployer) for a total weight of about 300 kg. The gravity effect in the manipulator is largely compensated by a special mechanical structure (the parallelogram) that helps reducing the size of the actuators. The severe operating conditions impose a selection of several vacuum and temperature technologies that have been tested, qualified or optimized to cope with the requirements.In September 2007, the Remote Handling Equipment deployment under atmospheric conditions in a real Tokamak environment (Tore Supra) enabled to qualify the entire prototype. The scenario has to be rehearsed under vacuum and temperature to achieve the complete feasibility demonstration of a Tokamak close inspection by means of a robotic equipment under real operating conditions. The demonstration is an important step in the project but further developments are or could be necessary to cope with 100% of the requirements toward a reliable industrial prototype.

        "abstract": "Image based modeling methods has been well studied for generating a 3D model from an image sequence. Most of them require redundant and huge spatio-temporal images for estimating a scene depth. It is not good characteristic for taking a higher resolution of texture. A route panorama is a continuous panoramic image along a path. It is suitable for modeling large environments such as a city or town. The panorama captured by a line scan sensor also has advantage for capturing higher resolution easily. In this paper, we propose a method for depth estimation from the panorama. The route panorama has color drifts that correspond to the distances of captured objects. We use these color drifts to estimate the depth of an image. The proposed method detects the color drift by window matching using belief propagation. It also uses a Gaussian pyramid to stabilize the estimation and decrease its computation cost. We confirmed that the proposed method estimated depth maps from a single high-resolution panorama in experiments.",

        "abstract": "We present a new device aimed at being used for upper limb rehabilitation. Our main focus was to design a robot capable of working in both the passive mode (i.e. the robot shall be strong enough to generate human-like movements while guiding the weak arm of a patient) and the active mode (i.e. the robot shall be able of following the arm without disturbing human natural motion). This greatly challenges the design, since the system shall be reversible and lightweight while providing human compatible strength, workspace and speed. The solution takes the form of an orthotic structure, which allows control of human arm redundancy contrarily to clinically available upper limb rehabilitation robots. It is equipped with an innovative transmission technology, which provides both high gear ratio and fine reversibility. In order to evaluate the device and its therapeutic efficacy, we compared several series of pointing movements in healthy subjects wearing and not wearing the orthotic device. In this way, we could assess any disturbing effect on normal movements. Results show that the main movement characteristics (direction, duration, bell shape profile) are preserved.",

To construct a database for moving sounds, we developed a moving sound creation tool using the API library developed by the ARINIS Company. We developed a two-channel-based sound source localization system integrated with a cross-power spectrum phase (CSP) analysis and EM algorithm. The CSP of sound signals obtained with only two microphones is used to localize the sound source without having to use prior information such as impulse response data. The EM algorithm helps the system cope with several moving sound sources and reduce localization error. We evaluated our sound localization method using artificial moving sounds and confirmed that it can well localize moving sounds slower than 1.125 rad/sec. Finally, we solve the problem of distinguishing whether sounds are coming from the front or back by rotating a robotpsilas head equipped with only two microphones. Our system was applied to a humanoid robot called SIG2, and we confirmed its ability to localize sounds over the entire azimuth range.",

The micro electrode design is based on the assumption that the electrical potential at any point (x,y,z) created by a micro electrode of interest is defined by a polynomial that obeys Laplace\u2019s equation. By substituting this polynomial into Laplace\u2019s equation the corresponding equipotentials can therefore be determined, and these in turn can be used to define the required micro electrode boundaries for use in carbon nanotube deposition, manipulation, and implementation using dielectrophoresis for electronics and sensing application.

        "abstract": "The design hypothesis, architectures, and computational modeling of a novel peptide based nanoGripper are presented in this paper. We engineered the alpha-helical coiled coil portion of the yeast transcriptional activator peptide called GCN4 to obtain an environmentally-responsive nanoGripper. The dimeric coiled-coil peptide consists of two identical ~4.5nm long and ~3nm wide polypeptide chains. The actuation mechanism depends on the modification of electrostatic charges along the peptide by varying the pH of the solution resulting in the reversible movement of helices and therefore, creating the motion of a gripper. Using molecular dynamics simulations we showed that pH changes led to a reversible opening of up-to 1.5 nm which is approximately 150 % of the initial separation of the nanoGripper. We also investigated the forces generated by the nanoGripper upon pH actuation. Using a new method based on a modified steered molecular dynamics technique we were able to show that the force output of the nanoGripper is comparable to that generated by ATP-based molecular motors such as myosin and kinesin even though our molecular tweezer is smaller in size to these molecular motors.",

They consist of a thin polymer membrane and micromolded polyurethane veins. The planar shape and venation of one type were the same as those of a swallowtail butterfly, and those of the other two were different. The effect of the distribution of stiffness over the wings by the veins on flight characteristics during free forward flight was investigated using an ornithopter and the three different types of wing. The overall aerodynamic coefficients were the highest for the wings with veins the same as those of a swallowtail butterfly, indicating that the veins enable slow forward flight.",

The designed XY stage is featured with flexure hinges and a relatively simple structure. The output decoupling is allowed by the employment of compound parallelogram flexure, and the input decoupling is implemented by actuation isolation which is enabled by the double compound parallelogram flexure with large transverse stiffness. An improved displacement amplifier is adopted to amplify the stroke of linear actuator and to simplify the stage architecture. Kinematic models of both the amplifier and the XY stage are conducted by resorting to compliance analysis based on matrix method, which are validated by finite element analysis performed with ANSYS. The presented results are helpful for the design of a new XY flexure parallel manipulator for micro/nano scale manipulation.",

The device consists of a knee brace in which a motorized mechanism actively places and removes a spring in parallel with the knee joint. This mechanism is controlled such that the spring is in parallel with the knee joint from approximately heel-strike to toe-off, and is removed from this state during the swing phase of running. In this way, the spring is intended to store energy at heel-strike which is then released when the heel leaves the ground, reducing the effort required by the quadriceps to exert this energy, thereby reducing the metabolic cost of running.",

The new knowledge of the objects are provided by the manufacturers of the object and the owners, designers, architects, or removers who structure the environment whenever the ambience changes. Secondly, in case of different robots, the same ambient intelligence can handle different kinds of robots. No one needs to customize each robot. Each robot is able to execute tasks using the common ambient intelligence.",

We first derive formula for calculating virtual ankle-joint torque and a performance index of dissipated mechanical energy for a convex foot shape model with general foot shape parameterization. Secondly, using the foot shape determined by a 2nd Bezier curve with which a form can be controlled easily, we calculate a value of the virtual ankle-joint torque and the performance index of dissipated mechanical energy to verify effects of change in foot shape. Furthermore, relationship between the foot shapes and the walking speeds are clarified by a numerical simulation. Finally, we propose a method to design a convex foot shape that attains a desired virtual ankle-joint torque and verify an improvement of the walking speed by a numerical simulation with the foot shape that is designed by the proposed method. We believe that the proposed method will be applied to design effective active ankle-joint torque and/or to design a foot shape for biped robots.",

The quartz crystal resonator has the characteristic that the resonance frequency changes by the external force, which achieves high sensitivity, high-speed response, and wide range of measurement by a simple structure. Also it has the superior feature in the temperature and frequency stability. In the past, the quartz crystal resonator had been hardly applied to the force measurement because of low degree of mechanical characteristic, that is, it is weak to stress concentration by bending. The objective of this study is to construct the sensor mechanism that safely maintains the quartz crystal resonator for the external force with flat structure. We designed and analyzed a novel retention mechanism of the quartz crystal resonator. The proposed force sensor is flat, small, and sensitive. It can be applied to several usages such as medical treatment and contact force detection of human.",

We study crawler robots that can traverse rough terrains and are used in such search operations. This paper describes the designing of an online simulation environment using which we can develop control algorithms for crawler robots, especially for the robot named \u201cKenaf.\u201d We use USARSim that can simulate three-dimensional space. By employing realtime simulation, we connect a real robot controller and the simulator directly and realize online simulation using the real robot controller.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an anomaly detection system that is able to detect time-related anomalies by using a wireless sensor network and a mobile robot. The sensor network uses an unsupervised fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network to learn and detect intruders in a previously unknown environment. Upon the detection of an intruder, a mobile robot travels to the position where the intruder is detected to investigate by using its camera. The wireless sensor network uses a hierarchical communication/learning structure, where the mobile robot is the root node of the tree. Our fuzzy ART network is based on Kulakov and Davcevpsilas implementation (Kulakov and Davcev, 2005). However, we enhance their work by extending the fuzzy ART neural network with a Markov model to learn a time series and detect time-related anomalies. Finally, a mobile robot is employed to verify whether the detected anomalies were caused by intruders. The proposed architecture is tested on physical hardware. Our results show that our enhanced detection system with mobile robot verification has a higher accuracy and lower false alarm rate than the original fuzzy ART system.",

Though a significant amount of work has been done on detecting obstacles, not much attention has been given to the detection of drop-offs, e.g., sidewalk curbs, downward stairs, and other hazards where an error could lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we propose algorithms for detecting both obstacles and drop-offs (also called negative obstacles) in an urban setting using stereo vision and motion cues. We propose a global color segmentation stereo method and compare its performance at detecting hazards against prior work using a local correlation stereo method. Furthermore, we introduce a novel drop-off detection scheme based on visual motion cues that adds to the performance of the stereo-vision methods. All algorithms are implemented and evaluated on data obtained by driving a mobile robot in urban environments.",

Regarding the items in the ceiling side, after the dismantling task of the ceiling panels, it is necessary to remove carefully the screws that once held these boards to the Light Gauge Steel (LGS), with the purpose of reusing. The proposed methodology to achieve the task consists at first of the LGS detection. Such detection is useful as a first approach to detect the screws because a trajectory under and near of that metal-ceiling structure can be generated for a scanning process. In both tasks, a stereo camera configured as an eye-in-hand system is necessary. During the motion under the structure, the screws are detected by applying a multi-template matching process to every caught image. A multi-frame integration increases the robustness in the screw detection process. The results of all the processed images along the trajectory are analyzed in order to measure both the true and the false positive detection rates of the screws attached to the LGS and to measure the 3D position of each one.",

Exploiting these measurements, we form a maximum-likelihood estimate of the camera-to-body transformation, without assuming prior knowledge of the robot motion or of the mirror configuration. Additionally, we estimate the mirror configuration with respect to the camera for each image. We validate the accuracy and correctness of our method with simulations and real-world experiments.",

The thrust production from this device was characterized in a static environment and seen to be well approximated by a simple fluid slug model. A linear transfer function model was derived to describe the transient dynamics of this thruster and a virtual vehicle simulation was developed to test the thruster with unsteady driving signals to verify this model. Due to the extremely non-linear nature of underwater vehicle environments we developed a scaling system to classify regimes of maneuvers and characterize their dynamics independently. Within the hybrid simulation environment, using a simple proportional derivative control algorithm, a thruster/controller was designed and observed to provide sufficient control over the vehicle performing large scale maneuvers. However, some additional compensation may be required for accurate small scale maneuvers which require minimal overshoot.",

During the injured fingerpsilas flexion and extension motion the machine can always exert perpendicular forces on the finger phalanges, meanwhile it can achieve the precise control of scope, force and speed of the moving fingers. In order to control the CPM machine, we have also designed an embedded control system based on S3C2410 (a kind of 32-bit RISC microprocessor).

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the design and development of a positioning and compensation device for a versatile micro robot. To provide microscopic operations, the versatile micro robot has developed. The robot can move in any direction in the manner of an inchworm. However many positioning errors exist because of an assembling error in the four piezoelectric actuators and two electromagnets. We need an automatic positioning device for more accurate work. Motion compensation is also highly required for more effective work. This robot is very small, so it can easily be set to work with the various devices. The positing device should also be small so that we can carry the device easily and set it up in a narrow working area. In this report, we propose a USB camera based positioning device with special compensation function. In experiments, we succeeded in controlling the robot on an octagonal path with controlling the posture angle freely. When we compensate for the motion, the positioning time becomes 60 % compared to that of no compensation. The design procedure, basic performance and biomedical application are also discussed as an advance in the new field of micro-robotics used in precision regions.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to create an interface for human-robot interaction. Specifically, musical performance parameters (i.e. vibrato expression) of the Waseda Flutist Robot No.4 Refined IV (WF-4RIV) are to be manipulated. Our research is focused on enabling the WF-4RIV to interact with human players (musicians) in a natural way. In this paper, as a first approach, a vision processing algorithm, that is able to track the 3D-orientation and position of a musical instrument, was developed. In particular, the robot acquires image data through two cameras attached to its head. Using color histogram matching and a particle filter, the position of the musicianpsilas hands on the instrument are tracked. Analysis of this data determines orientation and location of the instrument. These parameters are mapped to manipulate the musical expression of the WF-4RIV, more specifically sound vibrato and volume values. We present preliminary experiments to determine if the robot may dynamically change musical parameters while interacting with a human player (i.e. vibrato etc.). From the experimental results, we may confirm the feasibility of the interaction during a performance, although further research must be carried out to consider the physical constraints of the flutist robot.",

We have developed an android robot called ldquoRepliee Q2rdquo that closely resembles a human being; however, the sensors mounted on its body are not sufficient to allow human-like communication due to factors such as sensing range and spatial resolution. To overcome this problem, we endowed the environment surrounding the android with perceptive capabilities by embedding a variety of sensors into it. This sensor network provides the android with human-like perception by constantly and extensively monitoring human activities in a less obvious manner. This paper reports on an android system that is integrated with a sensor network system embedded in the environment. A human-android interaction experiment shows that the integrated system provides relatively human-like interaction.",

Up until now, we have developed flexible, thin and lightweight center of pressure (CoP) sensor. The sensor, constructed of pressure conductive rubber sandwiched between two sheets of conductive film, is able to detect the center position of the load distribution and the total load. Recently, detection of initial slip has been shown to be possible. However the detection principles are unclear. Therefore, we carried out verification experiments of the slip detection properties of the CoP sensor and the detection principle. In the results, we found a change in electrical conductivity produced with a shear deformation of the pressure conductive rubber. In this paper, we will discuss the slip detection properties of the CoP sensor and detection principle.",

To acquire high mobility and jumping, AirHopper consists of the following mechanisms. 1) 4 legs that are widely spread like a spider for stability, 2) active wheels on its feet which are driven by built-in motors and transmissions, 3) 2 decoupled pneumatic cylinders per leg and a built-in piston that drive 4-bar linkage leg mechanism. In this paper, we proposed the design of a powerful light weight leg-wheel mechanism, and verified its validity. AirHopper jumped 850 mm vertically, and landed on the ground softly by means of controlling in-cylinder pressure. Running jump motion was also achieved.",

The stator of the rotary-linear motor is fabricated as a single metallic cube with a through-hole and shaft is inserted to the through-hole. Four piezoelectric elements are bonded to the sides of the stator. When AC voltage at each resonant frequency is applied to the piezoelectric elements, the shaft can move to the rotary and linear directions. There are several control inputs such as the voltage, the frequency, and the phase difference of two AC voltages to control the motor. We have measured the characteristics of the control inputs. As the result, the control characteristics of voltages were linear and were better than those of the frequency and phase difference. On the other hand, the MRI compatibility test was conducted in 0.3 Tesla MRI. MRI image shows the practical quality of the image in the case of that the motor is placed at the center of the imaging volume of MRI while the motor is not driven.",

Then, after introducing several appearance designs of a robot, we shift our focus to a locomotor for them. After we simplified their appearances into a skeletal model, we implement a simple embodied agent within a physical simulation. Using the physical simulation, we test the validity of the locomotion model, and analyze basic behaviors of the agent. We also test swing-slip locomotion within the real-world.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a wall climbing robotic system for visual inspection of man-made structures. The adhesion mechanism of our system consists of an impeller and two-layer suction seals which provide sufficient adhesion forces for supporting the robot body on the non-smooth vertical wall and horizontal ceiling by generating pressure difference between the inside of the pressure chamber and the ambient environment. A comprehensive study is performed on the dynamic fluid modeling of the adhesion mechanism and the adhesion force is controlled by adjusting the pressure inside of the chamber. In addition, stable differential-driving locomotion on non-smooth surface are achieved by adapting a suspension mechanism for each wheel. A wall climbing robot, called LARVA, is successfully developed and its effectiveness of locomotion is verified with experiments on non-smooth vertical wall and horizontal ceiling surface.",

This method finds contact point trajectories from contact points between the robotic hand and the object with task-orientated manipulation quality measurement. Based on the defined manipulation quality, the pose for robotic hand relative to object can also be optimized by random sample. Experiments using Schunk anthropomorphic hand with 13 degrees of freedom screwing a light bulb into holder with screw thread demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of the introduced method.",

But comparing the weight of the object to another object (say, an apple) would be an easy task and an everyday occurrence. In this paper we explore support friction estimation for pushing operations. We present two difference-based techniques for measuring friction (a transition-based method and a work-based method) and test each using two different force sensors (a commercial sensor and an estimation method based on motor torque). Our results show that low-cost, noisy force sensors perform just as well as highly accurate sensors when used with our difference-based friction estimation techniques. Finally, we present an algorithm which determines if two objects have statistically similar support friction coefficients using a modified version of Student\u2019s t-test.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to differentially constrained robot motion planning and efficient re-planning. Satisfaction of differential constraints is guaranteed by the state lattice, a search space which consists of motions that satisfy the constraints by construction. Any systematic replanning algorithm, e.g. D*, can be utilized to search the state lattice to find a motion plan that satisfies the differential constraints, and to repair it efficiently in the event of a change in the environment. Further efficiency is obtained by varying the fidelity of representation of the planning problem. High fidelity is utilized where it matters most, while it is lowered in the areas that do not affect the quality of the plan significantly. The paper presents a method to modify the fidelity between replans, thereby enabling dynamic flexibility of the search space, while maintaining its compatibility with replanning algorithms. The approach is especially suited for mobile robotics applications in unknown challenging environments. In this setting, we applied the planner successfully to the navigation of research prototype rovers in JPL Mars Yard.",

We claim that the inclusion of simple everyday objects as part of distributed robot systems would have many advantages, and propose a design pattern to allow this inclusion. We make this pattern concrete by describing an implementation of it using a specific multi-robot middleware, called PEIS-Ecology Middleware. We also show an illustrative experiment which integrates everyday objects in a smart home equipped with mobile robots as well as more advanced distributed sensor nodes.",

Separation or penetration distance is computed with no space and time discretization for constant-speed motions. Motions are constrained to two degrees of freedom. Objects and their motions are modeled by 3D spherically-extended polytopes. The distance-computation algorithm returns a set of parameters that characterizes the maximum approach positions and the corresponding instant of time. Additionally, this set of parameters also characterizes a new motion for one of the objects to come into contact with the other moving object.",

The idea behind this algorithm is to make use of the structure similarity between sensor networks and SV Rs with 2D input data in order to implement SV R in a distributed way. During training stage, each sensor node provides its 2D coordinates as an input pattern and a sensory data as an output to the algorithm. By using local wireless communication with neighbors and kernel function with finite support, each sensor node independently learns its own Lagrange multipliers. During evaluation stage of learned regression function, each sensor node obtains a local result by communicating with local neighbors and estimates a global result by using a consensus algorithm. Simulations are provided to verify the proposed algorithm.",

It tries to maintain the target being visible to the mobile network all the time while consuming as little motion energy as possible. Meanwhile the network connectivity is maintained. At every time, only the nodes around the target are activated while other nodes keep idle. Certain functions are defined to quantify the main aspects in the tracking such as the target escaping probability and the network connectivity status. They transform the tracking into a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this global problem, a local motion strategy is proposed. Simulation results show that our algorithm yields good performance.",

The humanoid robot starts its motion from a statically stable configuration to another known statically stable configuration when it is necessary to make step; that is, the center of mass (COM) is inside the support polygon at the initial and the goal configurations. A dynamic motion generation method is proposed in order to generate the whole-body robot motion. Zero moment point preview control is used for maintaining dynamic stability while the robot is taking the step and suitable splines are used for generating the hands, neck and foot motion because it is a free motion on the field of gravity; the screw theory is applied under Lie groups for kinematics and dynamics humanoid modeling, which allows smooth and natural humanoid motion. Successful results on the HRP-2 humanoid robot are shown and discussed.",

A fuzzy-logic based control strategy is adopted to maintain a constant translational speed in robotpsilas motion when subjected to flow disturbances that are numerically modeled using step changes in flow velocity within a simulation environment. The controller has been synthesized in real-time through a human-in-the-loop setting within a virtual reality environment.",

In this paper, we propose a dynamic correlation matrix based multi-Q learning (DCM-MultiQ) method for a distributed multi-robot system. A novel dynamic correlation matrix is proposed, which not only handles each agent\u2019s Q value, but also deals with the correlation among agents. Furthermore, a theoretical proof of the convergence of the proposed DCM-MultiQ algorithm is also provided using a feedback matrix control theory. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed DCM-MultiQ method, several case studies of a multi-robot system in forage tasks have been conducted. The simulation results show the efficiency and convergence of the proposed method.",

Particularly, we have developed a steady crawl gait with duty factor beta = 0.75. The main feature of the suggested algorithm is that it does not based on the foothold selection, and it can be used for the walking of blind robots on more realistic irregular terrain. The adaptation algorithms are the translational velocity modification to satisfy the steady gait requirement and the swing period modification to avoid the kinematic limitation. The suggested gait generation algorithm has been implemented in a simple quadruped robot which has totally eight actuated joints on the legs. Using the PD controller for the trajectory following and the adaptation algorithm of gait parameters, the steady periodic crawl gait on low irregular terrain has been demonstrated.",

The key issue of lifting motion is how to reduce the load on humanoid arms in which low-power actuators are implemented. The use of singular postures of arms is well-known to avoid actuator saturation of the arms. By combining two different kinds of humanoid motions such as accelerating an object upward and sliding the body into under the object, we propose a method that enables to transit one singular posture of arms to another while lifting the object. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for reducing the load on the arms. We realize a motion of lifting a heavy object dynamically with the humanoid robot HRP-2 through experiment.",

Using this 3-D simulation along with several 1-D and 2-D models, stability in terms of robot elevation from the water surface and robot rolling are examined. Analysis of the lifting force shows the robot is capable of running on water using viscous drag forces. Using this analysis, a criterion for convergence to a steady state distance from the water is presented. It is determined that 7-12 Hz is an appropriate running frequency range for the robot to lift its weight. Compliant footpads are found to be beneficial in reducing the force associated with pulling out of the water. Further, from the roll motion analysis, previous designs result in instability along the roll axis. By comparing leg running frequency to the bodypsilas roll frequency, the minimum required roll moment of inertia for stable roll motion can be determined.",

In the authors\u2019 previous works, a dynamic object grasping method by using a pair of robotic fingers, called \u201cBlind Grasping\u201d, which does not need to use any external sensing, was proposed. However, it is so far assumed that spinning motion around the opposite axis for the object does not occur during the overall movement, because there are only two opposite fingers and thereby the spinning is uncontrollable. By introducing a surplus finger in addition to a pair of robotic fingers, this spinning can be inhibited and it becomes controllable. In this paper, a triple-fingered robotic hand system with nonholonomic constraints is modeled, and a control input to realize stable grasping with object position control is proposed. Its usefulness and effectiveness are illustrated through some numerical simulation results.",

We first extend our prevous algorithm for linear-time forward dynamics algorithm to handle closed kinematic chains. The extended algorithm is formally presented for the first time. We then present another extension that allows position-controlled joints, whose angles exactly follow the reference by perfect servo controllers. This feature is often useful for simple trial simulations only using joint angle commands because the user does not have to design low-level servo controllers for simulation. The simulation can also be performed without precise friction parameters. The algorithm is tested on a humanoid robot having toe joints with four-bar linkage structure.",

As the size of the robot gets smaller, finding an effective and efficient means of locomotion becomes especially challenging. This paper explores the limits for locomotion efficacy and efficiency by comparing simple locomotion models. Microrobot implementation issues that are not as easily modeled are also discussed. While legs and wheels may be theoretically efficient, they are not particularly effective for moving on varied surfaces and incur large efficiency penalties when implemented. Jumping may offer the best compromise for effective and efficient locomotion in millimeter-sized microrobots.",

The efficiency is then numerically analyzed and the optimality of mechanical energy restoration is discussed. It is also shown that perfectly ballistic gait by kick action achieves the highest walking speed and exhibits symmetric gait automatically. We discuss how the symmetric gait is generated from the angular momentum point of view.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to establish a good grasp for a novel object quickly. A comprehensive knowledge base for grasping is learned that takes into account the geometrical and physical knowledge of grasping. To automate the learning process as much as possible, learning happens in a virtual environment. We used the GraspIt! [16] simulation environment with the Barrett hand for this work. As only approximate features of objects are used for training the grasping knowledge base (GKB), the knowledge gained is rather robust to object uncertainty. Based on the guidance of the GKB, a suitable grasp for a novel object can be found quickly. The newly gained grasping information of the new object can also be feedback to the GKB so that the knowledge base continues to improve as it is exposed to more grasping cases. The GKB serves as the \u201cexperience\u201d of the robotic gripper to make grasping more and more skillful. We implemented the approach and tested it on a wide variety of objects. The results show the effectiveness of this approach to achieve quick and good grasps of novel objects.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many vision-based robotic applications such as visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) and autonomous navigation have achieved good performance using visual features. In these applications, robust feature tracking plays an important role, e.g., in scene recognition for autonomous navigation and in data association for visual SLAM. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical outlier detection algorithm for robust feature tracking; the algorithm uses a simple window-based correlation (NCC) and enforces angular and scale constraints. The proposed algorithm maximizes the inter-cluster score and detects outliers that do not satisfy the angular constraints. The remaining outliers are detected by enforcing scale constraints using SIFT descriptors. The proposed algorithm is efficient and particularly useful for scene recognition, in which an image corresponding to a query image is searched among data images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust to outliers and image variations such as scale changes. One of the main applications of the proposed algorithm is global localization due to its low computational complexity and robustness to outliers.",

Dynamic and Static constraints have been included in order to improve the movement realism. Two simplified hand models with 9 and 6 DoF have been developed according to the constraints predefined. These simplified models involve some errors in reconstructing the hand posture. These errors are calculated with respect to the 24 DoF model and evaluated according to the hand gestures. Finally, some criteria are defined to select the hand description best suited to the features of the manipulation task.",

The only assumptions are the availability of odometry and a range sensor able of identifying the different beacons. We propose exploiting the conditional independence between the position distributions of each beacon within a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) for maintaining independent Sum of Gaussians (SOGs) for each beacon. Unlike other approaches, it is shown then that a proper probabilistic observation model can be derived for online operation with no need for delayed initializations. We provide a rigorous statistical comparison of this proposal with previous work of the authors where a Monte-Carlo approximation was employed instead for the conditional densities. As verified experimentally, this new proposal represents a significant improvement in accuracy, computation time, and robustness against outliers.",

In multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), it becomes very important how efficiently a given map can be shared among the robot team. To this end, the recently proposed pose graph map representation is used, adapted for use in a particle filter based mapping algorithm, and compared to the standard occupancy grid representation. Through analysis of corner cases as well as experiments with real robot data, the two map representations are thoroughly compared. It is shown that the pose graph representation allows for much more efficient communication of map updates than the standard occupancy grid.",

Most of the sensor models for range sensors proposed in the past either consider the individual beam measurements independently or apply uni-modal models to represent the likelihood function. In this paper, we present an approach that learns place-dependent sensor models for entire range scans using Gaussian mixture models. To deal with the high dimensionality of the measurement space, we utilize principle component analysis for dimensionality reduction. In practical experiments carried out with data obtained from a real robot, we demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms existing and popular sensor models.",

        "abstract": "The most common ground locomotion method to make a mobile robot move is to use two-wheel drive with differential steering and a rear balancing caster. Controlling the two motors independently makes the robot non-holonomic in its motion. Such robots can work well indoor on flat surfaces and in environments adapted for wheelchairs. But the benefit of providing mobility to a robot directly relies on its locomotion capability, for handling different types of terrains (indoors or outdoors) and situations such as moving slowly or rapidly, with or without the presence of moving objects (living or not), climbing over objects and potentially having to deal with hazardous conditions. It is with this objective in mind that we designed AZIMUT. AZIMUT is a legged tracked wheeled robot capable of changing the orientation of its four articulations [1]. Each articulation has three degrees of freedom (DOF): it can rotate 360\u00b0 around its point of attachment to the chassis, can change its orientation over 180\u00b0, and rotate to propulse the robot.",

In the first, a robot hand pre-shapes to the geometry and pose of objects to be grasped, by servoing each finger according to the values on EF sensors built in to each finger. In the second, a 7 degree of freedom arm aligns itself in 2 dimensions with a target object using electric field measurements as the error signal. This system also allows the end effector to dynamically track the target object as it is moved.",

This paper proposed to recognize emotion using physiological signals obtained from multiple subjects. IAPS images were used to elicit target emotions. Five physiological signals: Blood volume pulse (BVP), Electromyography (EMG), Skin Conductance (SC), Skin Temperature (SKT) and Respiration (RESP) were selected to extract 30 features for recognition. Two pattern classification methods, Fisher discriminant and SVM method are used and compared for emotional state classification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides very stable and successful emotional classification performance as 92% over six emotional states.",

        "abstract": "Underwater operations present unique challenges and opportunities for robotic applications. These can be attributed in part to limited sensing capabilities, and to locomotion behaviours requiring control schemes adapted to specific tasks or changes in the environment. From enhancing teleoperation procedures, to providing high-level instruction, all the way to fully autonomous operations, enabling autonomous capabilities is fundamental for the successful deployment of underwater robots. This paper presents an overview of the approaches used during underwater sea trials in the coral reefs of Barbados, for two amphibious mobile robots and a set of underwater sensor nodes. We present control mechanisms used for maintaining a preset trajectory during enhanced teleoperations and discuss their experimental results. This is followed by a discussion on amphibious data gathering experiments conducted on the beach. We then present a tetherless underwater communication approach based on pure vision for high-level control of an underwater vehicle. Finally the construction details together with preliminary results from a set of distributed underwater sensor nodes are outlined.",

Accurate energy measurements supported by NIMS-PL enable path planning that optimizes the robot\u2019s path subject to an upper bound on energy consumption. We performed extensive empirical validation of the optimized path planning approach in simulation using an environmental sensing application as an example. We also validated the simulation results using NIMS-PL, demonstrating significant improvements in the sensing task when accounting with accurate energy measurements as opposed to Euclidean distance, which is typically used for modeling energy spent in path traversal.",

One of the key challenges that has prevented engineers from coming up with convincing aerial solutions for indoor exploration is the energetic cost of flying. This paper presents a way of mitigating the energy problem regarding aerial exploration within indoor environments. This is achieved by means of a model to estimate the endurance of a hover-capable flying robot and by using ceiling attachment as a means of preserving energy while maintaining a birds-eye-view. The proposed model for endurance estimation has been extensively tested using a custom-developed quadrotor and autonomous ceiling attachment system.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "There is a great effort during the last decades towards building robotic devices that are worn by humans. These devices, called exoskeletons, are used mainly for support and rehabilitation, as well as for augmentation of human capabilities. Providing a control interface for exoskeletons, that would guarantee comfort and safety, as well as efficiency and robustness, is still an issue. This paper presents a methodology for estimating human arm motion and force exerted, using electromyographic (EMG) signals from muscles of the upper limb. The proposed method is able to estimate motion of the human arm as well as force exerted from the upper limb to the environment, when the motion is constrained. Moreover, the method can distinguish the cases in which the motion is constrained or not (i.e. exertion of force versus free motion) which is of great importance for the control of exoskeletons. Furthermore, the method provides a continuous profile of estimated motion and force, in contrast to other methods used in the literature that can only detect initiation of movement or intention of force. The system is tested in an orthosis-like scenario, during planar movements, through various experiments. The experimental results prove the system efficiency, making the proposed methodology a strong candidate for an EMG-based control scheme applied in robotic exoskeletons.",

        "abstract": "The problem of estimating the positions of landmarks using a mobile robot equipped with a camera has intensively been studied in the past. In this paper, we consider a variant of this problem in which the robot should estimate the locations of observed landmarks based on a sparse set of geo-referenced images for which no heading information is available. Sources for such kind of data are image portals such as Flickr or Google Image Search. We formulate the problem of estimating the landmark locations as an optimization problem and show that it is possible to accurately localize the landmarks in real world settings.",

        "abstract": "A novel method is introduced to estimate the camera parameters when there is no useful information in the scene but in which two or more parallelograms exist. First, the proposed method acquires the infinite homography by rectification of the imaged parallelograms instead of the general method that uses vanishing point correspondences directly. Due to this peculiar approach, the additional constraints that arise from the parallelograms can be acquired. Second, the infinite homography estimated together with the additional constraints is applied to the calibration of a camera. Owing to the effect of the additional constraints, more accurate estimation results can be acquired. Moreover, even if the number of vanishing points induced from parallelograms is three, the infinite homography and, consequently, camera parameters can be computed without the need for an estimation of the fundamental matrix that requires many point correspondences between the views for accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a method for force estimation on inverted pendulum type balancing platforms is presented and examined. Inverted pendulum systems are sensitive to small external forces because they are being balanced about an unstable position of zero force. The perturbations that result from external forces cause noticeable changes to the system state variables and it is these changes that are used to estimate the force. We present a dynamic model for the inverted pendulum and then examine several methods for estimating an external force. Use of the open loop plant parameters offers the best method for estimating the net torques acting on the system. A significant outcome is that estimation can be performed using only the system mass properties along with the inertial and displacement sensors that are required for balancing and this estimate is more accurate than a comparable drive system in a statically stable robot. Thus improved one axis force estimation may be accomplished using the same sensors that are used to stabilize the platform.",

It utilizes the face direction as 3D vectors and estimates the position of group attention defined as the intersection of the multiple vectors. As a result, the position of the group attention can be represented as an arbitrary 3D position unlike other research in which only registered objects can be the focus of attention. As experiments, the group attention at word-chain game is estimated and the feasibility of the method is confirmed. We applied the proposed method to video conferencing, and developed the attention tracking system which acquires the group attention in real-time.",

These gaits should enable the fastest movement that is possible with the given robot mechanics and drives on a flat terrain. We show in a series of evolutionary simulations how a gradual reduction of the permissible state space of the movements of the robot legs leads to the proper leg trajectories for a hexapod robot. This strategy enables the learning system to discover feasible gaits, using only simple dependencies between the control signals of the legs and a simple fitness function. Finally, a stable and fast tripod gait evolved in simulation is shown in an experiment on the real walking robot Ragno.",

        "abstract": "There is a clear trend toward the miniaturization of medical devices for minimally invasive medical procedures, ranging from diagnosis and targeted drug delivery to complex surgical interventions. Current research focuses on increasing the functionality of commercially successful capsule endoscope technology by developing active locomotion and telemetry. The size of such a capsule must not be larger than what a person can swallow without difficulty. One approach to increase functionality while still working within this size constraint is to build a modular robotic system in which the modules are swallowed one at a time, and the final assembly is performed inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge that must be be met for the success of such swallowable modular robots-their self-assembly. We propose to use magnets in a specific configuration on the mating faces of the modules. Our results show that high success rates can be achieved and snake-type robots can be self-assembled with compliant magnetic joints allowing them to adapt to highly irregular paths, such as the small intestine.",

        "abstract": "Tracked mobile robots (TMRs) can be considered as the most important type of mobile robots. Large contact area of tracks with the ground provides superior advantages for TMRs such as better mobility in unstructured environments, though it may cause a higher risk of slippage. In this paper, an experimental slip model is proposed for exact kinematics modeling, and the parameters of this model will be determined based on experimental analysis of ResQuake. This is a tele-operative rescue mobile robot with great capabilities in climbing obstacles in destructed areas, and its performance was demonstrated in Rescue robot league of RoboCup 2005 in Osaka (Japan), achieving the 2nd best design award, and RoboCup 2006 in Bremen (Germany) achieving the best operator interface award. Therefore, ResQuake is used here as an experimental platform to study the relationship between slippage of tracks and two main physically meaningful factors, i.e. radius of the tracking path and speed of the robot. The slip coefficients will be obtained as an exponential function of radius of curvature of the path. To validate the obtained results, the proposed model will be used along with two path tracking controllers, and it is empirically demonstrated that the developed model drastically improves the system performance in terms of lower path tracking errors.",

        "abstract": "In this contribution we present a CPG (central pattern generator) controller based on coupled R\u00f6ssler systems. It is able to generate both limit cycle and chaotic behaviors through bifurcation. We develop an experimental test bench to measure quantitatively the performance of different controllers on unknown terrains of increasing difficulty. First, we show that for flat terrains, open loop limit cycle systems are the most efficient (in terms of speed of locomotion) but that they are quite sensitive to environmental changes. Second, we show that sensory feedback is a crucial addition for unknown terrains. Third, we show that the chaotic controller with sensory feedback outperforms the other controllers in very difficult terrains and actually promotes the emergence of short synchronized movement patterns. All that is done using an unified framework for the generation of limit cycle and chaotic behaviors, where a simple parameter change can switch from one behavior to the other through bifurcation. Such flexibility would allow the automatic adaptation of the robot locomotion strategy to the terrain uncertainty.",

The authors have studied an autonomous robotic explorer which can burrow into the soils. This paper focuses especially on the excavation mechanism of a burrowing robot for near-future lunar subsurface exploration. The main objective of the proposed robot is to bury a scientific observation instrument, such as a long-term seismometer under the lunar surface, which is covered with very compacted lunar regolith. Therefore, an efficient drilling mechanism is required. In this paper, the authors propose a non-reaction screw drilling mechanism with double rotation, which is called the contra-rotor screw. This paper also evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposal of a burrowing robotic system through some experimental analyses.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid microhandling is a new approach in microhandling that combines the benefits of two major branches of microhandling: robotic micromanipulation and self-assembly under a unified framework. This paper presents an in depth experimental study of a hybrid microhandling technique that combines robotic micromanipulator and droplet self-alignment. The experimental study is carried out on a home-made microrobotics test platform adapted for the experiments. Three important aspects of the microhandling technique are investigated - the efficiency, reliability, and capability - through a series of tests. With the assistance of a high-speed camera, the duration and the trajectory of the droplet self-alignment process are studied. According to authors\u2019 knowledge, such results have not been previously reported. The experimental results also indicate that such a hybrid microhandling technique has very low requirements on the precision of the handling robot (comparable to the dimensions of the micropart) while being able to achieve micrometer precision. Part sizes ranging from 50 to 300 micrometers can achieve perfect assembly results. The experiments also show, for the first time, that parts having different sizes can be reliably assembled using the proposed hybrid microhandling technique.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a method that allows automatic reaction of a robot to physical collisions, while preserving as much as possible the execution of a Cartesian task for which the robot is kinematically redundant. The work is motivated by human-robot interaction scenarios, where ensuring safety is of primary concern whereas preserving task performance is an appealing secondary goal. Unexpected collisions may occur anywhere along the manipulator structure. Their fast detection is realized using our previous momentum-based method, which does not require any external sensing. The reaction torque applied to the joints reduces the effective robot inertia seen at the contact and lets the robot safely move away from the collision area. If we wish, however, to continue the execution of a Cartesian trajectory, robot redundancy can be exploited by projecting the reaction torque into the null space of a dynamic task matrix so as not to affect the original end-effector motion. This leads to the use of the so-called dynamically consistent approach to redundancy resolution, which is further elaborated in the paper. A partial task relaxation strategy can also be devised, with the objective of keeping contact forces below a user-defined safety threshold. Simulation results are reported for the 7R KUKA/DLR lightweight robot arm.",

In this paper we provide a first step to close the loop between its graph-based theoretical formulation and practical scenarios. We show how it is possible to algorithmically extract suitable so-called surveillance graphs from occupancy grid maps. We also identify local graph modification operators, called contractions, that alter the graph being extracted so that the original surveillance problem can be solved using less robots. The algorithm we present is based on the generalized Voronoi diagram, a structure that can be simply computed using watershed like algorithms. Our algorithm is evaluated by processing maps produced by mobile robots exploring indoor environments. It turns out that the proposed algorithm is fast, robust to noise, and opportunistically modifies the graph so that less expensive strategies can be computed.",

A compact color and texture descriptor has been developed to describe local color and texture variations in an image. This descriptor is then used in a two-stage fast clustering framework using K-means to perform online segmentation of natural images. We present results of applying our descriptor for segmenting a synthetic image and compare it against other state-of-the-art descriptors. We also apply our segmentation algorithm to the task of detecting natural paths in outdoor images. The whole system has been demonstrated to work online alongside localization, 3D obstacle detection, and planning.",

These features identify the boundaries of the roadway and are used by a stochastic state estimator to identify the most likely road shape. This algorithm has been used successfully to allow an autonomous car to drive on paved roadways as well as on off-road trails without requiring different sets of parameters for the different domains.",

It consists of two parts, namely a plane fitting and a polygonalization step. Both exploit the sequential nature of 3D data acquisition on mobile robots in form of range images. For the plane fitting, this is used to revise the standard mathematical formulation to an incremental version, which allows a linear computation. For the polygonalization, the neighborhood relation in range images is exploited. Experiments are presented using a time-of-flight range camera in form of a Swissranger SR-3000. Results include lab scenes as well as data from two runs of the rescue robot league at the RoboCup German Open 2007 with 1,414, respectively 2,343 sensor snapshots. The 36ldr106, respectively 59ldr106 points from the two point clouds are reduced to about 14ldr103, respectively 23ldr103 planes with only about 0.2 sec of total computation time per snapshot while the robot moves along. Uncertainty analysis of the computed plane parameters is presented as well.",

It combines the benefits of knowledge-based ontology representation, autonomous partial ordering plan repair and robust mission execution. The approach uses the potential of ontology reasoning in order to orient the planning algorithms adapting the mission plan of the vehicle. It can handle uncertainty and action scheduling in order to maximize mission efficiency and minimise mission failures due to external unexpected factors. Its performance is presented in a set of simulated scenarios for different concepts of operations for the underwater domain. The paper concludes by showing the results of a trial demonstration carried out on a real underwater platform. The results of this paper are readily applicable to land and air robotics.",

The proposed strategy uses passivity approach for the bilateral controller and robust fault tolerant control (FTC) for the two-fingered microgripper system. First, the bilateral controller architecture uses the passivity approach for the teleoperation system in the presence of time delay and scaling factor variations. Second, the FTC controller is designed in such a way that the performance and robustness may be done separately which has the potential to overcome the conflict between performance and robustness in the traditional feedback framework. The slave controller architecture is controlled by the PI controller for a nominal model and the Hinfin controller for faulty operation. The simulation and experimental results show clearly the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

For mobile robots, a reliable method for comparing images can constitute a key component for localization tasks. In this paper, we address the issues of appearance-based topological and metric localization by introducing a novel group matching approach to select less but more robust features to match the current robot view with reference images. Feature group matching is based on the consideration that feature descriptors together with spatial relations are more robust than classical approaches. Our datasets, each consisting of a large number of omnidirectional images, have been acquired over different day times (different lighting conditions) both in indoor and outdoor environments. The feature group matching outperforms the SIFT in indoor localization showing better performances both in the case of topological and metric localization. In outdoor SURF remains the best feature extraction method, as reported in literature.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the first results of an ongoing work which aims at providing numerical tools useful to the design of a family of high speed parallel robots. The objective is to find sets of feasible values for the design parameters unlike more usual design procedures relying on optimization techniques. These tools are mainly based on interval analysis and take into account the dynamics of the parallel robots. Moreover, they can deal with bounded uncertainties that affect some physical parameters involved in the dynamics. Following the statement of the design problems considered, a general method is presented. Then, this method is illustrated with the study of a 2-DOF parallel robot.",

        "abstract": "In this paper the flocking problem for a multi-robot system, consisting in making the robots of a team grouping together, is addressed. The flocking is achieved resorting to the Null-Space-based Behavioral (NSB) control by defining very simple behaviors for each robot of the team and by properly arranging these behaviors in priority. The NSB algorithm, making the robots using only local information, successfully achieves the flocking with or without a rendez-vous point and in eventual presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations and experiments using differential-drive mobile robots prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In tightly coupled cooperative manipulation of two arms, an interaction force control is one of the important issues. In this paper, a sensor-less interaction force control in a de-burring task using a dual-arm is introduced. The dual arm manipulation increases the motion dexterity in the de-burring task as compared to the single arm manipulation. A closed form interaction force control algorithm is proposed, which does not require any force sensor. In the motion planning, the 12 Lagrangian coordinates of the system are decomposed into 9 motion degrees and 3 constrained degrees. Then, the whole dual arm can be modeled as a kinematically redundant robot. The primary task is to control the 9 motion degrees and the secondary task is to control the interaction force and the relative motion between the two arms. The concept of virtual joints is employed to represent the constrained degrees, which include the interaction force and the relative motion between the two arms. Through the simulation results, we show that the smooth de-burring task can be accomplished by using the suggested interaction force model without force sensor.",

This is a difficult problem because of the double constraint on the available time and the computational cost of robust object extraction algorithms. This paper builds upon former work on combining the strong theoretical foundations of clustering with the speed of other approaches. It is based on a novel self organizing network (SON) which has a robust initialization schema and is able to find the number of objects in an image or grid. The main contribution of our extension is that it eliminates the use of a threshold, allowing the algorithm to work on continuous, while having a complexity that remains linear with respect to the number of pixels or cells.",

A passivity analysis is done for this friction compensation, allowing a Lyapunov based convergence analysis in the context of the nonlinear robot dynamics. For the complete controlled system, global asymptotic stability can be shown. Experimental results validate the practical efficiency of the approach.",

Here, the goal of increasing the consistency and efficiency rates of these operations was pursued through robotics and automation. Initially, a teleoperated microinjection system was designed and implemented. Then, this system was evaluated under the control of a microinjection expert. The evaluation consisted of a series of blastocyst microinjections, which are presented and analyzed in this paper. The knowledge gained from these experiments was then used to: 1) create a new system setup more appropriate for automating consecutive blastocyst microinjections; 2) derive rules to guide automatic microinjections; and 3) define future research directions and system upgrades to further increase the system performance. Finally, experiments with the encoded algorithm for automatic blastocyst microinjections attested the validity of the derived rules by demonstrating a 75% success rate. The good quality of the microinjections was demonstrated by the 53% birth rate and the 20% yield of chimeras obtained from the implanted blastocysts.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the acquisition of 3D functional object maps for indoor household environments, in particular kitchens, out of 3D point cloud data. By modeling the static objects in the world into hierarchical classes in the map, such as cupboards, tables, drawers, and kitchen appliances, we create a library of objects which a household robotic assistant can use while performing its tasks. Our method takes a complete 3D point cloud model as input, and computes an object model for it. The objects have states (such as open and closed), and the resultant model is accurate enough to use it in physics-based simulations, where the doors can be opened based on their hinge position. The model is built through a series of geometrical reasoning steps, namely: planar segmentation, cuboid decomposition, fixture recognition and interpretation (e.g. handles and knobs), and object classification based on object state information.",

The most common instantiations of Bayes filters are Kalman filters (extended and unscented) and particle filters. Key components of each Bayes filter are probabilistic prediction and observation models. Recently, Gaussian processes have been introduced as a non-parametric technique for learning such models from training data. In the context of unscented Kalman filters, these models have been shown to provide estimates that can be superior to those achieved with standard, parametric models. In this paper we show how Gaussian process models can be integrated into other Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended Kalman filters. We provide a complexity analysis of these filters and evaluate the alternative techniques using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a precision positioning technique that can be applied to vehicles in urban areas. The proposed technique mitigates GPS multipath by means of an omnidirectional infrared (IR) camera that can eliminate the need for invisible satellites (a satellite detected by the receiver but without LOS (Line Of Sight)) by using IR images. Some simple GPS multipath mitigation techniques such as installation of antennas away from buildings and using choke ring antennas are well known. Further, various correlator techniques can also be employed. However, when a direct signal cannot be received by the antenna, these techniques do not provide satisfactory results because they presume that the antenna chiefly receives direct signals. On the other hand, the proposed technique can mitigate GPS multipath even if a direct signal cannot be received because it can recognize the surrounding environment by means of an omnidirectional IR camera. With the IR camera, the sky appears distinctively dark; this facilitates the detection of the borderline between the sky and the surrounding buildings, which are captured in white, due to the difference in the atmospheric transmittance rate between visible light and the IR rays. Positioning is performed only with visible satellites having less multipath errors, and without using invisible satellites. With the proposed system, static and kinematic evaluations in which invisible satellites are discriminated through observation using an omnidirectional IR camera are conducted. Hence, signals are received even if satellites are hidden behind buildings; furthermore, exclusion of satellites having large errors from the positioning computation becomes possible. The evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the feasibility of highly accurate positioning.",

Periodic motions of the legs switch between the swinging and supporting stages based on the phase of the oscillators. The oscillators receive touch sensor signals at the end of the legs as feedback when the leg touches the ground and compose a steady limit cycle of the total periodic dynamics of quadruped locomotion. And also muscle tone is adaptively controlled according to the dynamic state of the main body. This system can generate gait transition from one to another by changing locomotion speed and muscle tone.

The system consists of a binocular eye-tracking unit and a robotic instrument featuring a long, rigid shaft with an articulated distal tip for minimally invasive interventions. They have been integrated into a daVinci surgical robot to provide a seamless and non-invasive localization of eye fixations of the surgeon. By using a gaze contingent framework, the surgeonpsilas fixations in 3D are converted into commands that direct the robotic probe to the desired location. Experimental results illustrate the ability of the system to perform real-time gaze contingent robot control and opens up a new avenue for improving current human-robot interfaces.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we develop a theory of metamodules and an associated distributed asynchronous planner which generalizes previous work on metamodules for lattice-based modular robotic systems. All extant modular robotic systems have some form of non-holonomic motion constraints. This has prompted many researchers to look to metamodules, i.e., groups of modules that act as a unit, as a way to reduce motion constraints and the complexity of planning. However, previous metamodule designs have been specific to a particular modular robot. By analyzing the constraints found in modular robotic systems we develop a holonomic metamodule which has two important properties: (1) it can be used as the basic unit of an efficient planner and (2) it can be instantiated by a wide variety of different underlying modular robots, e.g., modular robot arms, expanding cubes, hex-packed spheres, etc. Using a series of transformations we show that our practical metamodule system has a provably complete planner. Finally, our approach allows the task of shape transformation to be separated into a planning task and a resource allocation task. We implement our planner for two different metamodule systems and show that the time to completion scales linearly with the diameter of the ensemble.",

The proto-symbol space is a topological space which abstracts motion patterns by utilizing continuous hidden Markov models. An interpolation algorithm for the proto-symbol space was proposed in a previous work, but an extrapolation algorithm was not. Therefore, in this study, we propose and extrapolation method which can further clarify the physical meaning of the dimension of the proto-symbol space that is one of the most essential issues for the realization of translation between motion patterns and language using the proto-symbol space. The extrapolation method also enables the robot to recognize and synthesis various kinds of motion patterns using a fewer number of proto-symbols. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "KNTU CDRPM is a cable driven redundant parallel manipulator, which is under investigation for possible high speed and large workspace applications. This newly developed mechanisms have several advantages compared to the conventional parallel mechanisms. Its rotational motion range is relatively large, its redundancy improves safety for failure in cables, and its design is suitable for long-time high acceleration motions. In this paper, collision-free workspace of the manipulator is derived by applying fast geometrical intersection detection method, which can be used for any fully parallel manipulator. Implementation of the algorithm on the Neuron design of the KNTU CDRPM leads to significant results, which introduce a new style of design of a spatial cable-driven parallel manipulators. The results are elaborated in three presentations; constant-orientation workspace, total orientation workspace and orientation workspace.",

With the utilization of satellite images and Monte Carlo localization technique, the global localization of an outdoor mobile robot is studied in this paper. The proposed method employs satellite images downloaded from the Internet to localize the robot iteratively. To accomplish this, the proposed method matches the local laser scanner data with the segmented satellite images. Initial test results conducted on the METU campus are found to be quite promising. Further improvement of this approach has the potential of cutting down not only the operational costs but also the preparation period of the mobile robot enabling researchers to operate their robots in diverse outdoor settings.",

The grasp space is constructed via a sampling method, which provides samples of force-closure or non force-closure grasps, used to compute regions of the graspable or non-graspable space, respectively. The method provides a reliable procedure for an efficient generation of the whole grasp space for n-finger grasps on discrete objects; two examples on 2D objects are provided to illustrate its performance. The approach has several applications in manipulation and regrasping of objects, as it provides a large number of force-closure and non force-closure grasps in a short time.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing systems that couple a robotic device with an ultrasound imager. Applications range from automatic probe positioning to ultrasound image-based guidance of instruments. One issue in these systems is to determine, prior to the intervention, the localization of the probe with respect to the robot. Literature suggests using external localizers, but they add to the complexity of the system, and the resulting precision is usually not good due to the addition of errors in the kinematic chain. In this paper, we study the hand-eye calibration problem without using any additional localizers. A generic system consisting of a fixed probe observing an instrument manipulated by a robot is used. We first derive a simplified model for mapping the image of the instrument with its 3D location w.r.t. the probe and then propose a calibration procedure based on a minimization algorithm. Results show that although very simple models were used for the imaging device, the localization is quite precise, as it results in errors of less than 2 mm, which is enough of a number of ultrasound guided interventions.",

This paper examines some important aspects of path planning in this context: the trade-offs between the speed of the exploration process versus the accuracy of resulting maps; and alternating between exploration of new territory and planning through known maps. The resulting motion planning strategy and associated heuristic are targeted to a robot building a map of an environment assisted by a Sensor Network composed of uncalibrated monocular cameras. An adaptive heuristic exploration strategy based on A* search over a combined distance and uncertainty cost function allows for adaptation to the environment and improvement in mapping accuracy. We assess the technique using an illustrative experiment in a real environment and a set of simulations in a parametric family of idealized environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel sound source separation method for a robot that needs to cope with dynamically changing noises in the real world. The sound source separation method, Geometric Source Separation (GSS), is promising because it has high separation performance and requires low computational cost. One of the most important factors in GSS performance is a step-size parameter to update a separation matrix which is generally used for extracting a target sound source. A fixed value that was obtained empirically is commonly used as the step-size parameter. However, in the real world, the surrounding environment changes dynamically. Thus, conventional GSS with a fixed step-size parameter sometimes results in poor separation results, or divergence of the separation matrix. Another important factor is the weight parameter, which adjusts the balance between geometric errors and separation errors and also affects performance. If this parameter is set to a small value, GSS becomes similar to a Blind Source Separation method, by which the output signal may contain errors based on indefinite source amplitudes and orders. In contrast, if this parameter is set to a large value, GSS becomes similar to a delay-and-sum Beamforming method, which does not have high separation performance. GSS gives good performance when the parameters are tuned to an optimum value, which changes according to the environment. We propose two effective methods that can be used for general BSS\u2019s. One is an adaptive step-size parameter control method. By using this method, the step-size and the weight parameters are automatically set to optimum values and are able to adapt to environmental changes. The other is an optima controlled recursive average method for correlation matrix estimation. This method can improve the estimation of a separation matrix, and achieve high separation performance. We evaluated the proposed GSS algorithm with an 8ch microphone array embedded in Honda ASIMO. Experimental r... Show More",

        "abstract": "Kinodynamic planning algorithms have the potential to find feasible control trajectories which accomplish a task even in very nonlinear or constrained dynamical systems. Underactuation represents a particular form of a dynamic constraint, inherently present in many machines of interest (e.g., walking robots), and necessitates planning for long-term control solutions. A major limitation in motion planning techniques, especially for real-time implementation, is that they are only practical for relatively low degree-of-freedom problems. Here we present a model-based dimensionality reduction technique based on an extension of partial feedback linearization control into a task-space framework. This allows one to plan motions for a complex underactuated robot directly in a low-dimensional task-space, and to resolve redundancy with lower-priority tasks. We illustrate the potential of this approach with an extremely simple motion planning system which solves the swing-up problem for multi-link underactuated pendula, and discuss extensions to the control of walking.",

One way of accomplishing visual homing is by computing the correspondences between features and then analyzing the resulting flow field to determine the correct direction of motion. Typically, some strong assumptions need to be posited in order to compute the home direction from the flow field. For example, it is difficult to locally distinguish translation from rotation, so many authors assume rotation to be computable by other means (e.g. magnetic compass). In this paper we present a novel approach to visual homing using scale change information from Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) which we use to compute landmark correspondences. The method described here is able to determine the direction of the goal in the robotpsilas frame of reference, irrespective of the relative 3D orientation with the goal.",

A local grid map has been used to remove the erroneous range measurements. A novel fuzzy-set-based algorithm has been employed to update evidence in the grid.

But, more importantly its ways of motion and reactions should be like that expected with human. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for solving the human arm inverse kinematics problem (position and orientation). The proposed method eliminates the singular configurations faced in the classical inverse kinematics methods. Our algorithm is based on the choice of a special reference frames in the workspace of the different parts of human arm. The geometrical projection in local frames gives the aimed results. The proposed redundancy resolution criterion for 7ddl human like arm is obtained through an energetic optimization. The proposed algorithm could be used for humanoid robots arm, in upper limb prosthesis application, as well as in computer animations. It gives the solution for the inverse kinematics of the arm. Simulation results within ADAMS software are presented. Our study takes the result of a detailed grasping research which gives an associated object reference frame indicating the way to grasp the object.",

The aim of this study is to display various realistic tactile senses by controlling multiple factors including roughness, softness and friction sense. First, a tactile displaying system was configured for displaying roughness, softness and friction sense simultaneously by compensating the interference among multiple parameters of ultrasonic vibration and force feedback on multiple tactile senses. Second, by conducting several sensory evaluation experiments, the proposed method for displaying softness and friction senses were verified. The relationship between each control parameter and the tactile senses were quantified as well. Then, material discrimination experiment was conducted. As a result, percentage of questions answered correctly was more than 87.5 in all materials. Finally, the tactile senses of real materials and artificial tactile senses were evaluated using adjectives. As a result, the correlation coefficients between real materials and hybrid artificial tactile senses were quite high at the evaluation items on roughness, softness and friction senses.",

        "abstract": "When an emergency occurs within a building, it may be initially safer to send autonomous mobile nodes, instead of human responders, to explore the area and identify hazards and victims. Exploring all the area in the minimum amount of time and reporting back interesting findings to the human personnel outside the building is an essential part of rescue operations. Our assumptions are that the area map is unknown, there is no existing network infrastructure, long-range wireless communication is unreliable and nodes are not location-aware. We take into account these limitations, and propose a novel algorithm, HybridExploration, that makes use of both mobile nodes (robots, called agents) and stationary nodes (inexpensive smart devices, called tags). As agents enter the emergency area, they sprinkle tags within the space to label the environment with states. By reading and updating the state of the local tags, agents are able to coordinate indirectly with each other, without relying on direct agent-to-agent communication. In addition, tags wirelessly exchange local information with nearby tags to further assist agents in their exploration task. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, which exploits both tag-to-tag and agent-to-tag communication, outperforms previous algorithms that rely only on agent-to-tag communication.",

        "abstract": "Due to their rapidity and their high resolution, piezoelectric materials are very prized in microactuators and microrobotics. The classical example is the piezocantilevers. Notwithstanding, piezoecantilevers present nonlinearities (hysteresis and creep) when the applied electric field becomes large. On the other hand, they present lightly damped vibration. Feedback control is a classical issue to eliminate this unwanted behavior but it involves the use of sensors. In micromanipulation and in microassembly, sensors still remain one of the problematic because of their sizes and difficulty of packaging. This paper presents the feedforward compensation of the hysteresis and the vibrations in piezocantilevers. While the Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) static hysteresis model is used to compute the hysteresis compensator, we employ the Input-Shaping method to reject the unwanted vibration. The experiments show that the accuracy can be highly increased while the setling time ameliorated and the vibration largely decreased.",

In order to adapt to a complex atmosphere environment, our model utilizes the IQ parameters as a criterion to search the proper estimation values of the wavelet domain denoising and enhancement model. Firstly, before the wavelet processing, we evaluate the IQ and estimate the expected image gray values from some sub-regions of the original image. Then our algorithm will add some ldquocleanrdquo and ldquoclearrdquo points with those expected gray values in the original image. After that our model will calculate the wavelet based denoising and enhancement model and evaluate the result by the IQ with those added reference points. Finally, if the IQ is not good enough, a feedback will be given and the model parameters will be modified until it gets a better result. Experiment results show our algorithm works well in many outdoor tests and it can be used in a complex atmosphere environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for identifying an object which contains an accelerometer out of many moving objects in the view of a stationary camera using motion data obtained by the camera and the accelerometer. The camera and the accelerometer are assumed to be connected with a network but not synchronized. In order to evaluate the similarity of the motion data despite the unknown time lag between the accelerometer and the camera, NCC (normalized cross-correlation) of the signals is computed and its peak is tracked. Since the coordinate system of the accelerometer is unknown, NCC is computed for the norms of the acceleration vectors, which were compensated for the gravitational acceleration component, obtained by the camera and the accelerometer. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully identified the person wearing the accelerometer out of three walking people. It is also shown that the hand holding the accelerometer was successfully identified out of three moving hands even though the directions of the accelerometer coordinate axes varied temporally due to the free motion of the hand.",

        "abstract": "The current discussion on physical human robot interaction and the related safety aspects, but also the interest of neuro-scientists to validate their hypotheses on human motor skills with bio-mimetic robots, led to a recent revival of tendon-driven robots. In this paper, the modeling of tendon-driven elastic systems with nonlinear couplings is recapitulated. A control law is developed that takes the desired joint position and stiffness as input. Therefore, desired motor positions are determined that are commanded to an impedance controller. We give a physical interpretation of the controller. More importantly, a static decoupling of the joint motion and the stiffness variation is given. The combination of active (controller) and passive (mechanical) stiffness is investigated. The controller stiffness is designed according to the desired overall stiffness. A damping design of the impedance controller is included in these considerations. The controller performance is evaluated in simulation.",

Classical approaches use one estimator (such as a Kalman filter) with a single system model. However the single system model is not good to deal with both of slip and no-slip situations because of the dynamics changes. In this paper, a multiple model approach that uses two Kalman filters is presented: one Kalman filter accounting for no-slip condition and the other for slip condition. The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) is adopted to switch two Kalman filters depending on whether slip occurs or not, and gives the weighted sum of two filter estimates. Experimental results are included to validate our approach.",

To reduce the work-load, we aim to realize a sensor-based autonomous controller of flippers to enable a \u2018semi-autonomous operation\u2019 of tracked vehicles. In this research, two laser range sensors are used for terrain sensing, and gyro sensors are used for the measurement of the robot\u2019s attitude. Based on such sensor system, we propose a strategy of simple sensor-based motion of active flippers for tracked vehicles to enable a semi-autonomous operation. In this paper, we introduce a strategy of motion of active flippers. Finally, we report several experimental results to verify the validity of our approach.",

This kind of environment poses a very difficult situation in this problem, since several of its regions do not provide relevant information to permit the robot to recover its pose. This paper proposes a strategy that distributes particles only in relevant parts of the environment using the information about the environment structure. Afterwards, it leads the robot along these regions using the numeric solution of a BVP involving Laplace equation. In the experiments, we also show that the information about robot motion can be used to improve the convergence rate to the correct robot pose. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the potential of the method.",

        "abstract": "We present a system to increase the performance of feature correspondence based alignment algorithms for laser scan data. Alignment approaches for robot mapping, like ICP or FFS, perform successfully only under the condition of sufficient overlap of features between individual scans. This condition is often not met, for example in sparsely scanned environments or disaster areas for search and rescue robot tasks. Assuming mid level world knowledge (in the presented case, weak presence of noisy, roughly linear or rectangular-like objects) our system augments the sensor data with hypotheses (\u2018Virtual Scans\u2019) about ideal models of these objects. These hypotheses are generated by analyzing the current aligned map estimated by the underlying iterative alignment algorithm. The augmented data is used to improve the alignment process. Feedback between the data alignment and the data analysis confirms, modifies, or discards the Virtual Scans in each iteration. Experiments with a simulated scenario and real world data from a rescue robot scenario show the applicability and advantages of the approach.",

In vivo microscopy is very in demand due to its potential impact on biological research [1]. However, it has turned out that in vivo microscopy is significantly disturbed by the motion of the imaged tissue of a living animal. The proposed system virtually removes the unwanted motion by synchronizing the motion of the objective lens with it. In order to realize this idea, we have developed a simple contact-type sensor for estimating the motion of organs, and also made a motion compensator for moving the objective lens. Sensing and compensating have been accomplished for 3-D translational motion. Not only laboratory tests with artificial motion, but also in vivo experiments show the successful motion canceling effect of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms which the brain uses to control body movements have been important in the both fields of robotics and neuroscience. Recent neuroscience studies have shown that humans can acquire a neural representation of the relation between motor command and movement, i.e., learn an internal model of the environment dynamics. In this paper, we investigate motor adaptation of human arm movements to external dynamics. In an experiment, we tried to determine whether humans can learn an internal model of a mixed force field (V+P) that was the sum of a velocity-dependent force field (V) and a position-dependent force field (P). The experimental results show that the subjects did not learn the internal model of V+P accurately and they compensated for the loads by using impedance control. Our results suggest that humans use impedance control when internal models become inaccurate because of the complexity of the external dynamics.",

In this paper, we propose a vision-based framework that considers this data association problem from a loop-closure detection perspective in order to correctly assign each measurement to its location. Our approach relies on the visual bag of words paradigm to represent the images and on a discrete Bayes filter to compute the probability of loop-closure. We demonstrate the efficiency of our solution by incremental and real-time consistent map building in an indoor environment and under strong perceptual aliasing conditions using a single monocular wide-angle camera.",

        "abstract": "Several kinds of indoor localization systems have been developed for estimating object\u2019s position lately. They are classified according to the environment, the purpose of application, the media type and so on. In this paper, we propose an improved beacon system, having the ultrasonic media type, which can be used for indoor localization. Moreover, it can estimate the direction of a mobile object by using a digital compass. However it is very hard for the indoor localization system using ultrasonic sensors to achieve much highly precise localization for mobile objects since the ultrasonic sensor is highly sensitive to noises and external shocks. In order to overcome this problem, we adopt a bandpass-filter to protect ultrasonic sensors form external shocks or another noisy signals. In addition, the multi-modulation of ultrasonic sensors - using ultrasonic sensors with different frequency - improves the sampling rate of this system. And we present the application of UKF (Unscented kalman Filter) to improve the localization performance of our indoor localization system. Consequently, the positioning accuracy and sampling rate of this system has been increased through bandpass-filter and multi-modulation.",

We propose an approach that does not use motion or odometric information but only a sequence of deterministic measurements observed by traversing an environment. Our algorithm implements a stochastic local search to build a small map which is consistent with local adjacency information extracted from a sequence of observations. Moreover, local adjacency information is incorporated to disambiguate places which are physically different but appear identical to the robots senses. Experiments show that the proposed method is capable of mapping environments with a high degree of perceptual aliasing, and that it infers a small map quickly.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel solution for building three-dimensional dense maps in unknown and unstructured environment with reduced computational costs. This is achieved by giving the robot the \u2018intelligence\u2019 to select, out of the steadily collected data, the maximally informative observations to be used in the estimation of the robot location and its surroundings. We show that, although the actual evaluation of information gain for each frame introduces an additional computational cost, the overall efficiency is significantly increased by keeping the matrix compact. The noticeable advantage of this strategy is that the continuously gathered data is not heuristically segmented prior to be input to the filter. Quite the opposite, the scheme lends itself to be statistically optimal and is capable of handling large data sets collected at realistic sampling rates. The strategy is generic to any 3D feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm in the information form, but in the work presented here it is closely coupled to a proposed novel appearance-based sensory package. It consists of a conventional camera and a range imager, which provide range, bearing and elevation inputs to visual salient features as commonly used by three-dimensional point-based SLAM, but it is also particularly well adapted for lightweight mobile platforms such as those commonly employed for Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), chosen here to demonstrate the excellences of the proposed strategy.",

A collision-free and statically stable path is planned in the first stage and it is transformed into a dynamically stable trajectory in the second stage. Contributions of the method is summarized as follows. (1) A local method plans a C1 path while avoiding collisions between non-strictly convex objects. (2) The second stage gives the minimum time trajectory by time parameterization under dynamic balance constraints. (3) Any path reshaping for recovering collision-freeness is not required since the second stage doesn\u2019t change shape of the path. Effectiveness of the method is examined by applying it to scenarios of a humanoid robot HRP-2.",

Furthermore, based on the permitted trunk twist angle derived from interviews with hospital nurses, systems were evaluated for detecting the intention of rollover, using a neural network to recognize rollover, and using a PARM to restrict trunk range of motion (ROM). Through experimentation, the effectiveness of the intelligent corset was confirmed in ULPT and LLPT rollover movements. However, in 11% of the LLFT rollover trials, the twisting angle was higher than the permitted angle. Additionally, it was found that the intelligent corset solved the problem of the hard corset that patients feel pressure because of the constant restriction. In future, the intelligent corset will be evaluated in the clinical test.",

        "abstract": "Creating robots able to interact and cooperate with humans in household environments and everyday life is an emerging topic. Our goal is to facilitate a human-like and intuitive interaction with such robots. Besides verbal interaction, gestures are a fundamental aspect in human-human interaction. One typical usage of interactive gestures is referencing of objects. This paper describes a novel integrated vision system combining different algorithms for pose tracking, gesture detection, and object attention in order to enable a mobile robot to resolve gesture-based object references. Results from the evaluation of the individual algorithms as well as the overall system are presented. A total of 20 minutes of video data collected from four subjects performing almost 500 gestures are evaluated to demonstrate the current performance of the approach as well as the overall success rate of gestural object references. This demonstrates that our integrated vision system can serve as the gestural front end that enables an interactive mobile robot to engage in multimodal human-robot interaction.",

        "abstract": "To facilitate training of biological cell injection operations, we are developing an interactive virtual environment to simulate needle insertion into biological cells. A key challenge of deformable simulation is to satisfy the conflicting requirements of real-time interactivity and physical realism. This paper presents methodologies for dynamic modeling, visual/haptic display and model validation of cell injection. We first investigate the challenging issues in the modeling of the bio-mechanical properties of living cells. We propose a dynamic model to simulate cell deformation and puncture. The developed approach is based on the assumptions that the mechanical response of living cells is mainly determined by the cytoskeleton and that the cytoskeleton is organised as a tensegrity structure including microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments. Equivalent microtubules struts are represented with a linear mass-tensor finite element model and equivalent microfilaments and intermediate filaments with viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt elements. The virtual environment has been implemented with both graphic and haptic interfaces.",

Specifically tailored for small entertainment robots, the system relies on vision only and learns its navigation capabilities incrementally by interacting with a user. This continuous learning strategy makes the system particularly adaptable to environmental lighting and structure modifications. From the computer vision point of view, the system uses a purely appearance-based image representation called bag of visual words, without any metric information. This representation was adapted to the incremental context of robotics and supplemented by active perception to enhance performances. Empirical validation on real robots and on the publicly available INDECS image database are presented.",

        "abstract": "In multimodal tele-cooperation as considered in this paper two humans in distant locations jointly perform a task requiring multimodal including haptic feedback. One human operator teleoperates a remotely placed humanoid robot which is collocated with the human cooperator. Time delay in the communication channel as destabilizing factor is one of the multiple challenges associated with such a tele-cooperation setup. In this paper we employ a control architecture with force-position exchange accounting for the admittance type of the haptic input device and the telerobot, which both are position-based admittance controlled. Llewellynpsilas stability criteria are employed for the parameter tuning of the virtual impedances in the presence of time delay. The control strategy is successfully validated in an intercontinental tele-cooperation experiment with the humanoid telerobot HRP-2 located in Japan/Tsukuba and a multimodal human-system-interface located in Germany/Munich, see also the corresponding video submission. The proposed setup gives rise to a large number of exciting new research questions to be addressed in the future.",

In this paper, motion trajectory oriented LbD is studied in which free form 3-D motion trajectory is extracted to characterize certain human demonstrations. We propose to build effective description to motion trajectories to be learned by a robot instead of learning the raw trajectory data. A novel signature descriptor is formulated which serves as a generic and invariant description for motion trajectories. More importantly, a trajectory reproduction algorithm based on the learned signature is investigated to enable a robot to repeat/follow the reproduced trajectory instance. Experiments are reported to show the signature description and the reproduction algorithm for further application to the LbD.",

It is also revealed that dynamic grasp and foot stability conditions have structurally the same equations when the palm -in object manipulation- and the ground -in legged locomotion- are horizontal. In this situation, parameters of the equations are very similar. It is demonstrated that the effects of violation of foot stability and dynamic grasp conditions are behaviorally the same.

        "abstract": "Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is one of the most frequently used nonlinear estimators from the view point of estimation accuracy and easy implementation to solve the SLAM problem that is often referred to as Unscented SLAM algorithm. This paper investigates the possibility of reduction of estimation error due to statistical linearization of nonlinear measurement model in Unscented SLAM (USLAM) algorithm. We take advantage of an iteration mechanism in update equations of Unscented SLAM in order to reduce the statistical error propagation existing in this algorithm. In this paper, Simulation results have shown better performance of the Iterated Unscented SLAM (IUSLAM) algorithm. Finally, simulation results are consistently validated by real-world experiments based on collected data from a mobile robot in our laboratory.",

While conventional manipulability is analysis in velocity domain and can not include force effect such as gravitational force, the proposing approach can include the force effect to keep grasping. For the purpose, an operation range is introduced. The operation range is for actuator attached with every joint of robot and provides generable joint torque and velocity and their relation (between generating torque/velocity and addable velocity/torque). Using the operation range, we derive manipulability set and measure in velocity domain, including force effect. The proposing method can evaluate not only the performance in velocity domain but also effects of friction, contact state, and external forces, which were not obtained in conventional studies.",

Two measures, directional dynamic dexterity (DDD) and directional kinematic dexterity (DKD) are defined and applied to predict the human arm posture. It is shown that DDD predicts the postures in which the hand has a high acceleration and DKD predicts the postures in which hand adopts a high velocity. The results are verified by comparing the predicted postures with practical postures required in high acceleration and velocity applications.",

Indeed, the spider shows all of the requisites for the exploration in these non-structured environments: low mass, high motion capabilities, climbing abilities and embedded decision elements. In order to understand how the spiders can walk and climb, the attaching mechanisms, the dynamics of the adhesion and the legspsila movements are evaluated. Thanks to this approach structural and dynamic directives for the model are found and the mobility of the real spider can be studied in order to define a suitable bio-mimetic model.",

We can simultaneously plan both the foot-place and the whole-body motion taking the dynamical balance of the robot into consideration. As a dynamic constraint, we consider the differential equation of the robotpsilas CoG. To solve this constraint, we assume two walking pattern generators; the offline and the online ones. We randomly sample the configuration space to search for the path connecting the start and the goal configurations. When sampling the configuration space, three milestones are sequentially connected to the parent milestone. To show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we show simulation and experimental results where the humanoid robot HRP-2 walks on several environments.",

Such a goal has been the subject of intensive research during the last few years and reflects the desire of the motion planning community to produce paths that are directly relevant to realistic mechanical systems and do not need a huge post-processing step in order to be executed on a robotic platform. To evaluate this approach, a recently developed motion planner is used to compute paths for a modular robot constructed from seven modules. These paths are then executed on hardware and compared with the paths predicted by the planner. For the system considered, the planner prediction and the paths achieved by the physical robot match, up to small errors. This work reveals the potential of modern motion planning research and its implications in the design and operation of complex robotic platforms.",

We determined the characteristics of these skills using an intersection-based description. The knotting process was examined based on the analysis of knots and the characteristics of the robot hand skills. Finally, we show experimental results of an overhand knot and a half hitch performed using a high-speed multifingered hand system.",

The implementation uses a Bayesian model for learning and classification, while the results are presented for the application to analyze expressive movements. In sports like Karate four judges are placed in the corners to observe the fight to ensure that the overall judgment is correct. In this paper we propose a multi-ocular system where each sub-system observes a movement from a different monocular perspective. The sub-systems send continuously guesses in form of probability distributions to the central system. The central system fuses the evidences and presents the final result. We present the Laban Movement Analysis as a concept to identify useful features of human movements to classify human actions. The movements are extracted using both, vision and magnetic tracker. The descriptor opens possibilities towards expressiveness and emotional content. To solve the problem of classification we use the Bayesian framework as it offers an intuitive approach to learning and classification. The presented work targets applications like social robots, smart houses and surveillance.",

Since the side fisheye camera has a wider FOV (Field Of View) than a hemispherical one the whole lane marking at the side may be observed by the fisheye camera and the two vanishing points of straight lane markings may appear in the fisheye image. When a vehicle moves along straight lanes the translation vector of the camera is the same as the direction vector of the straight lanes. In this paper, we first compute the epipoles of a pair of fisheye images by spherical stereo method. Then the epipoles are used as the initial position of the vanishing points of lanes. Finally, the straight lane markings are detected by the estimated position of the vanishing points and the gradient values of edge points of lane markings.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "With imitation robots have a powerful means to drastically cut down the exploration space. However, as existing imitation approaches usually require repetitive demonstrations of the skill to learn in order to be useful, those are typically not applicable in groups of robots. In these scenarios usually each robot has its own task to accomplish and should not be disturbed by teaching others. Therefor, most of the time an imitating robot has only one observed performance of the behavior from which it can learn. Utilisation of these sparse observation data has largely been ignored. We present an approach that allows an individually learning robot to make use of such cases of sporadic imitation which is often the only possibility to learn from other robots in a group. The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that it uses the robots already known skills and strategies to understand the observed behavior. Thereby, a robot can use imitation in order to guide its exploration efforts towards more rewarding areas in the exploration space. This is inspired by imitation often found in nature where animals or humans try to map observations into their own capability space. We show the feasibility by realistic simulation of Pioneer robots.",

        "abstract": "In their interactions with the world robots inevitably face equivalent action choices, situations in which multiple actions are equivalently applicable. In this paper, we address the problem of equivalent action choices in learning from demonstration, a robot learning approach in which a policy is acquired from human demonstrations of the desired behavior. We note that when faced with a choice of equivalent actions, a human teacher often demonstrates an action arbitrarily and does not make the choice consistently over time. The resulting inconsistently labeled training data poses a problem for classification-based demonstration learning algorithms by violating the common assumption that for any world state there exists a single best action. This problem has been overlooked by previous approaches for demonstration learning. In this paper, we present an algorithm that identifies regions of the state space with conflicting demonstrations and enables the choice between multiple actions to be represented explicitly within the robotpsilas policy. An experimental evaluation of the algorithm in a real-world obstacle avoidance domain shows that reasoning about action choices significantly improves the robotpsilas learning performance.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot navigation in unstructured outdoor environments is a challenging area of active research. The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths which allow the robot to progress toward a goal while avoiding obstacles. Machine learning techniques\u2014in particular, classifier ensembles\u2014are well adapted to this task, accomplishing near-to-far learning by augmenting near-field stereo readings in order to identify safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. Composition of the ensemble and subsequent combination of model outputs in this dynamic problem domain remain open questions. Recently, Ensemble Selection has been proposed as a mechanism for selecting and combining models from an existing model library and shown to perform well in static domains. We propose the adaptation of this technique to the time-evolving data associated with the outdoor robot navigation domain. Important research questions as to the composition of the model library, as well as how to combine selected models\u2019 outputs, are addressed in a two-factor experimental evaluation. We evaluate the performance of our technique on six fully labeled datasets, and show that our technique outperforms memoryless baseline techniques that do not leverage past experience.",

The target task is defined as a sequence of interactions between objects. An interaction that appears many times is assumed to be meaningful and repetitious relative motion patterns are detected from trajectories of multiple objects. The main contribution is that the problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem with two parameters, target object labels and correspondences on similar motion patterns, and is solved using local and global Dynamic Programming (DP) in polynomial time O(N logN), where N is a total amount of data. The proposed method is evaluated against manipulation tasks using everyday objects such as a cup and a tea-pot.",

        "abstract": "A long cherished goal in artificial intelligence has been the ability to endow a robot with the capacity to learn and generalize skills from watching a human teacher. Such an ability to learn by imitation has remained hard to achieve due to a number of factors, including the problem of learning in high-dimensional spaces and the problem of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach to the problem of teaching a high degree-of-freedom robot (in particular, a humanoid robot) flexible and generalizable skills via imitation of a human teacher. The robot uses inference in a graphical model to learn sensor-based dynamics and infer a stable plan from a teacherpsilas demonstration of an action. The novel contribution of this work is a method for learning a nonparametric policy which generalizes a fixed action plan to operate over a continuous space of task variation. A notable feature of the approach is that it does not require any knowledge of the physics of the robot or the environment. By leveraging advances in probabilistic inference and Gaussian process regression, the method produces a nonparametric policy for sensor-based feedback control in continuous state and action spaces. We present experimental and simulation results using a Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot demonstrating imitation-based learning of a task involving lifting objects of different weights from a single human demonstration.",

The lower layer realizes a desired small regional motion using the estimated boundary information about mode switches by support vector machine (SVM). Mode transition data are collected off-line for SVM learning. The proposed learning framework is applied to an object moving task with two-DOF manipulator, where the desired configuration of the object is specified so that stick/slip mode switchings are inevitable to accomplish the given task.

However, to date there have been only few extensions which have incorporated perceptual coupling to variables of external focus, and, furthermore, these modifications have relied upon handcrafted solutions. Humans learn how to couple their movement primitives with external variables. Clearly, such a solution is needed in robotics. In this paper, we propose an augmented version of the dynamic systems motor primitives which incorporates perceptual coupling to an external variable. The resulting perceptually driven motor primitives include the previous primitives as a special case and can inherit some of their interesting properties. We show that these motor primitives can perform complex tasks such a Ball-in-a-Cup or Kendama task even with large variances in the initial conditions where a skilled human player would be challenged. For doing so, we initialize the motor primitives in the traditional way by imitation learning without perceptual coupling. Subsequently, we improve the motor primitives using a novel reinforcement learning method which is particularly well-suited for motor primitives.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots require accurate models of their environment in order to plan and execute paths. We present a probabilistic technique based on Gaussian processes that allows terrain models to be learned and updated efficiently using sparse approximation techniques. The major benefit of our terrain model is its ability to predict elevations at unseen locations more reliably than alternative approaches, while it also yields estimates of the uncertainty in the prediction. In particular, our nonstationary Gaussian process model adapts its covariance to the situation at hand, allowing more accurate inference of terrain height at points that have not been observed directly. We show how a conventional motion planner can use the learned terrain model to plan a path to a goal location, using a terrain-specific cost model to accept or reject candidate footholds. In experiments with a real quadruped robot equipped with a laser range finder, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and discuss its benefits compared to simpler terrain models such as elevations grids.",

        "abstract": "As robots become more commonplace within society, the need for tools to enable non-robotics-experts to develop control algorithms, or policies, will increase. Learning from demonstration (LfD) offers one promising approach, where the robot learns a policy from teacher task executions. Our interests lie with robot motion control policies which map world observations to continuous low-level actions. In this work, we introduce advice-operator policy improvement (A-OPI) as a novel approach for improving policies within LfD. Two distinguishing characteristics of the A-OPI algorithm are data source and continuous state-action space. Within LfD, more example data can improve a policy. In A-OPI, new data is synthesized from a student execution and teacher advice. By contrast, typical demonstration approaches provide the learner with exclusively teacher executions. A-OPI is effective within continuous state-action spaces because high level human advice is translated into continuous-valued corrections on the student execution. This work presents a first implementation of the A-OPI algorithm, validated on a Segway RMP robot performing a spatial positioning task. A-OPI is found to improve task performance, both in success and accuracy. Furthermore, performance is shown to be similar or superior to the typical exclusively teacher demonstrations approach.",

In this work, we contribute a demonstration-based approach for teaching a robot task-specific planners involving complex sequential tasks with repetitions. Complexity of tasks results from step repetitions, execution failures and conditionally executing plans. Our demonstration approach uses sound and visually interpretable cues to guide and indicate the various actions and objects to a robot. The robot in turn performs the actions and generalizes its execution into a task-specific planner.

These characteristics indicate the compositepsilas suitability for implementation by small-scale aquatic vessels, such as those that operate within blood-streams to record and transmit biological data or interact with the blood to treat a medical condition. In order to develop such a robot, a suitable control system must be developed that allows for optimization of the IPMC motion to maximise thrust, given constantly changing conditions of the surrounding environment and parameters of the robot itself. This paper seeks to develop such a control system, first by developing a propulsion model for the robot, and then uses Extremum-seeking feedback control to optimise the swimming mode, with the results verified experimentally.",

The extraction of the fundamental frequency and the formants is robust against room echoes and interfering noise.

        "abstract": "High performance and compliant robot control requires accurate dynamics models which cannot be obtained analytically for sufficiently complex robot systems. In such cases, machine learning offers a promising alternative for approximating the robot dynamics using measured data. This approach offers a natural framework to incorporate unknown nonlinearities as well as to continually adapt online for changes in the robot dynamics. However, the most accurate regression methods, e.g. Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), suffer from exceptional high computational complexity which prevents their usage for large numbers of samples or online learning to date. Inspired by locally linear regression techniques, we propose an approximation to the standard GPR using local Gaussian processes models inspired by. Due to reduced computational cost, local Gaussian processes (LGP) can be applied for larger sample-sizes and online learning. Comparisons with other nonparametric regressions, e.g. standard GPR, nu-SVR and locally weighted projection regression (LWPR), show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and nu-SVR while being sufficiently fast for online learning.",

Control of stance movement is difficult because all legs in stance are mechanically coupled. Based on the idea of velocity feedback, recently a specific revision, local positive velocity feedback, has been proposed to solve this problem using an extremely decentralised architecture. In this control scheme the locally measured joint velocity of an elastic joint is fed into the same joint in the next time step to maintain the movement. At the same time an additional part of the same joint controller observes the mechanical joint power to confine the positive feedback. In this paper, we show that this principle can actually be successfully applied to move a complete 6-legged system. This is tested using a dynamic simulation.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing sophistication of sensors such as 3D laser range finders and their use in more complex environments, new approaches for the efficient processing of 2 and 3D point data are becoming more and more important. We develop algorithms for finding and using line segments as primitives for processing such data, and explore the benefits of such a choice. Line segments are simple enough to allow for relatively efficient detection algorithms, but are sophisticated enough to support tracking of dynamic obstacles over time. Further, such a parametric representation of the environment is better suited to deal with the noise inherent in dynamic, real-world environments. We develop a locally-adaptive line-detection algorithm, the output of which is used in a line-segment tracker. The resulting representation is shown to alleviate some of the problems in ray-tracing a dynamic obstacle map.",

        "abstract": "An earthworm moves by peristaltic crawling, which propagates extension and contraction waves along the anteroposterior direction from the anterior to posterior part, by varying the thickness and length of its segments. This locomotion mechanism is in contact with a large area on the ground when the robot moves. Furthermore, the amount of space required is less than that for other locomotion mechanisms. Therefore, this mechanism is suitable for not only rescue robots but also exploration robots in the ground and automatic endoscopic robots. In this study, we developed a peristaltic robot with a flexible feature actuated by servomotors. We proposed different turning patterns. In addition, we confirmed that the robot could move not only on a plane surface but also in a tube. The experiments revealed good performance.",

These cues consist of the detection and tracking of the lumen and of an illumination highlight in capsule endoscopy (CE) images. The proposed approach aims at developing vision algorithms which are robust with respect to the challenging imaging conditions encountered in the GI tract and the great variability of the acquired images. Cases where no or more than one lumens exists, are also detected. The proposed approach extends the state-of-the-art in lumen detection, and is demonstrated for in-vivo video sequences acquired from endoscopic capsules.",

        "abstract": "The paper describes a novel non-contact manipulation system using an on-chip, magnetically driven micro-tool (MMT) rather than conventional biomanipulation by hand, which has a higher risk of contamination and lower success rate and repeatability. MMTs can sort particles individually, and have the unique feature that they can be installed directly in a microchannel (width = 150 mum), unlike conventional cell sorting systems. The drive unit was significantly downsized by amplifying the magnetic power using a permanent magnet. Lower power consumption could also be realized, because no energy is required to keep MMTs stationary at a particular position. Sorting was performed using real-time sensing images of microbeads, where the system successfully sorted beads of different sizes at switching speeds up to 18 Hz. The MMT developed in this study is unique with respect to its flexibility and biocompatibility; in addition, since the PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) microchip is disposable, it can be applied to cell sorting without any risk of contamination. Potential fields of application of this technology include cloning techniques, which require sorting of oocytes with and without nuclei.",

A traversability prediction simulator has recently been developed. The simulator is used to investigate the influence of vehicle design and soil properties on the maneuverability performance of tracked vehicles on soft terrains. Results of the simulations carried out give insight into the behavior of such vehicles with different operating conditions and how they can be controlled.",

The search areas of the joints are automatically generated based on the manipulation knowledge. We present three key techniques to recognize and manipulate the objects incorporating rotational and linear joints. 1) Knowledge Description for Manipulation and Recognition of these objects 2) Motion Planning Method to Manipulate them 3) Recognition Method of them Closely Related to the Manipulation Knowledge.

Therefore, we have developed a new type of finger-shaped haptic sensor that can measure a three-dimensional force vector field over a contact surface. The sensor consists of a transparent elastic body, two layers of internal blue and red markers, and a CCD camera to capture the movements of the markers. Using the elastic theory, we can calculate the force vector field from the captured movements of the markers. However, the elastic theory cannot be applied to the finger-shaped sensor because of its complicated shape. Therefore, we use actual measurements for the calibration in order to develop a prototype of the sensor. Then, we evaluate its basic performance. The result shows that the sensor performance can be improved further, and the sensor can be successfully used in a robotic hand.",

Underactuated fingers and differential mechanisms have been used in order to fit all the functional components (actuators, sensors and electronics) in the size of a human hand. Moreover innovative non-back-drivable mechanisms have been designed in order to overcome some of the actual drawbacks of the mechanisms commonly used in prosthetic hands. The new hand is provided with a comprehensive sensory system embedded in the structure of the fingers composed of 40 proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. The large employment of sensors, combined with an actuation architecture that allows for grasping and gestures, will permit this hand to be used in clinical experimentation in the near future.",

The algorithm exploits the well known Hough transform in a novel way in order to produce a set of ranked roto-translations aimed to overlap the partial maps provided as input. In this paper, after having briefly summarized such method, we investigate the impact on the performance of different variations of the Hough transform. In particular, we are interested in determining the repercussions in terms of accuracy and computational time when only a subset of points is used to compute the transformation. Results are analyzed while merging maps produced by two robots exploring an indoor environment, and also using public available data sets. It turns out that the proposed method is robust and positively influenced by the use of more refined approaches to compute the Hough transform.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Over the past few decades, various haptic gloves have been developed for use in virtual environments. The actuating systems for most existing haptic gloves require lots of external auxiliary equipment. Because of this, the motion of the user is restricted by the length of the electric wires or pneumatic tubes attached to this equipment. A compact actuation system, including related equipment, is thus indispensable for a wearable haptic glove to be truly effective. To resolve the problem of hampered motion and reach, a micro hydraulic actuating system was developed in this research. It was composed of a slim, flexible artificial muscle, a compact hydraulic module for actuating the muscle, and a micro pressure sensor for measuring without flux loss. The characteristics of the muscle were investigated for their control capacity. The step and sinusoidal responses were analyzed to evaluate the performance of the micro hydraulic system. Once these analyses were completed, a lightweight and compact actuation system was built incorporating a wearable haptic glove. By virtue of the developed micro hydraulic system, the wearable haptic glove was able to operate independently of any external equipment, and movement was completely free of any restrictions from wires or tubes.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present preliminary results on the use of a torque sensor based on a Bragg grating for torque control applications of tendon-driven mechanisms. Owing to the minimally invasive nature of optical fibres, one of the most promising applications can be the integration of the sensor into anthropomorphic robotic hands for accurate impedance or compliance control. In fact, the sensing element of the proposed torque sensor can be easily bonded directly to the tendon following its natural routing with a significantly reduced invasiveness with respect to conventional sensors. These are usually based on strain gauges, which are cumbersome and require additional mechanical components and interfaces in order to provide the necessary measurement, while the Bragg sensor is embedded into the optical fibre whose typical diameter is about 125 mum which allows its integration into the tendon itself. The experimental results presented here have been obtained on a simple test-bench realized by using off-the-shelf and cheap components conceived to demonstrate the potentiality of the sensor and its effectiveness in an actual compliance control scheme.",

In general, it is recognized that mixed-load transportation can decrease the moving time to some extent. However, many scheduling methods without regard to mixed-load transportation have recently been proposed. In this respect, we propose a design for scheduling problems with mixed-load transportation handled by vehicles. The proposed method uses two well-known dispatching rules and a local search method based on a simulated annealing algorithm. Two rules are applied to obtain the initial solution while ignoring the mixed-load transportation, and the local search method is applied to improve the initial solution to obtain a semi-optimal solution in consideration of mixed-load transportation. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed system, we implemented our system with several product transportation environment. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A biologically inspired azimuthal broadband sound localisation system is introduced to simulates the functional organisation of the human auditory midbrain up to the inferior colliculus (IC). Supported by recent neurophysiological studies on the role of the IC and superior olivary complex (SOC) in sound processing, our system models two ascending pathways of the auditory midbrain: the ITD (Interaural Time Difference) pathway and ILD (Interaural Level Difference) pathway. In our approach to modelling the ITD pathway, we take account of Yinpsilas finding that only a single delay line exists in the ITD processing from cochlea to SOC for the ipsilateral ear while multiple delay lines exists for the contralateral ear. The ILD pathway is modelled without varied delay lines because of neurophysiological evidence that indicates the delays along that pathway are minimal and constant. First, two-dimensional (2D) tonotopical ITD and ILD spike maps over frequency and ITD/ILD are calculated by a spiking neural network which follows the biological delay structure. Then these maps are weighted considering the advance of ITD in low frequency and ILD in middle and high frequency. Finally, ITD and ILD maps are merged together to find out the best estimation of the sound source. Experimental results involving noise and voice show that our model performs sound localisation that approaches biological performance. Our approach brings not only new insight into the brain mechanism of the auditory system, but also demonstrates a practical application of sound localisation for mobile robots.",

A path tracking controller based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework is presented that explicitly considers terrain geometry and actuator limitations. The controller performance is studied with three vehicle dynamic models in a high-fidelity ADAMS simulation. The effect of model order on path tracking performance on flat terrain and sloped terrain is evaluated. It is shown that improved performance can be obtained by explicitly considering terrain effects.",

The method we present extends the robot localization methods based on occupancy grids, however here occupancy grids are used to represent not only the geometry of the environment but also that of the robot. For tracking the robot we employ a particle filter. The details of the method are given and experimental results are shown to illustrate the method.",

Latency in communication lines limits the transmission of vivid tactile sensations and drives the system unstable. In this paper, we propose a new model-based approach for the bilateral control of a telesurgical robot using time-domain passivity control. This method consists of a virtual slave model implemented at the master side to estimate the force on the slave side. During the operation, the estimated force from the virtual slave is added to the actual measured force transmitted from the slave in order to maintain the passivity of the system. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the performance of this new controller.",

        "abstract": "Needle insertion treatments require accurate placement of the needle tip into the target cancer. However, it is difficult to insert the needle into the cancer because of cancer displacement due to the organ deformation. Then, a path planning using numerical simulation to analyze the deformation of the organ and the timing of puncture is important for the accurate needle insertion. In this study, we have explained the modeling of conditions where the puncture occurs. Firstly, this paper shows needle insertion experiments for the hog liver in order to measure the needle force and displacement where the puncture occurs. According to the experimental results, significant variations in puncture force were observed. Accordingly, we proposed a novel condition of the force causing a puncture considering probability distribution. We summarized variations of the puncture force in the experimental data and represented conditions where a puncture occurs with probability distribution models where the force is random variable. In addition, the boundary conditions and liver shapes are considered by analyzing the stress status near the needle. Then, we derived the conditions of the puncture with probability distribution models where the stress is random variable.",

        "abstract": "For a person to feel comfortable when approaching a robot it is necessary for the robot to behave in an expected way. People\u2019s behavior around a robot not being aware of them were observed during a preliminary experiment. Based on those observations people were classified into four groups depending on their interest in the robot. People were tracked with a laser range finder based system, and their positions, directions and velocities were estimated. A second classification based on that information was made and the relation between the two classifications were mapped. Different actions were created for the robot to be able to react naturally to different human behaviors. In this paper we evaluate three different robot behaviors with respect to how natural they appear. One behavior that actively tries to engage people, one that passively indicates that people have been noticed and a third that makes random gestures. During an experiment test subjects were instructed to act according to the groups from the classification based on interest, and the robot\u2019s performance with regard to naturalness was evaluated. Both first and third person evaluation made clear that the active and passive behavior were considered equally natural, while a robot randomly making gestures was considered much less natural.",

Having 3-DoF actuator improves the complexity of coordination patterns and control algorithms of the modular system more relevantly as compared to having only 1 or 2DoF actuator in the module. Nevertheless, modules with actuators of only 1 or 2DoF require more modules to be assembled together in order to achieve complex tasks. Experiments performed with RobMAT modular system proves that a 3DoF actuator in the module is better, because tasks such as displacement, obstacle climbing and object manipulation, can be efficiently carried out with systems of 2 modules, 4 modules and 6 (maximum) modules connected together.",

To travel freely in every pipeline element, the robot adopts a differential driving mechanism that we have developed. Furthermore, by introducing clutches in transmitting driving power to the wheels, MRINSPECT V is able to select the suitable driving method according to the shape of the pipeline and save the energy to drive in pipelines. The robot aiming for autonomous navigation is configured with four modules serially connected. Two active driving modules are located in front and rear of the system, respectively. Passive modules are linked between the driving modules. This module-based robot can fit to narrow and winding pipelines by using the novel mechanism such as the specially designed module-joints. In this paper, the critical points in the design and construction of the proposed robot are described with the preliminary results of experiments that yield good mobility and increased efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We present a system for monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (mono-SLAM) relying solely on video input. Our algorithm makes it possible to precisely estimate the camera trajectory without relying on any motion model. The estimation is completely incremental: at a given time frame, only the current location is estimated while the previous camera positions are never modified. In particular, we do not perform any simultaneous iterative optimization of the camera positions and estimated 3D structure (local bundle adjustment). The key aspect of the system is a fast and simple pose estimation algorithm that uses information not only from the estimated 3D map, but also from the epipolar constraint. We show that the latter leads to a much more stable estimation of the camera trajectory than the conventional approach. We perform high precision camera trajectory estimation in urban scenes with a large amount of clutter. Using an omnidirectional camera placed on a vehicle, we cover one of the longest distance ever reported, up to 2.5 kilometers.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a modular robot design inspired by the creation of complex structures and functions in biology via deformation. Our design is based on the Tensegrity model of cellular structure, where active filaments within the cell contract and expand to control individual cell shape, and sheets of such cells undergo large-scale shape change through the cooperative action of connected cells. Such deformations play a role in many processes, e.g. early embryo shape change and lamprey locomotion. Modular robotic systems that replicate the basic deformable multicellular structure have the potential to quickly generate large-scale shape change and create dynamic shapes to achieve different global functions. Based on this principle, our design includes four different modular components: (1) active links, (2) passive links, (3) surface membranes, and (4) interfacing cubes. In hardware implementation, we show several self-deformable structures that can be generated from these components, including a self-deformable surface, expandable cube, terrain-adaptive bridge [1]. We present experiments to demonstrate that such robotic structures are able to perform real time deformation to adapt to different environments. In simulation, we show that these components can be configured into a variety of bio-inspired robots, such as an amoeba-like robot and a tissue-inspired material. We argue that self-deformation is well-suited for dynamic and sensing-adaptive shape change in modular robotics.",

In this paper, a path planning algorithm based on the slice projection technique, optimized particularly for car-parking is proposed. Collision-free region of a nonholonomic motion can be easily computed by using the slice projection technique. Sufficient collision-free, nonholonomic feasible paths can be directly obtained by computing reachable regions by using the slice projection technique for nonholonomic motions from the initial pose. The proposed planning scheme provide not a single solution, but a candidate solution set. Therefore, the parking path can be easily optimized with respect to performance criteria such as safety, maneuvering, and so on. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed scheme provides various practical solutions.",

To the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are very few tumbling robots in existence and no formalized methods for their control. In this paper we begin addressing these issues by presenting an approach for deriving motion primitives for tumbling robots. We apply our method to the specific case of a two-armed tumbling robot and include the final derived motion primitives. Additionally we discuss in general the motion of tumbling robots and introduce 3 useful gaits derived from the resulting primitives of our approach.",

The action selection of the robot is carried out based on a selection probability determined by several internal variables that draws upon the motivation mechanism of human beings. This makes the robot classify its action space by a sensory feedback caused by its own action. The system prioritizes actions that are expected to cause distinguishing sensory patterns. The action selection probability allows the robot to explore unknown spaces for understanding the dynamics of objects in a real environment. In our experiment, we demonstrate the performance of object clustering by multi-modal active sensing using the proposed action selection rule. Furthermore, we show that the system allows the robot to build knowledge about common object movements by repeating interactions with several different types of objects, and also to predict the movement of unknown objects.",

A key factor for human like interaction is the usage of non-verbal communication. Therefore robots must be able to have some kind of emotions. These emotions mainly depends on the achievement of the goals of the interaction. Psychologists point out that motives generate these kind of goals to humans. Because of this, this paper presents a motive model for the emotion-based architecture of the humanoid robot ROMAN. For the implementation of these motives a behavior-based approach is used. Furthermore some experiments concerning the functionality of the motives of interaction are presented and discussed.",

To realize localization using multiple modal exteroceptive sensors needs consistent environment maps (landmark maps). Multiple sensor SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is one of solutions to build maps consistently. In implementation of SLAM, approximations of sensor model contribute to get speeded up the algorithm. However in several case, these approximations deteriorate quality of the map. This paper proposes fast and accurate map building algorithm using multiple modal sensors based on sparse linear equations solver. This algorithm needs less approximations-but computation speed is fast. In addition, application of measured data from multiple sensors to this algorithm is described.",

The proposed method assumes that mobile robots use occupancy grid maps as the main representation model for the built maps and a hill climbing local search algorithm for exploring the environment without any kind of human intervention. It is demonstrated that hill climbing based exploration may recover from local minima and cover completely any environment, if a topological representation of the environment is created incrementally along the mapping and exploration mission. The approach is devised for either a single mobile robot or multiple cooperative mobile robots.",

        "abstract": "Distributed monitoring applications require wireless sensors that are efficiently deployed using robots. This paper proposes to deploy sensor nodes in order to estimate the time-varying spread of wildfires. We propose a distributed multi-scale adaptive sampling strategy based on neural networks, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and greedy heuristics, named \u201cEKF-NN-GAS\u201d. This strategy combines measurements arriving at different times from sensors at different scale lengths, such as ground, air-borne or space-borne observation platforms. We use the EKF covariance matrix to derive quantitative information measures for sampling locations most likely to yield optimal information about the sampled field distribution. Furthermore, we reconstruct the spatio-temporal forest fire spread, based on parameterized Radial Basis Functions (RBF) neural networks. To replicate the complexity involved in actual fire-spread we simulate it using discrete event cellular automata acting as our \u201ctruth model\u201d. Finally, we present experimental results with ground vehicles that navigate over a \u201cvirtual fire\u201d projected on the lab floor from a ceiling-mounted projector to emulate a sampling mission performed by aerial robots.",

MMU1 is an adaptive mobile mechanism that changes its working mode autonomously and gets over the obstacle without any extra motor\u2019s help, in the case that the pipe diameter changes. MMU2 is a mechanism that has both driving ability and detecting function; MMU3 is equipped with assemblies that integrate the wheel and propeller function together, thus, MMU3 is able to propel both in dry pipe and watery pipe. These MMUs are all constructed from a same platform, which makes little increase of the cost but realizes of more kinds of robots. Several basic experiments have been conducted to confirm the effectiveness and mobility of the MMUs.",

Laser data points are clustered and classified with a set of geometrical features using an SVM AdaBoost method. The clusters define a region of interest in the image that is adjusted using the ground plane information extracted from the 3D laser. In this areas a novel vision based people detector based on Implicit Shape Model (ISM) is applied. Each detected person is tracked using a greedy data association technique and multiple Extended Kalman Filters that use different motion models. This way, the filter can cope with a variety of different motion patterns. The tracker is asynchronously updated by the detections from the laser and the camera data. Experiments conducted in real-world outdoor scenarios with crowds of pedestrians demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study sensor fusion for the attitude estimation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), in particular mechanical flying insects. First, following a geometric approach, a dynamic observer is proposed which estimates attitude based on kinematic data available from different and redundant bio-inspired sensors such as halteres, ocelli, gravitometers, magnetic compass and light polarization compass. In particular, the traditional structure of complementary filters, suitable for multiple sensor fusion, is specialized to the Lie group of rigid body rotations SO(3). Then, a numerical implementation of the filter is provided for the specific case of inertial/magnetic navigation, i.e. when gravitometers, magnetometer and gyroscopes are available. Finally, the filter performance is experimentally tested via a 3 degrees-of-freedom robotic flapper and a custom-made set of inertial/magnetic sensors. Experimental results show good agreement, upon proper tuning of the filter, between the actual kinematics of the robotic flapper and the kinematics reconstructed from the inertial/magnetic sensors via the proposed filter.",

The hand has an independent palm and five identical modular fingers, each finger has three DOFs and four joints. All the actuators and electronics are integrated in the finger body and the palm. By using powerful super flat brushless DC motors, tiny harmonic drivers and BGA form DSPs and FPGAs, the whole fingerpsilas size is about one third smaller than the former finger in the DLR/HIT Hand I. By using the steel coupling mechanism, the phalanx distalpsilas transmission ratio is exact 1:1 in the whole movement range. At the same time, the multisensory dexterous hand integrates position, force/torque and temperature sensors. The hierarchical hardware structure of the hand consists of the finger DSPs, the finger FPGAs, the palm FPGA and the PCI based DSP/FPGA board. The hand can communicate with external with PPSeCo, CAN and Internet. Instead of extra cover, the packing mechanism of the hand is implemented directly in the finger body and palm to make the hand smaller and more human like. The whole weight of the hand is about 1.5Kg and the fingertip force can reach 10N.",

        "abstract": "Nonverbal behavior plays an important role in human communication. In this paper, we propose a novel museum guide robot that has three different types of communication modes (autonomous, remote-control, and remote-interactive), which are integrated to interact with visitors through nonverbal behavior. First, the autonomous mode is an autonomously controlled mode in which the robot can directly interact with visitors through nonverbal behaviors such as head movements or arm gestures. Second, when a visitor begins to ask the robot questions, the communication is changed into a remote-control mode. In this mode, a remote operator controls the robot with gestures to interact with visitors. Third, in the remote-interactive mode, a remote operator can also interact with the robot with voice and gestures through a network. In particular, the remote operator can ask the robot to do something with nonverbal behaviors such as pointing while saying, \u201cBring this brochure to him.\u201d These three communication modes are switched seamlessly depending on the situation.",

This paper presents a method for a robot to understand unfamiliar behavior shown by others through the collaboration between behavior acquisition and recognition of observed behavior, where the state value has an important role not simply for behavior acquisition (reinforcement learning) but also for behavior recognition (observation). That is, the state value updates can be accelerated by observation without real trial and error while the learned values enrich the recognition system since it is based on estimation of the state value of the observed behavior. The validity of the proposed method is shown by applying it to a dynamic environment where two robots play soccer.",

It is built on pattern recognition-based myoelectric control that discriminates muscular activities using forearmpsilas surface myoelectric signals. The core of the system is a support vector machine based classifier that classifies signal time domain features. Online training scheme is applied to cope with gradual changes in myoelectric signal patterns. Two indexes, contineousness and entropy, were used to update training data set in real time operation. The results confirm that the proposed myoelectric-based joystick is a reliable alternative for traditional joysticks and its performance is fairly acceptable.",

As an example, force sensors based on the interlayer electromechanical coupling of individual multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) are designed with various configurations. The devices are fabricated and characterized using nanorobotic manipulation inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Experimental results verify that the resistance of MWNTs is highly sensitive to applied mechanical load. A further performance analysis also indicates that a force sensor configuration in which two electrodes connect to the inner and outermost shells, respectively, provides the highest sensitivity and resolution (\u223c1nN) in the presence of lateral forces.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for near-optimal navigation of high speed mobile robots on uneven terrain. The method relies on a layered control strategy. A high-level planning layer generates an optimal desired trajectory through uneven terrain. A low-level navigation layer guides a robot along the desired trajectory via a potential field-based control algorithm. The high-level planner is guaranteed to yield optimal trajectories but is computationally intensive. The low-level navigation layer is sub-optimal but computationally efficient. To guard against failures at the navigation layer, a model-based lookahead approach is employed that utilizes a reduced form of the optimal trajectory generation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully navigate a mobile robot over uneven terrain while avoiding hazards. A comparison of the method\u2019s performance to a similar algorithm is also presented.",

        "abstract": "Human control of high degree-of-freedom robotic systems, e.g. anthropomorphic robot hands, is often difficult due to the overwhelming number of variables that need to be specified. Previous work has addressed this sparse control problem by learning a high-dimensional manifold of robot poses to provide low-dimensional control subspaces. Such subspaces allow cursor control, or eventually decoding of neural activity, to drive a robotic hand. Considering previously identified problems related to noise in manifold learning, we introduce a method for denoising neighborhood graphs in order to embed hand motion into 2D spaces. We present results demonstrating our approach in the case of a synthetic swissroll as well as in the embeddings for interactive sparse control for several grasping tasks.",

This net uses the zero moment point (ZMP) position and its variation as inputs, and the sagittal correction of the robotpsilas body is obtained as the output. The ZMP is obtained be acquiring use of the force distribution on four force sensors placed under each robotpsilas foot. The gait implemented on our biped is similar to a human gait. A human gait was acquired and adapted to the robot size. Some experiments were carried out and the results show that the used gait combined with the TSK neuro fuzzy net is appropriate to be used in the control of a biped robot, with and without an applied external force.",

The mechanical design of an existing system is improved to increase mechanical robustness and steering quality. In parallel, a simulation model is developed and implemented.

The temperature gradient created by laser absorption generates natural and thermocapillary (or Marangoni) convection flows. These flows are used to perform the manipulation itself. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that large and heavy particles can be dragged using the Marangoni convection flows. Experiments based on these phenomena show that fast and accurate underwater micromanipulation of particles up to 280 mum is possible using only a convergent 1480 nm laser beam.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new mechanism for artificial fingers. It enables adduction/abduction of the MP joint in addition to the synergetic flexion/extension of the DIP, PIP and MP joints. The key mechanism is the newly invented double planetary gear system (DPGS) that allows three DOF motions of the finger in a compact placement of all actuators in a palm. The DPGS receives three input torques; two are active torques coming from DC-motors, which drives solar gears, the other one is a passive torque loaded at the carrier of the planetary gears generated by a spring. This active / passive hybrid actuation enables to grip unknown shape objects with no sensory feedback. This paper describes the kinematics and the kinetics of the newly developed mechanism followed by the kinetics of pinching the object by two-fingers. It also shows the results of a couple of experiments. Additionally, we show a new mechanical design aiming for constructing a multi-fingered hand.",

The paper sheds light on a number of real world issues involved with the design of visual attention system for physically embodied robots and explains how the proposed Bayesian model of visual attention addresses these issues.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a new point cloud registration strategy for 3D surface inspection, named object-oriented method. Traditionally, the registration methods use a fitting based algorithm, which is a recursive process and too time consuming to do quality inspection. Moreover, the fitting based algorithms require that the measured data and the CAD model have same shapes. Photogrammetry and ICP-based fitting algorithms are commonly used in this area. However, both of them cannot be applied directly to online point cloud registration for quality inspection. Since it requires: 1.) no markers on the object surface; 2.) a very limited inspection period of time for each part on an assembly line; and 3.) the measured work piece can not be assumed as same as the CAD model. The online registration is currently demanded by 3D surface inspection in automotive glasses manufacturing industry. The object-oriented registration method is developed based on matching the invariant geometric features between two data sets instead of the artificial markers and the recursive fitting algorithms. Therefore the registration speed is much higher. A datum filter is developed to extract the invariant features from the measured point cloud, based on the information that the CAD model carries. The curvature information and moment values are used as characteristic features to design the filter. The registration matrix is calculated by the invariance parts in both data sets. The new online registration method has been applied to the quality inspection in the windshield manufacturing industry. Experimental results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy.",

We compute paths using a probabilistic roadmap to avoid collisions between the robot and obstacles, while penalizing trajectories that do not maintain line-of-sight. The system determines the space from which line-of-sight is unimpeded to the target (the visible region). We assign penalties to trajectories within the roadmap proportional to the distance the camera travels while outside the visible region. Using Dijkstrapsilas algorithm, we compute paths of minimal occlusion (maximal visibility) through the roadmap. In our experiments, we compare a shortest-distance path to the minimal-occlusion path and discuss the impact of the improved visibility.",

        "abstract": "A ballistic walking gait is designed for a planar biped with two identical two-link legs, a trunk and two one-link arms. This seven-link biped is controlled via impulsive torques at the instantaneous double support to obtain a cyclic gait. These impulsive torques are applied in six inter-link joints. Then infinity of solutions exists to find the impulsive torques. An energy cost functional of these impulsive torques is calculated to choose a unique solution by its minimization. Numerical results show that for a given time period of the walking gait step and a length of the step, there exists an optimal swinging amplitude of arms. For this optimal motion of the arms, mentioned above cost functional is minimum.",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with modeling of human-like reaching movements using optimal control theory. Typically, in the construction of optimization models, capturing the invariant features of human movements, the main emphasis is placed on the form of the optimality criterion. However, the boundary conditions are also an important part of the optimization problem. Considering reaching movements in the manipulation of flexible objects, we first show that the conventional imposition of the boundary conditions does not always produce a good match to the experimental data featuring the acceleration jumps in highly dynamic tasks. To explain the acceleration jumps, we reformulate the problem, using the concept of natural boundary conditions, and show that it improves the prediction of the experimental data. Finally, it is suggested how not only the acceleration but all the boundary conditions can placed in a natural way.",

Additionally to complicated forward kinematics, having a wide workspace makes it difficult to directly measure the pose of the end-effector. The goal of the controller is trajectory tracking in a large and singular free workspace, and to guarantee that the cables are always under tension. A control topology is proposed in this paper which is capable to fulfill the stringent positioning requirements for these type of manipulators. Closed-loop performance of various control topologies are compared by simulation of the closed-loop dynamics of the KNTU CDRPM, while the equations of parallel manipulator dynamics are implicit in structure and only special integration routines can be used for their integration. It is shown that the proposed joint space controller is capable to satisfy the required tracking performance, despite the inherent limitation of task space pose measurement.",

In order to obtain precise and complicated three dimensional patterns of magnetically driven 3D microtools, a grayscale photolithography technique has been applied by making good use of thick nega-photoresist as sacrificed mold. By controlling an amount of ultraviolet light with a gradation of gray tone mask, we have fabricated smoothly curved (100 mum gap) object without steps which tend to be appeared in case of conventional layer by layer photolithography techniques. A wide range of on-chip application of microactuators can be proposed by using a softness of polymer-based 3D MMT. For example, microrotor was operated as miromixer and micropump, also microloader was actuated by the magnetic and fluidic force. The surface of the 3D MMT was fabricated with a group of spiked pattern to reduce the contact area between PDMS (poly dimethyl siloxane) microchannel and PDMS-based 3D MMT. The produced 3D MMT can be applied to complicated on-chip manipulations of sensitive materials such as cells.",

These applications require sufficiently accurate, robust, and fast estimation of the inertial parameters. Existing approaches, however, do not allow for robust on-line estimation, since they use standard batch least-squares techniques, which ignore noise in the data matrix. The proposed approach, however, estimates the inertial parameters on-line and very fast (approx. 1.5s), while explicitly considering noise in the data matrix by a total least-squares approach. Apart from estimation equations and estimation approaches, the design of estimation trajectories is addressed in this paper. The performance of the proposed estimation approach is compared with the recursive ordinary least-squares (RLS) and the recursive instrumental variables (RIV) method. Experimental results clearly recommend the proposed recursive total least-squares approach (RTLS).",

The Linear Inverted Pendulum dynamic model and the Zero Moment Point concept are employed to solve the walking problem. We consider walk planning as the choice of a sequence of ZMPs leading to a stable walk that satisfies all the dynamic and mechanical constraints of the robot. We contribute a novel online sampling algorithm to efficiently search for such ZMP sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by successful combined walking tasks in a faithful simulation of a full-body humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Transferring motion from a human demonstrator to a humanoid robot is an important step toward developing robots that are easily programmable and that can replicate or learn from observed human motion. The so called motion retargeting problem has been well studied and several off-line solutions exist based on optimization approaches that rely on pre-recorded human motion data collected from a marker-based motion capture system. From the perspective of human robot interaction, there is a growing interest in online and marker-less motion transfer. Such requirements have placed stringent demands on retargeting algorithms and limited the potential use of off-line and pre-recorded methods. To address these limitations, we present an online task space control theoretic retargeting formulation to generate robot joint motions that adhere to the robot\u2019s joint limit constraints, self-collision constraints, and balance constraints. The inputs to the proposed method include low dimensional normalized human motion descriptors, detected and tracked using a vision based feature detection and tracking algorithm. The proposed vision algorithm does not rely on markers placed on anatomical landmarks, nor does it require special instrumentation or calibration. The current implementation requires a depth image sequence, which is collected from a single time of flight imaging device. We present online experimental results of the entire pipeline on the Honda humanoid robot - ASIMO.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental validation of an online estimation algorithm we recently investigated theoretically. One of the peculiar characteristics of the approach we propose is the ability to perform an online estimation of the variance parameters that regulate the dynamics of the nonlinear dynamical model used. The approach exploits and extends classical iterated Kalman filtering equations by propagating an approximation of the marginal posterior of the unknown variances over time. The method has been previously used to model and solve a localization task for multiple robots equipped only with a sensor returning mutual distances. In this paper we present a first experimental validation of the algorithm that complements and confirms our initial promising theoretical findings. Our current implementation relies on a sensor returning distance estimates based on a simple image processing algorithm. Such sensor is inherently and intentionally noisy, and in this study we show that our technique is capable of appropriately estimating the variance describing the noise affecting this sensor. We conclude proving experimentally that the procedure we present ensures a performance comparable to similar algorithms that require significantly more a priori information.",

        "abstract": "Many elderly and disabled people experience difficulties when maneuvering an electric wheelchair. In order to make wheelchair driving a safer and more comfortable experience, there has long been the claim to equip wheelchairs with some form of intelligent controller assisting in difficult or unsafe situations. It has been observed that every user presents different symptoms causing a specific driving pattern. Therefore, if the user is to be helped and not frustrated, his/her particular driving behavior should be taken into account when assisting him/her. In this paper we present a general user modeling technique for our Bayesian framework for plan recognition and shared wheelchair control. Plan recognition corresponds to estimating the plan a user has in mind. Assistive actions can then be taken based on the estimated user plan. A user modeling technique based on Gaussian processes has been selected, which can be adapted online to any type of driving style. The potential of Gaussian processes for user modeling is illustrated on a case study with a disabled patient suffering from spastic quadriplegia.",

In this paper we focus on modularity and re-usability, as major features for robotic applications. We thus characterize existing frameworks for robot software development through the choices made on concurrent execution of modules and information sharing among them and we present OpenRDK, a modular framework focused on rapid development of distributed robotic systems. OpenRDK has been designed and developed with many years of experience following userspsila advice and has been successfully used for the development of many diverse applications with different kinds of robots.

An optical flow-based visual sensor looking down the terrain surface is employed to recover the motion of the vehicle by tracking features selected from the terrain surface. The special orientation of the on-board camera is to assure high accuracy of the motion estimation. To cope with the noise and uncertainty from the visual sensor, a sliding mode observer (SMO) based on the kinematic model of the skid-steered vehicle is delicately designed to simultaneously estimate the slips and velocities. The complete non-GPS slip and velocity estimation technique is independent of terrain parameters and robust to noise and uncertainty. The SMO scheme can produce more accurate estimates than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the nonlinear case. Experimental results are given to show that the technique has good potential for vehicle slip and velocity estimation.",

We propose an approach based on a nonlinear optimization formulation that may encounter physiological and technological constraints. The study considers a biomechanical knee model and the associated agonist/antagonist muscles. The goal of this method is to synthesize optimal patterns which minimize the muscular activities and/or tracking trajectory errors in order to reduce the muscular fatigue while achieving a desired movement. Different tests have been performed and the results compared with regard to the energetic balance. The approach is illustrated in simulation with: 1) sinusoidal desired knee joint trajectory, 2) optimal reference knee joint trajectory and 3) without explicit reference knee joint trajectory. The simulations have been performed with model parameters estimated from real subject data. We show that the trajectory tracking presents high energy consumption which demonstrates the inappropriateness of classical robotics methods for musculoskeletal system. Instead, minimization of muscle activation only gives better results with regard to energy consumption, still with a reasonnable trajectory tracking error.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a correct solution to the optimal visual feedback control for a nonholonomic vehicle with limited field-of-view. Previous work on this subject has shown that the search for a shortest path can be limited to simple families of trajectories. We preliminarily provide an extension of the alphabet of optimal control words, to cover some regions of the vehicle plane where the synthesis of turns out to be suboptimal. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm to translate the optimal synthesis to the image plane, thus enabling a purely image-based optimal control scheme. This allows better performance and increases the robustness of the overall process, avoiding the need of slowly-converging and error-prone parameter estimation algorithms. Simulations and experiments are reported which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",

In this study, a numerical procedure to obtain solution of the optimal guidance law in undersea area of sea current disturbances is presented. Simulated optimal and quasi-optimal navigations by minimum time guidance are realized based on the dynamics of an AUV ldquor2D4rdquo. The r2D4 is a deep ocean exploring AUV developed by Institute of Industrial Science, the University of Tokyo. The developed algorithm never fails to derive the optimal headings for minimum time navigation, if only the distribution of current velocity in navigation region is deterministic.",

However, to take full advantage of the flexibility and speed offered by a group of UGV platforms, a fast way to compute desired camera locations that cover or surround a set of buildings e.g., in response to an alarm, is needed. In this paper we focus on two problems. The first is how to create a line-of-sight perimeter around a given set of buildings with a minimal number of UGVs. The second problem is how to find UGV positions such that a given set of walls are covered by the cameras while taking constraints in terms of zoom, range, resolution and field of view into account. For the first problem we propose a polynomial time algorithm and for the second problem we extend our previous work to include zoom cameras and furthermore provide a theoretical analysis of the approach itself. A number of examples are presented to illustrate the two algorithms.",

This phase where the biped becomes underactuated is not present during the walk of humanoid robots. The objective of this study is to determine if the introduction of this phase for a 3D biped robot is useful to reduce the energy consumed in the walking. In order to study the efficiency of this new gait, two cyclic gaits are presented. The first cyclic motion is composed of successive single support phases with flat stance foot on the ground. The second cyclic motion includes a sub-phase of rotation of the supporting foot about the toe. For these two gaits, optimal motions are designed by minimizing a functional torques cost. It is shown that for fast motion a foot rotation sub-phase is useful to reduce the functional cost.",

This paper proposes a way to generate impact motions for humanoid robots to exert a large force keeping a balance. In the proposed method, the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is used to solve a nonlinear programming problem in which an objective function and constraints may be nonlinear functions of the motion parameters. Impact motions are generated using SQP so that the impact force is maximized while the angular momentum is minimized to keep stability. Breaking wooden boards by Karate-chop is taken as a case study because it is a typical example of tasks that utilize impulsive force. A humanoid robot motion for the Karate-chop is generated by the proposed method. In order to validate the designed motion, experiments are carried out using a small humanoid robot Fujitsu HOAP-2. The Karate-chop motion generated by the proposed method is compared with the motion designed by a human. The results of the breaking wooden boards experiments clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We have performed autonomous assembly in neutral buoyancy of elements of a space truss whose mating components require positioning tolerances of the same order of magnitude as the noise in the sensor systems used for the docking. Numerous trade-offs, design decisions, and innovations were made during the development of the assembly system in order to both reduce and compensate for the sensor noise. By using relative positioning, decoupling sensing and manipulation, caching high-quality position estimates, and developing a new waypoint-completion metric, we were able to reduce sensor noise to the sub-millimeter level and autonomously assemble components with millimeter tolerances. In this paper, we discuss our approaches to the problem and report the results of a series of autonomous assembly operations.",

Instead of trying to improve those factors the paper presents an alternative solution in which the grasping operation is aided by force control which accommodates positional inaccuracies. The developed control law utilizes the superposition of visually generated desired position and desired mechanical impedance of the manipulator.",

Harata et. al. applied this method to a kneed biped robot which is proper for the parametric excitation, and show that sustainable gait has been generated with only knee torque. A swing-leg of a kneed biped robot has similar mechanism to an acrobot, and many acrobots bends a joint in inverse direction like ornithoid walking. This suggests that inverse bending a knee restores more mechanical energy than forward bending like human walking, and hence, inverse bending may be more efficient. In this paper, we propose a parametric excitation based ornithoid gait generation method for a kneed biped robot, and show that it can walk sustainably by numerical simulation. We also show that parametric excitation based inverse bending walking is more efficient than parametric excitation based forward bending walking with respect to performance indices in our model.",

Parametric excitation principle is one of the solutions. Harata et al. applied this principle to a knee actuated robot to achieve parametric excitation by bending and extending the knee, and succeeded in generating a sustainable biped gait by computer simulation. Although only the dynamics of the swing-leg was considered in the method, the stance-legpsilas dynamics also affects the swing-legpsilas dynamics. Therefore we considered the whole dynamics of the robot in this paper. Therefore, we dealt with the robotpsilas center of mass as an inverted pendulum and achieved stable gait generation by parametric excitation of the inverted pendulum. The resultant energy efficiency was increased significantly.",

It is based on the combination of classical Artificial Potential Field methods (APF) with Multi-rate Kalman Filter estimations (MKF), which takes into account present and future obstacle locations within a temporal horizon. By doing that, position uncertainty of obstacles is considered in the avoidance algorithm. This implies anticipation to the movement of the obstacles and its consideration in the path planning strategy. In this paper, forces derived from the potential field are taken as control inputs for the system model as well as considered in the Kalman Filter estimation. This leads to the generation of a local trajectory that fully meets the restrictions imposed by the kinematic model of the robot.",

The operators are required to command only one unit in the head, then commands for the rest of the units are automatically calculated to track the path of the preceding units. Although the velocity commands for exact path tracking can be calculated using past command signals due to the omni-directional property of the robot, a simpler control law without using past signals is adopted from the implementation viewpoint. Asymptotic tracking error is investigated based on a Lyapunov approach for the case of a constant curvature. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated by computer simulations and laboratory experiments.",

        "abstract": "Conventionally GPS receivers and odometers are used in localization systems for ground vehicles/robots due to cost constraints. When these are deployed in urban conditions, multi-path and wheel slippage often result in large localization estimation errors. In this paper, pattern recognition techniques are employed to improve the localization estimates of a loosely coupled GPS-odometer solution. The presented method filters out from the fusion process false GPS estimates and uses extensively information on the vehicle ego-state. The approach comprises three phases. First, a detection algorithm is used to recognize likely false GPS estimates, which are then excluded from Kalman Filter updates. Second, we model the vehicle motion as a weighted sum of individual maneuvers. These are processed by a multiple model Kalman Filter to improve accuracy. Third, a maneuver recognition algorithm is used to select automatically the type of motion taken by the vehicle. The performance of our localization system has been evaluated in a quantitative manner by comparing it with a reference trajectory. This reference trajectory is estimated by a localization system based on high-grade GPS-IMU-odometer. Extensive trials were performed in different real traffic conditions; results have validated the approach and demonstrated tremendous potential.",

This sensor, placed on the front of a vehicle collects information about distance distributed according to 4 laser planes. Like a vehicle, a pedestrian constitutes in the vehicle environment an obstacle which must be detected, located, then identified and tracked if necessary. In order to improve the robustness of pedestrian detection using a single laser sensor we propose here a detection system based on the fusion of information located in the 4 laser planes. In this paper, we propose a Parzen kernel method that allows first to isolate the ldquopedestrian objectsrdquo in each plane and then to carry out a decentralized fusion according to the 4 laser planes. Finally, to improve our pedestrian detection algorithm we use a MCMC based PF method allowing a closer observation of pedestrian random movement dynamics. Many experimental results validate and show the relevance of our pedestrian detection algorithm in regard to a method using only a single-row laser-range scanner.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel type of inter-module connection mechanism for waterborne modular robotic systems. The proposed mechanism exploits the thermoelectric effect to cool down and freeze the water between two modules thus causes them to attach to each other. We validate the feasibility of this mechanism by embedding a Peltier heat pump (m = 0.8 g) in two types of cm scale self-assembly systems, one in which the modules are free to move and one in which the modules are linked together by hinges. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Peltier-based connector has (a) a high bond strength/weight ratio for a rather large range of temperatures and (b) is rather robust against misalignments between docking modules, making it a useful alternative to current connection mechanisms for small scale low autonomy self-assembly systems.",

        "abstract": "Pelvic motions are of great importance while walking, and have thus to be taken into account when developing and controlling rehabilitation devices. This paper will first introduce a new reeducation device for paraplegic people: the WalkTrainer. This device is composed of a leg and pelvic orthosis, an active bodyweight support and closed loop muscle stimulation. Second, the six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the pelvis will be measured by using the WalkTrainer on a population of twenty healthy subjects. Each DOF was successfully measured and can be analyzed as a function of time or gait cycle. Third several models that predict the pelvic motion amplitude as a function of various parameters (speed, size, ...) will be proposed and analyzed. Fourth, pelvic trajectories will be programmed on the WalkTrainer and applied on healthy subjects by the mean of the pelvic orthosis. In that phase one of the previously proposed models will be implemented. A force reduction of 20% is measured on the pelvic orthosis when the pelvic motion amplitude prediction model is used. At last muscle identification and stimulation will be introduced in the future works chapter.",

        "abstract": "It is the goal of this paper to present performance differences between a Direct Drive master actuator (DD) and a Bowden Cable relocated master actuator (BCD) in a typical force-feedback tele-manipulation experiment with a virtual slave. The BCD actuator is a candidate actuator for implementation in a wearable exoskeleton, in order to reduce mass and inertia on each joint of the movable structure. The BCD performance matches the one of the DD in terms of torque and position tracking in a 4 channel control. The maximum rendered contact stiffness is suitable for implementation in the ESA human arm exoskeleton, with a maximum of about 36 Nm/rad. When, instead of the DD, a relocated BCD actuator is implemented in an exoskeletons movable structure, the mechanical output power-density can be increased by more than 5 fold up to 31 mNm/cm3, with comparable performance. The specific power is then increased by more than 6 fold, to 13 Nm/kg. The Bowden Cable transmission wrapping angle alters the free movement friction only marginally by about 50 mNm only. The tracking performances are hardly affected and the contact stiffness increases with increasing wrapping angle. Transmission wrapping angles of up to 270 Deg. are tested.",

This paper presents a robust method for matching vertical lines in omnidirectional images. Matching robustness is achieved by creating a descriptor which is very distinctive and is invariant to rotation and slight changes of illumination. We characterize the performance of the descriptor on a large image dataset by taking into account the sensitiveness to the different parameters of the descriptor. The robustness of the approach is also validated through a real navigation experiment with a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera.",

The spinal column has been modeled as a set of rigid bodies, representing the vertebrae, connected by joints. Real-time dynamic simulation has been carried out from motion captured data collected from skin markers. A feedback controller has been developed for error minimization. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a tool for analyzing the forces acting on the spine. We report experiments performed with a boxer dog walking on a treadmill. Potential applications of this study involve bio-inspired robotics and computer graphics, as well as diagnostic applications for live animals.",

In order to speed up the process, the learning phase has been carried out in a simulated environment and, in a second step, the policy has been transferred and tested successfully on a real robot.

        "abstract": "A method of estimating pose of a robot on a lattice of RFID tags is described. In recent years, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has become a very popular method for localizing robots because it is robust to disturbances such as lighting and obstacles, which adversely affect the conventional methods that use cameras, supersonic waves and so on. Despite the advantage that RFID tags, especially passive tags, can be inexpensively mass-produced, previous studies using RFID have not targeted the detailed work of robots because they have made use of RFID tags dotted over a wide area as landmarks. Therefore, it is still difficult to use the technology at home. There is a model room in WABOT-HOUSE Laboratory of Waseda University where the floor is equipped with a lattice of RFID tags at 300 mm intervals, simulating a future home environment where robots interact symbiotically with humans. We speculate that such an environment, where the tags are distributed at regular intervals, is one of the most probable infrastructures of the near future and propose a method that use Monte Carlo localization to estimate the pose of robot on the lattice. Our experiments show that robots can localize their position more precisely than the interval of tags and also estimate their orientation successfully by using the proposed method when two readers are placed in appropriate positions.",

Diverse manipulation actions are required, e.g. simple pick and place for moving objects and constrained motions for opening doors and drawers. The robot kinematics and link limits however are restrictive. Therefore especially a constrained trajectory will not be executable from arbitrary placements of the mobile manipulator. A two stage approach is presented to position a mobile manipulator to execute constrained linear trajectories as needed for opening drawers. In a first stage, a representation of a robot arm\u2019s reachable workspace is computed. Pattern recognition techniques are used to find regions in the workspace representation where these trajectories are possible. A set of trajectories results. In the second stage mobile manipulator placements are computed and the corresponding trajectories are checked for collisions. Compared to a brute force search through the workspace, the success rate of finding a mobile manipulator placement can be increased from 2% to 70%.",

The goal is to design a feeder based on controlled mechanical vibrations in order to drive microcomponents by breaking the friction force. The contact model is based on the Hertz theory and the Greenwood-Williamson multi-asperity model. The amplitude of the static friction force is measured in a clean environment with an AFM (atomic force microscope) whose cantilever is placed in the vertical position. Using this setup and the modeling, we have estimated the interfacial shear stress between the microcomponent and the support.",

        "abstract": "Robotic path planning in changing environments with difficult regions is an extremely challenge. Since the structure of configuration space (C-space) will change when obstacles move in workspace (W-space), the planner should have the capacity of building approximate structure of C-space, while avoiding intense computational complexity. Further, difficult regions will also change their positions, which requires the planner should be able to identify them fast and increase the free nodes inside them efficiently. This paper presents a novel approach for path planning in changing environments using predictive model, which is inspired by the idea of active learning. With the help of W-C nodes mapping, this predictive model is built to capture the approximate structure of C-space, while avoiding intense computational complexity. This model include two steps: K-near Dynamic Bridge Builder (K-near DBB) is proposed to identify difficult passages in the space first, and then Inner Parzen Window is adopted to sample points in these difficult regions without invoking any collision checker. Experiments are carried out with two 6-DOF manipulators, and our approach can find a path with high time efficiency and low error rate, even if the environment is complex.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel particle filter implementation for estimating the pose of tags in the environment with respect to an RFID-equipped robot. This particle filter combines signals from a specially designed RFID antenna system with odometry and an RFID signal propagation model. Our model includes antenna characteristics, direct-path RF propagation, and multipath RF propagation. We first describe a novel 6-antenna RFID sensor system that provides the robot with a 360-degree view of the tags in its environment. We then present the results of real-world evaluation where RFID-inferred tag position is compared with ground truth data from a laser range-finder. In our experiments the system is shown to estimate the pose of UHF RFID tags in a real-world environment without requiring a priori training or map-building. The system exhibits 6.1 deg mean bearing error and 0.69 m mean range error over robot to tag distances of over 4 m in an environment with significant multipath. The RFID system provides the ability to uniquely identify specific tagged locations and objects, and to discriminate among multiple tagged objects in the field at the same time, which are important capabilities that a laser range-finder does not provide. We expect that this new type of multiple-antenna RFID system, including particle filters that incorporate RF signal propagation models, will prove to be a valuable sensor for mobile robots operating in semi-structured environments where RFID tags are present.",

Trying to completely avoid regions resulting from worst case predictions of the obstacle dynamics may leave no free space for a robot to move, especially in environments with high dynamic. This work presents an algorithm for a ldquosoftrdquo risk mapping of dynamic objects leaving the complete space free of static objects for path planning. Markov Chains are used to model the dynamics of moving persons and predict their potential future locations. These occlusion estimations are mapped into risk regions which serve to plan a path through potentially obstructed space searching for the trade-off between detour and time delay. The offline computation of the Markov Chain model keeps the computational effort low, making the approach suitable for online applications.",

The detection is cast as a probability decision problem that accounts for sensor noise and achieves robust classification. Probabilistic occlusion checking is finally performed to improve robustness.

This paper proposes an ultrasonic vibrator which has a compact mechanism to produce vibratory stimulation on human skin using a pin array driven by a single piezoelectric actuator. Amplitude modulations of the ultrasonic vibration can generate tactile sensations even if a finger is fixed on the vibrator. To generate enough stimulation to deform the skin, resonance of the piezoelectric actuator was designed. We proposed a new mechanical design method to arrange arbitrary distributions of vibration for the pin array using the principle of a dynamic vibration absorber. Detailed designs were conducted by finite element analysis. We successfully designed a smart vibrator which had a size of 17 times 17 times 3.65 mm and a weight of about 4 g. The vibrator could mount on the joystick of the PlayStation2 controller. Trial experiments of tactile presentation showed that the prototype vibrator could generate vibratory feelings in the range of 30 - 50 Hz and 200 - 300 Hz. In addition, stimulation corresponding to joystick operation generated some rubbing-like sensation.",

We introduce an upper body as a one-link torso and add it to a simple biped model by means of a bisecting hip mechanism (BHM). We first mathematically analyze the effect of the upper body with the BHM as a counterweight and discuss how it affects natural swinging motion of the swing leg. Second, we propose a simple method for generating efficient dynamic bipedal gait imitating the property of virtual passive dynamic walking, and numerically analyze the gait efficiency. Simulation results show that the walking system exhibits period-doubling bifurcation, and we discuss how the efficiency changes in the multiple-period gait.",

        "abstract": "The use of hierarchical maps has recently been proposed as an approach to make real-time visual SLAM computationally tractable in large environments. Compared to earlier work in SLAM with other sensors, local maps generated from monocular vision have one significant difference, namely, their scale is varying over different local maps. Thus, the relationship between two maps is a similarity transformation, and not an Euclidean transformation. This paper presents a novel representation of similarity transformations using quaternions. The representation is complete, is not overparameterized, does not have singularities of consequence, and its maximum likelihood estimation can be performed in real-time. The paper describes the parameterized transformation, as well as how the parameters can be optimized in real-time in a monocular visual SLAM system. Experiments presented show the validity of the approach.",

In this paper, we introduce a fourth type of kinematics machine, known as quotient kinematics machine(QKM). A QKM generating a subgroup motion G consists of two mechanisms (or motion modules) acting in unison, one synthesizing a subgroup H of G, and another that of a complement of G/H. Apparently, the two motion modules of a QKM have simpler kinematic structures than that of a SKM, PKM or HKM with the same motion type G, and thus is expected to have performance advantages in terms of stiffness (speed and accuracy), modularity and etc, over its SKM/PKM/HKM counterparts. The formulation of the QKM concept and its analysis and synthesis are considered in this paper.",

The proposed module provides the resulting modular robotic structures with dexterous deformation and force creating capabilities. The resulting robotic structures are not defacto rigid, but can change shape & form even without any cell-reconfiguration.

We use a rapidly exploring randomized tree (RRT) in conjunction with a simulated particle based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to expand the tree. The simulated SLAM explicitly accounts for sensor, localization and mapping uncertainty in the planning stage. Moreover, the RRT itself is represented in the augmented configuration space where an extra dimension of uncertainty is used. The collision likelihood along a planned path is explicitly computed and is used to select a planned path. Preliminary simulations show the effectiveness and benefits of our integrated approach.",

        "abstract": "Behavior-based architectures use behaviors as building blocks for decision-making and action execution processes. Behaviors are distributed and evaluated in parallel for the control of the robot, taking real-time inputs from sensory data and sending real-time commands to effectors. No centralized components exist in these architectures, each module carrying out its own strategy independently, making an overall behavior emerge from the interaction between the concurrently executed modules and the environment. In this paper, we discuss the use of a reactive hierarchical task network (HTN) planner in a behavior-based robot architecture. The planner in this architecture is not a central component on which everything else relies on, but acts as one of the motivational modules recommending tasks to be executed and influencing the selection and configuration of behaviors. The planning module allows the behavior-based architecture to deal with tasks with priorities, flexible time constraints and on-line planning using a simple but very effective reactive planning strategy. We demonstrate our approach in the context of making a robot attend a conference.",

        "abstract": "A real-time solution for estimating and tracking the 3D pose of a rigid object is presented for image-based visual servo with natural landmarks. The many state-of-the-art technologies that are available for recognizing the 3D pose of an object in a natural setting are not suitable for real-time servo due to their time lags. This paper demonstrates that a real-time solution of 3D pose estimation become feasible by combining a fast tracker such as KLT [7] [8] with a method of determining the 3D coordinates of tracking points on an object at the time of SIFT based tracking point initiation, assuming that a 3D geometric model with SIFT description of an object is known a-priori. Keeping track of tracking points with KLT, removing the tracking point outliers automatically, and reinitiating the tracking points using SIFT once deteriorated, the 3D pose of an object can be estimated and tracked in real-time. This method can be applied to both mono and stereo camera based 3D pose estimation and tracking. The former guarantees higher frame rates with about 1 ms of local pose estimation, while the latter assures of more precise pose results but with about 16 ms of local pose estimation. The experimental investigations have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach with real-time performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we construct a hands-free robot spoken dialogue system based on the real-time blind spatial subtraction array (BSSA) and evaluate the system. BSSA is the blind source extraction method, and the source extraction in BSSA is carried out by subtracting the power spectrum of the estimated noise signal by the independent component analysis from the power spectrum of the target speech partly enhanced signal. Although BSSA can reduce noise signal efficiently, ICA consumes huge amount of computational costs. Thus it is difficult to run BSSA in real-time. In this paper, we newly propose a real-time architecture of BSSA and construct a hands-free robot spoken dialogue system based on the real-time BSSA. In the hands-free robot spoken dialogue system with the real-time BSSA, 6% improvement of the speech recognition result can be seen compared with the conventional speech enhancement methods.",

Our algorithm is based on the continuum model for crowd simulation and our flexible virtual structure approach for formation control in virtual environments. Simulations created with our algorithm run at interactive rates in quite complex environments. In addition, each formation can be deformed in real-time and the deformation is triggered either automatically (e.g., when the formation\u2019s path is blocked by dynamic obstacles) or manually. Via simulations, we show that we can plan at least four formations, each with tens of agents, in real-time on a PC.",

        "abstract": "Minimum-time path-tracking control of robotic manipulators assumes a relevant role in industrial applications where efficiency is an issue. On the other hand, minimizing the traveling time leads to an increment of the mechanical solicitations: the actuators dynamic limits can be easily exceeded. For this reasons, kinematic and/or dynamic constraints are normally taken into account when planning optimal trajectories through off-line algorithms. Nevertheless this precaution, dynamic limits can be easily violated during actual operations due to model uncertainties and the action of the feedback controller. In order to fulfill with certainty the given constraints, planned trajectories are typically online scaled by means of dynamic filters. Normally, this is done by only considering torque constraints. On the contrary, in this paper, the trajectory is online scaled by also taking into account the existence of bounds on the torque derivatives. Indeed, torque derivatives have a direct impact both on the mechanical solicitations and on the tracking accuracy. A new nonlinear filter is proposed for the optimal trajectory scaling. Its effectiveness is verified by means of simulations.",

The algorithm differs from most visual odometry algorithms in two key respects: (1) it makes no prior assumptions about camera motion, and (2) it operates on dense disparity images computed by a separate stereo algorithm. This algorithm has been tested on many platforms, including wheeled and legged vehicles, and has proven to be fast, accurate and robust. For example, after 4000 frames and 400m of travel, position errors are typically less than 1m (0.25% of distance traveled). Processing time is approximately 20ms on a 512x384 image. This paper includes a detailed description of the algorithm and experimental evaluation on a variety of platforms and terrain types.",

The driving pattern primitives consisting of states of the environment, vehicle and driver are symbolized by hidden Markov models (HMMs), which can be used for both recognition and generation of the driving patterns. The relationship among the HMMs can be represented by locating the HMMs in a multidimensional space. The contribution of each variable to the HMM space can be analyzed such that important variables can be selected out of the driving data in order to reduce the size of the HMMs. Moreover, this paper presents a hierarchical model with the HMMs abstracting the primitive driving patterns in the lower layer, and another HMMs abstracting the longterm contextual driving patterns which are representation in the HMM space. Tests with a driving simulator and a actual vehicle demonstrate not only the validity of symbolization of driving pattern primitives, recognition and generation, but also availability of key feature selection. The extended hierarchical model is also proved to have a potential to predict the driving data appropriately.",

All systems were trained and tested with multiple samples gained from the exploration of a set of 4 soft and 4 hard objects of different materials. The monomodal texture system was good at mapping individual objects in a sensible way, the hardness systems was good at mapping individual objects and in addition dividing the objects into categories of hard and soft objects. The multimodal system was successful in merging the two modalities into a representation that performed at least as good as the best recognizer of individual objects, i.e. the texture system, and at the same time categorizing the objects into hard and soft.",

In the previous paper, we introduced a method to express criteria for generating transformations. A criterion is regulated by 32 parameters corresponding to 32 kinds of local shapes on contour of the structure. According to the criterion, CHOBIE II can dissolve undesirable local shapes and transform to goal configurations. In this paper, we propose a method to realize load-adaptive motion extending the criterion. Specifically, we add two new criteria to induce desirable local shapes and to change priorities of motions depending on a load condition. We show the availability of the method by simulation results that the modular robots construct a cantilever structure avoiding overstressed states.",

The principle is to extend the potentialities of magnetic-coupling motor shafts by adding degrees of freedom in their kinematics. The idea is to redirect the propeller and therefore, the thrust to another direction without adding or moving any motors. The focus of this work is to understand how does behave the transmitted coupling torque with regard to the new kinematics of the propeller shaft. After introducing the theory underlying this thruster technology, we bring numerical and experimental results for a laboratory set up, then for an existing and reconfigured thruster. The feasibility of this technique is then discussed based on potential integration and developments on real AUVs. The conclusion marks these results as an interesting step to achieve full 3D smooth control on a short-term basis.",

        "abstract": "Robots that are supposed to work and communicate with humans in our daily life have been developed in recent years. For this kind of robots, sensitive tactile sensors are necessary to achieve haptic interactions. However, influences of its own motion on tactile sensors sometimes become larger than the signal to be detected. This paper proposes a method to reduce such noises. It is enabled by estimating and subtracting the influences from sensor outputs. The influences of robotpsilas motions on tactile sensors are estimated by using the sequence of joint angles of the robot. In our method, a partially linear model is built to estimate the influences on a tactile sensor. The robotpsilas posture space, which is represented by its joint angles, is divided into several subspaces to fit to a linear model. We conducted an experiment with a robot covered with tactile sensors to verify the validity of our method. This paper shows that the robot is able to estimate the influences on a tactile sensor in high accuracy by the model.",

A new conceptual path planner based on rapidly-exploring random trees is proposed, which uses a set description of the uncertain configurations. A practical implementation of this path planner based on interval analysis is then described. It provides paths that could be safely followed by the vehicle during navigation, whatever the values taken by the uncertain quantities.",

The multi-camera system is based on a server-client system with local network of 1000 Base-T to achieve a voxel 3D reconstruction of human body posture in real-time. In order to extract significant points of the human body such as head, neck, shoulders, elbow joints, hands, waist, knee joints, and toes in 3D, an articulated cylindrical human model is applied to the voxel reconstruction of human body. To evaluate the proposed human body posture estimation method, 3D reconstruction experiments of human body posture and extraction experiments of human bodypsilas significant points are carried out. The system runs in real time (9 frames/sec with 50 times 50 times 50 voxel resolution) and the experimental results confirm both the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system in 3D human body posture estimation.",

It enables the use of object affordance for recognition and control, but due to its intrinsic locality and low density of current tactile sensors, stable and proper manual contacts with the objects are indispensable. Recently, design of hand structure have shown to be effective for adaptive grasping. However, such adaptive design are only introduced to the fingers in existing works of haptics and their role in recognition remains unclear. This paper introduces the design of the Bionic Hand; an anthropomorphic hand with adaptive design introduced to the whole hand and fully covered with sensitive skin. The experiment shows that anthropomorphic design of hand structure enables robust haptic recognition by convergence of object contact conditions into stable representative states through repetitive grasping. The structure of the human hand is found to solve the issue of narrowing down the sensor space for haptic object recognition by morphological computation.",

Yet, offline sampling-based planners only work in static and known environments, suffer from unbounded memory requirements and the produced paths tend to contain a lot of unnecessary maneuvers. This paper describes an online replanning algorithm which is flexible and extensible. Our results show that using a sampling-based planner in a loop, we can guide the robot to its goal using a low dimensional navigation function. We obtain higher success rates and shorter solution paths in a series of problems using only bounded memory.",

Several studies on interaction with robots stress the importance of social intelligence and even more so in a health- and eldercare environment. It shows a more social intelligent robot will be more effective in its communication and it can therefore be expected to be easier and more pleasant to interact with and therefore would be indeed accepted easier.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a unique landmark identification method is proposed for identifying large distinguishable landmarks for 3D visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in unknown cluttered urban search and rescue (USAR) environments. The novelty of the method is the utilization of both 3D (i.e., depth images) and 2D images. By utilizing a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT)-based approach and incorporating 3D depth imagery, we can achieve more reliable and robust recognition and matching of landmarks from multiple images for 3D mapping of the environment. Preliminary experiments utilizing the proposed methodology verify: (i) its ability to identify clusters of SIFT keypoints in both 3D and 2D images for representation of potential landmarks in the scene, and (ii) the use of the identified landmarks in constructing a 3D map of unknown cluttered USAR environments.",

The torque-controlled DLR light-weight robot, equipped with an on-board camera (eye-in-hand configuration), is committed with the task of looking for given parts on a table, picking them, and inserting them inside the corresponding holes on a movable plate. Visual servoing techniques are used for fine positioning over the selected part/hole, while insertion is based on active compliance control of the robot and robust assembly planning in order to align the parts automatically with the hole. Execution of the complete task is validated through extensive experiments, and performance of humans and robot are compared in terms of overall execution time.",

We summarize the experimental design, analysis, and results of our study, the first where a sociable robot interacts with a user to achieve behavior change. Results show that participants track their calorie consumption and exercise for nearly twice as long when using the robot than with the other methods and develop a closer relationship with the robot.

Previous approaches using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) have fixed number of models constructed from sample color data and could not keep models associated with shadows. As a result, although they work in some specific environments, they fail in other environments or in scenes with shadows. In this paper, we propose a new vision-based approach where flexible number of models are built from sample data. Those color samples are reliably collected from stereo-verified ground patches inside a pre-defined trapezoidal learning region. After model construction, models associated with shadows and highlights are detected and maintained. The advantages of this approach with respect to other techniques are that it gives more robust results and, in particular, recognizes shadows on road as drivable road surface instead of non-road.",

        "abstract": "Thermal sense plays an important role in object recognition. The idea to identify materials by heat flow from the skin to the touched materials have been introduced to artificial thermal sensors and proved effective. Moreover, the addition of tactile sensors is found to improve the performance of material identification by obtaining further properties of objects such as roughness and stiffness. However, the application of these sensors to autonomous recognition by a robot is not a well investigated topic. Contact with the objects will vary in such cases, but no previous sensor has shown the ability of material recognition robust to change in contact conditions with the required size and softness. The limitation is partly due to the design of current thermal sensors where the skin and the sensing devices are separated. This paper introduces a soft anthropomorphic finger with both thermal and tactile sensing elements embedded in soft polyurethane material. Experimental results show the ability to discriminate materials robust to variety in contact condition by virtue of the deformable tissue and compensation by the tactile sensors. Recognition robust to change of temperature is also realized by an additional thermal sensor.",

The originality of this work relies on the nature of the disturbances acting on the helicopter and the way to compensate them. The disturbance consists in vertical wind gusts. Here, a 7DOF nonlinear Lagrangian model of VARIO helicopter with unknown disturbances is used. This model presents quite interesting control challenges due to nonlinearities, aerodynamical forces, underactuation and its dynamics are non-minmum phase. Two approaches of robust control are compared via simulations: an approximate feedback linearization and an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) using the approximate feedback linearization procedure. Several simulations show that adding the observer can compensate the effect of disturbances.",

        "abstract": "We present robust localization algorithm using particle filter for mobile robots. The blueprint of building that cannot completely represent the real environment or a simple map of environment can be used in this work. With this incomplete information, it will not be easy to estimate the pose of robots because un-modeled obstacles will make the sensor observation inconsistent. Proposed algorithm provides robustness in such a dynamic environment because the effect of corrupted sensor observations can be suppressed by a selective update or a sampling from non-corrupted window. Results of experiments and simulations show the robustness of proposed algorithm.",

In this paper robust stability of different types of bilateral control algorithms for admittance-type devices is analyzed. Hereby stability of the system is investigated by using the parameter space approach, which allows the analysis of uncertain systems with varying plant parameters. Stability of the teleoperation system is analyzed by using linear models for human-system interface and teleoperator. The parameter space approach is adopted for controller design as well as for robustness analysis. Robust stability of the presented control architectures is evaluated for a real mechatronic teleoperation system.",

An important issue in view-based localization is to cope with the change of object views due to changes of weather and seasons. We have developed a two-stage SVM-based localization method which exhibits a high localization performance with few parameter tunings. In this paper, we extend the method in the following two ways: (1) adding new object models and visual features to deal with various urban scenes and (2) introducing a Markov localization strategy to utilize the history of movements. The new method can achieve a 100% localization performance in an urban route under a wide variety of conditions. The comparison with local feature-based methods is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many vision-based navigation methods have been introduced as an intelligent robot application. However, many of these methods mainly focus on finding an image in the database corresponding to a query image. Thus, if the environment changes, for example, objects moving in the environment, a robot is unlikely to find consistent corresponding points with one of the database images. To handle these problems, we propose a novel motion-based navigation method in contrast with appearance-based approaches. This algorithm is based on motion estimation by a camera to plan the next movement of a robot and robust feature matching to recognize home and destination locations. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the vision-based autonomous navigation against environment changes.",

A Hidden Markov Model is used to represent the incoming data sequence, where each model state represents the probability density estimate over a window of the data. Based on the assumption that data belonging to the same motion primitive will have the same underlying distribution, the segmentation is implemented by finding the optimum state sequence over the developed model. The basic algorithm is modified to add the capability for modifying the model based on known motion primitives. The inclusion of such scaffolding motion primitives can improve the performance of the basic segmentation algorithm. The modified algorithm is tested on a corpus of continuous human motion data to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

Human-computer augmented nodes and autonomous mobile sensor platforms are collaborating on a peer-to-peer basis by sharing information via wireless communication network. For each node, a computer (onboard the platform or carried by the human) implements both a decentralized Bayesian data fusion algorithm and a decentralized Bayesian control negotiation algorithm. The individual node controllers iteratively negotiate anonymously with each other in the information space to find cooperative search plans based on both observed and predicted information that explicitly consider the platforms (humans and robots) motion models, their sensors detection functions, as well as the target arbitrary motion model. The results of a collaborative multi-target search experiment conducted with a team of four autonomous mobile sensor platforms and five humans carrying small portable computers with wireless communication are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.",

If the error of interpolation is small enough, the corresponding isocline of the interpolated field will match the real isocline accurately enough. Tracking this isocline in a certain direction will then allow robust traversal of field isoclines.

Task performance increased in going from four to eight controlled robots but deteriorated in moving from eight to twelve. Workload increased monotonically with number of robots. Performance per robot decreased with increases in team size. Results are consistent with earlier studies suggesting a limit of between 8-12 robots for direct human control. This study demonstrates that these findings generalize to a more realistic setting and complex task.",

        "abstract": "Insights from biology have helped reduce the weight and increase the climbing ability of mobile robots. This paper presents Screenbot, see Fig. 1, a new 126 gram biologically-inspired robot that scales wire mesh substrates using spines. Like insects, it walks with an alternating tripod gait and maintains tension in opposing legs to keep the feet attached to the substrate. A single motor drives all six legs. Mechanisms were designed and tested to move the spines into and out of contact with the screen. After the spine engages the substrate, springs along the leg are compressed. The opposing lateral spring forces constitute a distributed inward grip that is similar to forces measured on climbing insects and geckos. The distributed inward gripping (DIG) holds the robot on the screen, allowing it to climb vertically, walk inverted on a screen ceiling and cling passively in these orientations.",

In this paper, an innovative robust control strategy based on 2nd order sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed for the stabilization of an autonomous bicycle. In order to improve overall performance, application of a disturbance observer (DOB) is suggested. The combination of 2nd order SMC and DOB enables to increase the robustness of the system trajectories while avoiding the chattering phenomenon. The proposed control scheme is validated by simulation and experimental results for bicycle stabilization at low and zero velocities.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a computational model for phoneme acquisition by infants. Human infants perceive speech sounds not as discrete phoneme sequences but as continuous acoustic signals. One of critical problems in phoneme acquisition is the design for segmenting these continuous speech sounds. The key idea to solve this problem is that articulatory mechanisms such as the vocal tract help human beings to perceive speech sound units corresponding to phonemes. That is, the ability to distinguish phonemes is learned by recognizing unstable points in the dynamics of continuous sound with articulatory movement. We have developed a vocal imitation system embodying the relationship between articulatory movements and sounds produced by the movements. To segment acoustic signal with articulatory movement, we apply the segmenting method to our system by recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB). This method determines the multiple segmentation boundaries in a temporal sequence using the prediction error of the RNNPB model, and the PB values obtained by the method can be encoded as kind of phonemes. Our system was implemented by using a physical vocal tract model, called the Maeda model. Experimental results demonstrated that our system can self-organize the same phonemes in different continuous sounds. This suggests that our model reflects the process of phoneme acquisition.",

In earlier work, we have shown the efficiency of 3D object shape approximation by box primitives for the purpose of grasping. A point cloud was approximated by box primitives [1]. In this paper, we present a continuation of these ideas and focus on the box representation itself. On the number of grasp hypotheses from box face normals, we apply heuristic selection integrating task, orientation and shape issues. Finally, an off-line trained neural network is applied to chose a final best hypothesis as the final grasp. We motivate how boxes as one of the simplest representations can be applied in a more sophisticated manner to generate task-dependent grasps.",

It requires no explicit sensor model and is capable of exploiting given tag infrastructures, e.g., provided by supermarket shelves containing labeled products.",

        "abstract": "One of the most amazing phenomena widely observed in nature is self-assembly; living systems spontaneously form their body structure through the developmental process. While this remarkable phenomenon are not thoroughly understood in biology, the concept of self-assembly becomes undeniably indispensable also in artificial systems as they increase in size and complexity. Based on this consideration, this paper discusses the realization of self-assembly with the use of a multi-robotic system each of which has simple motile function. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: the first concerns a fully decentralized control method derived from the mutual entrainment between coupled nonlinear oscillators; and the second is related to the exploitation of inter-modular physical interaction stemming from a passive deformation mechanism, which allows an efficient movement of individual modules during the course of self-assembly. Here, form generation by self-assembly is considered as the result of time evolution toward the most dynamically stable state. Owing to this, in principle, the proposed method also satisfies significant ability of self-repair without making any modification to the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that stable and spontaneous self-assembly is achieved irrespective of the initial positional relationship between the modules.",

For the purpose, each of the robots configures themselves into an area with geographical constraints through local interactions with two adjacent neighboring robots. The basic idea underlying this work is that robots can be thought of as liquid particles that change their positions conforming to the shape of the container they occupy. The main challenge is how to cope with the accuracy limitations of sensors and possible holes in the configuration. Considering such realistic conditions, the convergence of the proposed method is proved using Lyapunov\u2019s theorem. The proposed method is verified to be effective through the simulation for the secure deployments of robotic sensor network.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a positioning system that uses a phased array sensor to measure the distance and direction of multiple landmarks relative to the position of a mobile robot so that the robot can self-localize. The positioning system can control the strength and the width of the beam from the phased array sensor and observe the multiple landmarks at the same time. By using the distance and direction of plural landmarks, our positioning system is able to use various self-localizing methods. A main part of our work has been incorporating our various techniques for making a robot positioning error smaller into a system in which the most suitable self-localizing method is selected on the basis of sensitivity, which is defined as the ratio between localizing and sensor errors. We propose using a set of indices to evaluate the accuracy of self-localizing methods. The indices are derived from the sensitivity. We used these indices to compare the accuracy of three methods for the self-localizing of a mobile robot using landmarks, and we demonstrated a rational way to minimize a localizing error.",

This paper proposes a skill-synthesis framework to enable robots to self-organize learned skills for facilitating learning a new skill for accomplishing a new task. The proposed skill-synthesis framework differs from previous work in its capability of self-organizing learned skills into stimulus-response units (SRU), from which new skills can be quickly learned and synthesized. The proposed skill-synthesis framework can be realized by stages, which establish common SRUs between two similar skills and self-organize a new skill from these common SRUs and additional new SRUs with reinforcement learning. Computer simulations and experiments with a Pioneer 3-DX mobile robot were conducted to validate the self-organizing capability of the proposed skill-synthesis framework in identifying common SRUs between similar skills and learning new skills from learned skills.",

In this paper, we focus on periodic, rhythmic arm motions that can be achieved by using a controller based on neural oscillators. The challenge of this work is to determine appropriate parameters of neural oscillators coupled to a robot arm, accomplishing a given task as well as self-sustaining natural rhythms. For this, an enhanced simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is developed. This work also demonstrates how to technically implement the proposed control scheme to a real robot. Exploiting the entrainment property of neural oscillators coupled to the joints of the arm, we verify that the arm traces a trajectory in such a way that the total energy consumption is minimized, responding to external disturbances.",

        "abstract": "Active flippers for tracked vehicles are very useful to improve traversability on uneven terrain. However it is widely known that control of flippers also increases the work-load for operators, particularly where the vehicle and the operator are far apart. To reduce the work-load, we aim to realize a sensor-based autonomous controller of flippers to enable a \u201csemi-autonomous operation\u201d of tracked vehicles. The \u201csemi-autonomous operation\u201d means that the only requirement for an operator is to indicate the robot\u2019s direction. In this way, the robot is navigated autonomously through its sensors and actuators to surmount or avoid obstacles. In this research, two laser range sensors are used for terrain sensing, and gyro sensors are used for the measurement of the robot\u2019s attitude. Based on such sensor system, we propose a strategy of simple sensor-based motion of active flippers for tracked vehicles to enable a semi-autonomous operation. In this paper, we introduce a strategy of motion of active flippers, and the stability analysis of tracked vehicles with active flippers. Finally, we report several experimental results to verify the validity of our approach.",

The algorithm runs fast since it is simple, and the rich information from the sensing system helps the robot overcome the real environment, even an extremely complex one.

This work indicates which sensors may be most suitable for the inspection of transmission lines, and describes their assembly in a simple and compact structure (Sensor-Unit). In addition, it proposes several manipulator mechanisms (Sensor-Arm) to deploy sensors around the cables and to remove them when necessary. The mechanisms are compared taking into account practical aspects such as assembly, reliability, functionality and results of field experiments. Finally, the design of a high-quality camera for detailed inspection is also described.",

The method is based on the incremental generation of a configuration-space data structure called Sensor-based Exploration Tree (SET). The expansion of the SET is driven by information at the world level, where the perception process takes place. In particular, the frontiers of the explored region are used to guide the search for informative view configurations. Various exploration strategies may be obtained by instantiating the general SET method with different sampling techniques. Two of these are compared by simulations in 2D and 3D worlds.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for shape classification in rotation manipulation by a multi-fingered robotic hand. The robotic hand has five fingers equipped with tactile sensors. Each tactile sensor can measure the pressure distribution once every 10(ms). Our proposed classification method consists of the following processes: A kurtosis is calculated from the pressure distribution, and it quantifies shape of the current contact surface. By rotating an object and measuring a time-series pressure distribution, the hand obtains a kurtosis pattern. Finally, a degree of similarity is calculated between the kurtosis pattern and a reference pattern through a dynamic programming (DP) matching scheme. This classifies the contact surface shape using thresholds. Laboratory experiments confirm that this method can classify three objects with a high degree of accuracy.",

The constrained forces are expressed by an algebraic function of states, input generalized forces, and constraint condition, and then direct position / force controller without force sensor is proposed based on the algebraic relation. To give the grinding system the ability to adapt to any object shape being changed by the grinding, we added estimating function of the constraint condition in real time for the adaptive position / force control. Evaluations through simulations by fitting the changing constraint surface with spline functions, indicate that reliable position / force control and shape-grinding can be achieved by the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "We describe a framework for detecting and tracking continuous ldquotrailsrdquo in images and image sequences for autonomous robot navigation. Continuous trails are extended regions along the ground such as roads, hiking paths, rivers, and pipelines which can be navigationally useful for ground-based or aerial robots. Our approach to single-image trail segmentation incorporates both bottom-up and top-down processes. First, good grouping hypotheses are efficiently generated by probabilistic clustering of superpixels based on color similarity. Second, hypotheses are robustly ranked with an objective function comprising shape, appearance, and deformation terms. The shape term measures how well a triangle, the approximate template for a trail viewed under perspective, can be fit to the groupingpsilas boundary. The appearance term reflects the visual contrast between the grouping and its surroundings using a between-class/within-class scatter measure. Finally, the deformation term measures the closeness of the fitted triangle to a learned distribution which captures expected size, location, and other degrees of shape variation. Although trail detection is accurate and reasonably fast on a variety of isolated images, we describe how introducing temporal filtering to both the bottom-up and top-down stages increases segmentation accuracy and per-frame speed over image sequences. Results are shown on varied sequences collected from flying and driving platforms, as well as images sampled from the Web.",

Motion trajectories and positions of CNTs assembled on electrodes are predicted based on calculated DEP forces and torques. Both simulation and experimental results show that the geometries of two opposing electrodes significantly affect the precision and robustness with which CNTs can be deposited. Investigation of an electrode array verifies our model and demonstrates that the spacing between neighboring electrode pairs should be larger than twice the width of electrodes to avoid overlapping of electric fields and imbalance of DEP forces; otherwise unequally distributed electric fields and DEP forces induce a significant number of assembly failures in the array.",

Actuators based on dielectric elastomers, a specific class of electroactive polymers, appear as suitable candidates for new MRI-compatible technologies, due to their intrinsic material properties and working principle. This paper presents the first investigation on the MRI compatibility of a recently developed linear contractile actuator made of a silicone elastomer. The assessed absence of any degradation of both the actuator electromechanical performance in the MRI environment and the quality of images acquired from a phantom demonstrated the MRI compatibility of the actuator. These results suggest the suitability of this soft actuation technology as a possible new entry in the class of MRI compatible mechatronic systems.",

A completely passive wing pitch reversal design based on the wingpsilas inertial dynamics is proposed. Dynamics are simulated using a Lagrangian formulation, resulting in theoretical predictions for aerodynamic forces and motion trajectory. Based on the generated wing lift and rotation trajectory delay, the wingpsilas sensitivity to variations in spring stiffness, damping coefficient, driving frequency, and rotation axis position is analyzed and the above parameters are evaluated for efficiency as control inputs. Furthermore, a wing control methodology based on slow actuation of spring stiffness and flapping frequency is proposed, allowing for partial position/orientation of the robot in free space.",

The main implementation issue is to mimic the real behavior of the body at the extremely high rates required by haptic devices. Since even high-end computers have inadequate performance, one possible solution is to exploit the parallelism of modern Graphics Processing Units. In this paper we present our research aiming at moving the whole computational process from the CPU to the GPU taking advantage of the computational power of the graphics hardware. We use a mass-spring model, augmented with local damping coefficients and volume preservation forces. Collision detection is performed against external rigid bodies with high complexity mesh, such as the skeleton\u2019s one. The user interacts with the model by controlling virtual tools, i.e. probes or tweezers. Haptic forces are computed on GPU and the results are asyncronously transferred to the CPU. Our approach can simulate the deformation of complex models with gravity and interaction with environment and tools at a frame rate higher than 1 KHz, making it suitable for visual rendering and haptic feedback.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a largely open problem in haptic simulation and rendering: contact force and deformation modeling for haptic simulation of grasping a deformable object with a realistic virtual human hand, especially in power grasps. The virtual hand model consists of meshes of realistic shapes for the finger links and palm of a hand. We tackle the problem by adopting the non-linear contact force model and the beam-skeleton model for global shape deformation introduced in [5]. The results verify the efficiency of contact force and deformation modeling for both power grasp and precision grasp of deformable objects with reasonable realism.",

Such filters represent posteriors over the person location by a mixture of Kalman Filters, where each is conditioned on a sample of robot pose. Furthermore, information collected via multi-modal sensors is utilized in the RBPFs framework to improve the performance of both localization and tracking. This method is capable of tracking human in situations with sensor noise and global uncertainties over the observer\u2019s pose, whilst outperforms the Conditional Particle Filters (CPF) in computational efficiency. Implementation with collaboration of multi-modal sensors is described, and the experimental results illustrate the accuracy in tracking, as well as the performance of sensor collaboration in accelerating global localization and providing more robustness against occlusions.",

In this paper, we extended SLAMMOT problem to simultaneous map prediction and moving object trajectory prediction. The robot not only passively collects the data and executes SLAMMOT, but actively predicts the future scene. The recursive Bayesian formulation of SLAMMOT with scene prediction is also derived for real time operation. Preliminary results are also shown and validated the idea in this paper.",

These mechanisms are composed of three identical legs ending with a spherical joint that is constrained to move in one of three equally spaced planes intersecting at one line. The computation of the singularity loci is based on the degeneracy of the system of screws applied on the platform by the legs. The whole study is based on the use of a special orientation representation, previously introduced under the name of Tilt-and-Torsion angles. This representation is briefly introduced. Then the interdependence between the Cartesian coordinates of the general class of parallel mechanisms is derived. Finally, the singularity loci are derived and the size of the workspace taking into account all singular configurations is shown.",

        "abstract": "Image segmentation is an important problem because it is required for many different applications. In particular, visual extraction of an object that is the target of attention or manipulation, is an increasingly important issue in robot vision. In real-world applications, a robot needs to extract an object designated by a human in a complicated environment. There is a large literature on the problem of image segmentation, but most previous methods have a limited ability to extract desired objects from a cluttered scene. Moreover, from the perspective of human-robot interfaces, it is desirable to make it as easy as possible for the user to indicate an object. In this paper, we propose a segmentation method, CD-matting, which can correctly extract a target object in complicated real-world visual situations. This method exploits color and distance information in an integrated way. The system requires only a simple input to designate the target object. We verify the proposed system by real-world experiments. The results show the effectiveness of our method in complicated situations.",

The resulting local path planner considers all the visible obstacles surrounding the robot, not just the closest two.

This planner can be used on-line to establish visual and force control loop suitable in presence of human. The cubic trajectories build by this planner are good candidates as output of a manipulation task planner. The obtained system is then homogeneous from task planning to robot control.

In previous experiments, the collective behavior of 15 autonomous swarm robots, driven by a simple bio-inspired control algorithm, was investigated: in two different environmental conditions, the ability of the robots to aggregate below a light source was tested. Distinct approaches to predict the dynamics of the spatial distribution were made by two different modeling approaches: one model was constructed in a compartmental manner (ODEs). In parallel, a space-continuous model (PDEs) was constructed. Both models show a high degree of similarity concerning the modeling of concrete environmental factors (light), but due to their different basic approaches, show also significant differences in their implementation. However, the predictions of both models compare well to the observed behavior of the robotic swarm, thus both models can be used to develop further extensions of the algorithm as well as different experimental setups without the need to run extensive real robotic preliminary experiments.",

        "abstract": "Spatial scaffolding is a naturally occurring human teaching behavior, in which teachers use their bodies to spatially structure the learning environment to direct the attention of the learner. Robotic systems can take advantage of simple, highly reliable spatial scaffolding cues to learn from human teachers. We present an integrated robotic architecture that combines social attention and machine learning components to learn tasks effectively from natural spatial scaffolding interactions with human teachers. We evaluate the performance of this architecture via a human subjects experiment which examines our humanoid robotpsilas ability to learn from live interactions with human teachers in a secret-constraint task domain. This evaluation provides quantitative evidence for the utility of spatial scaffolding cues to systems that learn from natural human teaching behavior.",

Using the properties of this novel model, conditions of stability of periodic orbits are derived using inverted pendulum model and Poincare map method for nonlinear systems with impact. Using optimization of mechanical work and considering periodic and stability conditions with no slipping and no bouncing at heel, desired trajectories are obtained as functions of a time scale parameter. Upon designing a robust sliding mode controller, these trajectories are tracked. To compensate for underactuation, second derivative of the time-scale parameter is used as an input. Simulation results are finally presented to show stability of the motion.",

        "abstract": "Nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) is a very popular method employed in aircraft automatic flight control systems. However, it is known that this technique may have stability and robustness issues as soon as the model parameters used in the inversion process are uncertain or when the measurement data are noisy and biased. Many advanced analysis techniques have been presented to quantify the stability of a control system using NDI but very few papers have actually shown the physical effects of uncertainties on the behavior of the system. This paper considers the dynamic inversion process employed in the inner loop of a pitch rate control system for an aircraft and shows the effects of parameter and measurement uncertainties on the inversion process. In this paper, an explicit transfer function from the plant input to the plant output is derived, which includes the dynamic inversion process and all the relevant model parameter and measurement uncertainties. In this way the stability of the controlled system can be assessed and a systematic procedure for the selection of the uncertain model parameters involved in the dynamic inversion paths can be derived to guarantee that the plant together with the NDI process is a stable system.",

This paper derives stability boundaries of a linear model of a haptic system including those dynamics. It shows that all three elements of the human arm modeled as mass-spring-damper system contribute to stability. The haptic system itself is composed of a haptic device colliding with a virtual wall modeled as time-delayed discrete-time spring-damper system. Furthermore, the article proves that the recently found linear stability condition for haptic devices of Gil et al. still holds if a human is holding the haptic device. Finally, a relation to Colgatepsilas passivity condition defining a robustly stable region is given.",

        "abstract": "Simple models with circular arc feet rigidly mounted to the shank of the leg are widely used to investigate bipedal walking behavior. We use a simple walking model with arc feet, whose swing leg is driven by a rhythmic signal from an internal oscillator. The dynamical effects of the arc feet resemble flat feet mounted on ankles with a torsional spring, where the circular arc radius of the arc feet has similar dynamical characteristics to the spring stiffness in the ankle torque. Walking behavior generally consists of the falling motion of the body relative to the stance and the swinging motion of the swing leg. However, when the circular radius exceeds a certain threshold, the body motion changes from such divergent behavior to oscillatory behavior due to the dynamical influence inherent in the arc feet, and the mechanism to create walking behavior greatly changes. Since our model is driven by a rhythmic signal from the oscillator, the walking behavior is driven by two different oscillatory elements and the relationship between them plays an important role. In this paper, we clarify the dynamical effect of the relationship on walking stability.",

Whole-body motion based on redundant control that takes positional control of a composite center of gravity(CCoG) and a wrist roller as goal tasks is adopted. Using the motion control, motion planning of the robot can be described intuitively and in a simple manner. Compliance motion of a manipulator by force control of a wrist roller is adopted to move the position of CCoG and to maintain the robotpsilas stability when the wrist roller contacts with the ground, which is an important factor in successfully achieving a sitting motion. Based on this motion control, standing and sitting motion planning is also proposed, which considers the stability and the operational time efficiency of the process. The proposed control method and motion planning were tested experimentally with I-PENTAR, and it was confirmed that standing and sitting motions were achieved stably in a short time period.",

The theory can predict the behavior of the actuator for the different species of counterions. In order to describe the actuator dynamics as a system with inputs and outputs, this paper proposes a linear state space model based on the electrostress diffusion coupling theory.

        "abstract": "This paper presents analysis and experiments of a 4WD omnidirectional wheelchair for climbing a high step. For enhancing the mobility and maneuverability of standard wheelchairs, a new type of omnidirectional mobile platform with four-wheel drive (4WD) mechanism is introduced. The mobile platform equips four wheels, two omni-wheels in front and two normal tires in rear. The normal wheel and the omni-wheel, mounted on the same side of the base, are interconnected by belt transmissions to rotate in unison with a drive motor, i.e. a synchro-drive transmission. To rotate a chair at the center of the mobile base about vertical axis, the third motor is installed on the platform. The prototype wheelchair with the proposed 4WD system is capable of moving in any direction and climbing over a high single step. The conventional 4WD system provides enhanced step climb capability. However the maximum step height is restricted by the rear wheels. Namely, front wheels can climb up higher step than the rear wheels although the both wheels are identical in diameter. To clarify the difference between front and rear wheels in the step climb capability, the statics of the 4WD system is analyzed. It is suggested that the reaction of a drive torque cause the front-rear differences and its influence depends on a wheelbase and a vehicle weight distribution ratio between front and rear wheel axes. For varying a vehicle weight distribution ratio, we develop a chair tilting mechanism for the 4WD wheelchair with a linear drive mechanism controlled by a stability algorithm using an inclinometer. To verify the analysis results and availability of the chair tilting mechanism, step climb capabilities of a 4WD wheelchair prototype is tested in experiments. In the experiments, both front and rear wheels of the prototype wheelchair with a human can successfully climb a 90 mm step while the rear wheels fail when the chair tilting system is disabled.",

The behavior of the robot is analyzed by a multi-expert architecture, where a number of controllers compete for the data from the physical robot. Each expert stabilizes the representation of the acquired sensorimotor mapping in dependence of the achieved prediction error and forms eventually a behavioral primitive. The experts provide a discrete representation of the behavioral manifold of the robot and are suited to form building blocks for complex behaviors.",

The passive wheel can be transformed into sole mode by rotating ankle roll joints when Roller-Walker walks on rough terrain. This paper describes adaptation of characteristics of the propulsion by a leg trajectory in the case of wheeled locomotion. Firstly, the authors demonstrate that Roller-Walker could achieve high-speed propulsion and slope climbing propulsion by simply changing parameters of the leg trajectory on the hardware experiments. Secondly, an asymptotic parameter tuning method is introduced to perform specified velocity on the different surfaces with different friction. The method is evaluated in numerical simulations. The results suggest that the method allows the Roller-Walker to have a function similar to an automatic transmission of a usual car.",

Previous studies have shown that the chameleon effect, which increases the likeability of a person who mimicks another during a conversation, appears not only with humans but also with CG agents. However, if we use humans, they cannot accurately mimic. In addition, if we use a CG agent, it doesnpsilat have a very humanlike appearance. It remains doubtful whether the CG agent reappears in a human-human communication. Thus, we use an android with a very humanlike appearance and approach the principle of human-human communication. In this paper, we compared mimic and non-mimic conditions when an android conversed with subjects in face-to-face. Likeability toward an android increased when the android mimicked its partner. In addition, we confirmed the possibility of using an android to explore human-human communication. These results contribute to verbal communication for robots in daily life.",

        "abstract": "Pixel array based 3D range sensors like time of flight sensors (e.g. Swiss-ranger) are commonly used for spatial mapping. Analogous to a laser range finder beam, each pixel measures distances within its conical field of view. However, unlike laser range finders, these sensors use incoherent visible or near visible light for range measurement. This, combined with their relatively long maximum ranges, means that the convenient thin beam assumption can no longer be used to update an occupancy grid map using a probabilistic sensor model. We present an analysis of a scenario where a pixel beam is intersected by more than one object and where a unimodal probabilistic distribution assumption causes spurious objects to appear in the detected scene. This adversely affects path-planning based on such maps because perfectly good escape routes are blocked off. A two step multimodal Gaussian mixture model based procedure is presented which is able to detect multiple obstacles per pixel and hence ameliorate the problem. The results of experiments done using a time of flight based sensor are presented.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of coordinating a swarm of unmanned ground vehicles with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is utilized as a leader robot that is intelligently followed by a coordinated group of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The UAV is a completely autonomous agent that is controlled using Sugueno fuzzy logic. The UGVs are organized into formation utilizing artificial potential fields generated from normal and sigmoid functions. These functions are built around the location of the UAV and ultimately construct the surface that swarm members travel on, which inherently controls the overall swarm geometry and the individual member spacing. Nonlinear limiting functions are defined to provide tighter swarm control by modifying and adjusting a set of control variables forcing the swarm to behave according to set constraints, formation and member spacing. The swarm function and limiting functions are combined to control swarm formation, orientation, and swarm movement as a whole. Parameters are chosen based on desired formation as well as user defined constraints. Simulations demonstrate the precision of the approach with up to forty UGVs. Experimental results are presented using a fully autonomous swarm of three UGVs and a single UAV helicopter for coordination.",

Firstly a group of particles associated with potential solutions are initialized in a high-dimensional space. Then particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to drive particles flying. The object is tracked when the particles reach convergence. This PSO-based algorithm contains resample, similarity measure, and integration together such that the degeneracy problem of particle filter can be avoided. Furthermore, a multiple feature model is proposed for object description to enhance the tracking accuracy and efficiency. The proposed algorithm is independent with specific objects and can be used for any free-selected object tracking. Some experimental results demonstrate efficiency and robustness of the algorithm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Vision-based tracking is used in nearly all robotic laboratories for monitoring and extracting of agent positions, orientations, and trajectories. However, there is currently no accepted standard software solution available, so many research groups resort to developing and using their own custom software. In this paper, we present Version 4 of SwisTrack, an open source project for simultaneous tracking of multiple agents. While its broad range of pre-implemented algorithmic components allows it to be used in a variety of experimental applications, its novelty stands in its highly modular architecture. Advanced users can therefore also implement additional customized modules which extend the functionality of the existing components within the provided interface. This paper introduces SwisTrack and shows experiments with both marked and marker-less agents.",

The algorithm is completely distributed. Each robot flashes by lighting up its on-board LEDs and neighboring robots are driven to flash in synchrony. Since robots that are suffering catastrophic failures do not flash periodically, they can be detected by operational robots. On a real multi-robot system of 10 autonomous robots, we show how the group can correctly detect multiple faults, and that when given (simulated) repair capabilities, the group can survive a relatively high rate of failure.",

Imitation control was applied on a biped robot based on measurements of the developed wearable sensor system. Experimental study was implemented to verify the synchronous imitation control method proposed for the biped robot, and verification results proved the feasibility of the proposed control method. Through comparing results obtained from direct imitation control method and improved method based on training algorithm considering the personal motion pattern, we found that the imitation control accuracy was markedly improved, and the three-axial average errors of x- y- and z- moving displacements related to leg length were 12%, 8% and 4% respectively.",

This paper presents the design and experimental results of our latest walking robot \u2018Flame\u2019 and the design of our next robot in line \u2018TUlip\u2019. The focus is on the mechanical implementation of series elastic actuation, which is ideal for Limit Cycle Walkers since it offers high controllability without having the actuator dominating the system dynamics. Walking experiments show the potential of our robots, showing good walking performance, though using simple control.",

Advancing recent work on rolling indenters [1], the sensor proposed here makes use of a rigid sphere which is held at the end of a tubular shaft and pressed against the tissue by a stream of air. Variations in tissue stiffness result in movements of the sphere within the shaft and are picked up by an optical system. The new approach allows virtually frictionless motion of the sphere across the tissuepsilas surface and rapid acquisition of tactile information over large areas of soft tissue. The structure and working principles of this new air-cushion tactile sensor are described. Laboratory experiments are conducted to show the feasibility and illustrate the behaviour of the proposed sensor system. The outcome of the conducted experiments shows the potential of the sensor system.",

The prototype sensor was composed of two different stiffness layers of elastomers as epidermis-dermis. Epidermal ridge and papillary ridge like structures are formed on a top layer of proposed structure. To measure its deformation, standing piezoresistive cantilevers are placed beside the papillary ridge. Since the papillary ridge deforms with the standing cantilever, it will causes unique deformation to the sensor. In this study, we confirmed the efficiency of the proposed tactile sensor with the scanning test of the object surface with grating. In the scanning test, contact angle of the sensor was related to its response. We verified the relationship between the contact angle and the sensor response and showed sensorpsilas efficiency for texture detection.",

        "abstract": "In normal human communication, people face the speaker when listening and usually pay attention to the speaker\u2019 face. Therefore, in robot audition, the recognition of the front talker is critical for smooth interactions. This paper presents an enhanced speech detection method for a humanoid robot that can separate and recognize speech signals originating from the front even in noisy home environments. The robot audition system consists of a new type of voice activity detection (VAD) based on the complex spectrum circle centroid (CSCC) method and a maximum signal-to-noise (Max-SNR) beamformer. This VAD based on CSCC can classify speech signals that are retrieved at the frontal region of two microphones embedded on the robot. The system works in real-time without needing training filter coefficients given in advance even in a noisy environment (SNR \u226b 0 dB). It can cope with speech noise generated from televisions and audio devices that does not originate from the center. Experiments using a humanoid robot, SIG2, with two microphones showed that our system enhanced extracted target speech signals more than 12 dB (SNR) and the success rate of automatic speech recognition for Japanese words was increased about 17 points.",

Sensory information from cameras is processed by the Level Set Method in real time and integrated with range data obtained by laser range finders in a probabilistic manner using novel SIR/MCMC combined particle filters. Though the conventional SIR particle filter is a popular technique for object tracking, it has been pointed out that the conventional particle filter has some disadvantages in practical applications such as its low tracking performance for multiple targets due to the degeneracy problem. In this paper, the new combined particle filters consisting of a low-resolution MCMC particle filter and a high-resolution SIR particle filter is proposed. Simultaneous tracking experiments for multiple moving targets are successfully carried out and it is verified that the combined particle filters has higher performance than the conventional particle filters in terms of the number of particles, the processing speed, and the tracking performance for multiple targets.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an integrative approach to solve the coupled problem of reaching and grasping an object in a cluttered environment with a humanoid robot. While finding an optimal grasp is often treated independently from reaching to the object, in most situations it depends on how the robot can reach a pregrasp pose while avoiding obstacles. We tackle this problem by introducing the concept of task maps which represent the manifold of feasible grasps for an object. Rather than defining a single end-effector goal position, a task map defines a goal hyper volume in the task space. We show how to efficiently learn such maps using the rapidly exploring random tree algorithm. Further, we generalise a previously developed motion optimisation scheme, based on a sequential attractor representation of motion, to cope with such task maps. The optimisation procedure incorporates the robotpsilas redundant whole body controller and uses analytic gradients to jointly optimise the motion costs (including criteria such as collision and joint limit avoidance, energy efficiency, etc.) and the choice of the grasp on the manifold of valid grasps. This leads to a preference of grasps which are easy to reach. The approach is demonstrated in two reach-grasp simulation scenarios with the humanoid robot ASIMO.",

This is because tethers provide robust data communication and uninterrupted power delivery. Tether management is an important research domain, which has not been well explored. Our research work aims at devising tether management techniques to reduce the inherent problems associated with a tether and to obtain useful information about the robot and its environment. In this paper, tethers are used to monitor an environment, to localize a robot and to guide it back to the entry point. Experimental results show that proposed tether monitoring techniques are effective and open up several interesting avenues for further investigation.",

Conversely, robots offer a robust experimental platform on which to test biological hypotheses. This interaction of biology and robotics is an exciting but challenging task, because the vast disparities between both can lead to inaccurate or even misleading conclusions. In this paper, we present a biorobotic platform that can arbitrarily define the dynamic couplings between a fruit fly and a robot. The platform is used to explore the stability and emergent properties of the biorobotic couple. The fruit fly\u2019s wing kinematics are measured in real time and used to drive an autonomous robot. In turn, the robot\u2019s sensory information is transformed back into visual feedback to the fly. Using different case studies, we explore how the choice of feedback influences the success of the biorobotic device. We discuss the meaning of such feedback in view of biomimetic implementations.",

        "abstract": "In this video we present a work in progress in the UJI (i.e. the acronym for University Jaume I) robotics telelaboratory. This telelaboratory uses a remote control system based on networked robots and FPGAs technology. The main devices included in this Cell are: a SCARA manipulator (AdeptOne), a robot arm with six degrees of freedom (Motoman), an industrial belt, several sensors and cameras, an FPGA that takes care of the computer vision algorithms (i.e. including grasping determination), and a distributed architecture that allows any user to control remotely via Internet a specific manufacturing task. The different components of this system are connected by a 100BaseT Ethernet network and follow the SNRP architecture (i.e. Simple Network Robot Protocol), which permits the integration of network robots and sensors within an e-learning platform in a simple and reliable manner. The whole telelaboratory is connected to the Internet through a router that permits the user to control the networked devices according to security constraints. This distributed architecture allows any user to control remotely via Internet a specific manufacturing task.",

Due to the non-Markovian, dynamic, multimodal, and discontinuous objective function employed, the controller presented uses a stochastic optimizer in the form of either a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) or a comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO) to calculate UAV routes. A hybrid maneuver automaton is applied to model vehicle dynamics and a Fisher information theory based model of discrete ground regions is used as an objective function. Finally, the non-Markovian process PSO (NMPPSO) algorithm is introduced to achieve better performance by customizing the PSO and its variants to decision processes with non-Markovian reward through the use of a suffix trie.",

A Shoulder structure is one of the keystone, because it controls arms and end effectors and it have direct contact with humans and daily life environments. We have designed new shoulder structure following the scapula-collarbone structure for a muscle-driven humanoid robot named \u201cKojiro\u201d (Fig. 1)[1]. We consider that the scapula-collarbone structures have the following merits, 1)wide range of movement, 2)flexible shoulder like humans, 3)safety from the driving system, 4)allowing space for a lot of parts inside the thorax. The shoulder structure is consisted of scapula, collarbone, upper-arm and thorax. We have devised the spherical shape thorax and scapula structure which realizes desired scapula motions. In this paper, we describe the design process and operation test of the shoulder structure.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to increase flapping frequency of a previously developed flapper actuated by lightweight piezo-composite actuator (LIPCA). This is an effort to mimic the flapping motion of Allomyrina Dichotoma of which flapping frequency is typically 30 Hz. For this purpose, the dynamic characteristic of the LIPCA and the parameter study of a four-bar linkage have been conducted. From the finite element analysis and experiment, it was found that the first resonant frequency of the LIPCA in a simply supported configuration is about 80 Hz. When a dummy mass of 50 grams is attached at the center of the LIPCA, the first resonant frequency is dropped to about 20 Hz, which is still higher than the optimal frequency of the previous flapper. This means that a particular geometry of the four-bar linkage system, which was used to amplify the actuation displacement and flapping angle, might have reduced the optimal flapping frequency. Therefore, the topology of the linkage system was examined for the amplification of rotation angle and the moment transfer efficiency. In a parametric study, it was found that a carefully chosen combination of linkage lengths may provide a higher flapping frequency while the flapping angle is not seriously reduced. A new four-bar linkage system was fabricated based on the result and tested to verify the possibility. The optimal flapping frequency of the new flapper was measured to be about 18 Hz, which is about 100% increase compared to that of the previous flapper.",

The motion editor is a higher level puppet motion composer that creates and combines sequences of control in a timely fashion. The special designed data glove uses a minimum number of sensors to achieve puppet manipulation. It measures the gesture data and maps to the motion of X-puppet in real-time.

In this work, we present the next generation of Whegs\u2122 robots, DAGSI Whegs\u2122, which has been completed and extensively field tested. Several innovations have made the robot more rugged and well suited to autonomous operation. Specifically, an actively controlled, passively compliant body joint has been tested in three different modes of operation to judge the usefulness of the mechanism. A two-dimensional dynamic simulation of the robot has also been constructed, and has been used to study the effects of weight distribution on obstacle climbing and to investigate future autonomous climbing strategies. Moving the center of mass forward allowed the robot to climb taller obstacles. DAGSI Whegs\u2122 can climb rectangular obstacles as tall as 2.19 times the length of a leg.",

This method, the LF/SoG, does not rely on the establishment of correspondences. The underlying idea is to model one of the scans by a function of x-y-coordinates, the Likelihood Field, depicting the likelihood of obstacle detection. Then, the scan matching problem turns into an optimization problem involving the Likelihood Field and the other scan. Because no correspondences are established, the main problems of ICP-based algorithms are not present in the LF/SoG. The presented experimental results validate the LF/SoG approach and compare it with other well known scan matching algorithms in terms of robustness, accuracy and convergence rate.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a human-robot interactive scenario consisting of a memory card game between Honda\u2019s humanoid robot ASIMO and a human player. The game features perception exclusively through ASIMO\u2019s on-board cameras and both reactive and proactive behaviors specific to different situational contexts in the memory game. ASIMO is able to build a dynamic environmental map of relevant objects in the game such as the table and card layout as well as understand activities from the player such as pointing at cards, flipping cards and removing them from the table. Our system architecture, called the Cognitive Map, treats the memory game as a multi-agent system, with modules acting independently and communicating with each other via messages through a shared blackboard system. The game behavior module can model game state and contextual information to make decisions based on different pattern recognition modules. Behavior is then sent through high-level command interfaces to be resolved into actual physical actions by the robot via a multi-modal communication module. The experience gained in modeling this interactive scenario will allow us to reuse the architecture to create new scenarios and explore new research directions in learning how to respond to new interactive situations.",

We named a Flexible, Flat Plate to FFP actuator as an actuator of a flexible locomotion robot. The FFP actuator is a versatile actuator that mechanically obtains flexible displacement by combining functional materials like the shape-memory alloy with a simple lamina structure lightly not broken. The center of gravity movement is achieved by the expansion and contraction of a flexible lamina. In the robots that proposes, the actuators and the structures are unification. The assembly of this robot is possible at few time. The resulting robot weighs a mear 5.8g (with a height of 80mm). By miniaturizing flexible robots, execution of more detailed work becomes possible. This robot is certain to save the loading payload approximately 1.5 times the empty weight of the robot (onboard load of the about 0g). We achieved quadruped locomotion robot without the falling depending on the average speed of about 1.5mm/second.",

The conditions of the existences of stable sliding mode on the intersection of hyper-surfaces in the space of the system coordinates with the presence of essential dynamic reciprocal effect between all control channels are obtained and strictly proved. The new law of the adaptive tuning of the position of sliding hyper-surfaces in each control channel is proposed and mathematically substantiated. The application of these control laws allow to provide the high control quality and the maximally possible fast-action at any variations of the object parameters within the given ranges.

The basic approach is to approximate the features of interest with a set of non planar coverage surfaces and to design a motion plan that guarantees the coverage surface is swept completely with a conical-field-of-view sensor. We establish a lower bound on time for a UAV to achieve complete coverage and derive the analytical coverage plan whose duration is a constant times this lower bound.

When a manipulator of a space robot is controlled, rotational motion of the base body is induced by the reaction torque. Assuming that reaction wheels are used to cancel the reaction and to stabilize the base attitude, the torque limitation of the wheels should be considered in order to realize zero base rotation of the robot. In this paper, a time-optimal control strategy of a free-floating space robot is discussed considering an arbitrary prescribed path for the manipulator hand and the dynamic constraints on reaction torque. The strategy is verified by numerical simulation with a free-floating space robot model equipped with a 7DOF (degrees-of-freedom) manipulator and a system of three reaction wheels.",

        "abstract": "Retinal vein occlusion is an obstruction of blood flow due to clot formation in the retinal vasculature, and is among the most common causes of vision loss. Currently, the most promising therapy involves injection of t-PA directly into small and delicate retinal vessels. This procedure requires surgical skills at the limits of human performance. In this paper, targeted retinal drug delivery with wireless magnetic microrobots is proposed. We focus on four fundamental issues involved in the development of such a system: biocompatible coating of magnetic microrobots, diffusion-based drug delivery, characterization of forces needed to puncture retinal veins, and wireless magnetic force generation. We conclude that targeted drug delivery with magnetic microrobots is feasible from an engineering perspective, and the idea should now be explored for clinical efficacy.",

Our approach is a part of larger efforts to develop a cognitive robot and has two components: (a) the robot models affordances as statistical relations among actions, object properties and the effects of actions on objects, in the context of a goal that specifies preferred effects and outcomes, (b) to exploit the general-knowledge potential of actual experiences, the robot engages in internal rehearsal by playing out virtual scenarios grounded in yet different from actual experiences. To the extent the robot accurately appreciates affordance relations, the robot can autonomously predict the outcomes of its behaviors before executing them. Internal rehearsal-based outcome production in turn facilitates planning of a sequence of behaviors toward successful task execution. We also report simulation results of internal rehearsal-based traversability affordance learning of a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "The field of ubiquitous robotics is becoming an active research domain. One of the more challenging of this domain is providing services composition in a seamless manner. Several recent research efforts have dealt with the services composition problem in ubiquitous environment. However, most of them assume that the composition plan was already constructed despite of the major challenge and complexity that involves this task. In this paper, we propose an approach which generates automatically a flexible plan for the services composition by optimising both the number of services and parameters which appear in this composition. Our plan is constructed in an abstract way in order to be adaptable to the changes which occur on the services and the context of use. This approach is tested under USARSim simulator on a set of ubiquitous robotic services which assist an elderly person. We have also tested our approach when the complexity of services composition increases. Obtained results show clearly the feasibility and scalability of our approach in ubiquitous environment.",

Often, a lot of object physics and modelling effort has to be incorporated into a controller working only for a very restricted task specification and performing quite artificially looking movements. In this paper, we present the first steps towards a representation of manipulation movements recorded from human demonstration which facilitates later application and promotes natural motion. We use manifolds of hand postures embedded in the finger joint angle space which are constructed such that manipulation parameters including the advance in time are represented by distinct manifold dimensions. This allows for purposive navigation within such manifolds. We present the manifold construction using the Unsupervised Kernel Regression (UKR) and the way of applying it for manipulation in the example of turning a bottle cap in a physics-based simulation.",

Usually the state of a warehouse is managed in a central database, which must be updated for every storage and retrieval activity. The entire process is prone to errors, because it relies on manual activities performed by employees. This paper presents a technique to monitor the manual transportation processes of goods in a warehouse, in order to update the database automatically. In the proposed scenario, transport vehicles such as forklift trucks or pallet jacks are equipped with wireless sensor nodes and every storage and retrieval activity is reported to the warehouse management system. Tracking of transport vehicles is performed with nanoLOC sensor nodes, which offer range measurement capabilities. This radio positioning system determines the range between two devices by measuring the signal propagation delay. The paper describes the tracking of transport vehicles with range measurements and trilateration using the Extended Kalman Filter. It presents experimental results of tracking a forklift truck in a warehouse.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a trafficability analysis for the exploration rover is described. A rover traveling on loose terrain often experiences its slippages (wheel slips or vehicle sideslip), and in particular, these slips become larger when the rover traverses on sandy slopes. The authors have investigated traction mechanics of a rigid wheel of the rover on loose terrain with paying attention to slipping behaviors of the wheel. In this paper, based on our previous works regarding the wheel-terrain mechanics, we propose a Thrust-Cornering Characteristic Diagram for trafficability analyses of the rover. The thrust-cornering characteristic diagram consists of various characteristics curves of wheel forces, namely thrust and cornering forces, with various wheel slippage conditions. This diagram provides quantitative criteria for slope traversing capability of the rover on arbitrary angles of slope. The usefulness of the proposed diagram for the trafficability analysis is confirmed through slope traversal experiments using a four-wheel test bed. Further, a steering maneuver control for slope traversing situation is discussed based on the diagram.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method called Transition-based RRT (T-RRT) for path planning in continuous cost spaces. It combines the exploration strength of the RRT algorithm that rapidly grow random trees toward unexplored regions of the space, with the efficiency of stochastic optimization methods that use transition tests to accept or to reject a new potential state. This planner also relies on the notion of minimal work path that gives a quantitative way to compare path costs. The method also integrates self tuning of a parameter controlling its exploratory behavior. It yields to solution paths that efficiently follow low cost valleys and the saddle points of the cost space. Simulation results show that the method can be applied to a large set of applications including terrain costmap motions or planning low cost motions for free flying or articulated robots.",

The proposed mechanism exploits the thermoelectric effect to cool down and freeze the water between two modules thus causes them to attach to each other. We validate the feasibility of this mechanism by embedding Peltier heat pumps (m = 0.8 g) in a cm scale self-assembly system. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Peltier-based connector has (a) a high bond strength/weight ratio for a rather large range of temperatures and (b) is rather robust against misalignments between docking modules, making it a useful alternative to current connection mechanisms for small scale low autonomy self-assembly systems.",

One important problem in tool handling with a multifingered hand is that the relative positions between the robot hand, the tool and the handled object change during the handling. For this reason, it is necessary to measure these relative positions in realtime, and to control the hand so as to cancel the changes. We have resolved this problem by using a high speed visual servoing. In this paper, as an example, a tweezers is handled by a multifingered hand. Further, a new method to control tools along with experiment result are shown.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots must be designed with consideration for reconfiguring body pose during operation if they are to address more challenging environments. Researchers have mostly relied on static stability methods to monitor the possibility of rollover in stationary or slow moving vehicles. However, little research in dynamic stability is being conducted for robots capable of reconfiguring their pose to overcome obstacles encountered in challenging terrains. A multi-degree-of-freedom robot with the capability to vary its center of gravity is discussed in this paper. It is designed to improve mobility over rough terrain and is used in this paper as an example to address one aspect of dynamic stability. A complete understanding of the dynamic behaviour of a multiple degree of freedom robot in unstructured terrain is a difficult problem to solve. It is too complex to solve completely and therefore a reduced aspect of the problem is addressed. The robot will only have the ability to vary its center of gravity in the plane parallel to its direction of forward motion. In addition the robot will only move on flat terrain and encounter an immovable linear step feature. The result of the research is that once the center of gravity is specified by selection of robot body pose, and a maximum obstacle considered, platform stability can be ensured with a maximum allowable velocity. In other words, a maximum allowable velocity of the robot is governed by the position of the center of gravity relative to the wheel in contact with the linear step feature. If the robot is traveling below the predetermined maximum velocity then the robot is guaranteed to remain upright.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel adaptive controller for image-based visual servoing of robots with an uncalibrated eye-in-hand camera using line features. The controller is developed based on three key ideas. First, we propose a new method that is similar to the Plucker coordinates, to represent projections of the lines features. The new representation leads to a depth-independent image Jacobian matrix and an error vector between real images and estimated projections of the lines, which are both linear to the unknown camera parameters. Second, an adaptive algorithm is developed to estimate the unknown camera parameters and the 3-D coordinates of the lines on-line. Third, a simple controller using the depth-independent image Jacobian is designed to control the projections of the lines to desired positions and orientations. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic convergence of the image error to zero based on the nonlinear robot dynamics. Finally, experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",

We present a two-stage algorithm that achieves point stabilization without oscillatory behavior. A low-level controller regulates as many outputs as available control inputs. The unregulated states are generally nonzero when the regulated states have converged, but for certain initial conditions the vehicle arrives at the origin of the state space using only the low-level controller. This set of initial conditions forms a manifold in the state space. A separate Lyapunov-based manifold convergence controller drives the vehicle states to this manifold so that the low-level controller can bring the vehicle to the origin. We provide experimental results of this two-stage algorithm applied to a 1.25-meter ship model.",

In this work, we propose a new Java-based editor with a plugin architecture for GUI elements and communication ports. Special focus is laid on platform-independent design, easy extensibility, connectivity to different robotic frameworks, usability and deployment.

        "abstract": "It is a common assumption that with just two microphones only the azimuth angle of a sound source can be estimated and that a third, orthogonal microphone (or set of microphones) is necessary to estimate the elevation of the source. Recently, using specially designed ears and analyzing spectral cues several researchers managed to estimate sound source elevation with a binaural system. In this work, we show that with two bionic ears both azimuth and elevation angle can be determined using both binaural (e.g. IID and ITD) and spectral cues. This ability can also be used to disambiguate signals coming from the front or back. We present a detailed analysis of both azimuth and elevation localization performance for binaural and spectral cues in comparison. We demonstrate that with a small extension of a standard binaural system a basic elevation estimation capacity can be gained.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a mobile robot global positioning system which combines passive RFID and monocular vision. The method is intended to solve the so-called kidnapped robot problem, that is, the problem of estimating the robot pose when it is first booted up or it has been kidnapped and taken to some unknown location. The main novelty of the approach is the use of fuzzy logic to cope with both uncertainty in RFID data and missing tag position information. Fuzzy logic allows us to manage inaccurate sensor data using rules easily understandable by humans. An additional advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require the robot to move around to solve ambiguities, nor does it need several tags to be properly arranged. Conversely, only one passive RFID tag and a single visual landmark are sufficient to univocally estimate the pose of the robot in the environment.",

Vision-based SLAM approaches usually rely on interest points associated to a point in the Cartesian space: by adjoining oriented planar patches (if they are present in the environment), we augment the landmark description with an oriented frame. Thanks to this additional information, the robot pose is fully observable with the perception of a single landmark, and the knowledge of the patches orientation helps the matching of landmarks. The paper depicts the chosen landmark model, the way to extract and match them, and presents some SLAM results obtained with such landmarks.",

We address this problem by considering the swarms as dynamic camera networks in which, each robot is reduced to a mobile camera. The synchronicity is a strong restriction that in some cases of wide applications can be difficult to obtain. This paper studies the methodology of using a non synchronized camera network. We consider the cases where the frequency of acquisition of each element of the network can be different, including desynchronization due to delays of transmission inside the network. The following work introduces a new approach to retrieve the temporal synchronization from the multiple unsynchronized frames of a scene. The mathematical characterization of the 3D structure of scenes is used as a tool to estimate synchronization value, combined with a statistical stratum. This paper presents experimental results on real data for each step of synchronization retrieval.",

In this aim, we develop a generic sensor of visibility using an onboard camera in a vehicle. Our approach consists in estimating the range to the most distant object belonging to the plane of the road having at least 5% of contrast. The originality of this approach lies in the fact that the depth map of the vehicle environment is obtained by aligning the road plane in successive images. This algorithm exploits the dynamics of the vehicle which is given or observed from proprioceptive sensors classically available on public vehicles. In this paper, we present the principle of our approach in terms of image processing and explain how the vehicle dynamics takes part in it with a sensitivity study.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of implementing an intelligent velocity controller on the Platform for Ambulating Wheels (PAW). The PAW robot is a hybrid quadrupedal wheeled-legged robot that can bound, gallop, roll and brake at high speeds and perform inclined turning. The goal of implementing intelligent control is to increase the robotpsilas versatility and autonomy in order to traverse various terrain types and complete tasks. A Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm is executed at the top of flight instant in a stride and computes the forward and rear foot touchdown and liftoff positions. This enables the robot to track desired velocity in a Matlab-Adams co-simulation model. Initial steps are also taken to implement this learning algorithm on the physical robot by way of developing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the forward center of mass velocity. Additionally, a discussion on the future steps towards autonomous control of the PAW robot is presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a vertical ladder climbing of the humanoid robot only by the posture control without any external sensors. The humanoid robot does not have any special structure for fixing the body to the ladder. The robot maintains the body on the ladder by its grippers like human does. As a problem of this locomotion, a free gripper position of the climbing robot is not controllable because a yawing of the robot body around the axis connecting a supporting gripper and foot on the ladder is not fixed. To solve this problem, the momentum around AOY caused by the gravity is used to control the yaw motion of the body so that the various gait such as pace gait and trot gait could be realized in a ladder climbing maneuver. The algorithm of ladder climbing with recovery motion is experimentally verified by using ldquomulti-locomotion robot(MLR)rdquo which is developed to achieve various types of locomotion such as biped, quadruped walking and brachiation.",

        "abstract": "The problem of safe locomotion of legged and wheeled robots, when trying to avoid falling, tipping over or hitting obstacles, appears to be a problem of viability and not of Lyapunov stability. Theoretically speaking, viability and model predictive control are unquestionably related, but both can quickly lead to untractable numerical problems. We present here a promising approach for the problem of avoiding to fall in the case of legged locomotion that elegantly solves this difficulty. We propose then a brief discussion about what makes this approach successful with respect to the approaches proposed for the other problems where viability is at stake. This paper should be considered therefore mostly as a prospective reflection on the general problem of safe robotic locomotion.",

The concept of a vibrating wing with passive torsion is validated by comparisons between theoretical and experimental approaches on a schematic geometry of a single wing. The structural and aerodynamic aspects are separated in a weakly coupled formulation. In this first stage the wing is represented by a beam with a L shape. Vibrations with large displacements in bending-torsion are obtained at the expected frequency with well adapted materials. The theoretical and experimental approaches have now to be extended to a more complex system with two wings, a thorax and actuators.",

This study aims to investigate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of a mobile robot using omni-directional images. A switching method of visual reference scans is proposed to facilitate fast visual scan matching in the SLAM design. In this method, new reference scans can be added to a database and an existent reference scan can be switched to be current reference scan automatically in SLAM calculation. Visual reference scans can be used repeatedly to reduce the computation complexity of extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the SLAM algorithm. Experimental results show that the correct matching rate of landmark features is 92.6%. Indoor navigation experiments validate the proposed localization algorithm. Average localization error of 10cm has been achieved in a 30m travel in an indoor environment using omni-directional images.",

Vehicle localization and seabed mapping is performed simultaneously by means of an Extended Kalman Filter. Passive landmarks are detected on the images and characterized considering 2D and 3D features. Landmarks are re-observed while the robot is navigating and data association becomes easier but robust. Once the survey is completed, vehicle trajectory is smoothed by a Rauch-Tung-Striebel filter obtaining an even better alignment of the 3D views and yet a large-scale acquisition of the seabed.",

        "abstract": "Walking fruit flies are attracted by near-by objects. They estimate the distance to these objects by the parallax motion of their images on the retina. Here we provide evidence from robot simulations that distance is assessed by motion integration over large parts of the visual field and time periods of 0.5 s to 2 s. The process in flies is not selective to image motion created by the self-motion of the fly but also sensitive to object motion and to the pattern contrast of objects. Added visual motion (e.g. oscillations) makes objects more attractive than their stationary counterparts. Front-to-back motion, the natural parallax motion on the eyes of a forward-translating fly, is preferred. A group of several more distant objects can be more attractive than one close object. Objects, that are most attractive in the fronto-lateral eye-field, act as deterrent in the rear visual field. Time to course changes doubles from front to rear. A cybernetical model based on weighted motion integration in just four compartments (frontal to plusmn100deg lateral and plusmn100deg to plusmn160deg in the rear) can reproduce fly behavior. Implemented on a freely moving camera-equipped robot with panoramic vision it can reproduce various aspects of the orientation behavior of freely walking flies without the necessity to recognize objects. Tracks of walking fruit flies and traces of the robot model obtained in up-scaled environments have been rigorously compared in various arrangements of landmarks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a vision based method for grasp classification. It is developed as part of a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) system for which recognition of objects and pick-and-place actions represent basic building blocks for task learning. In contrary to earlier approaches, no articulated 3D reconstruction of the hand over time is taking place. The indata consists of a single image of the human hand. A 2D representation of the hand shape, based on gradient orientation histograms, is extracted from the image. The hand shape is then classified as one of six grasps by finding similar hand shapes in a large database of grasp images. The database search is performed using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), an approximate k-nearest neighbor approach. The nearest neighbors also give an estimated hand orientation with respect to the camera. The six human grasps are mapped to three Barret hand grasps. Depending on the type of robot grasp, a precomputed grasp strategy is selected. The strategy is further parameterized by the orientation of the hand relative to the object. To evaluate the potential for the method to be part of a robust vision system, experiments were performed, comparing classification results to a baseline of human classification performance. The experiments showed the LSH recognition performance to be comparable to human performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a position-based visual servo control scheme designed for an underwater vehicle. The methodology proposes a path planning technique, which guarantees that a flat target is kept in the camera optical field, while the vehicle avoids collision with the surface the target lays on. The vehicle pose (position and orientation) with respect to the target is obtained using a laser vision system (LVS). The LVS projects two laser dots in the image plane while it tracks the target using computer vision algorithms. The position of each laser dot in the image plane is directly related to the distance between the vehicle and the surface the target is located. The path planning strategy is based on the artificial potential field method (APF). The attractive part of the APF is responsible for minimizing the error between the current vehicle position and the desired. The repulsive part of the APF restricts the target inside the camera optical field while keeps away the laser dots from image regions related to small distances between the vehicle and the surface the target is located. The steering control of the vehicle is achieved by feeding the computed points of the path planning into a Cartesian kinematic controller, which was slightly modified for the needs of the methodology. The overall efficiency of the system, was proved through an extensive experimental procedure, using a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in a test tank.",

Here two special targets are considered: a sphere marked with two points on its surface and a sphere marked with a tangent vector to a point on its surface. For these targets we propose a new minimal set of six visual features which can be computed on classical perspective cameras. Using the new set, a classical control method is proved to be globally stable even in the presence of modeling error. In comparison with the previous set originally proposed for the second target, the new set draws a better camera trajectory. Finally, simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed theoretical results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Semantic knowledge especially for robots is often used as a form of knowledge representation which includes ontological knowledge to support Description Logics and rule language. However, it is difficult to design rules which provide some goal-associated Context, Object and Space (COS)-action complexes to be used to infer alternative attempts for success of a goal, when current attempt is not satisfactory. To cope with such a difficulty, we propose a novel weighted Action-coupled Semantic Network (wASN) which is used to recursively update and infer goal-associated COS-action complexes. To be specific, as in the semantic networks, wASN is a graph consisting of nodes and edges, respectively, to represent concepts-such as perception, object, space and context, and to represent semantic relation between the concepts. And, those concepts are designed to be all coupled with their associated actions. On the other hand, as in neural networks, our proposed wASN is designed to have weighted values of the connections among semantic nodes. And those weighted values are summed at each node, and are used to adopt a node by \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d activation strategy. It is shown that wASN is useful to recursively get COS-action complexes for a specific task to find objects which are partially occluded or unobservable.",

        "abstract": "In the near future, robots are expected to play active roles in human communities. After this time arrives, robots will need to be socially accepted by the people in the communities to which they belong. However, it remains unknown what issues must be resolved to make robots socially accepted. In this paper, we point out the three criteria with which people in communities evaluate a robot and three types of relations people have with the robot. We conducted a six-week study in an office to statistically test the relationship between the evaluations and how well a robot is accepted depending on relation types. We probe that by improving behaviors in the criteria the robot will be more accepted by each type of people. Then, the discussion are presented about the most important issues regarding the social acceptance of robots.",

        "abstract": "Carrying heavy payloads is a challenging task for the modular robot, because its composing modules are relatively tiny and less strong compared with conventional robots. To accomplish this task, we attached passive rollers to the modular robot, and designed a wheeled locomotion gait called tricycleBot. The gait is inspired by paddling motion, and is implemented on the modular robot called SuperBot. Features of this gait are systematically studied and verified through extensive experiments. It is shown that tricycleBot can carry payloads at least 530% of its own weight. It can also be steered remotely to move forward/backward, turn left/right. Capability of tricycleBot demonstrates that the versatility of modular robot can be further expanded to solve very specialized and challenging tasks by using heterogeneous devices.",

These systems are cheap, effective, and require no modifications to the environment. In this paper, we present a WiFi localization algorithm that generates WiFi maps using Gaussian process regression, and then estimates the global position of an autonomous vehicle in an industrial environment using a particle filter. This estimate can be used for bootstrapping a higher-resolution localizer, or for cross-checking and localization redundancy. The system has been designed to operate both indoors and outdoors, using only the existing wireless infrastructure. It has been integrated with an existing laser-beacon localizer to aid during initialization and for recovery after a failure. Experiments conducted at an industrial site using a large forklift-type autonomous vehicle are presented.",

Vehicle sensors consist of wheel speed and steering angle, the WiFi data consist of reception signal strength (RSS) and the angle of the maximal RSS with respect to the robot orientation. A nonholonomic nonlinear model vehicle is considered, due to this nonlinearities an extended Kalman filter EKF is used.

Based on feasibility analysis of grasps, the proposed approach uses a numerical optimization technique to first compute discretely the boundary of the possible motion of the grasped object, and then the limits of rotation about various axes at a specified feasible position of the object. Finally the boundaries of the linear motion and rotation are visualized in 3-D coordinates separately. This approach provides an effective solution to the challenging problem of workspace analysis of 3-D multifingered manipulation.",
