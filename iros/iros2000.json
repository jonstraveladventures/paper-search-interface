        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the stabilization problem of multiple chained form control systems with input constraints. A new controller presented can stabilize the system to an arbitrarily, small /spl epsi/-neighborhood of its equilibrium in a finite time. This is achieved by the sliding mode approach and a multi-step control strategy. The application of it to a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot is described. Simulation result shouts that the proposed controller is effective.",

(1996, 1998) have successfully applied constrain-move to three robots, but due to existence of redundancy in vertical forces in a team of four robots, this protocol is not applicable to such systems in its original form. In the presented cooperation strategy, the robots support the load on its bottom face and there is no lateral artificial constraint on the object. The distributed coordination protocol is designed in such a way that with minimum volume of communication and implementing their own local sensors, the robots can lift the object while its Euler angles and robot-object contact are controlled. Stability condition for the system is attained mathematically. Simulation results are given to support the applicability of the presented system.",

The manipulator consists of many links, and therefore it should plan a collision-free sequence of motions by a collision check between two moving 3D links. In previous octree-based algorithms, we drop each patch of an object on an octree of another object to investigate their collision. In our proposed algorithm, we drop each edge of an object on an octree of another object to find the collision. With our algorithm, tracing the edge is much faster than covering the patch on the octree. For this purpose, we first develop an efficient algorithm for finding neighbor nodes (cubes) along an edge in an octree. Next, we build a collision check algorithm with the support of the neighbor finding algorithm.",

Applications in robotics need to be able to process information from multiple sensors, for instance, in the case of a visible talking person. How can we relate this kind of information in a simple way, without making use of high level representation? This is the question that we want to address. A new framework based on a correlation measure of low level data information is proposed. This low level correlation measure can be used as an integration data engine to support high level task description. In the paper a coherent approach from sensor level to task level for developing a robot which can handle a large number of sensors and actuators is developed. An example how this approach can be used for a visual-sound integration task is also presented.",

Previous work has shown that the motion problem can be decoupled into trajectory generation and steering. We investigate basic issues of momentum generation for a class of dynamic mobile robots, focusing on eel-like swimming robots. We use control laws based on a series of gaits motivated by the biological literature on coupled oscillators and central pattern generators. A primary characteristic of this class of robots is that drift plays a significant role in the generation of motion. We develop theoretical justification for a forward gait that has been observed in nature and for a turning gait, used in our control laws, that has not yet been studied in the biological literature. We also explore theoretical predictions of novel gaits for turning and sideways swimming.",

The problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem by incorporating final state errors and obstacle avoidance conditions in the cost function. To solve the highly nonlinear optimal control problem, we introduce the concept of the order of priority into the trajectory generation procedure. We place the first priority on the convergence of the state to a desired state. The second priority is given to obstacle avoidance and the third priority is given to trajectory optimization. Then, a gradient-based iterative algorithm which synthesizes the gradient function in a hierarchical manner considering the order of priority is proposed. The simulation results of the 3-link planar free-joint manipulator are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

The algorithm of Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) and the algorithm of Lin-Canny (LC) are well-known fast solutions to the problem. We show how a mix between LC's idea and the GJK's algorithm can be used to solve the problem. In our algorithm, we use local methods to calculate the distance between features and new \"updating\" conditions to add stability. These new conditions enable one to ensure more stability when compared to GJK. We also modify our terminating conditions to add robustness to our approach. Our experiments also show that the expected running time of our approach is constant, independent of the complexity of the polyhedra. We present some comparisons of our method with GJK.",

        "abstract": "Selectively perceiving systems explore their environment by fixating on and analyzing potentially interesting parts of a scene in a continual manner. During this process, a sequence of snapshots, each containing visual data with distinct spatio-temporal properties, is collected. We propose a visual memory model that enables the integration of this spatio-temporal data. This memory model, referred to as the bubble model, uses a spherical surface attached to the viewpoint in order to store and manipulate information collected during selective perception process. The bubble surface can be deformed by a number of control points to represent visual information obtained from different fixation points. Bubbles are indexed by the viewpoint vectors so that they can be recalled or updated as necessary. Different bubbles attached to the same viewpoint can store multiple simple and complex features. Using time stamps and parametric surface representations the model can also be used to extract changes and similarities in the environment.",

Pictures from a camera at the robot's head are sent to a remote screen and can be monitored by a human operator. This human operator can also control the robot's motion, but not every single body part. Thus the operator only gives general directives and the robot will then able to follow autonomously the given directives. This is the semi-autonomous behavior of the robot. However, the robot must also be able to act fully autonomous when the contact to the operator is lost. After a short description of the robot we present a method which makes the operator control easy and also allows the robot to act fully autonomous. The autonomous motion control of the robot moving in a sewer pipe has been implemented.",

We describe the methodology we use to represent and handle uncertainties using probability distributions of the system's parameters and sensor measurements. It may be seen as a generalization of constraint-based approaches where we express a constraint as a probability distribution instead of a simple equality or inequality. Appropriate numerical algorithms used to apply this methodology are also described. Using an example, we show how to apply our approach by providing simulation results using our CAD system.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm which extends the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) framework to handle manipulation planning. This is done by using a two level approach, a PRM of PRMs. The first level builds a manipulation graph, whose nodes represent stable placements of the manipulated objects while the edges represent transfer and transit actions. The actual motion planning for the transfer and transit paths is done by PRM planners at the second level. The approach is made possible by the introduction of a new kind of roadmap, called the fuzzy roadmap. The fuzzy roadmap contains edges which are not verified by a local planner during construction. Instead, each edge is assigned a number which represents the probability that it is feasible. Later, if the edge is part of a solution path, the edge is checked for collisions. The overall effect is that our roadmaps evolve iteratively until they contain a solution. The use of fuzzy roadmaps in both levels of our manipulation planner offers many advantages. At the first level, a fuzzy roadmap represents the manipulation graph and addresses the problem of having probabilistically complete planners at the second level. At the second level, fuzzy roadmaps drastically reduce the number of collision checks. The paper contains experimental results demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme.",

However, the feedback was localized and the desired velocity field was given by a central controller. The geometry cooperative multiple mobile robot system whose subsystem is under nonholonomic constraints and which conveys a common rigid object in a horizontal plain was proposed. In this paper, we propose a method to generate the desired velocity field for cooperative mobile robots with decentralized PVFC. The proposed control method for cooperative mobile robots is constructed by extending the PVFC and ensures the stability and boundedness using projection algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is examined by computer simulations for cooperative tasks with two manipulators.",

Our approach is to divide self-reconfiguration planning into three levels: trajectory planning, configuration planning, and task-level planning. This paper focuses on algorithms for trajectory planning, moving a single molecule from a start location to a goal location, and configuration planning, moving a set of molecules from a starting configuration to a goal configuration. We also present our scaffold planning approach in which the interior of a structure contains three-dimensional tunnels. This allows molecules to move within a structure as well as on the surface, simplifying molecule motion planning as well as increasing parallelism. In addition, we present a new gripper-type connection mechanism for the molecule which does not require power to maintain connections.",

This framework can be used in any situation, and in particular, is suitable for crowded environments in which the robot's free C-space has narrow corridors such as maintainability studies in complex 3D CAD models. Our iterative strategy adaptively selects a planner whose strengths match the current situation, and then, online, switches to a different planner when circumstances change. This requires techniques to evaluate the characteristics of the current query, and a set of planners which are characterized so that we can match the query with the best planner for it. Our experimental results in complex 3D CAD environments show that our strategy solves queries that none of the planners could solve on their own.",

These properties are analyzed under the frictionless assumption by modelling each contact with a kinematic chain that instantaneously gives the same motion freedom as the contact itself and by studying the resulting parallel chain using the Grassmann-Cayley algebra. With this algebra twists and wrenches can be expressed by means of extensors and operated using the join and meet operators. Moreover, the duality inherent in this algebra is used to reflect the reciprocity condition between possible twists and admissible wrenches between partially constrained rigid bodies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a CAD-guided robot path generator is developed for the spray painting of compound surfaces commonly seen in automotive manufacturing. Instead of widely used parametric representation of surfaces, a planar facet scheme is used to approximate the painting surfaces. As a result, a new combinatorial gun path planning algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, big patches are formed by stitching small surfaces together. Therefore, the path planning is solved based on the global characteristics of tire part, and the resulting spray gun paths are well-behaved in the sense of time, coverage, and wastage. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested using ROBCAD/sup TM//Paint.",

The paper reduces all approaches for \"intelligent\" compliant, motion sensor processing to a basis set of just four classes. Some of these algorithms have already been tested experimentally, while others are still beyond the current state-of-the-art. The major contribution of this paper is to bring a clear structure to the field, which should eventually result in an easier integration of different research results, and a more precise discussion about their relative merits and innovations.",

Since the motion of a person's head pose and gaze direction are closely related to his/her intention and attention, detection of such information can be utilized to build natural and intuitive interfaces. In this paper, we describe a behavior recognition system based on the real-time stereo face tracking and gaze detection system to measure head pose and gaze direction simultaneously. The key aspect of our system is the use of real-time stereo vision together with a simple algorithm which is suitable for real-time processing. Our system we can significantly simplify the algorithm for 3D model fitting to obtain the full 3D pose of the head compared with conventional systems that use monocular camera. The recognition of attentions and gestures of a person is demonstrated in the experiments.",

This paper discusses a biomimetic search strategy extracted from ethological studies of how insects and animals forage for food, and cognitive studies of how children search for objects. This leads to a biomimetic search organization where a robot partitions the search space based on the semantic understanding of the expected distribution of survivors, then systematically searches each of the volumes in ranked order. While in transit between volumes, the robot conducts a passive opportunistic search. The paper also describes how this search strategy is being implemented and evaluated on a mobile robot for two upcoming USAR competitions.",

Inspired by bio-systems, a biomimetic trajectory planning method is introduced. This scheme is based on employment of redundant actuation which prevails in bio-systems. We explain that in the generation of the biomimetic trajectory, intelligent structure of bio-systems plays an important role to completely modulate the dynamic behaviour of a system, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios. A five-bar mechanism equipped with two redundant actuators is employed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed biomimetic trajectory experimentally.",

We propose a capturing procedure using hybrid position/force control and vibration suppression control.

The motion of the two hands of the manipulators are synchronized with the rotation of the object. The hands make contact with the spinning object safely, considering link flexibility, and then brake the spin smoothly. The effectiveness of our method is shown in experiments using two 3D manipulators, each of which has two flexible links and seven joints.",

In this paper we deal with the catching motion control of the gripper. We consider the necessity of the midair control of the gripper for catching a target. In order to enlarge the reachable area of the gripper, we propose the method of controlling the movement of the string by the brake mechanism. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed multiple braking control by simulation results and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the effects of the application of visual adaptation mechanisms on snapshot-based guidance methods. The guidance principle of the visual homing is proven to be a visual potential function with an equilibrium point located at the goal position. The presence of a potential function means that classical control theory principles based on the Lyapunov functions can be applied to assess the robustness of the navigation strategy. The proposed adaptation mechanism is the Retinex algorithm, a blind chromatic adaptation pre-filtering that performs color constancy with no a priori information about the illuminant. It increases the visual information similarity under changes in the illuminant, increasing the robustness of the visual guidance. Tests and comparisons are presented.",

The concept of artifical potential fields is used for accounting for the obstacles in the environment. Apart from taking advantage of the large body of knowledge from the numerical methods community this has the virtue of facilitating a simple and general problem description. Experiments show that using this method, complex movements can be calculated in a timely fashion.",

We also demonstrated that the stable giant swing motions of type B and C could be realized by the configuration method.",

In this paper, a robust adaptive controller which can achieve velocity tracking while considering not only kinematic model but also dynamic model of mobile robot is proposed. The proposed controller can overcome model uncertainty or external disturbances by the robust adaptive technique. The stability of the dynamic system is shown through the Lyapunov method.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the field of humanoid robotics attracts more and more interest and the research on humanoid locomotion based on central pattern generators (CPG) reveals many challenging aspects. This paper describes the design of CPG for stable humanoid bipedal locomotion using an evolutionary approach. In this research, each joint of the humanoid is driven by a neuron that consists of two coupled neural oscillators, and corresponding joint's neurons are connected by strength weight. To achieve natural and robust walking pattern, an evolutionary-based multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to solve the weight optimization problem. The fitness functions are formulated based on zero moment point (ZMP), global attitude of the robot and the walking speed. In the algorithms, real value coding and tournament selection are applied, the crossover and mutation operators are chosen as heuristic crossover and boundary mutation respectively. Following evolving, the robot is able to walking in the given environment and a simulation shows the result.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for robotic applications in dynamic unstructured environments is motivating the need for dextrous end-effectors which can cope with the wide variety of tasks and objects encountered in these environments. The human hand is a very complex grasping tool that can handle objects of different sizes and shapes. Many research activities have been carried out to develop artificial robot hands with capabilities similar to the human hand. In this paper the mechanism and design of a new humanoid-type hand (called TUAT/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand) with human-like manipulation abilities is discussed. The new hand is designed for the humanoid robot ARMAR which has to work autonomously or interactively in cooperation with humans and for an artificial lightweight arm for handicapped persons. The arm is developed as close as possible to the human arm and is driven by spherical ultrasonic motors. The ideal end-effector for such an artificial arm or a humanoid would be able to use the tools and objects that a person uses when working in the same environment. Therefore a new hand is designed for anatomical consistency with the human hand. This includes the number of fingers and the placement and motion of the thumb, the proportions of the link lengths and the shape of the palm. It can also perform most part of human grasping types. The TUAT/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand possesses 20 DOF and is driven by one actuator which can be placed into or around the hand.",

Design specifications for mobility, space requirement weight, sensing, and control are defined. A revolute hip joint is selected based on its enhanced mobility and capability to function in reasonably confined spaces. Small size dictates minimal weight, which is achieved by an under actuated joint structure, providing steering at only one foot, minimizing sensors, and structural optimization. The smart robotic foot supports the robot on a variety of smooth surfaces and provides feedback when a firm grip is established. Adaptable control strategies and dithering are implemented in lieu of minimal sensors and uncertainty created by backlash, gravity, and compliance in the suction feet. The robot is evaluated while performing tasks on surfaces with a variety of inclinations.",

A number of experiments based on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate, robust, and efficient for the registration of free-form shapes.",

The simulator is a significant tool to pursue this goal. In this paper, we first present a method for constructing a humanoid simulator that can closely model and predict the motion of an actual humanoid. We then propose a balance controller consisting of an off-line walk-pattern generator and a real-time modification. Using the simulator, we can predict the humanoid's physical capability subject to the constraints of actuators, and clarify the required specifications of actuators to execute a desired task. The functions of the developed simulator and the effectiveness of the proposed balance controller were evaluated through simulated walks on an unknown rough terrain, soft ground, and an environment in the presence of disturbances.",

The pallet has an initial uncertainty in pose (position and orientation) of the order /spl plusmn/15 cm and /spl plusmn/20 degrees. The docking error is required to be within /spl plusmn/1 cm and /spl plusmn/1 degree with \"very low\" failure rate. For the docking a combination of a range camera and a video camera is used. In the paper the range camera is emphasized. Experimental results from this work in progress are presented. Successful docking has been made with typical /spl plusmn/5 mm as errors. Currently one weak part is the integration with the control system on board the robot. Our persistent experience from this and earlier tests is that the weak part when using non-contact sensing for feedback in robots is the association problem. It should be mentioned that the resolution of a range camera is strongly distance dependent. One finding in the paper is that this type of docking is feasible and can be made self-monitoring.",

In such a system the capability of large shape change is used to induce tipping and rolling behaviors of the robot itself. However, the dynamics of the tipping motion and the contact forces that occur on impact with the ground are complex. In this paper, a two-phase planning and switching control sequence is introduced to achieve stable and reliable motion of an icosahedral Tetrobot modular robot. Simulation of the resulting rolling motions suggests that speed and direction of the rolling can be controlled, and both sustained uphill and downhill rolling motions are feasible.",

One approach is to evaluate teams comprising identical copies of a single evolutionary individual. The alternative is to use a separate evolutionary individual to specify each member of a team. Intuitively the former seems better suited, and it has been widely applied to the evolution of many kinds of homogeneous system. However, so little consideration has been given to the latter approach that, despite its apparent unsuitability, there is insufficient empirical evidence on which to discount it. This paper reports on a comparison of the two approaches over multiple runs in the context of a non-trivial cooperative task carried out by simulated mobile robots controlled by arbitrarily recurrent neural networks. It was found that, contrary to expectations, the latter approach performed significantly better than the former.",

        "abstract": "Vision systems employing region segmentation by color are crucial in real-time mobile robot applications. With careful attention to algorithm efficiency, fast color image segmentation can be accomplished using commodity image capture and CPU hardware. This paper describes a system capable of tracking several hundred regions of up to 32 colors at 30 Hz on general purpose commodity hardware. The software system consists of: a novel implementation of a threshold classifier, a merging system to form regions through connected components, a separation and sorting system that gathers various region features, and a top down merging heuristic to approximate perceptual grouping. A key to the efficiency of our approach is a new method for accomplishing color space thresholding that enables a pixel to be classified into one or more, up to 32 colors, using only two logical AND operations. The algorithms and representations are described, as well as descriptions of three applications in which it has been used.",

        "abstract": "The subject of the paper is a fast algorithm for detecting collisions of two convex polyhedra translating in space. A major feature is the novelty of the approach: collision detection for two convex bodies is reduced to collision detection for pairs of planar sections and minimization of a bivariate convex function; furthermore, most of the subproblems are solved using two-dimensional geometry. As proved by previous theoretical work, on this basis it is possible to design an algorithm, which runs in O(log/sup 2/n) time in the average and O(log/sup 3/n) in the worst case, where n is the total number of vertices. Here the focus is on a more practical version of the algorithm, which is particularly suited to plan collision-free paths on the basis of fine-grain descriptions of the objects in the workspace, as it is the case for the systems supported by sophisticated geometric modelers. After explaining the main ideas underlying the approach, a set of experimental results are presented and discussed in some depth.",

Our method is also based on the Bayesian model, thus it also provides estimates for the spatial uncertainties, in the form of covariances of the pose parameters.

A vigorous stability analysis of the MIC algorithm based on Lyapunov direct method, besides error analysis, show that the MIC law guarantees good tracking of cooperative manipulators and the object, in performing a manipulation task. Also, a force tracking strategy inspired by human control system is added to the MIC algorithm and the general formulation is revised to fulfil a desired force tracking task after impact. A system of three manipulators mounted on a space free-flyer is simulated, and the results show that, even in the occurrence of an impact due to collision with an obstacle, the response of the MIC algorithm is smooth. Also, relying on the new modification of the algorithm, the contact force follows successfully a desired tracking trajectory.",

Fuzzy behavior elements are trained by a genetic algorithm. This has been conducted for three behavior groups namely objective behavior group, free behavior group and reactive behavior group. Simulation has been carried out for the PUMA robot to reach a target from a given point while avoiding an obstacle. Result shows that the fuzzy behavior based approach can be applied to plan the manipulator's joint angles and angular velocities to reach a particular point while avoiding obstacles.",

To navigate, self-localize and cooperate in such contexts, a multi-robot system has to find a way to represent and share knowledge about the world it is living in. We discuss the necessity and the advantages of grounding representations and communications of a robot team in real perceptions. We describe a technical framework designed for this purpose, which is based on the classification of the perceptions of a robot population. Percepts must have specific properties to enable grounding, and we present particular percepts well suited to this process. Finally we discuss the possible usages of grounded classes and propose a grid representation for fusion and exchange.",

        "abstract": "Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is an attractive tool to validate the functionality of space robots. It is the purpose of the hardware-in-the-loop simulation to make a rigid robot prototype behave, in contact/noncontact phases, as closely as possible to a given robot reference model that would be encountered in the real-world. We introduce a method for the hardware-in-the-loop simulation that is based on the projection of the generalized coordinates of the robot model into two subspaces representing independent and dependent coordinates. The independent coordinate is obtained via simulation by making use of its acceleration model expressed in a closed form. While, the dependent coordinate is obtained from the generalized coordinated of the linearized robot prototype acting as a double integrator on the input dependent-coordinate acceleration. It is followed by investigating the effect of external disturbance on the performance of the hardware-in-the-loop simulation, by the method of Lagrangian multiplier. Finally experimental results obtained from implementation of a single axis arm is presented.",

        "abstract": "Segmentation of an articulated object is one of the fundamental techniques of computer vision, and it can be applied to human body structure analysis and motion measurement. In this report, we propose a method that generates the contour model of each link element of an articulated object by using the hierarchical part decomposition (HPD) method of body contour. The HPD can divide the body region into characteristic elements without any model of link parameters or shape based on the distribution of high-curvature points of the object's contour in the video sequence. Although the HPD only works under the restricted situation, the proposed method can also handle more general body motion by using the shape model of human body generated from the decomposed result. Experiment results of measuring the kip motion under real environment show that the proposed method can divide the body into characteristic elements and obtain postures of the body from the video sequence.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, off-the-shelf algorithms for force/torque control are used in the context of mobile manipulation, in particular, the task of opening a door is studied. To make the solution robust, as few assumptions as possible are made. By using relaxation of forces as the basic level of control more complex information can be derived from the resulting motion. In our system, the radius and centre of rotation of the door are estimated online. This enables the complete system to have a higher degree of autonomy in an unknown environment. In addition, the redundancy of the robot is exploited in such a way to drive the system towards a desired configuration. The framework of hybrid dynamic systems is used to implement the algorithm which gives a theoretically sound framework for analysing the system with respect to safety and functionality. The integration of the above approaches results in a system which can robustly locate and grasp the handle and then open the door.",

        "abstract": "Visual servoing based upon geometrical features such as image points coordinates is now well set on. Nevertheless, this approach has the drawback that it usually needs visual marks on the observed object to retrieve geometric features. The idea developed here is that these features can be retrieved by integrating dynamic ones, which can be estimated without any a priori knowledge of the scene. Thus, more realistic scenes can be used to achieve vision-based control such as positioning tasks. We show that an affine model is insufficient to ensure convergence and that a quadratic one is needed. Finally, results are presented related to the positioning with respect to a complex scene.",

        "abstract": "An essential task for a multiple autonomous mobile robot system is to search for and to gather objects. To accomplish such a task effectively, it is essential that all the agents share common information on locations of objects, comrade agents and the place to deposit the objects. The authors have proposed a method called \"COMPASS\" to realize this only using two functions of each agent-to estimate the location of the objects by dead reckoning and to exchange the information with each other by one to one bidirectional proximity communication. In the paper, a new concept \"figure of confidence (FOC)\" is introduced to the COMPASS for higher performance and additional capability. The FOC is a self-estimated measure for accuracy of information in each agent. Using the FOC, agents can accelerate information sharing and handle multiple objects without significantly increasing complexity of the algorithm. The validity of FOC is confirmed through computer simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a nonlinear feedback path controller for a skid-steering mining vehicle. The dynamic model of the vehicle is derived using the Boltzmann-Hamel formalism. The control design utilizes the computed torque type technique combined with an auxiliary continuous static state feedback, which involves error coordinates expressed in a moving reference frame partially linked to the vehicle. Assuming that the lateral friction forces caused by the skidding of the wheels are not exactly known, the last part of the paper is centered on the analysis of the effect of Coulomb friction on the behaviour of the system. Asymptotic stabilization of the equilibrium set is achieved for the closed-loop system with discontinuous right-hand side.",

Image partitioning plays two roles: load distribution and load balancing. Image partitioning is executed not simply by the number of pixels, but by the number of interested pixels, or features. The characteristics of load variance are analyzed, and the positions of two perpendicular (vertical, horizontal) lines are determined using these characteristics. The PIP algorithm offers fast load balancing, and enables efficient vision processing with well balanced load. We apply the PIP algorithm to real-time depth determination for mobile robot navigation with a sequence of images.",

Such a robot has a quite different mechanism in locomotion from that of other locomotion systems, namely, it has no driving wheel and moves only by bending its body. Hence the locomotability depends on its posture. In order to evaluate the locomotability, we utilize a notion of dynamic manipulability which has been applied to a robot manipulator. We also propose a simple controller based on this manipulability. Simulation results show that a certain periodic winding motion is automatically generated.",

In this paper we describe the mechanical design of the first generation of Conro modules: the philosophy of their design, their parts and functionality and derive two inequalities that relate the design parameters of a module. Each module is fully self-contained in every sense; it carries its own CPU, power supply, and actuators. The modules were designed to work in groups, as robots, and thus, they also support inter-module communication. We conclude the paper describing a Conro hexapod as an example of the robots that can be built using these modules.",

It could be well applied to mobile manipulation in nonroutine task automation. The main objective of the mobile manipulation is to obtain versatile and efficient manipulation by the arms. In this respect the legs are required to assist the arms obtaining their high manipulability by changing step length and timing of step motion. Accordingly, the required motion of the legs in mobile manipulation is different from conventional biped locomotion. From this point of view, the relationship between manipulability of the arm and various leg motions is analyzed and evaluated by computer simulations.",

We propose the use of electro-magnetic levitation in order to integrate a mobility into the microgravity rover. The rover has a spherical shape and a smaller spherical shell inside. Four electromagnets are symmetrically located between the outer sphere surface and the inner sphere shell with one end of each directed to the center of the shell. With electromagnetic force of the magnets, a sphere iron ball inside the shell is controlled and levitated. When the rover lifts the ball inside with the electro-magnetic force, the rover is in return pressed down the ground by the reaction force, due to which the rover system not only gains upward momentum for floatation, but also obtains friction that enables its rolling on the ground. The prototype microgravity rover was developed and experimental results indicate effectiveness of the proposed mobility.",

In this work, we propose a closed-form internal impact model applicable to general classes of robotic mechanisms. The characteristics of the internal impulse are analyzed through simulation for serial-chain, closed-chain, and hybrid-chain systems. It is shown that the external impulse is distributed to the internal impulses of the various structures and that configurations best for external impulses might not be best for internal impulses.",

The nearness diagram method (ND) performs a high level information extraction and interpretation of the environment. Subsequently, this information is used to generate the motion commands. The proposed approach is well-suited to deal with unknown, unstructured and dynamic environments, where problems of other approaches are avoided. Some experimental results are shown using an holonomic mobile base to demonstrate the usefulness of the method.",

The dynamics of the mobile manipulator is assumed to be unknown and is to be identified by the NN online estimators. No preliminary learning stage of NN weight matrices is required. The controller is capable of disturbance-rejection in the presence of unknown bounded disturbances. Closed-loop stability of the control system and convergence of the NN learning processes are both guaranteed. Experimental tests on a two-DOE manipulator arm illustrate that the proposed control is significantly better than conventional robust control.",

        "abstract": "Research has focused on developing control strategies that allow to work with imprecisely calibrated or even uncalibrated robot systems. A popular approach is to close the control loop with visual feedback (visual servoing), even though this requires continuous, high rate image processing. In contrast, we developed a strategy that can compensate calibration errors by integrating sparse visual feedback asynchronously. This strategy was motivated by neuroscientific studies which show that human grasping definitely requires only sparse asynchronous visual feedback, even with disturbed visual input. We analyze the performance of our control strategy on a robotic hand-eye system consisting of a 6 d.o.f. manipulator and a pan-tilt head with a stereo camera system. To analyze thoroughly which calibration errors can be compensated by sparse feedback, we furthermore built a complete simulation model of the real hand-eye system, including the vision modules. Taken together, experimental and simulation results show that calibration errors can be compensated with a very moderate amount of (asynchronous) visual feedback. Thus, the proposed control strategy can indeed be seen as a serious alternative to visual servoing for real robotics applications. This shows that robotics can profit from taking a closer look at the results of neuroscience.",

In order to reach short cycle times, grasp planning must make the best of the image information acquired all at once, which comprises more or less visual occlusions and thus unknown regions. For time reasons, it is not acceptable to inspect in further steps all unknown regions by means of local sensing before grasp planning. We present a grasp planning system, which determines explicitly the fractions of grasp operations in known and unknown regions. Using that crucial information, a planning system may not request a tool change, but prefer a grasping operation with the mounted gripper, which moves mostly in known and free regions. Then, only a small part has to be executed slowly using local sensing with, for examples, proximity or force torque sensors.",

The camera-head is mounted on a mobile robot and freely moves in a 3D space. We aim at visual feedback to correct the estimation error of its position and pose obtained from dead reckoning. Since the nuclear power plant where the robot moves about consists of many pipes without particular marks, most of features in the observed images are occluding edges of the pipes. For robustly finding 3D-2D point correspondences on the occluding edges, two-type predicted images which are calculated from the 3D environmental model by a view simulator are used as follows: 1) 3D model points which correspond to the observed occluding edges are quickly obtained from the predicted depth image; 2) The predicted intensity image is used to select only the 3D model points which are expected to appear clearly in the observed image. As a result, point correspondences between the observed image and the 3D model can be robustly found even in complicated scenes. Preliminary experiments using an actual plant mock-up have shown that the method is promising.",

        "abstract": "Robotics can serve as a testbed for cognitive theories. One behavioral criterion for comparing theories is the extent to which their implementations can learn to exploit new environmental opportunities. Furthermore, a robotics testbed forces researchers to confront fundamental issues concerning how internal representations are grounded in activity. In our approach, a mobile robot takes the role of a creature that must survive in an unknown environment. The robot has no a priori knowledge about what constitutes a suitable goal, what is edible, inedible, or dangerous, or even its shape or how its body works. Nevertheless, the robot learns how to survive. The robot does this by tracking segmented regions of its camera image while moving. The robot projects these regions into a canonical wavelet domain that highlights color and intensity changes at various scales. This reveals sensory invariance that is readily extracted with Bayesian statistics. The robot simultaneously learns an adaptable sensorimotor mapping by recording how motor signals transform the locations of regions on its camera image. The robot learns about its own physical extension when it touches an object, but it also undergoes an internal state change analogous to the thirst quenching or nausea producing effects of intake in animals. This allows the robot to learn what an object affords: is it edible or poisonous, by relating these effects to learned clusters of invariance. In this way primitive symbols emerge. These proto-symbols provide the robot with goals that it can achieve by using its sensorimotor mapping to navigate, for example, toward food and away from danger.",

        "abstract": "Making a quadrupedal robotic machine walk is a problem with an infinity of solutions. Nevertheless, this question seems to have been solved successfully by mammals. Hence a particular approach in the design of walking robots has been considered, based on the animals movement characteristics. Indeed, studying animal walking can help produce a class of solutions towards the definition of quadrupedal robots. From this starting point, a model can be created according to a reduced number of criteria, notably the shape of the trajectory followed by the ankle or wrist during motion relatively to the hip or to the shoulder respectively. The problem lies in the difficulty to extract significant and valuable information from the mere observation of animals walking. This paper presents an experiment designed to extract angular variations data from the observation of a walking hedgehog and the use of these data to create a 2D dynamical simulation model to be used as an analysis basis.",

The AP analysis consists of two steps: at the first step, it broadly observes human task, constructs rough human task model and finds APs which require detailed analysis; and at the second step, by applying time-consuming analysis on APs in the same human task, it can enhance the human task model. This human task model is highly abstracted and is able to change the degree of abstraction adapting to the environment so as to be applicable in a different environment. We describe this method and its implementation using data gloves and a stereo vision system. We also show an experimental result in which a real robot observed a human task and performed the same human task successfully in a different environment using this model.",

This paper presents a novel approach for solving the regrasp problem. The approach consists of a preprocessing and planning stages. Preprocessing, which is done only once for a given robot, generates a look-up table which has information of kinematically feasible task space of end-effector through all the workspace. Then, using the table, planning automatically determines possible intermediate location, pose and regrasp sequence leading from the pick-up to put-down grasp. Experiments show that the approach presented is complete in the total workspace. The regrasp planner was combined with the existing path.",

We term such an n-holon colony where intelligent agents can self-localize in the reconfiguration task space without their individual tasks within the colony configuration being assigned by a central controller, an n-holony. The proposed method is based on a cascaded computation scheme for the self-reconfiguration of the n-holony: self-localization followed by self-organization. The holon communicates with its neighbours in order to acquire knowledge about the colony configuration within a neighbourhood of radius d based on configuration invariants namely the eigenstructures. Self-organization uses this knowledge to take the next action for achieving the desired holony configuration.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For mobile robots employing reactive behaviors, allocation of physical sensors to satisfy sensing needs should be dynamic and fast. It is becoming increasingly apparent that this allocation should also support behavioral sensor fusion, as indicated by experimental data, in order to maximize the use of available sensing hardware and to increase the quality of sensing. These issues are addressed in the context of the min-conflict with happiness algorithm for dynamic sensor allocation, whose execution rates on two real robots ranged from 11 to 17 milliseconds. Experimental results are shown which illustrate the improvements (27.5%-75% of observations) achieved using sensor fusion. The paper also contributes a quantitative representation of sensing quality using t-norms, allowing fused sensors to be compared with single sensors for a behavior.",

(1999) because: our algorithm is developed in similarity space rather than in camera centred coordinate frame; our algorithm is directly based on a fourth order polynomial rather than on an eighth order polynomial resulting in an easier and more efficient implementation; and finally our algorithm is a unified linear algorithm for structural estimation. The algorithm has been extensively validated by experimentation using both synthetic and real images and compared with a classical linear algorithm and an algorithm based on epipolar geometry. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is generally accurate, robust, and efficient for the calibration of all parameters of interest.",

        "abstract": "An economic automatic system for spray painting of a general three dimensional surface is described. The spray gun is mounted on the wrist of a six degree of freedom (6 DOF) industrial robot. The system functions by the method of camera space manipulation, using two CCD cameras to scan the surface dimensions off-line, and store them in a supervisory computer in the form of nodes. An inverse kinematic program is developed and stored in the computer to calculate the trajectories of the six joints corresponding to the nodes on the surface, to acquire the correct position and orientation of the spray nozzle. The values of the joint angles are fed to the controllers of the joint motors every time interval, depending on the number of nodes and the required spray painting rate. Sensors inform the computer of the presence of the surface as well as of the home position and end of trajectory. The computer also receives sensory data from the motor controllers as spray painting of the workpiece is accomplished. The position and velocity trajectories of two surfaces with different geometries (rectangular and hemispherical) are calculated using the proposed algorithm, and plotted for each of the six joints angles.",

        "abstract": "According to recent theories of sensorimotor development in biological systems, the dynamics of physical interaction with the world encodes control knowledge. Control is derived by reinforcing and learning to predict constructive patterns of interaction, and behavior is an artifact of coupled dynamical systems with a number of controllable degrees of freedom. For grasping and manipulation, we propose a closed-loop control process that is parametric in the number and identity of contact resources. In this paper, we show how control decisions can be made by estimating patterns of membership in a family of prototypical dynamic models. A grasp controller can thus be tuned continuously online to optimize performance over a variety of object geometries. This same process can be used to estimate the haptic category in which the object resides. We illustrate how a grasping policy that is incrementally optimal for several objects can be acquired using our Salisbury hand with tactile sensor feedback.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, task space control for the whole arm of a serial-chain manipulator is considered. The task space for the whole arm is interpreted in two ways, the space of rolled shapes or bunches of ordered n-frames. A rolled shape is a set of restricted points with rolling angles of links, and gives us intuitive viewpoint of the space. To represent the rolls of links, the concept of the canonical manipulator is introduced. A bunch of n-frames is a collection of frames each of which corresponds to the link orientation of the chain, and allows us to handle the space easily. A rolled spatial curve, which has a roll distribution over the curve, is used for specifying a desired rolled shape of the chain. A method generating the bunch of desired n-frames from a desired rolled curve is proposed. Based on the method, we derive a regulation law in the task space for the whole arm by Lyapunov design. The derived control law is very simple; recursive with respect to the link/joint number, and calculated by geometric operations in three-dimensional Euclidean space.",

We demonstrate how the computational task of the collective can be formulated as a global energy minimization task over the entire collective, and show how individual members of the collective can solve the task in a distributed fashion so that the entire collective meets its goal. This result is then extended to consider unbounded communication delays between members and complete failure of individual members of the collective.",

This paper focuses on the reconfiguration control of the colony that we structure as a sequence of planar grasp operations defining a holonic regrasp, which uses a graph theoretic formalization of configuration changes that occur in this holonic hand during this regrasping phase.",

We define the term \"embodiment\" as the size and shape of the agent's body, locomotive ability and its sensor. According to embodiment, an object is represented by reaching action paths, which correspond to a set of sequences of movements taken by the agent for reaching the object. Visual information is used to obtain sensorimotor mapping which represents the relationship between the change of object's appearance and the movement of the agent. On the other hands, tactile information is utilized to evaluate the change of physical condition of the object caused by such movement. By means of this method, the agent can recognize an object without depending on its position and orientation in the environment. The experimental result of computer simulation is shown to validate the method.",

The proposed simulator applies the emotional algorithm to determine the performance of each traffic signal individually and to avoid the traffic jam around it. The emotional algorithm estimates the emotional value based on the emotional functions, which are defined on the emotional space. The emotional space consists of four factors, \"happy\" \"relief,\" \"afraid\" and \"angry,\" and provides the emotional states of the system by the value of it. The emotional function evaluates and imitates the state of driver's mind, and aims at not inflicting psychological stress on the driver. This report proposes the principal architecture of the emotional algorithm and some simulators to use it to decide its performance of the traffic signal system. The numerical simulations clear the effectiveness of the proposed emotional algorithm and the applied system. The learning simulator, of which parameters dynamically change by evaluating the congestion of a road, especially shows the excellent performance. Date environment analysis is a good learning method to optimize the parameters in the emotional algorithm by simulation results.",

The problem of operating and transferring the object from a given start point to a given goal point is considered. In this case, in general, degrees of freedom of the manipulators are larger than that of the object, and thus this manipulator system involves redundancy. Several joints can be changed to passive ones. We use remaining redundant degrees of freedom to refine trajectories. We apply this algorithm to a two-manipulators system.

The robot detects this repetitive pattern as an intentional gesture by which the user wants to give it some order. Then it shows a little action according to the meaning of the gesture that the robot guesses. It observes the user's reaction to its action. If he/she continues the same pattern gesture, the robot considers that its understanding is right, completing the action. It also registers the pattern as a gesture of the guessed meaning. Otherwise, it iterates the same procedure by taking another action as a candidate of the meaning. We have implemented such interactive capability on our intelligent wheelchair.",

The big advantage of this motor is that it can be driven by such low pressure as tap water with high performance. The key of their mechanism is that the working fluid is completely wrapped by the soft tube and their machine moving parts contact the fluid indirectly. In other words, the deformation of the tube drives the motor, and reversely the valve makes the tube deformed to control the motor, which removes the risk of leakage without also requiring a seal. In addition, the valve to control the rotational speed is designed which can be driven by fluid power signal without using electricity. The motors can be used in places where electricity cannot be used safely, such as bathroom, sink, workshop over water, under water, etc. The basic driving principle and characteristics of the theoretical torque, the rotational speed, and the efficiency are described here with the results of the experiment.",

Based on a similar idea, we have proposed a view-based navigation method using a model of the route called the \"view sequence.\" It contains a sequence of frontal views along a route memorized in the teaching run, and the recognition of the environment is realized based on the matching of the current view and memorized view sequence. In this paper, we discuss the required characteristics of the view for the view sequence, and evaluate our former method of generating views. Then we confirm that the stereo disparity satisfies the requirement of the view sequence through an experiment, and the disparity view sequence is applied for outdoor navigation. The experimental results indicate such views other than normal camera images can be utilized for our view-based navigation method.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Automation of welding process in shipyard is ultimately necessary, since welding site is spatially enclosed by floors and girders, and therefore welding operators are exposed to hostile working conditions. To solve this problem, recently a robotic welding system for closed block assembly has been developed. For complete autonomy, this system needs a sensor system for the weld seam tracking and the recognition of the working environments. In this paper, a three-dimensional laser vision system is developed based on the optical triangulation technology in order to provide robots with work environmental map. This sensor system composed of three laser stripes and two visions is used to detect the welding positions and to recognize the 3D shape of the welding environments. The algorithm architecture for the welding environment recognition is divided into two parts. The first is the conventional 3D scanning module, and the second the plane generation module utilizing a Hough transform. The design of the sensor system and the algorithm for sensing the structured environment are described and discussed in detail.",
