        "abstract": "Optical depth cameras, including both time-of-flight and structured-light sensors, have led to dramatic improvements in robot sensing and perception. We propose the use of millimeter-wave (mmW) radar as an important complement to optical sensors. While the millimeter wavelengths of radar sensors do not support as high resolution as the nanometer wavelength of optical sensors, the ability of mmW signals to penetrate smoky and foggy environments as well as see through many opaque objects makes them a compelling sensor for navigation as well as manipulation in challenging environments. We present a series of 2D and 3D mmW images made with a hand-held antenna grasped by a PR2 robot. The radar image sensor uses a mechanical \u201cpainting\u201d motion to acquire multiple views of the target object over the 15 \u2013 26.5 GHz K-band. A GPU-based reconstruction algorithm synthesizes 2D and 3D images of the target object. We demonstrate a ground range resolution of 13.6 mm and a cross-range resolution of 7.1 mm for objects up to 0.5 m away from the robot. We further demonstrate imaging objects through fog, as well as through opaque paper.",

        "abstract": "Single port surgery is an innovative approach in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Although several telemanipulators exist to perform operations through only a single incision they all suffer from the lack of haptic feedback. To generate kinesthetic feedback the intracorporeal forces need to be measured, which is a challenging task. To overcome these limitations we investigate in this paper the force sensing capability of a new single port robot that has two parallelkinematic manipulators. Because of the rigidity and excellent controllability the tip force is measured using proximally arranged force sensors. To minimize friction effects a longitudinal vibration of 6 Hz with an amplitude of 20 \u00b5m is applied to the manipulator while the tip force is varied in the three main coordinate axes. Within the analysis 32320 values are investigated showing that a vibration has a significant impact and dramatically improves the signal quality by minimizing the crosstalk by a factor of up to 12.7 enabling to measure the tip force exactly.",

During the task, using proximity servoing, the sensors are aligned parallel to the surface and kept at a target distance. In addition, due to the spatial resolution, it's possible to estimate the surface's curvature in two dimensions along the rows and columns of the array. We show how a compound movement can be derived from both curvatures that pre-aligns the end-effector in each step, yielding a predictive component for the control scheme. We evaluate our approach with different geometries and show that the curvature information produces smooth contour following paths. We show that the system can handle speeds up to 150mms\u22121.",

Particularly, for multi-floor operations, the robot must robustly detect and localize stairs to allow for safe climbing. In this paper, we develop a graph-based stairway detection method for point cloud data, that can detect a large variety of stairways. Our approach first segments planar regions and extracts the stair tread- and stair riser-shaped segments. With these segments, a dynamic graph model is initialized that is used to detect stairs including the railing system in the surroundings. We show that our system can accurately detect and localize different stairways from a variety of different positions, including descending stairs. Our system's accuracy is higher than those of most state-of-the-art stairway detection methods even in case of sparse point cloud data.",

Given the lack of sufficiently realistic training devices available for future physicians, we propose a new haptic simulator which reproduces the haptic sensations felt by anaesthesiologists when performing this kind of operation. The originality of this simulator is the coupling of a Geomagic Touch\u00ae device with a pneumatic cylinder to reproduce the \u201cLoss of Resistance\u201d phenomenon which helps the physician to control the needle depth. In this paper, we introduce the parametric 3D model of the region of interest and the control laws used jointly. Even though this device could not reproduce the right level of forces required in this type of anaesthesia, an anaesthesiologist involved in the project gave positive feedback about its haptic tissue rendering.",

        "abstract": "A `region' is an important concept in interpreting 3D point cloud data since regions may correspond to objects in a scene. To correctly interpret 3D point cloud data, we need to partition the dataset into regions that correspond to objects or parts of an object. In this paper, we present a region growing approach that combines global (topological) and local (color, surface normal) information to segment 3D point cloud data. Using ideas from persistent homology theory, our algorithm grows a simplicial complex representation of the point cloud dataset. At each step in the growth process we compute the zeroth homology group of the complex, which corresponds to the number of connected components, and use color and surface normal statistics to build regions. Lastly, we extract out the segmented regions of the dataset. We show that this method provides a stable segmentation of point cloud data in the presence of noise and poorly sampled data, thus providing advantages over contemporary region-based segmentation techniques.",

This wrist is a high-dexterity miniature robot, able to provide simultaneously the grasping/cutting (1-DoF) and rotations capabilities with 3-DoF. The grasping function is insured by the folding of the top platform of a parallel structure. The grasping capability of the wrist is part of the mechanical structure itself and can be fully controlled by external actuators. In order to validate this original approach, an experimental prototype has been fabricated using 3D printing technology at a larger scale. The inverse kinematic model has been developed and the workspace analysis was accomplished to assess the capabilities of the realized system. Finally, experimental tests have been also carried out for validating the proposed structure.",

        "abstract": "Robots could benefit from maps that represent haptic properties of their surroundings. By touching locations with tactile sensors, robots can infer haptic properties of their surroundings, but touching all locations would be prohibitive. We present an algorithm that uses touch and vision to efficiently produce a dense haptic map. Our approach assumes that surfaces near a robot that are visually similar are more likely to have similar haptic properties. Given an image and sparse haptic labels, our algorithm uses a dense conditional random field (CRF) to produce a haptic map with labels for all image pixels. In an evaluation using images with idealized haptic labels, our algorithm substantially outperformed a previous algorithm. It also enabled a real robot to label leaves and trunks after reaching into artificial foliage. In addition, we show that our algorithm can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for material recognition from Bell et al. [1] that we modified and fine-tuned. This CNN provides estimated probabilities for haptic labels using vision alone, which enables the algorithm to infer haptic labels before the robot makes contact with anything. In our evaluation, using this CNN further improved performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper tackles the inverse problem of finding optimal configurations of magnetic gradient sources in Dipole Field Navigation (DFN), a magnetic navigation method proposed recently for the direct targeting of drugs. In DFN, a limited number of these gradient sources, called the cores, must be positioned properly around a patient in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner to induce the required directional forces on the navigated therapeutic carriers. To overcome some limitations of the previous approach for solving this problem, here we propose a novel and conceptually simple multidimensional variant of the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This variant, called Progressive Multidimensional PSO (PMD-PSO), enables a tradeoff between the quality and the complexity of the solutions by progressively increasing the number of dimensions in the search space. We apply this algorithm to the core placement problem using an improved fitness function for the evaluation of a core configuration given a vascular path towards a target. Experiments on simulated vasculatures show that, while the approach can effectively solve this inverse problem, PMD-PSO exhibits better performances for DFN compared with two other multidimensional PSO variants.",

        "abstract": "Conventional ultrasonic drills can drill into rocks using high frequency axial vibration, which feature lower power and lower preload force, thus they could become a very attractive solution for future deep-space exploration. However, drill cuttings cannot be removed effectively with the increase of drilling depth by conventional ultrasonic drills that only driven by longitudinal vibration. To address this issue, a Rotary-Percussive Ultrasonic Drill (RPUD) is proposed, which employs one single PZT transducer to generate rotary-percussive motion for rock fracturing. RPUD is composed of a PZT transducer, a percussive unit, a rotary unit, and a drill tool. The percussive unit enlarges the longitudinal vibration of front part of PZT transducer, and provides a reciprocating percussion to the drill tool. The rotary unit transforms longitudinal vibration of rear part of PZT transducer into longitudinal-torsional vibration to drive the drill tool to rotate continuously. The rotary and percussive motions are independent of each other, and can be adjusted separately. To make the rotary and percussive motions move synchronously, finite element method is employed to tune the resonance frequencies of the rotary unit and percussive unit to be close by transient analysis. Experimental results show that RPUD can improve removal efficiency of the drill cuttings due to its rotary motion, compared with conventional ultrasonic drills.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The foraging problem, which evolved from ants finding food and delivering them to the nest, is for a swarm of robots to transport objects from a source to a destination. To avoid collision of robots or congestions, object transportation is generally conducted in a pipelining manner. Existing solutions towards the foraging problem either have performance problems or cannot tolerate failures. We present a self-stabilizing solution for the swarm robotic system to form a pipeline structure to transport objects and achieve the foraging task. In this paper, we first define the stable state for the swarm, which includes two requirements: (1) the robots operate in non-overlapping regions, i.e., transport objects in a pipeline structure and (2) the transportation rate of the system is optimal. Then, we introduce our self-stabilizing algorithm for the foraging problem and prove its convergence and the correctness of its convergence properties. Due to the self-stabilization nature, our solution is decentralized and fault tolerant. The swarm can achieve the foraging task as long as there is at least one working robot. Due to the definition of the stable state, our swarm system, when converged, can achieve optimal performance. We conduct simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and the experimental results show that from any state, our algorithm can converge very quickly to reach the stable state and provide optimal performance for object transportation.",

        "abstract": "Most traditional robotic mechanisms feature inelastic joints that are unable to robustly handle large deformations and off-axis moments. As a result, the applied loads are transferred rigidly throughout the entire structure. The disadvantage of this approach is that the exerted leverage is magnified at each subsequent joint possibly damaging the mechanism. In this paper, we present two lightweight, elastic, bio-inspired tensegrity robotic arms adapted from prior static models which mitigate this danger while improving their mechanism's functionality. Our solutions feature modular tensegrity structures that function similarly to the human elbow and the human shoulder when connected. Like their biological counterparts, the proposed robotic joints are flexible and comply with unanticipated forces. Both proposed structures have multiple passive degrees of freedom and four active degrees of freedom (two from the shoulder and two from the elbow). The structural advantages demonstrated by the joints in these manipulators illustrate a solution to the fundamental issue of elegantly handling off-axis compliance. Additionally, this initial experiment illustrates that moving tensegrity arms must be designed with large reachable and dexterous workspaces in mind, a change from prior tensegrity arms which were only static. These initial experiments should be viewed as an exploration into the design space of active tensegrity structures, particularly those inspired by biological joints and limbs.",

Few authors contributed to the problematic of safety in pure linear motion, i.e. prismatic joint. The contribution of this work is to present a new design capable of achieving, passively, a nonlinear elastic behavior for prismatic joint implementation, the so-called Prismatic Compliant Joint (PCJ). This new device is based on a six-bar mechanism equipped with a linear spring. Hence, this structure generates the desired nonlinear stiffness behavior under a specified external force. The elastic characteristic will comply with force safety criteria of physical Human/Robot interaction (pHRI); a Hunt-Crossley model based one. In order to fit the PCJ response curve to the established safety measures, an optimization based on genetic algorithm method tunes PCJ intrinsic parameters subject to the chosen constraints.",

        "abstract": "Recently, robotics has been seen as a key solution to improve the quality of life of amputees. In order to create smarter robotic prosthetic devices to be used in an everyday context, one must be able to interface them seamlessly with the end-user in an inexpensive, yet reliable way. In this paper, we are looking at guiding a robotic device by detecting gestures through measurement of the electrical activity of muscles captured by surface electromyography (sEMG). Reliable sEMG-based gesture classifiers for end-users are challenging to design, as they must be extremely robust to signal drift, muscle fatigue and small electrode displacement without the need for constant recalibration. In spite of extensive research, sophisticated sEMG classifiers for prostheses guidance are not yet widely used, as systems often fail to solve these issues simultaneously. We propose to address these problems by employing Convolutional Neural Networks. Specifically as a first step, we demonstrate their viability to the problem of gesture recognition for a low-cost, low-sampling rate (200Hz) consumer-grade, 8-channel, dry electrodes sEMG device called Myo armband (Thalmic Labs) on able-bodied subjects. To this effect, we assessed the robustness of this machine learning oriented approach by classifying a combination of 7 hand/wrist gestures with an accuracy of \u223c97.9% in real-time, over a period of 6 consecutive days with no recalibration. In addition, we used the classifier (in conjunction with orientation data) to guide a 6DoF robotic arm, using the armband with the same speed and precision as with a joystick. We also show that the classifier is able to generalize to different users by testing it on 18 participants.",

        "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance is the core problem for mobile robots. Its objective is to allow mobile robots to explore an unknown environment without colliding into other objects. It is the basis for various tasks, e.g. surveillance and rescue, etc. Previous approaches mainly focused on geometric models (such as constructing local cost-maps) which could be regarded as low-level intelligence without any cognitive process. Recently, deep learning has made great breakthroughs in computer vision, especially for recognition and cognitive tasks. It takes advantage of the hierarchical models inspired by human brain structures. However, it is a fact that deep learning, up till now, has seldom been used for controlling and decision making. Inspired by the advantages of deep learning, we take indoor obstacle avoidance as example to show the effectiveness of a hierarchical structure that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a decision process. It is a highly compact network structure that takes raw depth images as input, and generates control commands as network output, by which a model-less obstacle avoidance behavior is achieved. We test our approach in real-world indoor environments. The new findings and results are reported at the end of the paper.",

By using applied force to control the machining depth, conventional AFM machining approaches unable to machining a nanostructure with specified machined depth. With the proposed method, the vibration phase of micro-cantilever has a specific relationship with machining depth. Therefore, the nano-grooves with desired depth can be machined by using phase value as feedback of PID control. In this paper, the theoretical analysis and simulation are carried out, and the experiments of phase-closed-loop control method are conducted. The experimental results verify the primary feasibility of the proposed method. The present method also demonstrates the potential on the fabrication of three-dimension nanostructures and nanoelectronic device.",

        "abstract": "Weakly electric fish use self-established electric field to sense the underwater environment that may be cluttered and turbid. Previous works on building artificial counterparts are limited to simplest cases, as no analytical solutions exist under complex boundary conditions. Universal numerical approaches like Finite Element Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) suffer from lengthy meshing process and heavily computational burden. In this paper, discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is widely used in light scattering and absorption problems, was for the first time proposed to be applied for underwater electrosense. This approach is lightweight, flexible and computationally efficient compared with FEM. It was simulated in electric fields excited by parallel-plate electrodes and spherical electrodes of a simplified robotic model. A constrained unscented Kalman filter (CUKF) was further utilized to localize the position and identify the size of an invading cube. Results comparison with FEM indicate the differences of a cuboidal object in two orthogonal positions were 7.10% and 10.46% respectively, and the difference in size was 11.82%. These results were achieved at a cost of less than 1% of the computational effort of the FEM. The proposed approach proved effective from the simulation results and laid a solid foundation for real-time underwater active electrosense in a more general environment.",

We propose the distributed deterministic spiral algorithm (DDSA) which generalises a spiral search pattern to robot swarms. While being an effective search strategy in its own right, the DDSA is also a useful point of comparison for other swarm search strategies. Such a benchmark for robot swarm search is currently needed but missing. As a case study, we compare the DDSA to a biologically-inspired central-place foraging algorithm that uses stochastic search, memory, and communication to efficiently collect resources in a variety of different resource distributions.",

        "abstract": "Haptically enabled hands-on or tele-operated surgical robotic systems provide a unique opportunity to integrate pre- and intra-operative information into physical actions through active constraints (also known as virtual fixtures). In many surgical procedures, including cardiac interventions, where physiological motion complicates tissue manipulation, dynamic active constraints can improve the performance of the intervention in terms of safety and accuracy. The non-energy-storing class of dynamic guidance constraints attempt to assist the clinician in following a reference path, while guaranteeing that the control system will not generate undesired motion due to stored potential energy. An important aspect that has not received much attention from the researchers is that while these methods help increase the performance, they should by no means distract the user systematically. In this paper, a viscosity-based dynamic guidance constraint is introduced that continuously redirects the tool's motion towards the reference path. The proportionality and continuity of generated forces make the method less distracting and subjectively appealing. The performance is validated and compared with two existing non-energy-storing methods through extensive experimentation.",

        "abstract": "Robots are being increasingly used in safety-critical contexts, such as transportation and health. The need for flexible behavior in these contexts, due to human interaction factors or unstructured operating environments, led to a transition from hardware- to software-based safety mechanisms in robotic systems, whose reliability and quality is imperative to guarantee. Source code static analysis is a key component in formal software verification. It consists on inspecting code, often using automated tools, to determine a set of relevant properties that are known to influence the occurrence of defects in the final product. This paper presents HAROS, a generic, plug-in-driven, framework to evaluate code quality, through static analysis, in the context of the Robot Operating System (ROS), one of the most widely used robotic middleware. This tool (equipped with plug-ins for computing metrics and conformance to coding standards) was applied to several publicly available ROS repositories, whose results are also reported in the paper, thus providing a first overview of the internal quality of the software being developed in this community.",

        "abstract": "Solving the direct kinematics (DK) of parallel robots, i.e. finding all the possible poses of the platform for given input values, is most of the time a difficult problem. This is evidently true for cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR) that are more complex than classical parallel robot because of the unilateral nature of the cable actions but also if cable deformations are taken into account. Furthermore there are many different deformable cable models and developing a DK algorithm for each of them will be a tremendous task. Consequently using a numerical continuation scheme that starts from the DK solutions for non-deformable cables and then moves toward the solution for deformable cables appears to be an interesting approach. To use this scheme we have to assume that the cable model relies on physical parameters that have limit values for which the deformable cable acts like a non-deformable one. Under that assumption we are then able to derive a possible maximum of solutions for the DK, whatever is the cable model. We then apply this approach for a specific complex cable model, the catenary case, to show that this approach is computer efficient but requires to address difficult theoretical issues in order to obtain a solving algorithm that is guaranteed to determine all DK solutions.",

While adverse events occur rarely during training, they could be fatal to the patients if they happen during real surgical procedures and are not handled properly by the surgical team. In this work we propose a hardware-in-the-loop robotic surgery simulator with high fidelity of the robot motion in a simulated environment, which is capable of reproducing adverse events during surgery. The proposed simulator is built upon the Raven-II open source surgical robot, integrated with a simulated surgeon console and a safety hazard injection engine, which automatically injects faults into modules of the robot control software. We simulate representative safety hazards seen in the adverse events, related to da Vinci\u2122 robot, reported to the FDA MAUDE database. A novel haptic feedback strategy is provided to the operator when the underlying dynamics differ from the real robot states.",

Previous work that focused on drawing an image on a canvas accurately has not contained artistic processes like performance, drawing skills and other artists' intents at the time of creation. To combine such artistic processes, the work in this paper utilizes whole-body motion of a humanoid to paint an image on a wall using Pointillism. However, a biped humanoid consists of high Degree Of Freedom (DOF) system and is very sensitive to internal and external disturbances from interaction with environments. As is the case when graffitiing on a wall. Most notably, the vibration from impact contacts and mechanical uncertainties limit the humanoid in graffitiing properly. This paper presents an approach to realize drawing a large image on a wall through real-time motion planning for printing, artificial compliance, and a disturbance controller.",

The mobile manipulator is composed by a mobile platform and a 5 dof arm, and the proposed control scheme allows the simultaneous control of both the devices by means of a single haptic device characterized by an open kinematic chain and not specifically designed for mobile manipulators teleoperation (e.g. a Phantom Omni). The proposed teleoperation controller overcomes the mismatch of the control signals to be sent to the arm (position) and to the mobile platform (velocity) through a proper partition of the master device workspace. Tests have been performed both by simulation and with a real setup. The setup is composed by a 6 dof Phantom Omni haptic device acting as master, and a single-arm Kuka youBot omnidirectional manipulator acting as slave. Experimental results related to a pick and place task, performed on the real setup and involving the motion of both the arm and the platform are reported and commented.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel algorithm to control wheels of a rover in rough terrains with keeping traction and minimizing energy consumption on the basis of observing a change of a robot velocity from a 4WD Kinematic model. Proposed kinematic-based rough terrain control (KRTC) can satisfy a rover to meet an integrated performance of following a desired velocity while keeping maximum traction and minimizing energy use without an estimator of wheel sinkage and an observer of a dynamic parameter. KRTC consists of two main parts; a slip optimizer and a slip controller. For slip optimization, optimal slip values regarding maximum traction and tractive efficiency are derived from indoor experimental data during a wheel-terrain interaction. Optimized slip ratio is used as an input of a PID slip controller. KRTC only uses the desired velocity of the robot as an input value and gets the two feedback data of actual slip and actual velocity of each wheel. For verification, KRTC was applied to a 4WD rover and the performance was analyzed based on acquired experimental data on a variety of rough terrains.",

The handful of social robots designed to facilitate such activities are currently only able to implement a priori known recreational activities that have been pre-programmed by human experts. Once deployed in their intended facility, these robots are not able to learn new activities from non-expert humans. In this paper, we present the development of a novel learning from demonstration (LfD) system architecture for a social robot in order for it to learn from non-expert teachers the structure of an activity and monitor the execution of the new activity. In order to obtain user compliance, personalized persuasive strategies are also learned by the robot to use while implementing the activity during human-robot interactions (HRI) with the intended users. The architecture has been integrated into our socially assistive robot Tangy to learn the group-based activity Bingo. System performance experiments were conducted with Tangy to first learn to facilitate Bingo from non-expert teachers and then use the learned activity to physically facilitate Bingo with multiple users. The results showed Tangy was able to effectively and efficiently learn the new Bingo activity structure as well as personalize its persuasive strategies to individual users in order to obtain activity compliance.",

However, the use of traditional IGBs requires complex insertion tools and flexible endoscopes to place and remove the balloon inside patient's stomach. This causes abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and gastric mucous damage. To overcome these limitations, we designed a novel magnetic soft capsule robot for obesity treatment with magnetically actuated inflatable IGB. The balloon is made from a thin, flexible, biocompatible material, and is inflated to a desired volume using biocompatible effervescent chemicals. Instead of using complex deflation mechanism, a biodegradable material is developed to automatically deflate the balloon after a predetermined period of treatment. In addition, multiple capsules can be simultaneously swallowed. As the source of actuation is provided via external magnetic fields, the magnetic soft capsule size can be significantly reduced with no limitations on the power consumption. A prototype of magnetic soft capsule is developed. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Most material recognition approaches use vibration signals from a tactile exploration, typically above one second long, to identify the material. This work proposes a tactile multi-modal (vibration and thermal) material identification approach based on recursive Bayesian estimation. Through the frequency response of the vibration induced by the material and thermal features, like an estimate of the thermal power loss of the finger, we show that it is possible to identify materials in less than half a second. Moreover, a comparison between vibration only and multi-modal identification shows that both recognition time and classification errors are reduced by adding thermal information.",

Since such objects are deformable and have non-Lambertian surfaces, it is difficult to apply conventional feature point approaches or edge based template matching. To solve this problem, we propose a new method which is called \u201cKCS (kernel convolution score)\u201d. It measures the total score of convolution between local image and multiple kernels which are generated according to the characteristics of the target object. The local image having maximum score is considered as the most promising object for picking. In the last part of this paper, the limitation of existing edge and template matching in the given problem is discussed with the experimental results. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method could localize the object which is appropriate for picking up with 91.67% success rate.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel variable stiffness joint (VSJ) mechanism that achieves the desired stiffness by using elastic deformation of silicone rubber cushions (SRCs). This mechanism can absorb the forces from multiple direction by the flexibility of SRCs and guarantee high safety. To react adequately against unpredictable collision or to manipulate an unstable object skillfully, a joint should be designed to have a stiffness adjustment capability in a short time. The proposed mechanism adjusts stiffness by controlling the position of an elliptical cam that pushes or pulls the support wall of the SRCs to surround them. The elastic deformation of the SRCs can be restricted according to the degree of the surrounded region of the SRCs. As a result, we can control the joint stiffness easily. Furthermore, the rotation of the cam from 0 deg. to 90 deg. accomodates the entire range of stiffness;, as a result, we can expect a fast adjustment of the stiffness. In this paper, we describe in detail the mechanism and the theoretical model for the stiffness adjustment. Moreover fundamental performances on the stiffness range, adjustment speed, and movability of the joint are shown through several experiments, and the problems in actual use are discussed.",

The advantages of using this sensing principle are the low manufacturing costs, the simple fabrication, and the immunity to electrical noise. The force/ torque sensor makes use of six optical sensors: each sensor measures the displacement of a reflective surface that moves integrally with a simply-supported beam. The proposed mechanical structure allows for a variety of shapes on the mechanical structure to be easily adaptable to many robot applications. In this paper, we present a five-axis force/torque sensor based on this optoelectronic principle. To measure force/torque components, two identical three-DoF force/torque sensor structures (comprised of three beams) are mounted on top of each other. Photo sensors and mirrors are fixed inside the structure to measure the six beam deflections. In this paper, we describe the sensor structure, design, fabrication, calibration, and verify our sensor development methodology.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic-assisted catheter insertion is becoming increasingly popular due to its potential applications including cardiac catheterization. Typically, catheters are tracked during insertion procedures to verify the location of the tip relative to anatomy or features of interest. To this end, many catheter tracking systems have been proposed in the literature. Current approaches such as visual servoing are computationally intensive and sometimes require harmful ionizing radiation (X-rays) for tip localization. Conversely, other approaches use 3D ultrasound probes which can be prohibitively expensive. In contrast, we propose an ultrasound-enabled robotic catheter tracking system that uses a 2D ultrasound probe and an active piezoelectric element to track the tip of a catheter. This approach has the potential to guide catheters from initial insertion, in a vein of the groin, to final placement at a target area inside of the heart. During the tracking process, no information from the ultrasound image is necessary; however, this information can be used to help clinicians guide the catheter or to perform diagnostic procedures. In this paper, we outline this procedure by first discussing the individual components of the system and then by describing our methodology for tracking the catheter tip. Next, we simulate the system in ROS to test its effectiveness, and finally we experimentally verify that a robotic arm equipped with a 2D ultrasound probe can track a catheter in a multi-vein phantom. Furthermore, the data collected during tracking can be used to virtually reconstruct the 3D structure of veins while tracking.",

        "abstract": "In highly dynamic tasks that involve moving targets, planning is necessary to figure out when, where and how to intercept the target. In robotic table tennis in particular, motion planning can be very challenging due to time constraints, dimension of the search space and modelling uncertainties. To simplify the problem, conventional planning algorithms often rely on a fixed virtual hitting plane to construct robot striking trajectories. These algorithms however generate restrictive strokes and can result in unnatural strategies when compared with human playing. In this paper, we introduce a new trajectory generation framework for robotic table tennis. We use a free-time optimal control approach to construct a novel planning algorithm that does not involve a fixed hitting plane. Furthermore, we estimate the parameters of our prediction models using human demonstrations. The resulting trajectories have lower accelerations while the joint constraints are enforced at all times. Our algorithm returns the balls with a higher probability to the opponent's court in our realistic simulation environment when compared with a virtual hitting plane based method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control design method with a new nonlinear disturbance observer using delayed estimates for motion control of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). In recent years, application of an underwater vehicle has been expected in various fields. Since modeling unknown hydrodynamic forces is difficult, nonlinear disturbance observers have been proposed in the aim of decreasing disturbances due to hydrodynamic forces. In this paper, we propose a new disturbance observer by combining a conventional disturbance observer and time delay control, and attempt to apply it to motion control of a UVMS. Further, an analysis of ultimate boundedness and numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed control system. The respective analysis and simulation results show that the proposed disturbance observer exhibits faster convergence and less estimation errors than the conventional one and hence the control system based on it can perform successful motion control.",

        "abstract": "We relax parametric inference to a nonparametric representation towards more general solutions on factor graphs. We use the Bayes tree factorization to maximally exploit structure in the joint posterior thereby minimizing computation. We use kernel density estimation to represent a wider class of constraint beliefs, which naturally encapsulates multi-hypothesis and non-Gaussian inference. A variety of new uncertainty models can now be directly applied in the factor graph, and have the solver recover a potentially multi-modal posterior. For example, data association for loop closure proposals can be incorporated at inference time without further modifications to the factor graph. Our implementation of the presented algorithm is written entirely in the Julia language, exploiting high performance parallel computing. We show a larger scale use case with the well known Victoria park mapping and localization data set inferring over uncertain loop closures.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) allows physicians to examine the entire digestive system without any surgical operation. Although it provides a noninvasive imaging approach to access the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the biggest drawback of this technology is the large numbers of images need to be diagnosed. In this paper, a global and local saliency coding (GLSAC) method is proposed to detect polyps from WCE images. We first extract the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features from image patches and apply K-means method on these features to obtain visual words. Since saliency is a fundamental characteristic of feature coding, a novel coding strategy: the global and local saliency coding (GLSAC) is proposed. The calculation of the global saliency coding and local saliency coding is obtained by the exponential function of feature differences to the nearest visual code and all visual words. Specifically, the local saliency strategy considers coding bases based on the distribution of the distances between the features and visual words adaptively. Furthermore, we present a concentric circle-based spatial-rotation-invariant pooling strategy to obtain final image features from the patch features. Experiment results achieve promising 91.13% accuracy and 92.51% sensitivity, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the comparison results show that our strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the polyp recognition task.",

        "abstract": "Despite successful demonstrations of outdoor walking by a few biped robots, performance measure for such robots has not been formally defined yet. The performance measure should be adequately defined by which one can evaluate how well the robot keeps from falling in the presence of disturbance. If such performance measure is suitably determined, designing a sort of optimal controller for stable outside walking would be possible. This paper firstly suggests to adopt the l\u221e-induced norm defined on the linearized Poincar\u00e8 map as a novel performance measure for biped robots, in the presence of bounded persistent disturbance. In order to validate the measure, a nonlinear dynamic simulation is conducted by extending an existing simple model to walk on rough terrain, of which height variance is bounded by some maximum value. The measure exploited for the model is compared with the numerical result obtained from nonlinear dynamic simulation. Finally, an example of application of this measure is provided, which successfully predicts whether the system could overcome upcoming terrain roughness.",

        "abstract": "Control of the exerted force on objects as well as the position of the actuator during a cell characterization operation has an essential role in achieving an efficient performance. In such operations, any undesired applied force could degrade the efficiency or make damages to the object. A challenging problem associated with application to cell characterization using a piezoelectric actuator is to design a suitable force-position switching control law and also to deal with nonlinear hysteretic behavior of such actuators. The main concern in this operation is to provide a smooth switching transition between position and force control modes. A modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator and its inverse are utilized for both identification and real time compensation of the hysteresis nonlinear behavior. By proposing an appropriate force-position switching control approach, the smooth transition between these two modes is guaranteed. The stability of each controller as well as the switching system is demonstrated analytically. Experimental results depict that the proposed approach achieves precise force-position control within each modes and also the switching remains smooth.",

A 120\u00d7100mm palm consisting of 12 spine tiles and a pulley differential system for load sharing are designed and tested on 9 different surfaces. The mean shear adhesion goes up to 710N (183kPa) on concrete blocks. Design considerations include scaling efficiency and maximal single-spine force. Desirable properties for load sharing in the palm design are discussed.",

First, the passivity can be guaranteed by finding a set of control parameters that makes the admittance function positive real. However, this approach cannot be applied to multi degrees-of-freedom robot because it requires transfer function analysis. Second, standard admittance controller is not suitable when the system is exposed to unexpected environmental interaction (of which interaction force is not measured) due to the wall sticking effect.

The proposed approach was verified using experiments and simulations.",

        "abstract": "Ribbon folding is a new approach to structure formation that forms higher dimensional structures using a lower dimensional primitive, namely a ribbon. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to address path planning for ribbon folding of multi-link planar structures. We first represent the desired structure with a graph-based representation of edges and nodes. We then use graph theory to claim that for any object which is represented by a connected graph, there exists a continuous path which visits all of its edges. Finally, we develop a path planning algorithm that takes into account the physical constraints of the folding machine. The input is the desired planar structure, and the output is the optimal sequence of ribbon folds for creating that structure using the minimum number of folds. The results of this algorithm are successfully used to fold various planar structures.",

In this paper, we present a perception system for a mobile robot that leverages information from various sensing modalities to act reliably in a partially observable environment.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel planar biped model which achieves asymptotically stable walking, based on ankle actuation and the virtual pendulum concept. Simple models for walking have provided useful insights in understanding fundamental principles of human locomotion as well as developing controllers for biped robots. Existing simplest walking models include a point mass with either rigid legs or compliant legs. Both models are able to describe different gaits such as walking and running, but are not able to address posture stabilization, which is another important issue in bipedalism. Recently, the virtual pendulum (VP) concept was proposed as an intuitive posture stabilization strategy and successfully demonstrated on the compliant leg scheme. However, the model does not address inherent peripheral mechanics of walking, i.e., ankle actuation and collisional energy loss from foot-ground interaction. The model proposed in this paper consists of a rigid trunk, rigid legs and ankle actuation. The energy dissipation due to collision and compensation by ankle actuation play an essential role for asymptotically stable walking, while the trunk posture is stabilized based on the VP concept. Nonlinear dynamic simulation verifies that the model constructs a stable limit cycle with a small angular oscillation of trunk.",

In this work, we examine animal and robotic systems on the metric of jumping agility and find that animals can outperform the most agile robots by a factor of two. These specially adapted animals use a jumping strategy we term power modulation to generate more peak power for jumping than otherwise possible. A novel eight-bar revolute mechanism designed with a new linkage synthesis approach encodes the properties for power modulation as well as constraints which assure rotation-free jumping motion. We fabricate an 85 gram prototype and demonstrate that it can perform a range of jumps while constrained by a linear slide. The prototype can deliver 3.63 times more peak jumping power than the maximum its motor can produce. A simulation matched to the physical parameters of the prototype predicts that the robot can attain an agility exceeding that of the most agile animals if the actuator power is increased to 15W.",

        "abstract": "The objective characterization of human motion is required in a variety of fields including competitive sports, rehabilitation and the detection of motor deficits. Nowadays, typically human experts evaluate the motor behavior. These evaluations are based on their individual experience which leads to a low inter- and intra-expert reliability. Standardized tests improve on the reliability but are still prone to subjective ratings and require human expert knowledge. This paper presents a novel method to characterize the motor state of Parkinson patients using full body motion capturing data based on a combination of multiple metrics. Our approach merges various metrics with a Random Forest and uses a probabilistic formulation to compute a one-dimensional measure for the performed motion. We present an application of our approach to the problem of relating subject motion to different classes like healthy subjects and Parkinson disease patients with deep brain stimulation switched on or off. In the experimental session we show that our measure leads to high classification rates and high entropy values for real-world data. Besides, we show that our method discriminates between Parkinson's subjects (with and without stimulation) and healthy persons as good as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).",

A service robot acting autonomously in an indoor environment is faced with very complex tasks. Consider the problem of pouring a liquid into a cup, the robot should first determine if the cup is empty or partially filled. RGB-D cameras provide noisy depth measurements which depend on the opaqueness and refraction index of the liquid. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic approach for estimating the fill-level of a liquid in a cup using an RGB-D camera. Our approach does not make any assumptions about the properties of the liquid like its opaqueness or its refraction index. We develop a probabilistic model using features extracted from RGB and depth data. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method and an improvement over the state of the art.",

Our Probabilistic Swarm Guidance using Inhomogeneous Markov Chains (PSG-IMC) algorithm adopts an Eulerian framework, where the physical space is partitioned into bins and the swarm's density distribution over each bin is controlled. Each agent determines its bin transition probabilities using a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. These time-varying Markov matrices are constructed by each agent in real-time using the feedback from the current swarm distribution, which is estimated in a distributed manner. The PSG-IMC algorithm minimizes the expected cost of the transitions per time instant, required to achieve and maintain the desired formation shape, even when agents are added to or removed from the swarm. The algorithm scales well with a large number of agents and complex formation shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed swarm guidance algorithm by using results of numerical simulations and hardware experiments with multiple quadrotors.",

        "abstract": "Reactive stepping is an important utility to regain balance when bipedal walking motions are disturbed. This paper sheds light on the reasons for humanoid robots to fall down. It presents a method to calculate modifications of predefined foot placements with the objective to minimize deviations of the Zero Moment Point from a reference without interrupting the walk. The calculation is in closed-form, and is embedded into a well-evaluated preview controller with observer based on the 3D Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (3D-LIPM). Experiments in simulation and on a physical robot prove the benefit of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Many robot learning algorithms depend on a model of the robot's forward dynamics for simulating potential trajectories and ultimately learning a required task. In this paper, we present a data-driven reservoir computing approach and apply it for learning forward dynamics models. Our proposed machine learning algorithm exploits the concepts of dynamic reservoir, self-organized learning and Bayesian inference. We have evaluated our approach on datasets gathered from two industrial robotic manipulators and compared it on both step-by-step and multi-step trajectory prediction scenarios with state-of-the-art algorithms. The evaluation considers the algorithms' convergence and prediction performance on joint and operational space for varying prediction horizons, as well as computational time. Results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art, converges fast and can achieve accurate predictions over longer horizons, which makes it a reliable, data-efficient approach for learning forward models.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a deployable boom which combines a rigid telescopic frame and a flexible tape spring. The front end of the spring is fixed on the rear end of the innermost segment of the frame. The spring spreads and rolls up inside the frame to drive the segments to move one by one to realize the boom deployment and retraction. The driving forces needed to deploy and retract the frame are modeled and simulated. The feasibility of the frame driving by only one spring is also studied. A 1.6 kg prototype system with 2.1 m total deployment length is implemented. Experimental results show the maximum driving forces for deployment and retraction of the frame are about 9.1 N and 6.8 N respectively. The boom is able to deploy in 76 s with energy consumption of 315 J. The boom can resist at least 15 N force axially and 31.5 N\u00b7m bending moment when the forces are acted on its front end. Advantages of this kind of boom enable it to be applied for instruments deployment, walking and sampling assists, and robotic arms design in space exploration.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of controlling a formation of quadrotor UAVs equipped with onboard cameras able to measure relative bearings in their local body frames w.r.t. neighboring UAVs. The control goal is twofold: (i) steering the agent group towards a formation defined in terms of desired bearings, and (ii) actuating the group motions in the \u2018null-space\u2019 of the current bearing formation. The proposed control strategy relies on an extension of the rigidity theory to the case of directed bearing frameworks in \u211d3\u00d7S1. This extension allows to devise a decentralized bearing controller which, unlike most of the present literature, does not need presence of a common reference frame or of reciprocal bearing measurements for the agents. Simulation and experimental results are then presented for illustrating and validating the approach.",

A lot of research has been done using three universal wheels but trajectory control for four Mecanum wheeled mobile robot (FMWMR) in presence of uncertainties still needs attention. Thus, to obtain smooth motion of mobile robots, with chattering free control input, in presence of uncertainties and external force disturbances, a robust and adaptive control is necessary. In view of these aspects, this paper extends the use of adaptive sliding mode controller for trajectory tracking of FMWMR. The effectiveness of proposed controller is verified using two case problems. Simulation results are presented for the verification of proposed controller for FMWMR. Further, experiments are conducted using position and orientation sensor to show the performance of the controller in real world environment. Simulation and experimental results revealed that FMWMR is capable of tracking any type of trajectories.",

The proposed topological map consists of nodes represented as a bag of visual line words and edges represented as both an adjacency list and relative motion information to perform the transition between topological nodes. Our proposed Bayesian localization framework uses two measurement models: a visual line word-based place model and a path-matching model. To enable a mobile robot to reach to a desired destination, a coastal path is planned in such a way that maximizes the possibility of following the reference path defined as a sequence of scenes encountered when building the topological map, while avoiding possible collisions by leveraging a local grid map constructed in real time from Kinect depth information. To show the validity of our proposed framework, we provide several extensive experimental results in several indoor environments under different conditions, such as illumination changes and visual occlusions.",

        "abstract": "To accelerate the developmental process of robots interacting with humans in the real world, we propose the simultaneous introduction of two competing robots into the test field. One robot moves autonomously using a preprogrammed behavior set, while the other is remotely controlled by a human operator. The operator attempts to improve the robot by exploring new behavioral elements. Concurrently, the preprogrammed behavior set is tested by the first robot. The main concept is that by allowing the two robots compete against each other, we aim to accelerate the development process. By applying this methodology, we developed an educational robot for children. Herein we report the functioning of this methodology and how behavioral elements were explored and improved through field development.",

        "abstract": "An important aspect to be taken care of while designing assistive robots for mobility is that they need to operate among humans. Thus understanding human spatial social conventions and incorporating them in the assistive solutions, is important. In this paper, we introduce a semi-autonomous framework for assistive wheelchair navigation in human environments, which is driven by the intention of the wheelchair user. Safe and socially compliant motion provided by a user intention driven local motion planner is fused with user teleoperation in order to create such a system. Taking into account the fact that the user is the primary controller, our proposed system aims to provide progressive assistance whenever the user is in danger of collision or at risk of disturbance to other humans. We also thus propose generalized formulations for estimating user intentions and for sharing control within the context of wheelchair mobility assistance, that is adaptable in order to be deployed in real world systems. We then evaluate the proposed framework in simulation in order to obtain a quantitative analysis. We also provide experimental evidence using an off-the-shelf robotized wheelchair equipped with a single 2D laser scanner.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method that arbitrates the control between the human and the robot actors in a teaching-by-demonstration setting to form synergy between the two and facilitate effective skill synthesis on the robot. We employed the human-in-the-loop teaching paradigm to teleoperate and demonstrate a complex task execution to the robot in real-time. As the human guides the robot to perform the task, the robot obtains the skill online during the demonstration. To encode the robotic skill we employed Locally Weighted Regression that fits local models to specific state region of the task based on the human demonstration. If the robot is in the state region where no local models exist, the control over the robotic mechanism is given to the human to perform the teaching. When local models are gradually obtained in that region, the control is given to the robot so that the human can examine its performance already during the demonstration stage, and take actions accordingly. This enables a co-adaptation between the agents and contributes to a faster and more efficient teaching. As a proof-of-concept, we realised the proposed robot teaching system on a haptic robot with the task of generation of a desired vertical force on a horizontal plane with unknown stiffness properties.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a simple 2D passive dynamic walking model with straight legs based on a novel hip joint, called T-joint. The model directly solves the common foot-scuffing problem in straight-legged walkers without introducing any new degree of freedom or additional motion phase, which is unavoidable in kneed robots. The mathematic model of the new walker is a 4D hybrid dynamical system, which can be reduced to a 3D Poincar\u00e9 map. A stable period-1 walking gait is found by searching the map with a proposed algorithm. Numerical studies show that the model performs well for disturbances on initial conditions and also on a large slope. The stable walking gait is verified by a virtual prototype in ADAMS. This study has been successfully used to make an efficient walking robot called Xingzhe, which has set a new world record for the longest distance after 134km non-stoping walking.",

The parallel kinematics of the device is constructed by connecting a 3RRP planar parallel mechanism to a linearly actuated modified delta mechanism with a connecting link. The configuration level forward and inverse kinematics of the device assume analytic solutions, while its workspace can be shaped to enable large end-effector translations and rotations, making it well-suited for laparoscopy operations. Furthermore, the haptic interface features a low apparent inertia with high structural stiffness, thanks to its parallel kinematics with grounded actuators. A model-based open-loop impedance controller with feed-forward gravity compensation has been implemented for the device and various virtual tissue/organ stiffness levels have been rendered.",

Both sensors have combs with a gap of 30 \u03bcm, length of 4 mm, and depth of 65 \u03bcm. A linear elastic analytical model was developed to predict change in capacitance as a function of strain, and experimental results show a reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions. The observed strain responses have high linearity and dynamic range, and negligible hysteresis. The strain resolution of the LC and TC sensors is 100 \u03bcstrain and 500 \u03bcstrain, respectively, tested up to 50% strain.",

        "abstract": "A novel three axis force sensor, based on magnetic flux measurements, was used in the fingers of a gripper. The force sensor uses three Hall Effect sensors orthogonally placed at the base of a hemisphere made of silicon rubber. A neodymium permanent magnet was inside the hemisphere. When a force was applied to the perimeter of hemisphere, it compressed the hemisphere displacing the magnet. This displacement caused change in the magnetic field around the Hall-effect sensors. By analysing these changes, we calculated the force in three directions using a lookup table. This sensor can be used in robot grippers to manipulate objects dexterously with tactile feedback. The cheap construction, robustness and reliability are few advantages of this sensor for it to be used in industrial applications. The sensor design, simulation and its characterization are presented in this work. Furthermore, as an application, a peg in a hole experiment was carried out to present the ability of the sensors to be used in robot grippers for manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, consumer electronic devices such as smartphones, are packaged with small cameras, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, all sensors allowing autonomous deployment of aerial robots in GPS-denied environments. Our previous work [1], demonstrated the feasibility of using smartphones for autonomous flight. In many applications, there is a large interest to the use multiple autonomous aerial vehicles in a cooperative manner to speed up the operation of the mission. In this work, we present the first fully autonomous smartphone-based swarm of quadrotors. Multiple vehicles are able to plan safe trajectories avoiding inter-robot collisions, optimizing at the same time a given task and concurrently building in a cooperative manner a 3-D map of the environment. The sensing, sensor fusion, control, and planning are all done on an offthe- shelf Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone using just the single camera and IMU available on the phone. The work allows any consumer with multiple smartphones to autonomously drive a swarm of multiple vehicles without GPS, by downloading an app, and have the swarm cooperatively map a 3-D environment.",

The proposed approach uses geometric mechanics based on Screw Theory and Lie groups. Both Lagrange's and Newton-Euler's equation of motion are derived. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed set of geometric equations holds the intrinsic robot parameters explicitly arranged like symbolic matrices. The formulation is valid for any branched AMS without closed kinematic chains and whose joints have one degree of freedom (DoF) (revolute and/or prismatic). All these properties allow the use of these equations in different algorithms such as identification, simulation and control of branched AMSs like hands or humanoids. Finally, the proposed equations have been validated and verified with the multi-body simulation software package MSC=ADAMS\u00a9 by computing the inverse dynamics of a two arm torso of 16 DoF.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on a real system implementation, analysis, and evaluation of a cooperative sensor fusion algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter, using simulated and real vehicles endowed with automotive-grade sensors. We have extended our previously presented cooperative sensor fusion algorithm with a fusion weight optimization method and implemented it on a vehicle that we denote as the ego vehicle. The algorithm fuses information obtained from one or more vehicles located within a certain range (that we call cooperative), which are running a multi-object tracking PHD filter, and which are sharing their object estimates. The algorithm is evaluated on two Citro\u00ebn C-ZERO prototype vehicles equipped with Mobileye cameras for object tracking and lidar sensors from which the ground truth positions of the tracked objects are extracted. Moreover, the algorithm is evaluated in simulation using simulated C-ZERO vehicles and simulated Mobileye cameras. The ground truth positions of tracked objects are in this case provided by the simulator. Multiple experimental runs are conducted in both simulated and real-world conditions in which a few legacy vehicles were tracked. Results show that the cooperative fusion algorithm allows for extending the sensing field of view, while keeping the tracking accuracy and errors similar to the case in which the vehicles act alone.",

We demonstrate successful classification of 185 objects in 10 categories, at sparse to dense surface sampling rate in point cloud simulation, with an accuracy of 77.5% at the sparsest and 90.1% at the densest. In a physics-based simulation, we show that contact clouds resembling the object shape can be obtained by a series of gripper closures using a robotic hand equipped with sparse tactile arrays. Despite sparser sampling of the object's surface, classification still performs well, at 74.7%. On a real robot, we show the ability of the descriptor to discriminate among different object instances, using data collected by a tactile hand.",

Inspired by medical suturing robots, we have adopted a single-sided sewing technique using a curved needle to perform the task of sewing stents onto fabric. A motorized surgical needle driver was attached to a 7 d.o.f robot arm to manipulate the needle with a second robot controlling the position of the mandrel. A learning-from-demonstration approach was used to program the robot to sew stents onto fabric. The demonstrated sewing skill was segmented to several phases, each of which was encoded with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Generalized sewing movements were then generated from these models and were used for task execution. During execution, a stereo vision system was adopted to guide the robots and adjust the learnt movements according to the needle pose. Two experiments are presented here with this system and the results show that our system can robustly perform the sewing task as well as adapt to various needle poses. The accuracy of the sewing system was within 2mm.",

Nuclear waste must be sorted, segregated and stored according to its radiation level in order to optimize maintenance costs. The objective of this work is to develop a shared control framework for remote manipulation of objects using visual information. In the presented scenario, the human operator must control a system composed of two robotic arms, one equipped with a gripper and the other one with a camera. In order to facilitate the operator's task, a subset of the gripper motion are assumed to be regulated by an autonomous algorithm exploiting the camera view of the scene. At the same time, the operator has control over the remaining null-space motions w.r.t. the primary (autonomous) task by acting on a force feedback device. A novel force feedback algorithm is also proposed with the aim of informing the user about possible constraints of the robotic system such as, for instance, joint limits. Human/hardware-in-the-loop experiments with simulated slave robots and a real master device are finally reported for demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.",

The proposed system is able to perform common hand gestures and self-adaptable grasps by mixing under-actuated and self-adaptable hand kinematics in a unique design. The hand answers the need for precise finger postures and sensor-less force feedback during gestures and for finger adaptation and autonomous force distribution during grasps. These are provided by a dual actuation system embodied within the palm and the fingers. Coexistence is ensured by compliant transmissions based on elastomer bars rather than classical tension springs, thanks to their high elastic coefficient at reduced sizes and strains. The proposed solution significantly reduces the weight and the size of the hand by using a reduced number of small actuators for gesturing and a single motor for grasping. The hand prototype (ALPHA) is realized to confirm the design feasibility and functional capabilities. It is controlled to provide safe human-robot interaction and preserve mechanical integrity in order to be embodied on a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces ANYmal, a quadrupedal robot that features outstanding mobility and dynamic motion capability. Thanks to novel, compliant joint modules with integrated electronics, the 30 kg, 0.5 m tall robotic dog is torque controllable and very robust against impulsive loads during running or jumping. The presented machine was designed with a focus on outdoor suitability, simple maintenance, and user-friendly handling to enable future operation in real world scenarios. Performance tests with the joint actuators indicated a torque control bandwidth of more than 70 Hz, high disturbance rejection capability, as well as impact robustness when moving with maximal velocity. It is demonstrated in a series of experiments that ANYmal can execute walking gaits, dynamically trot at moderate speed, and is able to perform special maneuvers to stand up or crawl very steep stairs. Detailed measurements unveil that even full-speed running requires less than 280 W, resulting in an autonomy of more than 2 h.",

        "abstract": "The present paper introduces a manipulator that is developed to combine safe and dynamic interaction tasks. The system is built from lightweight carbon fiber links and novel high-performance series elastic actuator units that provide dynamic movement capability, low-impedance joint torque control, and inherent interaction safety. This enabled the implementation of a model-based direct force control method purely based on joint torque regulation. Using unified force and motion control, the end-effector position can be accurately and dynamically tracked in task space while acting safely upon (unexpected) contacts with the environment. The force control component is implemented in a novel way that shows reduced forces in comparison to existing methods when navigating across a surface of unpredictable orientation and friction. ANYpulator is tested using a haptic feedback method that renders the system dynamics and contact forces back to the user.",

        "abstract": "To render a wearable robot imperceptible to a user is a very challenging control task. The constant and intrinsic interaction between robot and human, and person-dependent behaviours are the main difficulties when designing such cooperative control. In this contribution we introduce and discuss a novel and promising transparency control framework. The foundation of the framework is to measure the acceleration of the human limbs and to exploit this measurement to generate feedforward control commands by using a rigid body model of the robot. The framework includes also an acceleration feedback controller and a state estimator to enhance the overall performance. We present a simplified stability analysis with different feedback controllers and preliminary experimental data that demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in reducing interaction forces and mimicking human motions.",

        "abstract": "The reliable manipulation of micro-objects has been a still difficult work in scientific and technical field due to scale effects. This paper presents two types of release methods, using local stream and inertia force generated by 3D high speed motion of an end effector, for releasing and accurate positioning of biological cells. Two-fingered microhand driven by DC motors for both end effectors and PZT actuators for right end effector is employed. A parallel mechanism controlled by three PZT actuators generates 3D high speed motions to release cells adhered to one of the end effector. The local stream and inertia force created by high speed motion of the right end effector detach the cells adhered to the left end effector and right end effector, respectively. To generate the necessary external forces for separation of the attached cells, the vibration having high frequency and suitable amplitude is applied. For accurate positioning of the object, circular motions are proposed. To verify the advantage of the proposed motion, we compare five motions, three 1D motions and two circular motions. Experiments were conducted employing 16\u03bcm NIH3T3 cells. From these analyses of experiments, we conclude that the proposed motions can detach micro objects (100%) with high position accuracy (3\u00b10.7\u03bcm) on desired position after release.",

        "abstract": "To achieve tasks in unknown environments with high reliability, highly accurate localization during task execution is necessary for humanoid robots. In this paper, we discuss a localization system which can be applied to a humanoid robot when executing tasks in the real world. During such tasks, humanoid robots typically do not possess a referential to a constant horizontal plane which can in turn be used as part of fast and cost efficient localization methods. We solve this problem by first computing an improved odometry estimate through fusing visual odometry, feedforward commands from gait generator and orientation from inertia sensors. This estimate is used to generate a 3D point cloud from the accumulation of successive laser scans and such point cloud is then properly sliced to create a constant height horizontal virtual scan. Finally, this slice is used as an observation base and fed to a 2D SLAM method. The fusion process uses a velocity error model to achieve greater accuracy, which parameters are measured on the real robot. We evaluate our localization system in a real world task execution experiment using the JAXON robot and show how our system can be used as a practical solution for humanoid robots localization during complex tasks execution processes.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of objects search in clutter. In cluttered environments, partial occlusion among objects prevents vision systems from correctly recognizing objects. Hence, the agent needs to move objects around to gather information, which helps reduce uncertainty in perception. At the same time, the agent needs to minimize the efforts of moving objects to reduce the time required to complete the task. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), formulating it as a problem of optimal decision making under uncertainty. By exploiting spatial constraints, we are able to adapt online POMDP planners to handle objects search problems with large state space and action space. Experiments show that the POMDP solution outperforms greedy approaches, especially in cases where multi-step manipulation is required.",

The recorded data is then made available in a format that robots can understand, by using a symbolic layer to interconnect the two data types in a seamless way.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of deformable objects, especially that of highly flexible articles of clothing, is difficult to model. This is due to their vast number of degrees of freedom in addition to the noisy and incomplete measurements robots have to cope with. Therefore, we suggest focusing on the structures and object parts which are relevant to the task at hand. The openings (e.g., at the waist, leg or sleeve ends) characterize garments surprisingly well, not only from a topological perspective, but also in terms of their inherent function, namely dressing. We model openings as closed, oriented chains of movable points which we refer to as Active Boundary Component Models (ABCMs). Compared with the hardly predictable motions of an overall piece of clothing, relatively strict assumptions regarding the dynamics of these contour models can be made. We express these assumptions through position-based constraints which drastically restrict the degrees of freedom. In the present paper, we show how ABCMs can be initialized exploiting geometric prior knowledge of garments, and how they can be tracked visually using 3D point cloud data. Additionally, we consider the task of sliding a rod through a pant leg as a first step toward robotic dressing assistance for physically handicapped persons.",

        "abstract": "Active Constraint Learning (ACL) is continuously gaining popularity in the area of constrained clustering due to its ability to achieve performance gains via incorporating minimal feedback from a human annotator for selected instances. For constrained clustering algorithms, such instances are integrated in the form of Must-Link (ML) and Cannot-Link (CL) constraints. Existing iterative uncertainty reduction schemes, introduce high computational burden particularly when they process larger datasets that are usually present in computer vision and visual learning applications. For scenarios that multiple agents (i.e., robots) require user feedback for performing recognition tasks, minimizing the interaction between the user and the agents, without compromising performance, is an essential task. In this study, a non-iterative ACL scheme with proven performance benefits is presented. We select to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by building on the well known K-Means algorithm for clustering; one can easily extend it to alternative clustering schemes. The proposed methodology introduces the use of the Silhouette values, conventionally used for measuring clustering performance, in order to rank the degree of information content of the various samples. In addition, an efficient greedy selection scheme was devised for selecting the most informative samples for human annotation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first active constrained clustering methodology with the ability to process computer vision datasets that this study targets. Performance results are shown on various computer vision benchmarks and support the merits of adopting the proposed scheme.",

Robot-aided therapy is able to alleviate the therapist's laborious burden and to provide more information about patient's condition during the therapy. Generally, the requirement of active therapy arises during the later stage of recovery. To realize the active therapy, a useful active control of the robot and effective recovery assessment for the active robot-aided therapy are essential. In this paper, a new active control method and an active therapy protocol with assessment indexes are designed.

The proposed algorithm does not assume presence of a global reference frame and only requires bearing-rigidity of the formation (for the localization problem to admit a unique solution), and presence of (at least) one pair of robots in mutual visibility. Two different scenarios are considered in which the active scale estimation problem is treated either as a primary task or as a secondary objective with respect to the constraint of attaining a desired bearing formation. The theoretical results are validated by realistic simulations.",

Deploying a robot in crowded spaces such as museums, shopping malls, department stores, or university campuses is especially challenging because the moving people occlude the static parts of the environment, such as walls and doorways, making the robot essentially blind. A new weighting function is proposed for a particle filter state estimation algorithm that accounts for the presence of dynamic obstacles and avoids population depletion. An active localization strategy is employed which guides the robot to locations that resolve ambiguities and eliminate hypotheses in a systematic manner. Experimental results from multiple simulations and from real robot deployments validate the localization improvements achieved by the proposed method.",

Non-manual calibration procedures use manipulators to create known patterns in order to estimate the unknown calibration. Calibration is often time-consuming and involves humans performing repetitive tasks such as aligning a known calibration target at different poses with respect to the sensor. We propose an algorithm that plans a trajectory which actively reduces the uncertainty of the robot's calibration given a rough initial calibration estimate. Calibration is performed autonomously in a previously unknown environment by maintaining the belief over landmarks, poses, and the calibration parameters. We present experimental results to demonstrate the approach's ability to autonomously calibrate the exteroceptive sensor in simulated and real environments. We show that even a greedy approach can reduce the effort needed to perform calibration every time the robot is reconfigured for autonomous tasks and mitigates the possibility of human error added into the calibration.",

Most active sensing methods choose sensing actions that minimize the uncertainty of the state according to some information-theoretic measure. While this is reasonable for most applications, minimizing state uncertainty may not be most relevant when the state information is used to perform a task. This is because the uncertainty in some subspace of the state space could have more impact on the performance of the task than the others at a given time.

        "abstract": "Accurate object shape knowledge provides important information for performing stable grasping and dexterous manipulation. When modeling an object using tactile sensors, touching the object surface at a fixed grid of points can be sample inefficient. In this paper, we present an active touch strategy to efficiently reduce the surface geometry uncertainty by leveraging a probabilistic representation of object surface. In particular, we model the object surface using a Gaussian process and use the associated uncertainty information to efficiently determine the next point to explore. We validate the resulting method for tactile object surface modeling using a real robot to reconstruct multiple, complex object surfaces.",

        "abstract": "How should a robot direct active vision so as to ensure reliable grasping? We answer this question for the case of dexterous grasping of unfamiliar objects. By dexterous grasping we simply mean grasping by any hand with more than two fingers, such that the robot has some choice about where to place each finger. Such grasps typically fail in one of two ways, either unmodeled objects in the scene cause collisions or object reconstruction is insufficient to ensure that the grasp points provide a stable force closure. These problems can be solved more easily if active sensing is guided by the anticipated actions. Our approach has three stages. First, we take a single view and generate candidate grasps from the resulting partial object reconstruction. Second, we drive the active vision approach to maximise surface reconstruction quality around the planned contact points. During this phase, the anticipated grasp is continually refined. Third, we direct gaze to improve the safety of the planned reach to grasp trajectory. We show, on a dexterous manipulator with a camera on the wrist, that our approach (80.4% success rate) outperforms a randomised algorithm (64.3% success rate).",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of the image-based 3D pose computation of a semi-circle suturing needle using monocular image feedback for laparoscopy. We propose a constrained two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) geometry-based modelling method to parametrise the needle's 6-DOF pose, including depth information. The modelling solely relies on the simultaneous observation of the needle's apparent tip and junction. No external markers are needed for extra constraints. An adaptive controller combining gradient descent and vector-flow method is introduced to iteratively guide the needle's initial guessing pose to its real pose by minimizing image-based position errors. Experiments have been conducted using both numerical simulations and simulated laparoscopic scenarios to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.",

Recent advancement in numerical computation allow such locomotive robots to manipulate in real environments using a model-based control framework. This approach is successful if the precise model it is obtained. However, it is not always feasible to use the precise model because there are various factors related to both the robot and its surroundings. In this paper, we report the locomotion experiments with 2 types of legged robot that can change its behavior by switching connection patterns among hydraulic cylinders mounted on the robot's legs. An actuator network system (ANS) is used to switch mutual interconnection of cylinders. The switching connection allows the robots to realize not only adaptive locomotion to the environment but also operation of the traveling direction.",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots comprise telescopic precurved elastic tubes. The robot's tip and shape are controlled via relative tube motions, i.e. tube rotations and translations. Non-linear interactions between the tubes, e.g. friction and torsion, as well as uncertainty in the physical properties of the tubes themselves, e.g. the Young's modulus, curvature, or stiffness, hinder accurate kinematic modelling. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based methodology for kinematic modelling of concentric tube robots and in situ model adaptation. Our approach is based on Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR). The model comprises an ensemble of linear models, each of which locally approximates the original complex kinematic relation. LWPR can accommodate for model deviations by adjusting the respective local models at run-time, resulting in an adaptive kinematics framework. We evaluated our approach on data gathered from a three-tube robot, and report high accuracy across the robot's configuration space.",

The robot is required to monitor the rooms and detect visitors as many as possible. A key idea in the patrolling mission is to allow the robot to utilize information about visitor trends. Thus far, we have focused on a visiting probability as the trend. However, the visitor trends usually change over time. Therefore, the robot is further required to detect the changes and identify the correct visitor trends in each room. For this challenge, we present a novel change-point detection method. In this method, the Jensen-Shannon divergence is used as a dissimilarity measure between two distributions of the visiting probability. The change-point detection method is activated in the Bayesian learning for estimating the changed visiting probability. Consequently, the robot is allowed to adaptively patrol the changing environment. Through the simulation experiments, we discuss the effectiveness of the adaptive patrolling for the changes in the visitor trends.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new adaptive repetitive visual-servo control system for a moving high-flying vehicle (HFV) with an uncalibrated camera to monitor, track, and precisely control the movements of a low-flying vehicle (LFV) or mobile ground robot. When deployed, a remote operator of the HFV defines the desired trajectory for the LFV in the HFV's camera frame (image frame). Due to the circulatory motion of the HFV, the resulting motion trajectory of the LFV in the image frame is periodic in time, thus an adaptive repetitive control system is exploited to improve the tracking precision from one operating period to the next. Not only is the adaptive control law able to deal with uncertainties in the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, but it can also tolerate uncertainties in the localization of the LFV. The design and stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented, where the Lyapunov approach is used to show stability. Simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for controlling the movement of a low-flying quadcopter vehicle. Results show good tracking performance for three simulated test cases, where the average maximum tracking error is reduced by approximately 75% compared to the performance of a standard adaptive visual-servo controller.",

We exploit a recent parameterization of all feasible teleoperator admittance matrices to propose a control synthesis procedure based on admittance shaping. This leads to an intuitive performance-oriented controller design that reveals important trade-offs inherent to bilateral teleoperaton. In particular, this allows a trade-off between performance and passivity, that is not accessible while using classical passivity-based methods.

We prove that in both cases the system is exactly linearizable with a dynamic feedback and differentially flat for the same set of outputs (but different controllers). We compare the two cases with extensive and realistic simulations, which show that the rigid-joint case outperforms the elastic-joint case for aerial grasping tasks while the converse holds for link-velocity amplification tasks. We present preliminary experimental results using a actuated joint with variable stiffness (VSA) on a quadrotor platform.",

The aerial robot in this study consists of a small hexarotor platform and a robotic hand module including a gripper. After grasping the object, the torsional work is executed by using yaw rotation of the body of the robot. For increasing a torque for the torsional task, an impact device is embedded at the base of the hand module. A maximum instant torque generated with this impact device was more than 4 N\u00b7m. In addition, the number of rotations of the body is measured through images captured by an onboard camera mounted beside the hand. Through experiments, we verified the feasibility of the present robot by successfully unscrewing a light bulb set to the socket above the robot and safely landing with the detached bulb.",

It applies information theoretic measures in a belief-driven planning framework to recognize objects using the history of visual and manual interactions and to select the most informative actions. A generalization of the aspect graph is used to construct forward models of objects that account for visual transitions. We use populations of these models to define the belief state of the recognition problem. This paper focuses on the impact of the belief-space and object model representations on recognition efficiency and performance. A benchmarking system is introduced to execute controlled experiments in a challenging mobile manipulation domain. It offers a large population of objects that remain ambiguous from single sensor geometry or from visual or manual actions alone. Results are presented for recognition performance on this dataset using locomotive, pushing, and lifting controllers as the basis for active information gathering on single objects. An information theoretic approach that is greedy over the expected information gain is used to select informative actions, and its performance is compared to a sequence of random actions.",

        "abstract": "Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) have several superiorities over conventional stiff and non-back-drivable actuators in force control, e.g., lower reflected inertia, low cost force measurement, high force fidelity, safety, and so on. However, their position control applications significantly suffer from low performance and disturbances due to insufficient controller designs. In this paper, a new Active Disturbance Rejection (ADR) controller is proposed for the robust position control problem of SEAs by combining Differential Flatness (DF) and Disturbance Observer (DOb) in state space. The trajectory of the actuator is generated by using DF and is tracked by using a conventional state feed-back controller. The state and control input references of a DF-based trajectory tracking controller are modified by using estimated disturbances so that the robustness is achieved. The proposed controller provides high performance position control for SEAs when they suffer from plant uncertainties and external disturbances such as inertia variation, backlash, friction and external load. Experimental results are given to validate the proposal.",

The main objective is to improve the performance and the intuitivity of the physical human-robot interaction. One obstacle to achieve this goal is the management of limitations such as joint position limitation, singularities and collisions with the environment. Indeed, in addition to performing a given principal task, human users must pay a close attention to the manipulator configuration in order to handle the kinematic limitations. The proposed anticipative algorithm aims at relieving the human user from having to deal with such limitations. The algorithm is first presented and detailed for each individual limitation of a planar RR serial robot. The framework developed to manage several limitations occurring simultaneously is then presented. Finally, experiments are performed in order to assess the performance of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an efficient assembly sequence generation method for robot programming, which can reduce the complexity of assembly sequence generation for products within a product family. Today, principle markets for robot assembly automation (e.g., automobile and consumer electronics) have a relatively short product run rate, ranging from six to twelve months. To accommodate this rapidly changing production demand, in most cases, manufacturers design a series of new products within a product family (i.e., a group of products derived from a common product platform) so that they have similar assembly sequences. Seemingly robot programming for a new product within a product family does not require extensive programming adjustments, but it is still complex and manufacturers spend large amount time and money in programming robots for each new product. To solve this problem, we present a new assembly sequence generation method. With a case-based planner, we generate feasible and similar-to-real assembly sequence candidates for a new product from assembly sequences of old products within a product family. Then, we use geometric information extracted from its CAD model to evaluate those candidate sequences. Unlike those used by previous studies, our method can generate an assembly sequence that is more suitable for the concept of a reconfigurable assembly system for general-purpose robots (assembly sequence generation for robot programming); more similar to assembly sequences used in real assembly systems (case-based planning); and more properly evaluated for robot assembly (a CAD model). We apply the proposed method to a toy airplane assembly scenario and demonstrate its feasibility.",

Inspired by the fact that the required forces in human motions are not symmetric in many cases, a spring-actuator type cable-drive mechanism is adopted, which enables a compact cable routing structure. The joint is connected with the exoskeleton frame through a rotary series elastic mechanism to transmit the desired force to the human user. High performance in force control is achieved by advanced control algorithms, which combine a proportional and differential (PD) controller optimized with a linear quadratic (LQ) method with a disturbance observer (DOB) and a zero phase error tracking (ZPET) feedforward filter. The proposed system was tested for the elbow joint. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed system was able to generate and deliver accurate force to the human user even with external disturbances and modeling uncertainties introduced by human motions.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the emerging needs to improve the quality of life for the elderly and disabled individuals who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and who might have limited or no hand functionality at all, we propose an egocentric computer vision based co-robot wheelchair to enhance their mobility without hand usage. The co-robot wheelchair is built upon a typical commercial power wheelchair. The user can access 360 degrees of motion direction as well as a continuous range of speed without the use of hands via the egocentric computer vision based control we developed. The user wears an egocentric camera and collaborates with the robotic wheelchair by conveying the motion commands with head motions. Compared with previous sip-n-puff, chin-control and tongue-operated solutions to hands-free mobility, this egocentric computer vision based control system provides a more natural human robot interface. Our experiments show that this design is of higher usability and users can quickly learn to control and operate the wheelchair. Besides its convenience in manual navigation, the egocentric camera also supports novel user-robot interaction modes by enabling autonomous navigation towards a detected person or object of interest. User studies demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the proposed egocentric computer vision co-robot wheelchair.",

        "abstract": "Pick-and-place regrasp extends the manipulation capability of a robot by using a sequence of regrasps to accomplish tasks that are not possible using a single grasp due to constraints such as kinematics or collisions between the robot and the environment. Previous work on pick-and-place only leveraged static passive devices for intermediate placements, and thus is limited in the flexibility and robustness to reorient an object. In this paper, we extend the reorientation capability of a pick-and-place regrasp by adding an actively actuated gripper fixed in the working cell, and using it as the intermediate location for regrasping. In particular, our method automatically computes the stable placements of an object being hold in the gripper support, finds a rich set of force-closure grasps, performs k-means based grasp clustering, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and searches for the optimal regrasp sequence. To compare the regrasping performance with typical passive supports, we evaluate the success rate while performing tasks on various models. Experiments on reorientation tasks validate the benefit of using an actively actuated gripper for regrasp placement.",

Dual-user training systems are useful for supervised hands-on training when a trainer shows the right gestures to a trainee and where the forces to apply on the tools are difficult to dose. An energy shared control (ESC) based architecture is proposed, based on an intrinsically passive authority sharing mechanism which is enhanced to provide a full force feedback to both users. As this enhancement may violate the natural passivity of the system, a passivity controller is introduced. A task based comparative study with two other dual-user schemes (Complementary Linear Combination (CLC) and Masters Correspondence with Environment Transfer (MECT) from [1] is conducted, which reveals analogous performances. Real-time experiments demonstrate good tracking performances.",

We consider both the spatio-temporal variations of ocean phenomena and the disturbances caused by ocean currents, and design an approach integrating the information-theoretic and decision-theoretic planning frameworks. Specifically, the information-theoretic component employs a hierarchical structure and plans the most informative observation way-points for reducing the uncertainty of ocean phenomena modeling and prediction; whereas the decision-theoretic component plans local motions by taking into account the non-stationary ocean current disturbances. We validated the method through simulations with real ocean data.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a performance oriented method for simulating stable free-floating satellite dynamics on a position controlled robot. Intrinsic latencies found in robot controllers, i.e. between input and output data, are known to produce stability issues and performance degradation. These issues are even more apparent during contact phases, where impact dynamics play a major role. The approach presented in this paper guarantees stability through passivity and preserves the performance through the use of an optimal damping. The energy produced by delays found in the closed loop system is monitored and dissipated when necessary. In order to implement the dynamics accurately, the damping process is formulated as an optimization problem. Thus, over-dissipation can be avoided and the system becomes less conservative. Performance and effectiveness of the method are shown in simulation and verified experimentally on a position controlled seven degrees of freedom Light Weight Robot equipped with a force-torque sensor at the end-effector.",

To ensure reliability, a global object descriptor must be computed based on a unique and repeatable object reference frame. Moreover, the descriptor should contain enough information enabling to recognize the same or similar objects seen from different perspectives. This paper presents a new object descriptor named Global Orthographic Object Descriptor (GOOD) designed to be robust, descriptive and efficient to compute and use. The performance of the proposed object descriptor is compared with the main state-of-the-art descriptors. Experimental results show that the overall classification performance obtained with GOOD is comparable to the best performances obtained with the state-of-the-art descriptors. Concerning memory and computation time, GOOD clearly outperforms the other descriptors. Therefore, GOOD is especially suited for real-time applications.",

In this paper we designed an electrosensory membrane that can operate in a full 3-dimensional mode. Algorithms on the object localization were also designed and tested based on numerical methods of electric field forward simulation. We combined the statistic learning method by training a multi-layer neural network and a probabilistic approach by applying a constrained unscented Kalman filter (CUKF). This exploits the merits of fast estimation and precise signal marching process. Experimental results showed that the detection and localization with the reported sensor were quick and accurate, with errors of around 10 mm using one-step neural network mapping and about 5 mm in close-range using CUKF. This work demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed electrosensory membrane and algorithms.",

The system was developed as a part of the AQUABOT project that developed an underwater robotic system for autonomous inspection of offshore aquaculture installation. The system takes into account the hemispherical optics typical in underwater vehicle designs and implements an array of line-lasers to ensure that mesh-like targets provide reflections in a consistent manner. The developed algorithms for the laser vision system are capable of providing either raw pointcloud data sets from each laser or with additional processing high level information like distance and relative orientation of the target with respect to the ROV can be recovered. An automatic calibration procedure along with the accompanying hardware that was developed, is described in this paper, to reduce the calibration overhead required by regular maintenance operations as is typical for underwater vehicles operating in sea-water. A set of experimental results in controlled laboratory environment as well as at offshore aquaculture installations demonstrate the performance of the system.",

Despite the considerable success it has enjoyed in robotics and other problems, no quantitative analysis exists of the relationship between its near-optimality and the computation invested. Exploiting ideas from fully-observable MDP planning, we provide here such an analysis, in which the relationship is modulated via a measure of problem complexity called near-optimality exponent. We illustrate the exponent for some interesting POMDP structures, and examine the role of the informative heuristics used by AEMS2 in the guarantees. In the second part of the paper, we introduce a domestic assistance problem in which a robot monitors partially observable switches and turns them off if needed. AEMS2 successfully solves this task in real experiments, and also works better than several state of the art planners in simulation comparisons.",

The time necessary for rising up from a sit position is very short for healthy subjects, in the order of few seconds. Using similar speeds for the assisted motion would create safety concerns, hence slower speeds are usually employed. In this paper we experimentally investigate the effects of this speed reduction. We detail the relationship among robot's speed, forces acting on the robot's user and muscular activation. From the results of this analysis we derive indications on the speeds appropriate for assisting the sit-to-stand movement.",

        "abstract": "The stabilization of man-made artificial systems has been achieved by sensor based state feedback control with high computational bandwidth and high stiffness structures. In contrast, many biological systems have been achieved similar or superior stable behavior with low speed signal transmission via nervous systems, which is easy to introduce unstable performance from a control engineering perspective. In order to explain this phenomenon, the concept of self-stabilization has recently been proposed and investigated. Self-stabilization is defined as the ability to restore its original state after a disturbance without any feedback control. In this paper, the self-stabilizing function of a musculoskeletal system for arbitrary motion in the vertical plane is analytically investigated using Lyapunov stability theory. Based on this investigation we propose a design method to realize the self-stabilizing function of a musculoskeletal system, and experimentally verify that the self-stabilizing function can be physically realized by the proposed Lyapunov function.",

        "abstract": "An extension based on attention and anticipation of a robot vision pipeline for object recognition in RGBD images from low-cost sensors like MS Kinect or ASUS Xtion is presented. This work originated in research on an industrial application scenario, namely shipping-container unloading, but it is applicable to advanced manipulation tasks in unstructured environments in general where the perception must be very robust while being as fast as possible. For these scenarios, we build on our previous work that proved to be competitive in cluttered scenes in table-top scenarios and which forms the backbone of our RGBD object recognition. It is further enhanced by two main contributions. First, a simple but very effective form of anticipation as top-down expectations of the evolution of the scene due to the actions of the robot is used to speed up the processing. Second, attention is used as a mechanism for further speed-up by focusing processing only on certain regions of interest of the scene based also on an anticipation mechanism. The method is analyzed in experiments using real-world data from an industrial demonstration set-up.",

Our planning algorithm, which is an anytime extension of the Rapidly-exploring Random Belief Tree (RRBT), maintains the best possible path throughout the robot execution, and the generated path gets closer to the optimal one as more computation resources are allocated. We propose a branch-and-bound method to cull out unpromising areas by considering path lengths and uncertainty. We also propose an uncertainty-aware velocity obstacle as a simple local analysis to avoid dynamic obstacles efficiently by finding a collision-free velocity. We have tested our method with three benchmarks that have non-linear measurement regions or potential collisions with dynamic obstacles. By using the proposed methods, we achieve up to five times faster performance given a fixed path cost.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an online landmark selection method for distributed long-term visual localization systems in bandwidth-constrained environments. Sharing a common map for online localization provides a fleet of autonomous vehicles with the possibility to maintain and access a consistent map source, and therefore reduce redundancy while increasing efficiency. However, connectivity over a mobile network imposes strict bandwidth constraints and thus the need to minimize the amount of exchanged data. The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time. Motivated by this, we propose an unsupervised method of adaptively selecting landmarks according to how likely these landmarks are to be observable under the prevailing appearance condition. The ranking function this selection is based upon exploits landmark co-observability statistics collected in past traversals through the mapped area. Evaluation is performed over different outdoor environments, large time-scales and varying appearance conditions, including the extreme transition from day-time to night-time, demonstrating that with our appearance-dependent selection method, we can significantly reduce the amount of landmarks used for localization while maintaining or even improving the localization performance.",

        "abstract": "While the topic of security in industrial applications has gained some momentum in recent years, there are still severe security vulnerabilities which are actively exploited for attacks. The robot operating system (ROS) is expected to further grow in usage and to be used in many industrial applications. Analysis, however, shows that it lacks several security enhancements in order to make it suitable for industrial use. In its current state, false data and commands can be injected posing a possible safety risk for the resulting product and humans in the production. In addition, data may be eavesdropped and used by outsiders to gain insight into the production process. In this paper we propose a security architecture intended for use on top of ROS on the application level. We use a dedicated authorization server to ensure that only valid nodes are part of the application. Cryptographic methods ensure data confidentiality and integrity. We show in a demonstration with a collaborative robot how our architecture can be used to secure a ROS-based application.",

The vision processing steps generally dominate the computation time of a tag detection pipeline, so even small improvements in marker detection can translate to a faster tag detection system. We incorporated lessons learned from implementing and supporting the AprilTag system into this improved system. This work describes AprilTag 2, a completely redesigned tag detector that improves robustness and efficiency compared to the original AprilTag system. The tag coding scheme is unchanged, retaining the same robustness to false positives inherent to the coding system. The new detector improves performance with higher detection rates, fewer false positives, and lower computational time. Improved performance on small images allows the use of decimated input images, resulting in dramatic gains in detection speed.",

Our strategy exploits foot contact event estimated by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and can detect user intention as well as reflect user preference. In our strategy, a gait cycle is divided into 4 phases and the transitions between the phases are based on events that are unavoidable and can be detected reliably using the sensors available for our exoskeleton. The proposed strategy presents criteria for the initiation and termination of assistance by recognizing user intention, as well as methods to adjust the timing and the amount of assistance corresponding to user preference. When each step starts, the duration of assistance is determined and the torque profile for the whole step is planned ahead. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy for stair ascent and examine its effects on hip joint angle trajectory through experimental results.",

Conversely to classic methods oriented towards sound source localization, audio-based control is a sensor-based framework that does not localize the sound source. Instead, auditory features are used as inputs of a closed-loop control scheme. The audio-based control method presented in this paper relies on the sound signal energy measured by two microphones. By combining the interchannel level difference to the acoustic absolute energy level, the control scheme allows positioning the robot with respect to the sound source at a given distance and orientation. Moreover this method has the benefit of a low computation cost, since it only relies on the signal energy measurement. Experimental results conducted on a mobile robot validate the relevance and the robustness of this approach in dynamic and real world conditions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel control approach for robots that are physically coupled with humans, such as exoskeletons and assisting devices. In contrast with the conventional controllers, where assistance is usually provided indifferently of the configuration of the arm and direction of the motion, we propose a control method that compensates the anisotropic property of the manipulability related to the human arm. Consequently, the assistive behaviour of the proposed method allows the user to perform tasks in arm configurations that are otherwise unsuitable due to the lack of manipulability. In effect, the proposed method transforms the elliptic shape of the force manipulability ellipse to a circular shape in the whole space of human arm configurations. The proposed approach was evaluated by the arm-reaching task that involved pushing of a heavy object on a plane. We tested the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method under several conditions that involved motions with added weight and friction. The results of our study show that the proposed approach significantly improves the human motor control ability and maintains the desired accuracy of the movement.",

        "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks are being increasingly deployed for image classification tasks as they can learn sensor and environmental independence from large quantities of training data. Most, however, have focused on classifying uploaded photographs rather than the often occluded, arbitrary height and camera angles images found commonly in robotic applications. In this work, we look at the performance of the popular AlexNet architecture to detect people in different robotic scenarios using different sensors and/or environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fusing this architecture with the depth-based layered detection system, a more traditional geometric feature-based classifier, leads to significant improvements in classification precision/recall, whether working with depth data alone or a combination of depth and RGB images.",

        "abstract": "Water is a highly abundant nutrient in the human body and monitoring of its regulation is essential to keep the body hydrated. A number of critical health conditions including swelling of the brain and short/long term memory loss are associated with poor or excessive drinking habits. This can be prevented with the use of a real time hydration monitoring system. In this paper we presented AutoHydrate, a wearable hydration monitoring system which continuously monitors the drinking activities and daily fluid requirements of the user through automatic detection of drinking and body activities. The system is built using a throat microphone for collecting acoustic signals, a smartwatch for collecting body activity, an embedded computer for processing the signals and sending recommendation to a smartphone app in real time for an interactive information display. After different time, frequency and cepstral domain features are extracted from the signals, drinking activities are classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and body activity is classified using Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm. The Dietary Reference Intake standard is followed for recommending the amount of fluid required using our detection. Based on our experimental results on 8 subjects, a Drinking detection accuracy of 91.5% and Body activity classification accuracy of 89.12% are obtained. Results show that our system is feasible for real time monitoring of body hydration.",

In this study, we have proposed a nanorobotic manipulation system allowing automated pick-up of CNTs based on visual feedback. We utilize histogram normalization for automatic binarization, and it achieves to clearly distinguish CNTs from substrate and other impurities under different image brightness. Furthermore, we develop the gradient orientation inversion (GOI) algorithm to recognize CNT tip and atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever. Taking full advantages of the geometrical characteristics of CNT and AFM cantilever, GOI is proved to be quite robust. We have designed segment detection method (SDM) to successfully separate the AFM cantilever and CNT, whereas the contact detection between them is achieved by analyzing the straightness variation. Preliminary experimental results imply that our method shows high promise in realistic fabrication of nanodevices.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural microprobes contain hundreds of electrodes within a single shaft. Due to hardware and wiring restrictions, it is usually only possible to measure a small subset of the available electrodes simultaneously. The selection of the best channels is typically performed offline either manually or automatically. However, having a fixed selection for long-term observation does not allow the system to react to changes in the neural activity, and may therefore lead to the loss of important information. In this paper, we formulate the process of autonomously selecting the best subset of electrodes as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationary rewards, thus allowing the probe to adapt its selection policies online. In order to minimize exploratory actions of the probe, we furthermore take advantage of the existing dependencies between neighboring channels. Our approach is an adaptation of the discounted upper confidence bounds (D-UCB) algorithm, and identifies the electrodes providing the largest amount of non-redundant information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online approach for the problem of electrode selection. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our solution is not only able to converge towards an average optimal selection policy, but it is also able to react to changes in the neural activity or to damages of the recording electrodes.",

We address two configuration problems that the typical ROS user is confronted with: i) Determining parameter values and node allocations for maximising performance; ii) Determining node allocations for minimising hardware resources that can guarantee the desired performance. We formalise these problems with a mathematical model, a constrained form of a multiple-choice multiple knapsack problem. We propose a greedy algorithm for optimising each problem, using linear regression for predicting the performance of an individual ROS node over a continuum set of parameter combinations. We evaluate the algorithms through simulation and we validate them in a real ROS scenario, showing that the expected performance levels only deviate from the real measurements by an average of 2.5%.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle performance tests are conducted to evaluate factors of vehicle performance such as fuel consumption and durability. Robotic drivers are often used in these tests to ensure that performance evaluate is reproducible, and various types of vehicles have been tested. Manual transmission (MT) vehicles are widely used and represent about 50% of vehicles in the world. When the driver selects the gear ratio in MT, speed control performance is degraded during changing the gear. Because a torque transmission between the engine and wheels is cut during this sequence, the driver must drive the vehicle while considering the influence of changing the gear. Therefore, control performance in MTs depends on driver's technique. If robotic drivers are used with MT, there is a possibility that performance will be significantly degraded because the robot cannot adjust to change the gear while driving. In this paper, we realized the driving while considering shift changes by the robotic driver. First, we modeled the lack of a driving force using the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and the deceleration during changing the gear. We then derived a target vehicle speed waveform using the lack of a driving force model. Finally, we performed vehicle tests using a robotic driver. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed system from the results of actual vehicle tests.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly employed for the diagnosis and staging of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), mainly due to its non-invasiveness and high availability. High inter-operator variability and a lack of repeatability of current US image acquisition impair the implementation of extensive screening programs for affected patient populations. However, this opens the way to a possible automation of the procedure, and recent works have exploited the use of robotic platforms for US applications, both in diagnostic and interventional scenarios. In this work, we propose a system for autonomous robotic US acquisitions aimed at the quantitative assessment of patients' vessel diameter for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. Using a probabilistic measure of the US quality, we introduce an automatic estimation of the optimal pressure to be applied during the acquisition, and an online optimization of the out-of-plane rotation of the US probe to maximize the visibility of the aorta. We evaluate our method on healthy volunteers and compare the results to manual acquisitions performed by a clinical expert, demonstrating the feasibility of the presented system for AAA screening.",

The main contribution of this work is the use of the elastography modality directly as input of the robot controller. Force measures are also considered in the probe control in order to automatically induce soft tissue deformation needed for real-time elastography imaging process. Moreover, an automatic exploration process is implemented to orient the probe to reach different views of a soft tissue target of interest. This allows to improve the elastogram quality of the element of interest by fusing the information observed from different positions.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Aggregation of self-reconfigurable robotic modules can potentially offer many advantages for robotic locomotion and manipulation. The resulting system could be more reliable and fault-tolerant and provide the necessary flexibility for new tasks and environments. However, self-aggregation of modules is a challenging task, especially when the alignment of the docking parties in a 3D environment involves both position and orientation (6D), since the bases of docking may be non-stationary (e.g., floating in space, underwater, or moving along the ground), and the end-effectors may have accumulated uncertainties due to many dynamically-established connections between modules. This paper presents a new framework for docking in such a context and describes a solution for sensor-guided self-reconfiguration and manipulation with non-fixed bases. The main contributions of the paper include a realistic experiment setting for 6D docking where a modular manipulator is floating or rotating in space with a reaction wheel and searches and docks with a target module using vision. The movement of the docking parties is a combination of floating and manipulation, and the precision of the docking is guided by a sensor located at the tip of the docking interface. The docking itself is planned and executed by a real-time algorithm with a theoretical convergence boundary. This new framework has been tested in a high-fidelity physics-based simulator, as well as by real robotic modules based on SuperBot. Experimental results have shown an average success rate of more than 86.7 percent in a variety of different 6D-docking scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Building robots from soft materials provides opportunities to create more robust and adaptive designs: soft bodies can conform to complex shapes in the environment and they are able to cushion shocks and store elastic energy. The challenge, however, remains to control highly deformable moveable structures effectively. We have proposed that one useful approach is through an autonomous decentralized control using physically coupled mechano-sensory oscillators. We have developed a highly deformable 3-D printed soft robot (PS robot) as a platform to explore the validity of the control strategy. Based on this platform we introduce a caterpillar-like soft-bodied modular-robot that is controlled in a fully decentralized manner. This paper focuses on one of the advantageous characteristics of autonomous decentralized control, i.e., the extensibility/contractibility of the modularity structures. The numerical and experimental results demonstrate that simple oscillators (controllers) can interact with each other by deforming the soft-bodied structure leading to a phase gradient that propagates crawling locomotion. The PS robots provide a powerful platform for exploring this strategy and they can be generalized for use with different robot shapes and material properties.",

Manually assigning labels to new motions to a motion library is time consuming. However, a new motion may be similar to motions in the labeled motion library, and can be mapped to existing labels. We formally define motions, labels, and mappings between motions and labels. We use a NAO humanoid robot as a motivating example, though our approach is general for use on a humanoid robot with rotational joints. We explain how we generate motions and labels, define eight distance metrics to determine the similarity between motions, and use the nearest neighbor algorithm to determine the labels of a new motion. The distance metrics are varied across three axes - Euclidean versus Hausdorff, joint angles versus points of interest (postures), and mirrored versus non-mirrored. We evaluate the efficacy of these eight distance metrics, using precision, recall, and computational complexity.",

We present a model for the robot's motion, and use this model to create a motion controller that allows the robot to move from its current position to any other position on the table in approximately a straight line.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In dynamic environments crowded with people, robot motion planning becomes difficult due to the complex and tightly-coupled interactions between agents. Trajectory planning methods, supported by models of typical human behavior and personal space, often produce reasonable behavior. However, they do not account for the future closed-loop interactions of other agents with the trajectory being constructed. As a consequence, the trajectories are unable to anticipate cooperative interactions (such as a human yielding), or adverse interactions (such as the robot blocking the way). In this paper, we propose a new method for navigation amongst pedestrians in which the trajectory of the robot is not explicitly planned, but instead, a planning process selects one of a set of closed-loop behaviors whose utility can be predicted through forward simulation. In particular, we extend Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) [1] to this domain using the closed-loop behaviors Go-Solo, Follow-other, and Stop. By dynamically switching between these policies, we show that we can improve the performance of the robot as measured by utility functions that reward task completion and penalize inconvenience to other agents. Our evaluation includes extensive results in simulation and real-world experiments.",

Besides their typical applications in fetching, delivery, or escorting, such robots present the opportunity to assist human users in their daily tasks by gathering and reporting up-to-date knowledge about the environment. In this paper, we explore this use case and present an end-to-end framework that enables a mobile robot to answer natural language questions about the state of a large-scale, dynamic environment asked by the inhabitants of that environment. The system parses the question and estimates an initial viewpoint that is likely to contain information for answering the question based on prior environment knowledge. Then, it autonomously navigates towards the viewpoint while dynamically adapting to changes and new information. The output of the system is an image of the most relevant part of the environment that allows the user to obtain an answer to their question. We additionally demonstrate the benefits of a continuously operating information gathering robot by showing how the system can answer retrospective questions about the past state of the world using incidentally recorded sensory data. We evaluate our approach with a custom mobile robot deployed in a university building, with questions collected from occupants of the building. We demonstrate our system's ability to respond to these questions in different environmental conditions.",

In this paper, we present a novel planning framework for generating asymptotically optimal paths for mobile manipulators subject to task constraints. Our approach introduces the Bidirectional Informed RRT* (BI2RRT*) that extends the Informed RRT* [1] towards bidirectional search and satisfaction of end-effector task constraints. In various experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of BI2RRT* for both unconstrained and constrained mobile manipulation planning problems.

By mimicking the backstepping process of the planar case, a feedback controller for the ball-pendulum system is then proposed, tracking motion trajectories for both the position and orientation of the spherical shell of the rolling robot. The validity of the constructed tracking controller is demonstrated by establishing the asymptotic stability of the error dynamics for the closed-loop system.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The work presented herein, attempts to address the problem of designing stepping recovery controllers for compliantly actuated humanoid robots. Based on the decomposition of the stepping procedure into three distinct phases, which are characterized by unique combinations of configurations and impedance levels, the contrivance of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimization process allows for the production of a corresponding number of controllers. The penalties associated with the proposed cost functions, which account for compliant dynamics and balance-related parameters alike, are selected in a systematic manner that facilitates the generation of the appropriate impedance levels required for each particular phase of the stepping motion. Subsequently, the superimposition of gravity compensation control, onto the original LQR controllers, renders them nonlinear and theoretically capable of tracking referential stepping trajectories. The associated referential motor positions are then generated by exploiting a formula relating the Centre-of-Pressure (CoP) to the compliant ankle dynamics, thereby satisfying the balancing constraints whilst also accounting for the system's inherent under-actuation. Thus, the technique's novelty stems from its explicit consideration of flexible joint dynamics and deflection torques, for the design of the desired impedance levels and joint stepping trajectories. The Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) powered COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN), has served as an avatar of the stepping recovery methodology that is expounded in the paper.",

A solution path is thus a sequence of parabola arcs. The originality of the approach is to consider non-sliding constraints at contact points: slipping avoidance is handled by constraining takeoff and landing velocity vectors to 3D friction cones. Furthermore the magnitude of these velocities is bounded. The ballistic motion lying in a vertical plane, we transform the 3D problem into a 2D one. We then solve the motion equations. The solution gives rise to an exact steering method computing a jump path between two contact points while respecting all constraints. The method is integrated into a standard probabilistic roadmap planner. Probabilistic completeness is proven. Simulations illustrate the performance of the approach.",

Impact dynamics are combined with trajectory kinematics and manipulator dynamics to compute the evolving set of states (poses and velocities) of the arm able to achieve the task as the object is flying. Planning is conducted under the arm's dynamic and kinematic constraints. At the time of hit, the robot executes an action to minimize its total energy.

This paper demonstrates a method to create DEA-based biomimetic swimming robots that operate reliably even in conductive liquids. We ensure the insulation of the high-voltage DEA electrodes without degrading actuation performance by laminating silicone layers. A fish and a jellyfish were fabricated and tested in water. The fish robot has a length of 120 mm and a mass of 3.8 g. The jellyfish robot has a 61 mm diameter for a mass of 2.6 g. The measured swimming speeds for a periodic 3 kV drive voltage were \u223c8 mm/s for the fish robot, and \u223c1.5 mm/s for the jellyfish robot.",

        "abstract": "Protecting robot from broken of falling is always a challenge issue for a bipedal humanoid robot in dealing with various locomotion related tasks to serve human society, especially as the assigned tasks turns increasingly complicated and the corresponding real environment gets more and more complex. Unlike several previous successful approaches on humanoid falling control, in this study, a new approach is suggested in the light of how human do when a fall happens. The proposed approach takes a tripod-like falling controller followed by a human-inspired active compliance strategy using joints' active flexion and torque increment. Therefore, robot falling action covers both stages of a fall, i.e. before and after landing impact, so that to reduce the fall damage as far as possible. And the tripod like posture prevents accumulation of kinetic energy, while the active compliance absorbs the impact energy in a tender way. Meanwhile, considering the complexity of robot dynamics, other than taking expert experiences, the proposed human-inspired falling control strategy is parametrically modelled and optimized with policy gradient reinforcement learning. Experiments on both simulation and real robot PKU-HR5.1 are performed, and the results demonstrate this approach is effective and promising.",

One method to generate these patterns is to use an extrapolated center of mass (XcoM) concept and constant zero-moment point (ZMP) patterns. However, center of mass (CoM) patterns generated from such a method have discontinuous ZMP and CoM accelerations. For solving this problem, we propose a method in which continuous ZMP patterns can be simply generated from constant ones. In addition, experimental results of forward walking are presented. The results demonstrate that this pattern generation method can give a starting point for walking robots.",

We developed a blade-type crawler robot with a very simple and reliable mechanism, capable of traversing uneven terrain at high speed, using aerodynamic devices. As these small devices are in the low Reynolds number region, we tested a wing that made use of the ground effect. We experimentally confirmed the success of this approach in improving the traveling speed and ability to traverse uneven terrain. The robot with aerodynamic lift was climbed 1.5 times higher obstacle than without wings.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based, route-following algorithms enable autonomous robots to repeat manually taught paths over long distances using inexpensive vision sensors. However, these methods struggle with long-term, outdoor operation due to the challenges of environmental appearance change caused by lighting, weather, and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance change by using multiple experiences over different environmental conditions, they either provide topological-only localization, require several manually taught experiences in different conditions, or require extensive offline mapping to produce metric localization. For real-world use, we would like to localize metrically to a single manually taught route and gather additional visual experiences during autonomous operations. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-experience localization (MEL) algorithm developed specifically for route-following applications; it provides continuous, six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) localization with relative uncertainty to a privileged (manually taught) path using several experiences simultaneously. We validate our algorithm through two experiments: i) an offline performance analysis on a 9km subset of a challenging 27km route-traversal dataset and ii) an online field trial where we demonstrate autonomy on a small 250m loop over the course of a sunny day. Both exhibit significant appearance change due to lighting variation. Through these experiments we show that safe localization can be achieved by bridging the appearance gap.",

Buzz advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to define swarm behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and of the overall swarm. Single-robot primitives include robot-specific instructions and manipulation of neighborhood data. Swarm-based primitives allow for the dynamic management of robot teams, and for sharing information globally across the swarm. Self-organization stems from the completely decentralized mechanisms upon which the Buzz run-time platform is based. The language can be extended to add new primitives (thus supporting heterogeneous robot swarms), and its run-time platform is designed to be laid on top of other frameworks, such as the Robot Operating System. We showcase the capabilities of Buzz by providing code examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of the run-time platform through realistic simulated experiments with representative swarm algorithms.",

B\u00e9zier curve based optimization represents passive neural control supported by evolutionary algorithm for representing the relationship equation between neuron signal and reference joint signal. Passive neural control is implemented in order to reduce the neuron complexity in neuro-based locomotion by controlling 3 joints with one signal without decreasing the performance both in walking pattern and in its stability level, whereas one leg is represented by one motor neuron. Therefore, the 4 legged robot is controlled by 4 motor neurons which have feedback connection with ground and inertial sensor. In order to prove the effectiveness, we implemented the model in computer simulation and in a small 4 legged robot. This model can decrease the computational cost so it is possible to apply the model in either animal or humanoid robot with low frequency processor.",

        "abstract": "The study of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) has attracted much attention in recent years. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no single software platform exists for researchers to perform different types of analyses for CDPRs of arbitrary structure. In this paper, the Cable-robot Analysis and Simulation Platform for Research (CASPR) of CDPRs is introduced. Using this platform, arbitrary types and structures of CDPRs, such as single and multi-link CDPRs, can be studied for a wide range of analyses, including kinematics, dynamics, control and workspace analysis. CASPR achieves this using a general CDPR model representation and an abstracted software architecture. Moveover, CDPRs can be defined using Extensible Markup Language (XML) with out-of-the-box availability of an extensive range of robots and analysis tools. The open-source platform aims to provide both a communal environment for the researchers to use and add models and algorithms to. The example case studies demonstrate the potential to perform analysis on CDPRs, directly compare algorithms and conveniently add new models and analyses.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Cheap RGB-D sensors are ubiquitous in robotics. They typically contain a consumer-grade color camera that suffers from significant optical nonlinearities, often referred to as vignetting effects. For example, in Asus Xtion Live Pro cameras the pixels in the corners are two times darker than those in the center of the image. This deteriorates the visual appearance of 3D maps built with such cameras. We propose a simple calibration method that only requires a sheet of white paper as a calibration object and allows to reliably recover the vignetting response of a camera. We demonstrate calibration results for multiple popular RGB-D sensors and show that removal of vignetting effects using a nonparametric response model results in improved color coherence of the reconstructed maps. Furthermore, we show how to effectively compensate color variations caused by automatic white balance and exposure time control of the camera.",

        "abstract": "Multi-camera clusters used for visual SLAM assume a fixed calibration between the cameras, which places many limitations on its performance, and directly excludes all configurations where a camera in the cluster is mounted to a moving component. In this work, we present a calibration method for dynamic multi-camera clusters, where one or more of the cluster cameras is mounted to an actuated mechanism, such as a gimbal or robotic manipulator. Our calibration approach parametrizes the actuated mechanism using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention, then determines the calibration parameters which allow for the estimation of the time varying extrinsic transformations between camera frames. We validate our calibration approach using a dynamic camera cluster consisting of a static camera and a camera mounted to a pan-tilt unit, and demonstrate that the dynamic camera cluster can provide accurate tracking when used to perform SLAM.",

Indeed, unit sphere is becoming a natural space for projecting images captured from the central cameras (conventional and non-conventional cameras, as omnidirectional camera) and obtaining the spherical images. The proposed method relies on representing the spherical images into a 3D space based on image intensities. Spherical harmonic coefficients are then calculated for the 3D mesh surfaces and used to estimate an initial rotation between the underlying spherical images in spectral domain. The optimal rotation is then refined through the ICP algorithm. Experimental results, using synthetic and real image dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for rotation estimation, as well as its robustness against real conditions and images occlusion. A comparison between the proposed method and competitive ones, is performed.",

This research proposes a kind of modularized self-adaptive toe mechanism inspired by cat claws to improve the extremities' contact performance for legged robot. The mechanism is constructed with four-bar linkage actuated by contact reaction force and retracted by applied spring tension. A feasible mechanical design based on several essential parameters is introduced and an integrated Sole-Toe prototype is built for experimental evaluation. Mechanical self-adaption and actual contact performance on specific surface have been evaluated respectively on a biped walking platform and a bench-top mechanical testing.",

        "abstract": "Several self-assembly systems have been developed in recent years, where depending on the capabilities of the building blocks and the controlability of the environment, the assembly process is guided typically through either a fully centralized or a fully distributed control approach. In this work, we present a novel experimental system for studying the range of fully centralized to fully distributed control strategies. The system is built around the floating 3-cm-sized Lily robots, and comprises a water-filled tank with peripheral pumps, an overhead camera, an overhead projector, and a workstation capable of controlling the fluidic flow field, setting the ambient luminosity, communicating with the robots over radio, and visually tracking their trajectories. We carry out several experiments to characterize the system and validate its capabilities. First, a statistical analysis is conducted to show that the system is governed by reaction diffusion dynamics, and validate the applicability of the standard chemical kinetics modeling. Additionally, the natural tendency of the system for structure formation subject to different flow fields is investigated and corresponding implications on guiding the self-assembly process are discussed. Finally, two control approaches are studied: 1) a fully distributed control approach and 2) a distributed approach with additional central supervision exhibiting an improved performance. The formation time statistics are compared and a discussion on the generalization of the method is provided.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about underpinning long-term operations of fleets of vehicles using visual localisation. In particular it examines ways in which vehicles, considered as independent agents, can share, update and leverage each others' visual experiences in a mutually beneficial way. We draw on our previous work in Experience-based Navigation (EBN) [1], in which a visual map supporting multiple representations of the same place is built, yielding real-time localisation capability for a solitary vehicle. We now consider how any number of such agents might operate in concert via data sharing policies that are germane to the shared task of lifelong localisation. We rapidly construct considerable maps by the conjoining of work distributed to asynchronous processes, and share expertise amongst the team by the selective dispensing of mission-specific map contents. We demonstrate and evaluate our system against 100km of data collected in North Oxford over a period of a month featuring diverse deviation in appearance due to atmospheric, lighting, and structural dynamics. We show that our framework is capable of creating maps in a fraction of the time required by single-agent EBN, with no significant loss in localisation robustness, and is able to furnish robots on real-world forays with maps which require much less storage.",

        "abstract": "Object detection is an essential task for autonomous robots operating in dynamic and changing environments. A robot should be able to detect objects in the presence of sensor noise that can be induced by changing lighting conditions for cameras and false depth readings for range sensors, especially RGB-D cameras. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive fusion approach for object detection that learns weighting the predictions of different sensor modalities in an online manner. Our approach is based on a mixture of convolutional neural network (CNN) experts and incorporates multiple modalities including appearance, depth and motion. We test our method in extensive robot experiments, in which we detect people in a combined indoor and outdoor scenario from RGB-D data, and we demonstrate that our method can adapt to harsh lighting changes and severe camera motion blur. Furthermore, we present a new RGB-D dataset for people detection in mixed in- and outdoor environments, recorded with a mobile robot.",

Gaits have clear implications to robotic control strategy, efficiency, and stability. However, while several climbing robotic systems have been described as achieving `running', the question of whether distinct dynamic gaits exist and what classifies these gaits has not been rigorously explored. In this paper, by applying definitions developed in the horizontal regime, we show evidence of three distinct gaits as well as discuss the implications of these gaits on the development of dynamic climbing systems.",

        "abstract": "Micromanipulation of individual biological cells, such as embryos during preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is a delicate and time-consuming task. Two major procedures in PGD include the rotation of the embryo to gain a more favorable position for zona breaching, and the extraction of a blastomere after an opening has been made in the zona pellucida. Rotation tracking of cleavage-stage embryos has not been reported given their lack of distinctive features. In this manuscript, a geometric model for partially determining the three dimensional (3-D) angular position of 2-cell embryos using two dimensional (2-D) microscopic brightfield images was derived and verified using a computer generated model. This model was then applied using computer vision algorithms on a rotating cleavage-stage mouse embryo, demonstrating partial 3-D rotation tracking. Furthermore, embryo micromanipulation tasks are typically performed manually using micropipettes. Technological advances have made automation of these tasks possible. This manuscript also presents computer vision algorithms for the segmentation and calibration of micropipettes. The calibration procedure allowed automated position control of the micropipettes without the need for real-time vision feedback using micropipette recognition algorithms, and effective position control was verified using semi-automated blastomere extraction experiments. This manuscript presents preliminary work towards the automation of cell manipulation procedures.",

Starting from the nominal inverse kinematic model a complete model to take into account geometric errors on the axes of the revolute joints is obtained in closed form. Numerical simulations compare the results from the nominal and real design to show relevant changes and to confirm the statistical nonlinear nature of the problem. Finally, an application to the elastodynamics is provided to verify the influence of the constraint errors on the frequency range.",

The convection cell dynamic growth was controlled with the laser beam exposure time. Then, selected particles, glass beads ranging from 150 up to 212 \u03bcm, were dragged by small convection flows without reaching undesired particles.

In this work we take advantage of the close synergy between user and robot in co-robotic systems to better diagnose and overcome configuration failures. We leverage users' understanding of the system to mark failures they observe while the system is in operation. A marked failure indicates that the robot either \u201cdid not do something when it should have\u201d or \u201cdid something when it should not have\u201d. The failure marking is coupled with an automated analysis approach that identifies code predicates involving configuration parameters that may be relevant to each failure type, ranks the parameters according to their potential to be associated with the failure, and suggests adjustments based on the run-time outcome of those predicates. We present the approach, its implementation, and a preliminary study on a configurable unmanned air system. The results show how the approach can successfully help diagnose and adjust faulty configuration parameters in co-robotic systems.",

We formulate large-scale robotic manipulation problems as multi-level optimization, incorporating task, action, and motion planning. We develop an integrated planning approach for solving this optimization problem and generating a combined motion plan for a robot to optimize a task-level objective. This approach utilizes a combinatorial search algorithm for task planning and incrementally exploits information from lower-level optimization to improve the high-level task plan. Empirical results show that this integrated approach not only significantly outperforms a traditional top-down approach in solution quality, but also avoids infeasible lower-level motion plans.",

Small insects like cockroaches can rapidly right themselves when upside down, yet small fast-running legged robots are much less capable of ground-based self-righting. Inspired by the discoid cockroach that opens its wings to push against the ground to self-right, we designed actuated wings for robot self-righting based on recently-developed rounded shells for obstacle traversal [1]. We measured the self-righting performance of a robot using these actuated wings, and systematically studied the effects and trade-offs of wing opening magnitude, speed, symmetry, and wing geometry. Our study provided a proof-of-concept that robots can take advantage of an existing body structure (rounded shell) in novel ways (as actuated wings) to serve new locomotor functions, analogous to biological exaptations [2]. Our results demonstrated that the robot self-rights dynamically, with active wing pushing followed by passive falling, and benefits from increasing kinetic energy by pushing faster and longer.

        "abstract": "Flying and walking robots can use their complementary features in terms of viewpoint and payload capability to the best in a heterogeneous team. To this end, we present our online collaborative navigation framework for unknown and challenging terrain. The method leverages the flying robot's onboard monocular camera to create both a map of visual features for simultaneous localization and mapping and a dense representation of the environment as an elevation map. This shared knowledge from the flying platform enables the walking robot to localize itself against the global map, and plan a global path to the goal by interpreting the elevation map in terms of traversability. While following the planned path, the absolute pose corrections are fused with the legged state estimation and the elevation map is continuously updated with distance measurements from an onboard laser range sensor. This allows the legged robot to safely navigate towards the goal while taking into account any changes in the environment. In this setup, our approach is independent of external localization, relative observations between the robots, and does not require an initial guess about the pose of the robots. The presented methods are fully integrated and we demonstrate their capabilities in an experiment with a hexacopter and a quadrupedal robot.",

For agents with identical sensing capability, the proposed strategy defines a time-varying multi-agent formation on a Lissajous curve, which completes the aforementioned tasks in finite time with collision free paths for all agents in a 2-D rectangular region. This obviates the need for sensing and communication for collision avoidance among agents. A sufficient upper limit on agent dimensions that ensures collision free motion is derived. An algorithm is developed for choosing the number of agents and optimal Lissajous curve for a prescribed rectangle and agents' sensing capability. The optimal Lissajous curve is chosen to minimize the time period for repeated coverage and maximize the upper bound on agent size. The proposed algorithm is validated through computer simulations and experiments using differential drive robots.",

For this, we consider the combined use of a force/torque sensor mounted at the robot base and of a model-based virtual sensor. The virtual sensor is provided by the residual vector commonly used for collision detection and isolation in human-robot interaction. Integrating the two types of measurement tools provides an efficient way to estimate all unknown quantities, using also the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for dynamic computations. Different operative conditions are considered, including the special cases of pointwise interaction (pure contact force), known contact location, and of a base sensor measuring only forces. We highlight also the conditions for a correct estimation to be fully virtual, i.e., without resorting to a force/torque sensor. Realistic simulations assess the estimation performance for a 7R robot in motion, subject to an unknown external force applied to an unknown location.",

        "abstract": "Given the current capabilities of autonomous vehicles, one can easily imagine autonomy released on the road in the near future. However, it can be assumed that the transition will not be instantaneous, meaning they will have to be capable of driving well in a mixed environment, with both humans and other autonomous vehicles on the road. This leaves a number of concerns for autonomous vehicles in terms of dealing with human uncertainty and understanding of cooperation on the road. This work demonstrates the need for focusing on communication and collaboration between autonomy and human drivers. After analyzing how drivers perform cooperative maneuvers (e.g. lane changing), key cues were identified for conveying intent through nonverbal communication. It was found that human observers can predict lane changes with over two seconds in prior to the lane departure, without use of a turning signal. Building on this concept, an autonomous control scheme is proposed that aims to capture these subtle motions before executing a lane change. To compare the proposed human-inspired methods, three possible control schemes for autonomous vehicles are implemented for a validation study on human subjects to provide feedback on their experience. By properly conveying intent through nuanced trajectory planning, we show that drivers can predict the autonomous vehicle's actions with 40% increase in prediction time when compared to traditional control methods, both as a passenger and while observing the autonomous vehicle.",

However, when communication takes place over wireless networks, stringent bandwidth limits apply. These limits raise the need for efficient utilisation of available communication resources in a manner that balances information gathering utility with communication costs or limits. In our previous work, we introduced the dynamic information flow (DIF) problem as a general formulation of this trade-off. We introduced two variants of the problem addressing the issue of communication efficiency for data fusion only. In this paper, we extend one of the variants to address communication efficiency for both data fusion and cooperative decision making in a synergistic manner. We present a solution to this new variant that integrates a multi-cast routing algorithm with information structure optimisation. This solution allows teams that involve high-data-rate sensors and tight coordination to respect bandwidth limits. Through several simulations we verify that our solution significantly reduces bandwidth usage of such teams while maintaining information gathering performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "With the accelerated development of robot technologies, optimal control becomes one of the central themes of research. In traditional approaches, the controller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the basis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions, objectives, learning schemes, and so forth. While very successful with classical robots, these methods run into severe difficulties when applied to soft robots, a new field of robotics with large interest for human-robot interaction. We claim that a novel controller paradigm opens new perspective for this field. This paper applies a recently developed neuro controller with differential extrinsic synaptic plasticity to a muscle-tendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit. In the experiments, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when left alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses. By applying physical forces, the system can be entrained into definite motion patterns like wiping a table. Most interestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional resonance with the object's internal dynamics, starting to shake spontaneously bottles half-filled with water or sensitively driving an attached pendulum into a circular mode. When attached to the crank of a wheel the neural system independently develops to rotate it. In this way, the robot discovers affordances of objects its body is interacting with.",

        "abstract": "We develop a novel approach for decision making under uncertainty in high-dimensional state spaces, considering both active unfocused and focused inference, where in the latter case reducing the uncertainty of only a subset of variables is of interest. State of the art approaches typically first calculate the posterior information (or covariance) matrix, followed by its determinant calculation, and do so separately for each candidate action. In contrast, using the generalized matrix determinant lemma, we avoid calculating these posteriors and determinants of large matrices. Furthermore, as our key contribution we introduce the concept of calculation re-use, performing a onetime computation that depends on state dimensionality and system sparsity, after which evaluating the impact of each candidate action no longer depends on state dimensionality. Such a concept is derived for both active focused and unfocused inference, leading to general, non-myopic and exact approaches that are faster by orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. We verify our approach experimentally in two scenarios, sensor deployment (focused and unfocused) and measurement selection in visual SLAM, and show its superiority over standard techniques.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time, kinodynamic planning and information-theoretic exploration framework that enables high-resolution mapping of three-dimensional environments featuring complex concavities and disjoint objects. The proposed approach targets planetary exploration applications and seeks to achieve real-time operation on computationally constrained systems while ensuring energy-efficient information acquisition. Trajectories are selected by maximizing a measure of information gain per an expected execution cost (e.g., time or energy). The proposed trajectory generation formulation is based on state-lattice motion primitives and evaluation of the Cauchy-Schwarz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI) at each lattice state. An expanded search structure is proposed that extends the state-lattice to a finite horizon to enable expansive space coverage while remaining real-time viable. Additionally, compression techniques are employed to reduce the computational burden associated with the CSQMI calculation over expansive environments while preserving fidelity. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulated exploration of a three-dimensional terrestrial pit environment by a quadrotor aerial robot which acts as a surrogate for a propulsive vehicle when operating on an airless body.",

Such a system is implemented in a proof of concept scenario relying on a (MO)MDP decision framework that takes advantage of an eye-tracker device to estimate the cognitive availability of the human operator, and, some human operator's inputs to deduce where he is focusing his attention. An experiment was conducted with ten participants interacting with a team of autonomous vehicles in a Search & Rescue scenario. Our results demonstrate the advantages of considering the cognitive availability of a human operator in such a complex context and also the interest of using such a decisional framework that can formally integrate the non-deterministic outcomes which model the human behavior.",

In this paper, we introduce a control structure, which merges an arbitrary desired robot behavior with given constraints. Using a quadratic program (QP), control barrier functions (CBFs) are combined with an arbitrary nominal control law, which determines the desired behavior. The CBFs enforce the constraints, overruling nominal control whenever necessary. We show that the concept is applicable with arbitrary numbers of constraints and any nominal control law. In order to illustrate the capabilities of the approach, the control scheme is applied to an anthropomorphic manipulator, which is constrained by static as well as moving constraints.",

        "abstract": "This work exploits modeling spatial correlation in 2.5D data using Gaussian Processes (GPs), and produces constrained sampling realizations on these models to improve certainty in the predictions by means of integrating additional sparse information. Data organized in 2.5D such as elevation and thickness maps has been extensively studied in the fields of robotics and geostatistics. These maps are typically represented as a probabilistic 2D grid that stores an estimated value (height or thickness) for each cell. With the increasing popularity and deployment of robotic devices for infrastructure inspection, 2.5D data becomes a common interpretation of the condition of the target being inspected. Modeling the spatial dependencies and making inferences on new grid locations is a common task that has been addressed using GPs, but inference results on locations which are weakly correlated with the training data are generally not sufficiently informative and distinctly uncertain. The predictive capability of the proposed framework, which is applicable to any 2.5D data, is demonstrated with field inspection data from pipelines. Specifically, sparse and complementary measurements from alternative sensing modalities have been incorporated into the model to predict in more detail local thickness conditions where GP training data is limited. The output of this work aims to probabilistically present variations of the target in the case that both accuracy and reasonable diversity are of significant interest.",

The ability to detect and estimate the positions and directions of these contact points is crucial for monitoring the progress of the task, and detecting failures. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for detecting and localizing contacts between a grasped object and the environment using tactile sensing. We explore framing the contact localization as both a regression and a classification problem and train neural networks accordingly to estimate the contact parameters. We also compare the neural networks with Gaussian process regression and support vector machine classification with spatio-temporal hierarchical matching pursuit feature learning. We evaluate the presented approach using hundreds of contact events on eighteen objects with different shapes, sizes and material properties. The experiments show that the neural network approach can learn to localize contact events for individual objects with a mean absolute error of less than 2.5 cm for the positions and less than 10\u00b0 for the directions.",

        "abstract": "Achieving high spatial resolution in contact sensing for robotic manipulation often comes at the price of increased complexity in fabrication and integration. One traditional approach is to fabricate a large number of taxels, each delivering an individual, isolated response to a stimulus. In contrast, we propose a method where the sensor simply consists of a continuous volume of piezoresistive elastomer with a number of electrodes embedded inside. We measure piezoresistive effects between all pairs of electrodes in the set, and count on this rich signal set containing the information needed to pinpoint contact location with high accuracy using regression algorithms. In our validation experiments, we demonstrate submillimeter median accuracy in locating contact on a 10mm by 16mm sensor using only four electrodes (creating six unique pairs). In addition to extracting more information from fewer wires, this approach lends itself to simple fabrication methods and makes no assumptions about the underlying geometry, simplifying future integration on robot fingers.",

We consider making or breaking contact as the most abstract, yet representative element of a manipulation task. Using this paradigm, a robotic manipulation planner has been developed. Given an environment with robots and objects, a manipulation graph is generated by a set of rules and the available geometrical information. Next, the object manipulation planning is formulated as a graph search problem. Paths on this graph divide a complex manipulation task into sub-tasks, followed by low-level path planning and controller assignment for each sub-task. By sequentially executing these controllers in a hybrid fashion, one achieves the overall manipulation task.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the detection of pedestrian crossing intention to improve the situation awareness for autonomous driving in urban environments. A new definition of pedestrian crossing intention is discussed, which allows self-driving vehicles to identify pedestrians, whose intended actions are relevant for the own behavior planning, at an early stage. We propose a context-based feature descriptor in combination with a SVM classifier for detecting this. The descriptor captures the movement of a pedestrian relative to the road and the spatial layout of other scene elements in a generic manner. The performance of the feature descriptor is evaluated in relation to various SVM setups. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with data captured on-board of a vehicle in real inner-city traffic. The evaluation of the classification results confirms, that context-based data is a promising indicator for pedestrian crossing intention and that the proposed feature descriptor is capable of representing this. It is further shown that a lack of information about the pedestrian's posture and body movement results in a delayed detection of the pedestrians changing their crossing intention when compared to a human observer.",

In order to validate driving decisions, it is possible to maintain at all times a contingency maneuver, which transfers the vehicle to a safe standstill, if other decision making processes fail. In this paper we present a motion planner, which computes contingency maneuvers for an automated vehicle in a 0.1[s] time frame. A discrete set of motion primitives is assembled in a heuristic best-first search. In order to speed up the search, an obstacle sensitive heuristic is applied, which maintains properties of bounded sub-optimality and completeness. A run-time comparison with and without the obstacle sensitive heuristic is presented on two exemplary collision avoidance scenarios.",

The paper presents an implementation of iterative Linear Quadratic regulator (iLQR) based optimal control framework to control an anthropomorphic arm with each joint actuated by an agonist-antagonistic pair of Mckibben artificial muscles. The method is applied to positioning tasks and generation of explosive movements by maximizing the link speed. It is then compared to traditional control strategies to justify that optimal control is effective in controlling the position in highly non-linear pneumatic systems. Also the importance of varying compliance is highlighted by repeating the tasks at different compliance level. The algorithm validation is reported here by several simulations and hardware experiments in which the shoulder and elbow flexion are controlled simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a bilateral tele-operation scheme for cooperative aerial manipulation in which a human operator drives a team of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aerial vehicles, that grasped an object beforehand, and receives a force feedback depending on the states of the system. For application scenarios in which dexterous manipulation by each robot is not necessary, we propose using a rigid tool attached to the vehicle through a passive spherical joint, equipped with a simple adhesive mechanism at the tool-tip that can stick to the grasped object. Having more than two robots, we use the extra degrees of freedom to find the optimal force allocation in term of minimum power and forces smoothness. The human operator commands a desired trajectory for the robot team through a haptic interface to a pose controller, and the output of the pose controller along with system constraints, e.g., VTOL limited forces and contact maintenance, defines the feasible set of forces. Then, an on-line optimization allocates forces by minimizing a cost function of forces and their variation. Finally, propeller thrusts are computed by a dedicated attitude and thrust controller in a decentralized fashion. Human/Hardware in the loop simulation study shows efficiency of the proposed scheme, and the importance of haptic feedback to achieve a better performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of cooperative aerial transportation of an object using a team of quadrotors. The approach presented to solve this problem accounts for the full dynamics of the system and it is inspired by the literature on reconfigurable cable-driven parallel robots (RCDPR). Using the modelling convention of RCDPR it is derived a direct relation between the motion of the quadrotors and the motion of the payload. This relation makes explicit the available internal motion of the system, which can be used to automatically achieve additional tasks. The proposed method does not require to specify a priory the forces in the cables and uses a tension distribution algorithm to optimally distribute them among the robots. The presented framework is also suitable for online teleoperation. Physical simulations with a human-in-the-loop validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic movement primitives prove to be a useful and effective way to represent a movement of a given agent. However, the original DMP formulation does not take the interaction among multiple agents into the consideration. Thus, many researchers focus on the development of a coupling term for the underlying dynamical system and its associated learning strategies. The result is highly dependent on the quality of the learning methods. In this paper, we present a new way to formulate and realize interactive movement primitive in a leader-follower configuration, where the relationship between the follower and the leader is explicitly represented via the new formulation. This new formulation does not only simplify the learning process, but it also meets the requirements of several applications. We separately tested our new formulation in the context of the handover task and the wiping task. The results prove the flexibility and simplicity of the new formulation.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of robotics, dual-arm robots have been more and more widely used. Compared with the traditional single manipulator, it is very challenging for a dual-arm robot in modelling, planning and control. In this paper, we propose two compliance control methods for dual arm coordination to meet different requirements of fine manipulation tasks, such as payload carrying, assembly and repairing. The first method is called master-slave force control strategy, and the second is shared force control strategy. For the former, the desired trajectory and operational force of master arm are given in advance. Then that of slave arm are calculated from the closed-chain constraint equation. On the contrary, the two arms can be controlled in shared mode, that is to say, the desired trajectory and operational force of the end-effectors of dual arms are decomposed from the closed-chain constraint equation directly. The coordinated kinematic and dynamic equations of dual-arm robot system are established by considering the closed-chain constraint relationship. According to the force balance equation of the objective payload, the common force is decomposed into the desired end-effector force of each manipulator. Finally, the control algorithms are verified by simulation and experiment.",

The model consists of a pair of \u201cphysically-unconnected\u201d Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulums (SLIPs), each representing a part of the body of a quadruped (see Figure 1). For this model, we propose a spatio-temporal coordination controller that describes the evolution of coordination parameters by simple difference equations. A \u201ctime-aware\u201d deadbeat low-level controller is also proposed to realizing the generated control specifications in each SLIP individually. Evaluation of the proposed coordination controller for the Dual-SLIP model in simulation shows that even with remarkably off-phase initial conditions and ground height variation disturbances, quadrupedal bounding, pronking and different transitions between them can be realized.",

We present an approach that is able to learn a set of continuous action parameters and relational forward models from the robot's own experience. We formalize our approach as simultaneously clustering experiences in a continuous and a relational representation. Our experiments in a simulated manipulation experiment show that this form of coupled subsymbolic and symbolic learning is required for the robot to acquire task-relevant action capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous service mobile robots need to consistently, accurately, and robustly localize in human environments despite changes to such environments over time. Episodic non-Markov Localization addresses the challenge of localization in such changing environments by classifying observations as arising from Long-Term, Short-Term, or Dynamic Features. However, in order to do so, EnML relies on an estimate of the Long-Term Vector Map (LTVM) that does not change over time. In this paper, we introduce a recursive algorithm to build and update the LTVM over time by reasoning about visibility constraints of objects observed over multiple robot deployments. We use a signed distance function (SDF) to filter out observations of short-term and dynamic features from multiple deployments of the robot. The remaining long-term observations are used to build a vector map by robust local linear regression. The uncertainty in the resulting LTVM is computed via Monte Carlo resampling the observations arising from long-term features. By combining occupancy-grid based SDF filtering of observations with continuous space regression of the filtered observations, our proposed approach builds, updates, and amends LTVMs over time, reasoning about all observations from all robot deployments in an environment. We present experimental results demonstrating the accuracy, robustness, and compact nature of the extracted LTVMs from several long-term robot datasets.",

This paper presents a comparative study for actuation by undulation in water. We focus on actuating a 1DOF systems with several mechanisms. A hydraulic pump attached to a soft body allows for water movement between two inner cavities, ultimately leading to a flexing actuation in a side-to-side manner. The effectiveness of six different, self-contained designs based on centrifugal pump, flexible impeller pump, external gear pump and rotating valves are compared. These hydraulic actuation systems combined with soft test bodies were then measured at a lower and higher oscillation frequency. The deflection characteristics of the soft body, the acoustic noise of the pump and the overall efficiency of the system are recorded. A brushless, centrifugal pump combined with a novel rotating valve performed at both test frequencies as the most efficient pump, producing sufficiently large cyclic body deflections along with the least acoustic noise among all pumps tested. An external gear pump design produced the largest body deflection, but consumes an order of magnitude more power and produced high noise levels. Further refinement remains on determining the suitable oscillation frequencies and inner cavity designs for optimal efficiency and movement.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that reward shaping can greatly benefit learning in multi-robot exploration tasks. We propose a novel reward framework based on the idea of counterfactuals to tackle the coordination problem in tightly coupled domains. We show that the proposed algorithm provides superior performance (166% performance improvement and a quadruple convergence speed up) compared to policies learned using either the global reward or the difference reward [1].",

The study of robotic regrasping has generally been limited to use of theoretical analytical models and cases with little uncertainty. Analytical models and simulations have so far proven unable to capture the complexity of the real world. Empirical statistical models are more promising, but collecting good data is difficult. In this paper, we collect data from 3300 robot regrasps, and use this data to learn two probability functions: 1) The probability that the object is still in the robot's hand after a regrasp action; and 2) The probability distribution of the object pose after the regrasp given that the object is still grasped. Both of these functions are learned using kernel density estimation with a similarity metric over object pose. We show that our data-driven models achieve comparable accuracy to a geometric model and an off-the-shelf simulator in classification and prediction tasks, while also enabling us to predict probability distributions.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces a framework to compute decision making policies (mission planning) for a UAV-based delivery system serving impatient customers. Customers arrive on a finite number of locations L separated by arbitrary but fixed distances and eventually leave if not served. Policies seek to minimize the average net cost (maximize the average net revenue), i.e. loss from customers' abandonment deprived of the revenue from successful services. We introduce a novel model for the stochastic and dynamic pickup and delivery problem based on semi-Markov decision processes, and show the dependence of the optimal average net cost on the minimum distance between locations \u03b4. Furthermore, we propose a feature-based state aggregation method to overcome the curse of dimensionality due to the exact modeling. The selection of relevant features is based on their correlation with the optimal performance. We show that the distance to the nearest pickup location dominates on other features for almost all \u03b4. Based on this observation, we introduce the policy nearest neighbor or none, a policy with computational complexity O(L3) in many cases of interest. We show that this policy performs considerably better that the nearest neighbor (greedy) policy, and reaches the optimum for some \u03b4.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we model an aerial vehicle, specifically a quadrotor, and a load attached to each other by a rigid link. We assume a torque input at the joint between the aerial vehicle and the rigid link is available. After modeling, we decouple the system dynamics in two separate subsystems, one concerning the position of the center of mass, which we control independently from the chosen torque input; and a second subsystem, concerning the attitude of the rigid link, which we control by appropriately designing a torque control law. Differential flatness is used to show that controlling these two separate systems is equivalent to controlling the complete system. We design control laws for the quadrotor thrust, the quadrotor angular velocity and the torque input, and provide convergence proofs that guarantee that the quadrotor follows asymptotically a desired position trajectory while the manipulator follows a desired orientation. Simulation and experimental works are presented which validate the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Graph-based SLAM approaches have had success recently despite suffering from ever-increasing computational costs due to the need of optimizing over the entire robot trajectory. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate the decoupling of marginalization (node removal) and sparsification (edge reduction) to allow for short-term retention of dense factors induced by marginalization while enabling us to spread the computation of these two operations over time. In particular, we analytically show that during marginalization, the correct choice of linearization points in constructing dense marginal factors is to use the relative (local), instead of global, state estimates in the Markov blanket of the marginalized node, which has lacked a general consensus in the literature. Furthermore, during sparsification, we determine an online sparse topology through sparsity-regularized convex optimization, which guides us to construct consistent sparse factors to best approximate the original dense factors across the Markov blanket. The proposed approach is tested extensively on both 2D and 3D public datasets and shown to perform competitively to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for parallel-jaw grasping of isolated objects from depth images, under large gripper pose uncertainty. Whilst most approaches aim to predict the single best grasp pose from an image, our method first predicts a score for every possible grasp pose, which we denote the grasp function. With this, it is possible to achieve grasping robust to the gripper's pose uncertainty, by smoothing the grasp function with the pose uncertainty function. Therefore, if the single best pose is adjacent to a region of poor grasp quality, that pose will no longer be chosen, and instead a pose will be chosen which is surrounded by a region of high grasp quality. To learn this function, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which takes as input a single depth image of an object, and outputs a score for each grasp pose across the image. Training data for this is generated by use of physics simulation and depth image simulation with 3D object meshes, to enable acquisition of sufficient data without requiring exhaustive real-world experiments. We evaluate with both synthetic and real experiments, and show that the learned grasp score is more robust to gripper pose uncertainty than when this uncertainty is not accounted for.",

In this work, we present a deep learning based approach to predict exit locations of buildings. This technique exploits the inherent structure of buildings to create a model. A convolutional neural network is trained using a database of building blueprints and used to guide a search within a building. This technique is compared to standard frontier exploration and a traditional image processing approach of extracting features through histogram of gradients (HOG) and training a support vector machine (SVM). After validation through simulation, we show that the proposed deep learning technique reduces the amount of building exploration required to find the goal by 36%.",

Compared with traditional DLP 3D printers that use a low-cost off-the-shelf consumer projector and a single vertical carriage, the platform of our delta DLP 3D printer can also move horizontally in the plane. We show that this structure allows the printer to have a larger printing area than the projection area of a projector. Our system can print 3D models much larger than traditional DLP 3D printers. The major challenge to realize delta 3D printing with large size comes from how to partition an arbitrary planar polygonal shape (possibly with holes or multiple disjoint polygons) into a minimum number of rectangles with fixed size, which is NP-hard. We propose a simple yet efficient approximation algorithm to solve this problem. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(n3 log n), where n is the number of edges in the polygonal shape. A physical prototype system is built and several large 3D models with complex geometric structures have been printed as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Intrinsically stretchable, biphasic, gallium-based metal films embedded in an elastomeric substrate allow for extremely thin (<50 \u00b5m) and skin-conforming wearable sensors with outstanding robustness. The sensors sustain repeated cycling to 50% strain and are insensitive to normal pressure up to 100 kPa. Following a calibration phase, we recorded flexions of a human finger using the soft sensors and compared their joint angle estimation to that of a commercial marker-based visual motion tracking system. The accuracy of our system (defined as the mean angular deviation between our sensors' output and the reference system) was below 9\u00b0 over a set of 11 different grasping and motion tasks. We demonstrate the scalability and wearability of our technology with a three-finger sensing system used to track the fine movements of a pianist hand. Our soft technology is a promising candidate for implementation of truly wearable proprioceptive sensing systems.",

Each WDM contains a flexible backbone and a set of wires. The backbone bending is controlled by pulling the wires. The stiffness of the outer WDM is controllable and dominants that of the overlapped section. Therefore, in the overlapped section the inner WDM conforms to the shape of the outer WDM and the tip of the outer WDM serves as the base of the distal separate section of the inner WDM. Compared with conventional flexible mechanisms, i.e., tendon/wire/cable-driven mechanism and concentric tube mechanism, the CWM has a much wider workspace. This advantage is demonstrated by simulations based on kinematic modeling. A prototype is developed and the preliminary experimental results validate the design concept.",

The proposed structure consists of a non-circular cam, a roller which moves along outer circumference of the cam, and a stretched translational linear spring which is connected between center of the cam and center of the roller. We obtain a set of differential equations to design shape of the cam for any given torque-angle profile. Also, it will be shown that profiles with both positive and negative values can be implemented by the proposed method. At last, the cam of some popular nonlinear springs are designed, including constant, cubic, hyperbolic tangent and sinusoidal springs.",

The proposed manipulator has 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) and enables physical interaction on the sides, as well as below the aerial robot. The design parameters of the manipulator are chosen such that it achieves large and singularity-free workspace in combination with high dexterity. A Global Conditioning Index (GCI) is defined and used as a performance index for the manipulator over its complete workspace. Given the manipulator design parameters, a holistic model of the redundant aerial manipulation system is derived capturing the coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and the manipulator. Free flight experimental studies are utilized to validate the system, demonstrate its redundant DoFs, and evaluate its performance.",

To quickly adapt to winding pipes, holonomic rolling movement without moving forward and backward is more useful. However, this requires the replacement of driving actuators with rolling actuators at the expense of the driving force. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of high maneuverability of multilink-articulated robots in winding pipes by using less actuators and by designing spring joints. We further validate this by experimental verification.",

A simplified swimming appendage model was proposed to calculate deflection by drag force applied. Also, each of swimming appendage was optimized individually by considering the attached locations on the legs using the two fitness functions, and three different configurations were selected. In the experiments, the performance of the proposed robots was verified using a high-speed camera, and motion capture cameras.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to design low-cost robotic hands that require almost toolless assembly, and have special transmissions and joint mechanisms. The transmissions consist of active and passive gear trains manufactured by 3D printers to realize coordinated motions among joints and to transmit the driving force to underactuated joints. The joints are designed with pop-in structures to simplify the assembly of the designed robotic hands and its maintenance. The robotic hands even enabled us to exchange some components without necessitating a shutdown. By using these techniques, we manufactured two robotic hands with different passive gear trains. One of the hands had three fingers with stiff constrained gear trains and soft fingertips, and the other had five fingers with elastic gear trains. Experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed robotic hands and to clarify the roles of the different gear trains.",

This research proposes an alternative method (a spring-suspended suction cup with a buckled plate spring) that can be attached for long durations without any vacuum pumping system. The negative pressure of the spring suspended suction cup is analyzed and the buckled plate spring is appraised by the energy efficiency and force over long adsorption times of the suction cup. The adhesion time of the suction cup is calculated and compared with that of the volume-fixed suction cup. Under high air inflow conditions, the spring-suspended suction cup adhered to the test surface for longer than the fixed-volume cup. The advantages of the spring-suspended suction cup were verified in experiments on a developed prototype.",

        "abstract": "Traditional climbing robots that use vacuum suckers have some technical problems, e.g., inability to climb coarse walls, frictional resistance and abrasion of suckers, and poor obstacle-surmounting ability. In this study, a new negative pressure adsorption mechanism is applied to the design of a climbing robot. This mechanism generates and maintains negative pressure and adsorption force by using the air's rotational inertia effect; therefore, the structure incorporating this mechanism is called the electrically activated rotational-flow adsorption unit. The most important characteristic of the adsorption unit is that it can function without being in contact with the wall, which fundamentally solves these technical problems associated with traditional climbing robots. In this study, we designed a square-shaped rotational-flow adsorption unit to improve the robot's load ability (18% increase in the adsorption force) and designed a soft skirt structure to improve the robot's obstacle-surmounting ability. Finally, we fabricated a prototype of the climbing robot and tested it on a actual wall (extremely coarse wall, wall containing a large groove). The test results show that our prototype robot can move stably on extremely coarse walls and can pass over large grooves easily.",

        "abstract": "The advantages of mechanical compliance have driven the development of devices using new smart materials. A new kind of magnetorheological piston based on a toroidal array of magnetorheological valves, has been previously tested to prove its feasibility. However, being an initial prototype its potential was still limited by its complex design, and low output force. This study presents the revisions done to the design with several improvements targeting key performance parameters. An improved annular piston design is also introduced as comparison with conventional devices. The toroidal and annular piston head prototypes are built and tested, and their force performance compared with the previous iteration. The experimental results show an overall performance improvement of the toroidal assembly. However, the force model used in the study still fails to accurately predict the magnetic flux at the gaps of the piston head. This deviation is later verify and corrected using a FEM analysis. The force performance of the new toroidal assembly is on par with the commonplace annular design. It also displays a more linear behaviour, at the expense of lower energy efficiency. Finally, it also shows potential for a greater degree of customisation to meet different system requirements.",

Due to this omni-directional wrench generation, the ODAR system can realize such powerful behaviors impossible with conventional multi-rotor flying platforms as: 360\u00b0 photo/video shooting while holding its position for VR scene generation; or resisting sideway gust while keeping its attitude and exerting downward pushing force larger than its own weight for aerial manipulation applications. This paper presents optimal mechanical design, modeling and control, hardware and software implementation, and experimental verification of the ability of the ODAR system to attain those behaviors impossible with the conventional drones as stated above.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel architecture to estimate external forces applied to a compliantly controlled balancing robot in simulations. We use similar dynamics equations used in the controller to find mismatches in the available sensory data and associate them to an unknown external force. Then by decomposing Jacobians, we search over the surface of all body links in the robot to find the force application point. By approximating link geometries with ellipsoids, we can derive analytic solutions to solve the search problem very fast in real time. The proposed approach is tested on a complex humanoid robot in simulations where it outperforms static estimators over fast dynamic motions. We foresee a lot of applications for this method especially in human-robot interactions where it can serve as a whole body virtual suit of tactile sensors. It can also be very useful in identifying the inertial properties of objects being manipulated or mounted on the robot like a backpack.",

Motion planning is one of the most important key technologies for fully autonomous vehicles, especially when they are operated in constrained narrow space such as parking lot. In this the motion planning is challenging because it requires many changes in forward and reverse directions and adjustments of position and orientation. In this paper, an efficient motion planning algorithm is proposed based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) by specifying desired orientation during the tree expansion. A tangential vector space for desired orientation is used to model nonholonomic constraints of a vehicle and geometric constraints of obstacles. The proposed algorithm has been tested on various situations and its results demonstrated much faster performance compared to a nonholonomic RRT algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring of biosignals plays important roles in health management in daily life. Especially, the sensing method of biosignals, which does not require special efforts such as restraining people or wearing the sensors to measure them, is really important to maintain monitoring activities of people. We call such method what a sensing way should be for monitoring of biosignals as casual sensing methods. Previously, we have developed highly sensitive and wide-measurement-range load sensors based on measuring frequency shift of quartz crystal resonator (QCR) as the sensing principal. We have integrated the load sensor into a chair, and measure the load when people just sit on it. Since the load sensor has wide measurement range of 105 order, multi-biosignal; heartbeat, respiration, and body motion under the weight-loaded environment can be measured from load information. Thus, people can casually monitor the biosignals by sitting on the chair. However, the previous sensing system required us to measure the frequency shift of one-Hz order in tens-MHz of the resonant frequency of a QCR. In this case, the sensing system requires a expensive frequency counter, and it is not suitable for daily use situation such as in-home sensing. In this paper, we presents the detection of multi-biosignal method using a newly developed load sensing system which utilizes the developed frequency counter unit. In order to measure the frequency shift of one-Hz order in tens-MHz of the resonant frequency, we use a differential method of signal for two QCRs with an electrical signal-mixing circuit. By using the method, we can reduce the required measurement range for frequency from tens-MHz to tens-kHz. The load sensing performances were evaluated, and the results showed that the sensitivity and withstand load were 2.9 [mN] and 300 [N], respectively. Finally, we demonstrated the measurement of multi-biosignal by using constructed system, and succeeded in detecting respiration, heartbeat, and bod... Show More",

As a virtual reality interface for the hand, a wearable system should be able to measure finger joint angles and apply force feedback to the fingers with a simple and light design. In the proposed system, the finger joint angles are measured by a tendon-inspired cable mechanism. Also, another cable is used for force feedback to the finger. Using the measured finger joint angles and motor currents, the cable-driven actuation system applies desired force to the fingers. That is, when the desired force is zero, the motor position is controlled to track the changed cable length; when the desired force needs to be applied, the motor current is controlled to generate the desired force. For a smooth transition between two control strategies, linearly changing proportions of each control strategy is applied in the transition range. A prototype of the proposed system was manufactured, and the proposed control algorithms were verified by experiments.",

With delicate circuit design and optical attachments, we create a sensor as small as 35[mm] \u00d7 27[mm] \u00d7 30[mm] and as light as 20[g]. The line sensor samples 272 pixels (256 effective pixels) uniformly distributed within the measurement field of view customizable using different laser lenses. The optimal measurement range of the sensor is 0.05[m] \u223c 2[m]. Higher sampling rates can be achieved with a shorter range. The sensor can also extend its range to 3[m] with reduced accuracy. We model the overall errors of the sensor and formulate calibration methods, achieving repeatable accuracy and measurement bias both within 2[cm] with our tested ambient lighting conditions and measurement ranges. The sensor is applicable to range sensing tasks including humanoid hand-eye measurement, UAV safe landing, tiny robot range sensing, and object detection.",

The MNPs' 1D guidance system is a combined electromagnetic actuation (EMA) and monitoring system, which can provide an accurate control scheme with nanoparticle's localization for more precise targeting of the drug delivery. The localization of the MNPs is done by magnetic particle imaging (MPI) with low amplitude excitation field. In this paper, we have developed a novel coil topology for 1D MNPs feedback control, by alternate supply of different currents to coils set in time sequence, the coil set alternates functions between MPI and EMA. Motion of MNPs is controlled by a gradient of the magnetic field in EMA period, the distribution of MNPs is reconstructed in MPI period and provides feedback to the EMA. The guidance system will provide navigation and tracking interleaved for targeted drug delivery of MNPs in compact and efficient ways. The 1D MNPs guidance system has 2Hz of EMA and MPI hybrid frequency, allowing a position control of MNPs with 90nm diameter.",

Second, printed microhands are manipulated by multi-spot laser beam which traps and manipulates numerous objects simultaneously. Third, where direct trapping of the target object is not possible due to target objects' features such as size, shape, material, index of refraction, etc., indirect manipulation of the target microobjects is achieved by using the microhands as an extension of optical tweezers.

        "abstract": "The tutor-tutee hand-in-hand teaching may be the most effective approach for a tutee to acquire new motor skills. Repetitive nature of such procedures in a group setting usually results in a high labour cost and time inefficiency. Potential solution can be utilizing robotic platforms playing the role of tutors for demonstrating and transferring the required skills. This requires an appropriate guidance scheme to integrate the tutor's motor functionalities into the robot's control architecture. For instance, for hand-in-hand supervision of the writing task, the tutor's corrections can be applied when necessary, while a very compliant motion can be achieved if no errors are detected. Inspired by this behavior, we develop a teaching interface using a dual-arm robotic platform. In our setup, one arm is connected to the tutees arm providing guidance through a variable stiffness control approach, and the other to the tutor to capture the motion and to feedback the tutees performance in a haptic manner. The reference stiffness for the tutors arm stiffness is estimated in real-time and replicated by the tutees robotic arm. Comparative experiments have been carried out on a dual-arm Baxter robot. The results imply that the human tutor is able to intuitively transfer writing skills to the tutee and also show superior learning performance over over some conventional teaching by demonstration techniques.",

This paper proposes a spherical tether handling device that unfastens a robot's tether during surveys by releasing the tether and carrying it aside. By using a differential mechanism, the device drives shells and rollers that hold the tether. On flat surfaces, the device moves forward by driving the shells. When the device climbs over steps, the rollers are driven by the differential mechanism to pull the tether automatically. After prototyping the device, we confirm the surmountability of the proposed device against steps. The results show that the device can climb a height 90.9% of its diameter. We also demonstrate a scenario to handle the tether and untangle multiple tangles in an environment with several obstacles.",

We developed a harvesting robot with stereo camera which can measure depth in short range and direct sunlight and plucking gripper using the infinity rotational joint. We also evaluate the developed robot through harvesting in the tomato robot competition and the real farm. In the tomato robot competition, the robot harvested tometoes from tomato clusters and tomato trees, harvesting speed was about 80[s/fruit] and successful rate was about 60%. In the real farm we evaluated the robot with tomato trees in semi-outdoor environment to show the effectiveness and robustness under direct sunlight. According to the result of harvesting with real tomatoes, we improved the robot motion and finally harvesting speed was up to 23[s/fruit], however the gripper may grasp multiple fruits in case of very cluttered cluster and the calyx also may be broken when the stem angle is deep from the rotation axis. To avoid this situation, a grasp state estimation of the gripper and simultaneous recognition fruit and stem positions are next problems to improve the harvesting successful rate.",

IR has advantages that it is a minimally invasive method and it is applied widely such as lung cancer treatment, liver cancer treatment, biopsy, and so on. However, it has a problem that doctors are exposed by X-ray due to a procedure in the vicinity of the CT gantry. To solve this problem, we have developed a robot so we calling \u201cZerobot\u201d. Zerobot has six DOF and controlled remotely. We previously conducted animal experiment using a rabbit to evaluate Zerobot. As a result, percutaneous puncture was impossible without epidermis cutting. Therefore, we developed a new function called instantaneously puncture that can achieve high speed and short stroke puncture like a human operator. In this paper, overview of Zerobot is described first. Then, measurement of puncture speed of a human operator is described. Furthermore, design and system structure of instantaneously puncture system is described. Finally, we present results of animal experiment using the instantaneously puncture system.",

To detect accurate force sensing, a force sensing system is integrated to a gripper of a surgical instrument. At the gripper side, two possible locations are considered, and the sensing system is installed to the distal region of the gripper, which gives major advantages such as the gripper's minimization, palpation function, and multi-axis force sensing. Based on the capacitive-type sensing method, the sensor enables the direct measurement of the three-axis force applied to surgical gripper tip. The sensorized gripper is simply designed at a low cost, composed of only four mechanical parts, and, the forceps including two grippers are installed to an instrument that is able to conduct a grasping motion. Therefore, it is used to evaluate the performance of the force sensing system. The sensorized forceps are experimentally validated by using a commercial sensor in an experimental set-up.",

        "abstract": "Manipulation complexity of teleoperation increases the necessity of shared autonomy. However, designing an autonomy while keeping in mind the environmental uncertainty is challenging. This paper proposes a human interactive autonomy for a shared teleoperation. The central concept is a novel methodology of combining the innate cognitive ability of a human operator to arrive at an accurate, and precise solution of an autonomous system for mobile robot shared teleoperation. The resulting system is more efficient and less fatigued than direct teleoperation. This combined approach transfers the human operator's intention, shaped by his cognition about remote environment, to the autonomous system. The intention information input from the operator helps autonomous system perform the given teleoperation tasks more efficiently. For initial feasibility and proof of concept, the intention information is provided to the autonomous system in the form of a path which is acquired by our proposed sketch method. Our novel proposed sketch method allows the operator to sketch the path on the visual feedback image of the remote environments and the information is then transmitted to the autonomous system. Experimental results provide the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed method against prevalent control methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a particularly relevant class of aerial manipulators that we name protocentric. These robots are formed by an underactuated aerial vehicle, a planar-Vertical Take-Off and Landing (PVTOL), equipped with any number of different parallel manipulator arms with the only property that all the first joints are attached at the Center of Mass (CoM) of the PVTOL, while the center of actuation of the PVTOL can be anywhere. We prove that protocentric aerial manipulators (PAMs) are differentially flat systems regardless the number of joints of each arm and their kinematic and dynamic parameters. The set of flat outputs is constituted by the CoM of the PVTOL and the absolute orientation angles of all the links. The relative degree of each output is equal to four. More amazingly, we prove that PAMs are differentially flat even in the case that any number of the joints are elastic, no matter the internal distribution between elastic and rigid joints. The set of flat outputs is the same but in this case the total relative degree grows quadratically with the number of elastic joints. We validate the theory by simulating object grasping and transportation tasks with unknown mass and parameters and using a controller based on dynamic feedback linearization.",

One of the key problems in achieving physics-based virtual interaction is that there is no accurate haptic feedback to the user's hands and fingers, which must introduce a mismatch between the real hands and their virtual counterparts. This problem becomes more serious when multiple hands or fingers are involved to a single virtual object, for example, a hand-over situation from one hand to the other. The key contribution of this paper is to represent and describe the physical status of a virtual object in the local object space and to change the status in the object point of view in order to avoid its drastic changes by the physical-virtual mismatch. The experiments compare the performance of the proposed method with objects in different shapes when using 2D and 3D visualization devices.",

        "abstract": "Considering perception as an observation process only is the very reason for which robotic perception methods are to date unable to provide a general capacity of scene understanding. Related work in neuroscience has shown that there is a strong relationship between perception and action. We believe that considering perception in relation to action requires to interpret the scene in terms of the agent's own potential capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach for learning sensorimotor representations through the interaction between action and observation capabilities. We represent the notion of affordance as a probabilistic relation between three elements: objects, actions and effects. Experiments for affordances discovery were performed on a real robotic platform in an unsupervised way assuming a limited set of innate capabilities. Results show dependency relations that connect the three elements in a common frame: affordances. The increasing number of interactions and observations results in a Bayesian network that captures the relationships between them. The learned representation can be used for prediction tasks.",

In this paper, we modify the existing continuum Cosserat approach optimizing it for soft robot arms which can be discretized in a finite number of sections and degrees of freedom. The resulting new piece-wise constant strain model extends the existing piece-wise constant curvature model by allowing torsion and shears strains which are fundamental to cope with out-of-the-plane external forces as appearing for example during ground locomotion. A first experimental comparison has been also conducted using one fluidic actuated leg of the soft crawler FASTT.",

In contrast to recent approaches to slip detection, distinguishing slip from non-slip conditions, we consider the more difficult task of distinguishing different types of slippage. Particularly we consider an object pushing task, where forces can only be applied from the top. In that case, the robot needs to notice when the object successfully moves vs. when the object gets stuck while the finger slips over its surface. As an example, consider the task of pushing around a piece of paper. We propose and evaluate three different convolutional network architectures and proof the applicability of the method for online classification in a robot pushing task.",

Robots contacted with an obstacle first estimate the width of an obstacle by sharing bumped status of individual robots, and choose an appropriate obstacle avoidance scenarios between obstacle detouring and bouncing off a wall. Second, for both scenarios, robots switch their motion model to a parent following motion to avoid the obstacle. Finally, robots keep sensing the maximum tree angle to estimate whether they are completely escaped from the obstacle, and return to flock formation motion model. We provide theoretical analysis about maintaining connectivity while robots are avoiding an obstacle. Simulation results show a group of 36 robots successfully avoid three different kinds of obstacles including 1) a small bar, 2) a narrow corridor, and 3) a large wall while maintaining connectivity.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In many multi-robot applications such as target search, environmental monitoring and reconnaissance, the multi-robot system operates semi-autonomously, but under the supervision of a remote human who monitors task progress. In these applications, each robot collects a large amount of task-specific data that must be sent to the human periodically to keep the human aware of task progress. It is often the case that the human-robot communication links are extremely bandwidth constrained and/or have significantly higher latency than inter-robot communication links, so it is impossible for all robots to send their task-specific data together. Thus, only a subset of robots, which we call the knowledge leaders, can send their data at a time. In this paper, we study the knowledge leader selection problem, where the goal is to select a subset of robots with a given cardinality that transmits the most informative task-specific data for the human. We prove that the knowledge leader selection is a submodular function maximization problem under explicit conditions and present a novel distributed submodular optimization algorithm that has the same approximation guarantees as the centralized greedy algorithm. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "To operate in human environments, robots must be able to withstand external disturbances. Small disturbances can be stabilized through momentum regulation, but larger ones require steps to prevent falling. This work presents two new techniques for disturbance rejection. The first is an extension of divergent component of motion (DCM) and capture point tracking controllers that augments a PI feedback control law with a disturbance observer. This is used to estimate transient disturbances through momentum-rate-of-change error. For larger disturbances, we present a novel optimization-based framework based on the DCM dynamics that uses a quadratic program to compute the desired ground reaction forces and recovery step location. Using optimization gives a flexibility that enables planning angular-momentum-rate-of-change trajectories to help reduce recovery step length. We then illustrate the effectiveness of these methods with hardware and simulation experiments of the THOR humanoid.",

Recursive sampling-based planning is used to explore the space of possible continuous-space instantiations of these actions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a magnetic structure assembly task, showing that the robot can intelligently select a sequence of actions in different parts of the workspace and in the presence of obstacles. This approach can better adapt to new environments by selecting the correct high-level actions for the particular environment while taking human preferences into account.",

The Extended-Cooperative-Task Space (ECTS) presents a unified representation describing any type of coordinated motions of two end-effectors. This paper focuses on the specification of dual-arm motion tasks based on the ECTS representation and the evaluation of the performance of the specified tasks. We first examine how the ECTS motion variables can be used effectively to specify coordinated motions to manipulate different types of objects. Then we derive new performance indices that can be used to evaluate and optimize the configurations of dual-arm robot systems performing any type of coordinated-motion tasks. The experimental results of coordinated-motion tasks performed by a Baxter robot demonstrate intuitiveness and efficiency of ECTS-based task specifications. We also show that the proposed ECTS performance indices can enable redundancies in a dual-arm system to be effectively utilized for a larger range of workspace as well as desired control objectives.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) are a generic approach for trajectory modeling in an attractor land-scape based on differential dynamical systems. DMPs guarantee stability and convergence properties of learned trajectories, and scale well to high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose DMP+, a modified formulation of DMPs which, while preserving the desirable properties of the original, 1) achieves lower mean square error (MSE) with equal number of kernels, and 2) allows learned trajectories to be efficiently modified by updating a subset of kernels. The ability to efficiently modify learned trajectories i) improves reusability of existing primitives, and ii) reduces user fatigue during imitation learning as errors during demonstration may be corrected later without requiring another complete demonstration. In addition, DMP+ may be used with existing DMP techniques for trajectory generalization and thus complements them. We compare the performance of our proposed approach against DMPs in learning trajectories of handwritten characters, and show that DMP+ achieves lower MSE in position deviation. We demonstrate in a second experiment that DMP+ can efficiently update a learned trajectory by updating only a subset of kernels. The update algorithm achieves modeling accuracy comparable to learning the adapted trajectory with the original DMPs.",

        "abstract": "Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems are revolutionizing transportation in urban settings by improving vehicle utilization and reducing parking congestion. A key factor in the success of an MOD system is the ability to measure and respond to real-time customer arrival data. Real time traffic arrival rate data is traditionally difficult to obtain due to the need to install fixed sensors throughout the MOD network. This paper presents a framework for measuring pedestrian traffic arrival rates using sensors onboard the vehicles that make up the MOD fleet. A novel distributed fusion algorithm is presented which combines onboard LIDAR and camera sensor measurements to detect trajectories of pedestrians with a 90% detection hit rate with 1.5 false positives per minute. A novel moving observer method is introduced to estimate pedestrian arrival rates from pedestrian trajectories collected from mobile sensors. The moving observer method is evaluated in both simulation and hardware and is shown to achieve arrival rate estimates comparable to those that would be obtained with multiple stationary sensors.",

Such a monitoring system must reposition according to the targets' movements and maintain satisfactory coverage of the targets. We propose an approximate, centralized approach for maximizing the visible boundary of dynamic targets using mobile cameras in a bounded 2D environment. Targets and obstacles translate, rotate, and deform independently, and cameras are only aware of the current position and shape of the targets and obstacles. Using current information, the environment is searched for better viewing positions, then cameras navigate to those positions while avoiding collisions with targets and obstacles. We present a benchmark and metrics to evaluate the performance of our method, and compare our approach to a simple gradient-based local method in several real-time simulations.",

We purpose the use of the DSC in order to avoid the explosion of terms yielded by the backstepping algorithm and leading to compute the high order derivatives of variables. From the Lyapunov stability analysis, we prove that the designed controls render the closed loop system ultimately Uniformly Bounded (UUB).

In this paper, we propose a novel crank wheel mechanism, the \u201cEccentric Crank Rover\u201d(ECR), which is an enhanced crank wheel mechanism with eccentric wheels. The eccentric wheels increase the under-body clearance, and change the body trajectory from straight to trochoid curve, which has the same shape as the crank legs but opposite phase trajectory. Thus, the body itself acts as a \u201csecond\u201d crank leg.

Scenes are represented as nodes in the graph, and each connectivity between nodes is calculated by a pre-trained vocabulary tree. By applying a spectral clustering algorithm to the constructed graph, the scenes are partitioned into k groups where k is determined by the proposed estimation method. Instead of using the standard eigenvalue analysis, the optimal k is computed so that the partitioned graph becomes to have strong intra-class correlations while inter-class correlations are relatively weak. As a result, scenes are adaptively clustered according to the environmental changes. The clustering performance of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated with three image sequences captured in challenging environments. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that our line-based algorithm outperforms existing algorithms utilizing other types of features as well as the produced scene clustering results are more human-like.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic humanoid locomotion is a challenging control problem, and running is especially difficult to achieve, given the underactuation inherent to aerial domains. Previous work developed a gait-generating optimization framework for dynamic locomotion in the context of hybrid zero dynamics, producing stable 3D walking on the humanoid hardware platform DURUS. Here, we demonstrate that this optimization method also extends to stable 3D running. Gaits generated from the optimization, which utilizes the dynamics of all 23 degrees of freedom to maximize energy economy, results in stable running in a DURUS simulation model. Notably, the presented running is underactuated in all domains, due to DURUS' spring-legged design. Further, we generate 25 different running gaits, over a range of speeds (1.5\u20133.0 m/s), to demonstrate the reliability of solving the large-scale nonlinear program. We report statistical performance of the optimization in successfully generating stable running (average computation time: 323 seconds) in an effort to establish a benchmark for large-scale gait generation. We inspected this array of gaits across speeds, noting recognizable trends in optimized strategies from prior studies on lower-order models\u2014e.g., both increased step frequency and step length with speed\u2014along with the first reported cost-of-transport curve for a 3D humanoid running model. We consider this result an important step toward humanoid running on the DURUS hardware platform.",

This is achieved by a new mapping between classes and filters at the expansion side of the network. The network is trained end-to-end and yields precise road/lane predictions at the original input resolution in roughly 50ms. Compared to the state of the art, the network achieves top accuracies on the KITTI dataset for road and lane segmentation while providing a 20\u00d7 speed-up. We demonstrate that the improved efficiency is not due to the road segmentation task. Also on segmentation datasets with larger scene complexity, the accuracy does not suffer from the large speed-up.",

Although many humanoid robots, especially small-size humanoid robots, have their own stand-up motions, there has not been a generalized method to automatically learn flexible stand-up motions for humanoid robots which can be applied to various fallen positions. In this research, we propose a method for learning stand-up motions for humanoid robots using Q-learning making use of their bilateral symmetry. We implemented this method on DarwIn-OP humanoid robots and learned an optimal policy in simulation. We compared the resulting stand-up motion with manually designed stand-up motions and with stand-up motions learned without considering bilateral symmetry. Both in simulation and on the real robot, the new stand-up motion was successful in most trials while other motions took longer or were not as robust.",

The keypoint detector FALKO has been proposed to detect stable points in laser scans for localization and mapping tasks. In this paper, we present novel loop closure methods based on FALKO keypoints and compare their performance in online localization and mapping problems. The pose graph formulation is adopted, where each pose is associated to a local map of keypoints extracted from the corresponding laser scan. Loops in the graph are detected by matching local maps in two steps. First, the candidate matching scans are selected by comparing the scan signatures obtained from the keypoints of each scan. Second, the transformation between two scans is obtained by pairing and aligning the respective keypoint sets. Experiments with standard benchmark datasets assess the performance of FALKO and of the proposed loop closure algorithms in both offline and online localization and map estimation.",

We propose the use of a semantic map that stores information about the knowledge in the system and updates it, by an inference process, with sensor information received from the object recognition module. However, semantic maps are not capable of actively search for more information in the environment. For that reason a decision-making module, based on a POMDP framework, is integrated in the system. Several experiments were made in a realistic apartment test bed using every day objects and a mobile robot, showing that this hybrid solution makes the search process more efficient.",

Evaluating information-theoretic objective functions in the context of active SLAM is a very expensive process that requires significant computational overhead. The contributions of this work involve exploiting the structure of the planning problem integrated with SLAM via the Bayes tree graphical model. Specifically, we propose a constrained variable ordering and subtree caching scheme that reduce computational complexity by eliminating redundant computations between candidate actions that are similar. We also propose an active SLAM framework that utilizes these concepts, and demonstrate the benefits of the approach with an underwater robot performing visual SLAM in a hybrid simulation environment.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of ego-noise reduction, i.e., suppressing the noise a robot causes by its own motions. Such noise degrades the recorded microphone signal massively such that the robot's auditory capabilities suffer. To suppress it, it is intuitive to use also motor data, since it provides additional information about the robot's joints and thereby the noise sources. We propose to fuse motor data to a recently proposed multichannel dictionary algorithm for ego-noise reduction. At training, a dictionary is learned that captures spatial and spectral characteristics of ego-noise. At testing, nonlinear classifiers are used to efficiently associate the current robot's motor state to relevant sets of entries in the learned dictionary. By this, computational load is reduced by one third in typical scenarios while achieving at least the same noise reduction performance. Moreover, we propose to train dictionaries on different microphone array geometries and use them for ego-noise reduction while the head to which the microphones are mounted is moving. In such scenarios, the motor guided approach results in significantly better performance values.",

This paper discusses the design of leaf springs for a sub-class of VSAs that use variable lever arm ratios as means to change their output stiffness.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of robotic therapeutic massage, the experiments are conducted by recording EEG signals of subject before and after robotic massage. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is used to filter out artifacts of EEG signals. After signal processing, the power of delta, alpha and beta rhythms are analyzed. The experimental results show an increase in delta power and a decrease in alpha power which represents the relaxation response of subjects.

We propose a new framework to predict energy consumption using information extracted from publicly available maps. This method avoids having to model internal robot configurations, which are often unavailable, while still providing invaluable predictions for both explored and unexplored trajectories. Our approach uses a heteroscedastic Gaussian Process to model the power consumption, which explicitly accounts for variance due to exogenous latent factors such as traffic and weather conditions. We evaluate our framework on 30km of data collected from a city centre environment with a mobile robot travelling on pedestrian walkways. Results across five different test routes show an average difference between predicted and measured power consumption of 3.3%, leading to an average error of 6.6% on predictions of energy consumption. The distinct advantage of our model is our ability to predict measurement variance. The variance predictions improved by 84.3% over a benchmark.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a Frequency-based Action Descriptor (FADE) to represent human actions. In robotics, with the development of Programming by Demonstration (PbD) methods, representing and recognizing large sets of actions has become crucial to build autonomous systems that learn from humans. The FADE descriptor leverages Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for action representation and is combined with the Manhattan distance for measuring similarities between actions. It is characterized by a low time and space complexity and is particularly suitable for classification of human actions. For clustering problems, we propose a modified version of FADE, called Uncompressed-FADE (U-FADE), which performs well in combination with Spectral Clustering algorithms at the price of a reduced compression. We compare FADE with action descriptors based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) on the entire HDM05 motion capture database. Despite the high dimensionality of the problem, we obtained on the entire database a promising recognition rate of 78% combining FADE with a simple 1-NN classification algorithm. Furthermore, we achieved a rate of 98% on a small action set and 88% on a medium action set.",

The fact that the proposed approach does not rely on a single image to recognize a site allows for a more robust place recognition, and consequently loop closure detection, while reduces the computational complexity for long trajectory cases. We present evaluation results for multiple publicly available indoor and outdoor datasets using Precision-Recall curves, which reveal that our method outperforms other state of the art algorithms.",

The use of the proposed approach aims at improving the performances of bilateral teleoperation systems by reducing the human operator workload and increasing both the implementation and the execution efficiency. In fact, using our method virtual guidances do not need to be programmed a priori but they can be instead automatically generated and updated making the system suitable for unstructured environments. We strengthen the proposed method using passivity control in order to safely switch between different tasks while teleoperating under active constraints. A series of experiments emulating real industrial scenarios are used to show that the switch between multiple tasks can be passively and safely achieved and handled by the system.",

Capacitive sensors mounted to the robot structure can be used to measure the presence of conductive objects and, hence, allow the detection of persons. However, various objects in the workspace can influence capacitive sensor measurements. Thus, we propose to record an environment model containing the expected sensor values for relevant robot poses. Using this model, distance estimation and real-time reaction can be performed even in the presence of additional conductive objects in the workspace. A demonstration of our approach was shown at the Hannover Messe 2015.",

        "abstract": "Precisely estimating the pose of an agent in a global reference frame is a crucial goal that unlocks a multitude of robotic applications, including autonomous navigation and collaboration. In order to achieve this, current state-of-the-art localization approaches collect data provided by one or more agents and create a single, consistent localization map, maintained over time. However, with the introduction of lengthier sorties and the growing size of the environments, data transfers between the backend server where the global map is stored and the agents are becoming prohibitively large. While some existing methods partially address this issue by building compact summary maps, the data transfer from the agents to the backend can still easily become unmanageable. In this paper, we propose a method that is designed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the agent to the backend, functioning in large-scale, multi-session mapping scenarios. Our approach is based upon a landmark selection method that exploits information coming from multiple, possibly weak and correlated, landmark utility predictors; fused using learned feature coefficients. Such a selection yields a drastic reduction in data transfer while maintaining localization performance and the ability to efficiently summarize environments over time. We evaluate our approach on a data set that was autonomously collected in a dynamic indoor environment over a period of several months.",

A GelSight sensor is a tactile sensor that provides high resolution tactile images, which enables a robot to infer object properties such as geometry and fine texture, as well as contact force and slip conditions. The sensor is pressed on silicone samples by a human or a robot and we measure the sample hardness only with data from the sensor, without a separate force sensor and without precise knowledge of the contact trajectory. We describe the features that show object hardness. For hemispherical objects, we develop a model to measure the sample hardness, and the estimation error is about 4% in the range of 8 Shore 00 to 45 Shore A. With this technology, a robot is able to more easily infer the hardness of the touched objects, thereby improving its object recognition as well as manipulation strategy.",

        "abstract": "In order to ensure safe operation, robots must be able to reliably detect behavior perturbations that result from unexpected physical interactions with their environment and human co-workers. While some robots provide firmware force sensors that generate rough force estimates, more accurate force measurements are usually achieved with dedicated force-torque sensors. However, such sensors are often heavy, expensive and require an additional power supply. In the case of lightweight manipulators, the already limited payload capabilities may be reduced in a significant way. This paper presents an experience-based approach for accurately estimating external forces being applied to a robot without the need for a force-torque sensor. Using Information Transfer, a subset of sensors relevant to the executed behavior are identified from a larger set of internal sensors. Models mapping robot sensor data to force-torque measurements are learned using a neural network. These models can be used to predict the magnitude and direction of perturbations from affordable, proprioceptive sensors only. Experiments with a UR5 robot show that our method yields force estimates with accuracy comparable to a dedicated force-torque sensor. Moreover, our method yields a substantial improvement in accuracy over force-torque values provided by the robot firmware.",

In order for self-driving cars to become practical, they are required to operate safely and reliably even under adverse driving conditions. However, most current autonomous driving cars have only been shown to be operational under amiable weather conditions, i.e., on sunny days on dry roads. In order to enable autonomous cars to handle adverse driving conditions such as rain and wet roads, the algorithm must be able to detect roads within a tolerable margin of error using sensors such as cameras and laser scanners. In this paper, we propose a sensor fusion algorithms that is able to operate under a variety of weather conditions, including rain. Our algorithm was validated when a strong shower occurred during the 2014 Hyundai Motor Company's Autonomous Car Competition. In this paper, we present the competition results that were collected on the same course on both sunny and rainy days.

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe how we realized event-based signaling for large scale artificial robotic skin. We developed a new algorithm for the event generation on multi-modal skin cells. The skin cells have two modes, the conventional data sampling mode and the event mode. A comprehensive performance evaluation and comparison of these two modes is presented. We perform different experiments on our robot TOMM which has two UR5 robot arms, each covered with 260 multi-modal skin cells. Each skin cell samples 9 signals of 4 different modalities. Finally we derive models for extrapolating CPU usage and network traffic for larger numbers of skin cells and higher sample rates. The results show that the event-based system has superior performance and its performance edge increases with larger numbers of skin cells and higher sample rates. Experimental validation on our real robot system shows that in reactive control the event-based system reduces in comparison to the conventional system the packet rate by 48.2% and the CPU usage by 17.79%. We extrapolate the worst case for 5000 cells and show that the event-based system can at least reduce the packet rate by 21.2% and the CPU usage by 17.46%.",

When the event-driven iCub humanoid robot grasps an object its head and torso move, inducing camera motion, and tracked objects become no longer trivially segmented amongst the mass of background clutter. Current event-based tracking algorithms have mostly considered stationary cameras that have clean event-streams with minimal clutter. This paper introduces novel methods to extend the Hough-based circle detection algorithm using optical flow information that is readily extracted from the spatio-temporal event space. Results indicate the proposed directed-Hough algorithm is more robust to other moving objects and the background event-clutter. Finally, we demonstrate successful on-line robot control and gaze following on the iCub robot.",

When deploying mobile robots in a factory environment, the predictability and reproducibility of their behaviors become important and are often requested. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use motion planning scheme that can take into account user preferences for robot navigation. The preferences are extracted implicitly from the previous experiences or from demonstrations and are automatically considered in the subsequent planning steps. This leads to reproducible and thus better to predict navigation behaviors of the robot, without requiring experts to hard-coding control strategies or cost functions within a planner. Our system has been implemented and evaluated on a simulated KUKA mobile robot in different environments.",

A Human-Initiative (HI) variable autonomy system is investigated, in which a human operator is able to switch the Level of Autonomy (LOA) between teleoperation (joystick control) and autonomous control (robot navigates autonomously towards waypoints selected by the human) on-the-fly. Our hypothesis is that the HI system will enable superior navigation performance compared to either teleoperation or autonomy alone, especially in scenarios where the performance of both the human and the robot may at times become degraded. We evaluate our hypothesis through carefully controlled and repeatable experiments using a significant number of human test-subjects.",

In this paper, an universal approach addressing this particular issue is proposed, allowing to assist and improve handling and assembly task. The approach exploits typical charging effects in the SEM and derives information about the positions of objects and end-effectors as well as about assembly statuses.

Most SLAM approaches start from scratch and build a map only based on their own observations and odometry information. In this paper, we address the problem of how additional information can be exploited, for example from OpenStreetMap. We extend the standard graph-based SLAM formulation by relating the nodes of the pose-graph with an existing map. As this paper suggests, we can relate the newly built maps with information from publicly available maps with the laser range finder data from the robot and in this way improve the map quality. We implemented and evaluated our approach using real world data taken in urban environments. We illustrate that our extension to graph-based SLAM provides better aligned maps and adds only a marginal computational overhead.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for selecting the next best base position for a climbing robot so as to observe the highest information gain about the environment. The robot is capable of adhering to and moving along and transitioning to surfaces with arbitrary orientations. This approach samples known surfaces, and takes into account the robot kinematics, to generate a graph of valid attachment points from which the robot can either move to other positions or make observations of the environment. The information value of nodes in this graph are estimated and a variant of A* is used to traverse the graph and discover the most worthwhile node that is reachable by the robot. This approach is demonstrated in simulation and shown to allow a 7 degree-of-freedom inchworm-inspired climbing robot to move to positions in the environment from which new information can be gathered about the environment.",

By using a homotopy class or classes to represent one or more topological requirements, we build a framework that helps a robot understand a human's intent. This paper reviews a homotopic decomposition method that is used to convert any path into a string, which allows homotopic path equivalence to be performed by comparing strings. We then integrate the Homotopic Distributed Correspondence Graph (HoDCG) to infer the homotopic constraint in the format of strings from a language instruction. Finally, we use a homotopic path-planning algorithm that finds the optimal paths for a given objective and homotopic constraint. Experiment results show how a language instruction is converted into a path driven by an implicit topological requirement.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Local-Path Planning approach for an independent four-wheel steering (I4WS) mobile base. The approach smoothly drives and rotates the platform while still following a given path and avoiding obstacles. I4WS vehicles are omnidirectional vehicles, similar to shopping carts, if one neglects the time needed to steer the wheels. However, due to the danger of mechanical parts breaking while actuating the wheels, they are commonly controlled in a stop-and-go fashion, where the vehicle stops to turn its wheels perpendicular to a desired instantaneous center of curvature (ICC) before starting to move again. The approach overcomes this limitation and ensures an ICC-based kinematic constraint during continuous motion using a flat-input controller running at 100 Hz. Therefore, the trajectory of the ICC is both predictable and suitable for model predictive control (MPC). The MPC implemented generates optimized collision-free trajectories of up to several meters ahead at 10 Hz, given a set of points along a path and laser contour readings. Furthermore, the planner realized here is able to deal with additional constraints such as the vehicle's view direction to focus on attention points while driving. Experimental results highlight the capabilities of the approach on a simulated robot, using GazeboSim, and demonstrate its applicability for the field of service robotics.",

Inspired by acting movement training, we construct path shape features that layer expression into a mobile robot's motion traversal. Our video-study results show that simple variations of path shape and orientation can influence human perceptions of a robot's task, focus, and confidence. We further find that sequencing path features is a useful way to create expressions that are pinpointed in time without requiring changes in velocity. Our quantitative features represent the Laban Space Effort: using path shape and orientation along the path to communicate the direct or indirect attitude of the robot toward its target destination (acting vocabulary italicized). These features illustrate expressive or stylistic aspects of the robot's inner state, filling a gap in the pre-existing literature that has mostly focused on task legibility. Our future work will evaluate temporal and spatial robot motion features in explicit interaction contexts.",

        "abstract": "Many autonomous vehicles require precise localization into a prior map in order to support planning and to leverage semantic information within those maps (e.g. that the right lane is a turn-only lane.) A popular approach in automotive systems is to use infrared intensity maps of the ground surface to localize, making them susceptible to failures when the surface is obscured by snow or when the road is repainted. An emerging alternative is to localize based on the 3D structure around the vehicle; these methods are robust to these types of changes, but the maps are costly both in terms of storage and the computational cost of matching. In this paper, we propose a fast method for localizing based on 3D structure around the vehicle using a 2D representation. This representation retains many of the advantages of \u201cfull\u201d matching in 3D, but comes with dramatically lower space and computational requirements. We also introduce a variation of Graph-SLAM tailored to support localization, allowing us to make use of graph-based error-recovery techniques in our localization estimate. Finally, we present real-world localization results for both an indoor mobile robotic platform and an autonomous golf cart, demonstrating that autonomous vehicles do not need full 3D matching to accurately localize in the environment.",

Our method uses a single CPU core and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and can conduct fast and precise 6-DoF pose estimation at the same frequency of the camera input (100 fps). In addition, to show the performance of our method, we applied our 6-DoF pose estimation algorithm to a palm-sized quadcopter and flew it autonomously using only an on-board system with a monocular camera and three-axis gyro sensor. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study on fully on-board autonomous flight control of an MAV in 6-DoF space without an accelerometer.",

        "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop task involving soft contact has become common in robotic application, especially in physical human-robot interaction. In this task, it is required that robot would sense interactions with human by touching, as well as assess possibility of human approaching by proximity sensation. In addition, it is also essential to fabricate an interface so that human does not feel uncomfortable during physical interaction with robot. This paper presents an attempt on fabrication of sensing elements that can be utilized for construction of a soft interface (or a robotic skin). Each element is made from fabrics and soft materials that can sense both proximity and applied force from human's touch. In addition, each sensing element can sense the relative distance of conductive object (or human body) that is approaching the sensing element's surface, and the 2\u00d72 contact force distribution when the object makes contact with the sensing element. By exploiting simultaneous measurement of capacitance, each fabric sensing element can smoothly switch the proximity mode and tactile mode based on position of the object. We also constructed a model that can predict variation of capacitance measurement of proximity and tactile modes during operation for further analysis. The methods and results presented in this paper can be extended to construct a larger scale of robotic skin for robot's body, and act as a platform for study human-robot interaction.",

This class of objects are common in any environment but still challenging to deal with. This is due to the fact that the distribution of surface brightness makes difficult to compute interest points or appearance-based descriptors. Here we propose a novel part-based method using an efficient template matching approach where each template independently encodes the similarity function using a Forest trained over the templates. Moreover, accuracy is even more incremented by using a cascade of the learned forest. These templates forests together with the simplicity of the computed image features allow a quick estimate of the pose achieving real-time performance. Performance are demonstrated both on synthetic and real images with known ground truth.",

For matching two feature clouds observed at two different poses, we discover that the covariance matrix of the measurement prediction error can be written as the sum of a low rank matrix and a block diagonal matrix, if we assume that the features are observed independently at each pose. This special structure of the covariance matrix allows us to compute its inverse analytically and efficiently. Together with a good bookkeeping strategy, the complexity of the Joint Compatibility (JC) test is reduced to O(1). Contrary to the approximated JC test, ours is both exact and fast. Based on the efficient JC test algorithm and a branch and bound search procedure, we devise an algorithm, called Fast Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (FastJCBB), to quickly obtain robust data association. The FastJCBB algorithm is essentially modified from the conventional Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) algorithm and both of these algorithms are able to produce exactly the same data association results. However, with the substantial improvement in the efficiency of JC tests, our FastJCBB algorithm is much faster than the conventional JCBB, especially when matching two large feature clouds. It is reported that our FastJCBB algorithm is more than 740 times faster than the conventional JCBB in carrying out one million JC tests when matching two clouds with about 100 features each. Since both FastJCBB and JCBB share the same branch and bound procedure in exploring the interpretation tree, the search complexity remains exponential. Our main contribution is the significant improvement in the efficiency of exploring each node of the interpretation tree.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of rendezvous between two agents in urban street networks. Specifically, we consider the case where the agents have variable speeds and they need to schedule a rendezvous or a meeting under uncertainty in their travel times. Examples of such a scenario range from everyday life where two people would like to coordinate a meeting while going from office to home; to a futuristic case where automated taxis would like to meet each other for load balancing passengers. The scheduling for such scenarios can easily become challenging with uncertainties such as delayed departures, road blocks due to construction or traffic congestion. Any solution for such a task is required to minimize the waiting time and the planning overhead. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the total travel time and the waiting time for two agents to complete their respective paths from start to rendezvous and from rendezvous to goal locations subject to delays along their paths. We validate our approach with a street network database which has a cost associated with every query made to the database server. Thus our algorithm intelligently optimizes for rendezvous trajectories that effectively mitigate the scourge of traffic delays, while simultaneously limiting the number of queries through careful analysis of the informative value of each potential query.",

Standard methods from dense 3D point clouds are generally not effective. In this paper, we describe a feature-based approach using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of neighborhoods of points, which results in mathematically principled line and plane features. The key contribution in this work is to show how this type of feature extraction can be done efficiently and robustly even on non-uniformly sampled point clouds. The resulting detector runs in real-time and can be easily tuned to have a low false positive rate, simplifying data association. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on an autonomous car at the MCity Test Facility using a Velodyne HDL-32E, and we compare our results against the state-of-the-art NARF keypoint detector.",

While this task can be performed efficiently and robustly between complex polyhedra, using the exact analytic geometric models issued by CAD modelers still suffers from efficiency limitations. Yet models composed of smooth surfaces are required to ensure smooth contact constraints, thus avoiding possible numerical artifacts which may dramatically affect the behavior of the system in the case of functional contacts. This paper builds on the observation that industrial CAD models are mostly composed of simple surfaces to perform an off-line identification of similar features and build a bounding volume hierarchy in order to locate potential contacts. Those are then computed by dedicated analytic methods, or an iterative root-finder, depending on the actual geometric representations of the features. In the context of dynamic simulation of robotic tasks, our method exhibits interactive computation times while naturally providing better result accuracy than existing polyhedron-specific algorithms.",

This paper presents an event-based approach to the detection of corner points, which benefits from the high temporal resolution, compressed visual information and low latency provided by an asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera. The proposed method adapts the commonly used Harris corner detector to the event-based data, in which frames are replaced by a stream of asynchronous events produced in response to local light changes at \u03bcs temporal resolution. Responding only to changes in its field of view, an event-based camera naturally enhances edges in the scene, simplifying the detection of corner features. We characterised and tested the method on both a controlled pattern and a real scenario, using the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) on the neuromorphic iCub robot. The method detects corners with a typical error distribution within 2 pixels. The error is constant for different motion velocities and directions, indicating a consistent detection across the scene and over time. We achieve a detection rate proportional to speed, higher than frame-based technique for a significant amount of motion in the scene, while also reducing the computational cost.",

This approach relies on nonlinear iterative optimization methods that in practice perform both accurately and efficiently. However, due to the non-convexity of the problem, the obtained solutions come with no guarantee of global optimality and may get stuck in local minima. The application of SLAM to many real-world applications cannot be conceived without additional control tools that detect possible suboptimalities as soon as possible in order to take corrective action and avoid catastrophic failure of the entire system. This paper builds upon the state-of-the-art framework [1] in verification for this problem and introduces a novel superior formulation that leads to a much higher efficiency. While retaining the same high effectiveness, the verification times of our proposal reduce up to >50\u00d7, paving the way for faster verification in critical real applications or in embedded low-power systems. We support our claims with extensive experiments with real and simulated data.",

A robot navigating in a dynamic environment needs to be aware of objects that might change or move. A segmentation of the laser scans into individual objects is typically the first processing step before a further analysis is performed. In this paper, we present a fast method that segments 3D range data into different objects, runs online, and has small computational demands. Our approach avoids the explicit computation of the 3D point cloud and performs all computations directly on a 2D range image, which enables a fast segmentation for each scan. A further relevant aspect of our method is that we can segment objects even if the 3D data is sparse. This is important for scanners such as the new Velodyne Puck. We implemented our approach in C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it using different 3D scanners. Our method can operate at over 100 Hz for the 64-beam Velodyne scanner on a single core of a mobile CPU while producing high quality segmentation results. In addition to this, we make the source code for the approach available.",

This is often achieved through scene depth estimation, by various means. When fast motion is considered, the detection range must be longer enough to allow for safe avoidance and path planning. Current solutions often make assumption on the motion of the vehicle that limit their applicability, or work at very limited ranges due to intrinsic constraints. We propose a novel appearance-based Object Detection system that is able to detect obstacles at very long range and at a very high speed (~ 300Hz), without making assumptions on the type of motion. We achieve these results using a Deep Neural Network approach trained on real and synthetic images and trading some depth accuracy for fast, robust and consistent operation. We show how photo-realistic synthetic images are able to solve the problem of training set dimension and variety typical of machine learning approaches, and how our system is robust to massive blurring of test images.",

Multi-limbed robot is expected to work in dangerous, complicated narrow spaces, where human workers cannot reach. However, if one of the limbs is broken in the dangerous/narrow working space, human operators cannot go to the space to repair it. Even in these situations, the proposed method generates a new gait adaptively using the remaining usable limbs depending on the current situation of the multi-limbed robot. This fault-tolerant ability is effective for multi-limbed robots working in dangerous/narrow space. The method is implemented to a model of a multi-limbed robot \u201cASTERISK\u201d in a dynamical simulator (ODE). Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Self-folding provides an efficient way of creating complex 3D geometries from 2D composites. However, the precision of self-folding structures is often limited by the use of open-loop folding mechanisms. In this paper we demonstrate feedback-controlled self-folding using a shape memory polymer and optical sensors to accurately control folding angles. We present a method of quickly and inexpensively fabricating large collectives of self-folding autonomous robots that can be transported in flat configurations prior to autonomous deployment at target destinations. To demonstrate this, we build a collective of robots that is manufactured in one continuous laminar composite. Individual robots in the collective detach from one other, self-fold into pre-programmed configurations and navigate by phototaxis. This method could be applied to a broad range of applications where logistics necessitate compact transport and where external manipulation is difficult or expensive, such as in space applications or delivering search-and-rescue robots in cluttered environments.",

This paper presents a fiber optical proximity sensor that is integrated with a tactile sensing fingertip of a robotic hand of a mobile robot. The distance estimation of proximity sensors are typically influenced by the reflective properties of an object, such as color or surface roughness. With the approach proposed in this paper, the accuracy of the proximity sensor is enhanced using the information collected by the vision system of the robot. A camera is employed to obtain RGB values of the object to be grasped. Further on, the data obtained from the camera is used to obtain the correct calibration for the proximity sensor. Based on the experimental evidence, it is shown that our approach can be effectively used to reduce the distance estimation error.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a method of force control for a jumping biped robot to correctly control the ground reaction force during continuous jumping. Assuming dynamic motion, such as jumping and running, the attitude of the robot depends on the dynamics in response to the ground reaction force. Therefore, controlling the ground reaction force is necessary for stabilizing the robot's motion. However, control of the ground reaction force involves a fundamental problem: feedback control does not work properly against the impact force owing to limitations in the control bandwidth. This study introduces a method for stiffness ellipse control that utilizes three antagonist pairs of six pneumatic artificial muscles. When the tip of the robot makes contact with the ground, an external force is induced in the direction of lower stiffness. By utilizing this property of the stiffness ellipse, it is possible to control the ground reaction force by feedforward control, which is not dependent on the control bandwidth. Based on this idea, impact force control at landing and jumping force control at takeoff were proposed to correctly control the ground reaction force during the continuous jumping of the robot. The results of several experiments conducted convince us that the relationship between the ground reaction force and the stiffness ellipse is almost linear, and that the ground reaction force can be controlled with high reproducibility by adjusting the stiffness ellipse.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent researches relating to robotic fingers, a novel power transmission mechanism had been designed, and developed as Twist-drive Actuators or Twisted String Actuator systems (TSA). These actuation structures, state of the art, include compact designs, light-weight mechanical structures, inherent compliance, and variable gearing, resulting in the fabrication of anthropomorphic robotic hands. However, those studies mentioned position control of the joint, and focused on the control performance of the pulling forces of a twisted string. This paper, therefore, introduces a novel joint mechanism composed of an Antagonistically-twisted Round-belt Actuator (ARA), which is able to make rotating motion by means of contraction forces induced by twisting small-diameter elastic round-belts. A noteworthy point in this paper is that the ARA robot is extremely well-suited for contact force control, which is exerted on the tip of the single joint robot. First, we demonstrate the existence of hysteresis characteristics of static contraction forces induced by the round-belt twisting, in which three belts are simultaneously twisted at constant low-speed. In addition, there exists a stress relaxation phenomenon when strongly twisting the elastic round-belts. We reveal that such sorts of discontinuous and nonlinear properties do not influence control performance in either the contraction force on the belts or contact force on the tip of the robot. Finally, this paper clearly shows stable and accurate tracking performance of the contact force of the ARA robot. In these experiments, we newly develop a twin/triple-twisted round-belt structure for the agonist side actuator, thus enhancing the contact forces effectively.",

The aim of this study was to apply a new control strategy, named model-inverse time delay control (MiTDC), to series elastic actuators (SEA) in a lower extremity exoskeleton, even in the presence of uncertainties from pHRI. The law for time delay control (TDC) is derived and implementation issues are discussed, including the design of the state observer and the selection of the nominal value of the control distribution coefficient. Additionally, a new concept, a new reference position using the inverse of model dynamics, is introduced to realize satisfactory tracking performance without delay. Experimental results showed that the suggested controller achieved satisfactory performance without accurate information on system parameters, requiring only a nominal value of the control distribution coefficient.",

We propose to estimate local obstacle densities based on already detected objects and use them to predict traversal costs corresponding to potential obstacles in regions not yet observable by the robot's sensors. By taking into account the predicted costs for path planning, the robot is then able to navigate in a more foresighted manner and reduces the risk of getting stuck in cluttered regions. We thoroughly evaluated our approach in simulated and real-world experiments. As the experimental results demonstrate, our method enables the robot to efficiently navigate through environments containing cluttered regions and achieves significantly shorter completion times compared to a standard approach not using any prediction.",

Our algorithm TAPF* has the following features: (a) it incorporates kinematic constraints of robots in form of velocity limits; (b) it maintains a user-specified safety distance between robots; (c) it attempts to minimize the makespan; and (d) it runs efficiently for hundreds of robots and dozens of groups even in dense 3D environments with narrow corridors and other occlusions.

Prior work showed how to represent a desired pattern using a directed graph in which each edge is labeled with a rigid body transformation, and proposed an algorithm that accepts this graph as input and computes destinations for each robot using only local information. In this paper, we improve upon that result by describing a new algorithm, substantially different both in message passing procedure and in movement strategy, to resolve several limitations of the existing algorithm. We prove that, by executing this algorithm, the robots will form the desired lattice pattern in a bounded amount of time. We further show that, if the robots' communication graph is connected at the start of the algorithm, it will remain connected throughout the algorithm's execution. Using a simulation, we demonstrate that this algorithm works correctly for systems with dozens of autonomous robots to form various lattice patterns. Moreover, the experiments show a significant improvement in solution quality for our new algorithm compared to the previous approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Despite an intensive research on flapping flight and flapping wing MAVs in recent years, there are still no accurate models of flapping flight dynamics. This is partly due to lack of free flight data, in particular during manoeuvres. In this work, we present, for the first time, a comparison of free flight forces estimated using solely an on-board IMU with wind tunnel measurements. The IMU based estimation brings higher sampling rates and even lower variation among individual wingbeats, compared to what has been achieved with an external motion tracking system in the past. A good match was found in comparison to wind tunnel measurements; the slight differences observed are attributed to clamping effects. Further insight was gained from the on-board rpm sensor, which showed motor speed variation of \u00b1 15% due to load variation over a wingbeat cycle. The IMU based force estimation represents an attractive solution for future studies of flapping wing MAVs as, unlike wind tunnel measurements, it allows force estimation at high temporal resolutions also during manoeuvres.",

        "abstract": "The Jerboa, a tailed bipedal robot with two hip-actuated, passive-compliant legs and a doubly actuated tail, has been shown both formally and empirically to exhibit a variety of stable hopping and running gaits in the sagittal plane. In this paper we take the first steps toward operating Jerboa as a fully spatial machine by addressing the predominant mode of destabilization away from the sagittal plane: body roll. We develop a provably stable controller for underactuated aerial stabilization of the coupled body roll and tail angles, that uses just the tail torques. We show that this controller is successful at reliably reorienting the Jerboa body in roughly 150 ms of freefall from a large set of initial conditions. This controller also enables (and appears intuitively to be crucial for) sustained empirically stable hopping in the frontal plane by virtue of its substantial robustness against destabilizing perturbations and calibration errors. The controller as well as the analysis methods developed here are applicable to any robotic platform with a similar doubly-actuated spherical tail joint.",

Using a well-trained FOON, robots can decipher a task goal, seek the correct objects at the desired states on which to operate, and generate a sequence of proper manipulation motions. The paper describes FOON's structure and an approach to form a universal FOON with extracted knowledge from online instructional videos. A graph retrieval approach is presented to generate manipulation motion sequences from the FOON to achieve a desired goal, demonstrating the flexibility of FOON in creating a novel and adaptive means of solving a problem using knowledge gathered from multiple sources. The results are demonstrated in a simulated environment to illustrate the motion sequences generated from the FOON to carry out the desired tasks.",

Traditional solutions to this problem are based on the description of images using hand-crafted features, which have been shown to offer moderate invariance against seasonal changes. In this paper, we present a new proposal focused on automatically learned descriptors, which are processed by means of a technique recently popularized in the computer vision community: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The novelty of our approach relies on fusing the image information from multiple convolutional layers at several levels and granularities. In addition, we compress the redundant data of CNN features into a tractable number of bits for efficient and robust place recognition. The final descriptor is reduced by applying simple compression and binarization techniques for fast matching using the Hamming distance. An exhaustive experimental evaluation confirms the improved performance of our proposal (CNN-VTL) with respect to state-of-the-art methods over varied long-term datasets recorded across seasons.",

The device consists of a single degree of freedom series elastic actuator that connects to the trunk of a patient. The series elastic system is novel in that, it can provide the desired level of dynamic unloading such that the patient experiences only a percentage of his/her weight and inertia. Inertia compensation is important, since the inertial forces can cause significant deviations from the desired unloading force, specially at low support forces and fast walking speeds. Furthermore, this feature enables the inertia of the harness and force sensing unit attached to the patient to be compensated for, making sure that the device does not interfere with the natural gait cycle. We present a functional prototype of the device, its characterization and experimental verification of the approach.",

GUMS is based on the existing generalized unified model (GUM), which we extend in order to satisfy a tight relationship among a pair of omnidirectional views for fixed baseline sensors. We exemplify the proposed model's calibration via a single-camera coaxial omnistereo system in a joint bundle-adjusted fashion. We compare our coupled method against the naive approach where the calibration of intrinsic parameters is first performed individually for each omnidirectional view using existing monocular implementations, to then solve for the extrinsic parameters as an additional step that has no effect on the intrinsic model solutions initially computed. We validate GUMS and its calibration effectiveness using both real and synthetic systems against ground-truth data. Our calibration method proves successful for correcting the unavoidable misalignment present in vertically-configured catadioptric rigs. We also generate 3D point clouds employing the calibrated GUMS systems in order to demonstrate the qualitative outcome of our contribution.",

        "abstract": "The reaction wheel stabilizer (RWS) concept for bipedal stabilization consists of a wheel that can be accelerated in order to impart a reaction torque on the rest of the biped. The beneficial effects of such a device (or emulation of such a device through limb motion) on transient body motions are not well understood. This work quantifies this phenomenon by comparing optimal trajectories for robots with and without an RWS in terms of energy efficiency and dynamic feasibility when attempting to execute speed transitions and disturbance response motions. Robots with RWS systems are able to more efficiently execute abrupt speed transitions, showing up to a 60% improvement in efficiency for single step transitions. In responding to forward push disturbances, the RWS improves efficiency by between 20 and 60% over the range of tested disturbances. These savings are significantly larger than those shown previously for periodic walking.",

They rely on proper function approximators, which are sufficiently flexible to represent arbitrary movements but also ensure goal convergence in point-to-point motions. This work shows that Gaussian Processes (GPs) are suitable as a regressor for learning movements with DMPs ensuring stability. In addition, GPs provide a measure for the uncertainty about the current movement, which we exploit by proposing a new cooperation scheme for DMPs: For better reproduction of demonstrations, we follow the intuition, that individuals with more knowledge lead towards the goal, while others follow and focus on cooperation. Along with simulation results, we validate the presented methods in a robotic cooperative object manipulation task.",

By utilizing the generative property of Gaussian random paths, a Gaussian random path planner is developed to safely steer a robot to a goal position. The Gaussian random path planner can be used in a number of applications, including local path planning for a mobile robot and trajectory optimization for whole body motion planning. We have conducted an extensive set of simulations and experiments, showing that the proposed planner outperforms look-ahead planners which use a pre-defined subset of egocentric trajectories in terms of collision rates and trajectory lengths. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to existing trajectory optimization methods as an initialization step and demonstrate that it can help produce more cost-efficient trajectories.",

This adds more flexibility to the design of the estimator and in our case avoids the need for state augmentation. We achieve this by adapting the maximum likelihood formulation of the Kalman Filter, and thereby represent all measurement models as residuals. Posing the problem in this form allows for the straightforward integration of any number of (nonlinear) constraints between two subsequent states. To solve the optimization we present a closed form recursive set of equations that directly marginalizes out information that is not required, this leads to an efficient and generic implementation. The new algorithm is applied to parameter estimation on MAVs which have two dynamic models, the MAV dynamic model and the IMU-driven model. We show the benefits and limitations of the new filtering approach on a simplified simulation example and on a real MAV system.",

We use a modular approach based on regression in the model space. First, inverse dynamic models for the known masses are learned using a recently proposed approach called Independent Joint Learning (IJL). In IJL the torque errors due to unmodeled dynamics of the real robot are estimated using only joint-local information. Second, a mapping from load mass to model parameters of torque error model is learned in order to generalize the inverse dynamics to new load masses. The modular approach improves the accuracy of an existing KUKA LWR IV+ inverse dynamic model. The results are compared with a single step IJL approach. The results show the excellent generalization for new load masses using regression in the model space.",

        "abstract": "Modern SLAM systems with a depth sensor are able to reliably reconstruct dense 3D geometric maps of indoor scenes. Representing these maps in terms of meaningful entities is a step towards building semantic maps for autonomous robots. One approach is to segment the 3D maps into semantic objects using Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which requires large 3D ground truth datasets to train the classification model. Additionally, the CRF inference is often computationally expensive. In this paper, we present an unsupervised geometric-based approach for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into objects and meaningful scene structures. We approximate an input point cloud by an adjacency graph over surface patches, whose edges are then classified as being either on or off. We devise an effective classifier which utilises both global planar surfaces and local surface convexities for edge classification. More importantly, we propose a novel global plane extraction algorithm for robustly discovering the underlying planes in the scene. Our algorithm is able to enforce the extracted planes to be mutually orthogonal or parallel which conforms usually with human-made indoor environments. We reconstruct 654 3D indoor scenes from NYUv2 sequences to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our segmentation method.",

State-of-the-art methods for cooperative navigation are often tested in ideal laboratory conditions and not ready to be deployed in real-world environments, which are often cluttered with static and dynamic obstacles. In this work, we explore a graph-based framework to achieve control of real robot formations moving in a world cluttered with a variety of obstacles by introducing a new distributed algorithm for reconfiguring the formation shape. We systematically validate the reconfiguration algorithm using three real robots in scenarios of increasing complexity.",

In this work, we propose an alternative solution to the problem of grasp acquisition in simple autonomous pick and place scenarios, by utilizing the concept of grasp envelopes: sets of constraints on gripper postures. We propose a fast method for extracting grasp envelopes for objects that fit within a known shape category, placed in an unknown environment. Our approach is based on grasp envelope primitives, which encode knowledge of human grasping strategies. We use environment models, reconstructed from noisy sensor observations, to refine the grasp envelope primitives and extract bounded envelopes of collision-free gripper postures. Also, we evaluate the envelope extraction procedure both in a stand alone fashion, as well as an integrated component of an autonomous picking system.",

The extension of quality metrics for synergy-driven hands for the case of underactuated grasping is also presented. The performance of both types of measures is evaluated with simulated examples, concluding with a comparative discussion of their main features.",

We use objects modeled as point clouds obtained from a sensor camera or from a CAD model. We process the point clouds dividing them into two set of slices, one for each hand, where we look for sets of triplets of points. Each triplet must accomplish some physical conditions based on the structure of the hands. Then, triplets of points from each set of slices are evaluated to find a combination that satisfies the force closure condition (FC). Once one valid couple of triplets have been found the inverse kinematics of the system is computed in order to know if the points are kinematically reachable by the hands, if so, motion planning and a collision check are performed to asses if the grasp configuration of the system is suitable. The paper includes application examples of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In robotics, robotic arms should be smaller, less expensive, and able to demonstrate a better performance, in order to be utilized in various fields. However, expensive actuators and speed reducers are required to generate sufficient force at the end effector after overcoming the gravitational torque of robotic arm. Robotic arms become compact and cost effective if the gravitational torque can be passively compensated. Especially in the field of robotic laparoscopic surgery, the static equilibrium state of the robot arm in the entire workspace is essential to achieve both safety and ease of use. In this study, we propose a novel passive gravity compensation mechanism based on springs and wires. This mechanism utilizes a scotch yoke mechanism to compensate the gravitational torque changed by two rotational degrees of freedom (DOF). Furthermore, we applied to a surgical robotic arm which was constructed using a roll-pitch joint. According to the experiments, it was proved that the new mechanism effectively compensate the gravitational torque. As a result, compact and cost-effective robotic arms can be developed satisfying safety and ease of use.",

It guarantees that the front attached suction cup of the robot obtains a large enough reaction force from the attached surface. Experimental results show that the robot prototype with the designed guide rail is able to stably climb a surface without falling off, since the front suction cup of the robot prototype can be completely attached to the climbing surface.",

Currently widespread position control methods such as Proportional Integral Derivative control do not perform well under the influence of gusts. Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) is a sensor-based control technique that can control nonlinear systems subject to disturbances. This method was developed for the attitude control of MAVs, but in this paper we generalize this method to the outer loop control of MAVs under gust loads. Significant improvements over a traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller are demonstrated in an experiment where the drone flies in and out of a fan's wake. The control method does not rely on frequent position updates, so it is ready to be applied outside with standard GPS modules.",

        "abstract": "Exoskeletons offer an intuitive method for actuating multiple DOF of the body; this makes them attractive for applications where generation and coupling of artificial forces to the limbs is needed. Force feedback hand exoskeletons have been continuously considered for whole hand haptic interaction in virtual reality simulators, in teleoperation setups and for rehabilitation. In hand exoskeletons finger tracking, actuation and transmission systems must be embedded in confined spaces, matching at the same time the profound dexterity of the hand transparently and without causing a burden. Most of the design approaches for such systems have remained largely experimental due to hardware limitations, impacting heavily on important functional and ergonomic factors. This paper presents the design of a novel 3-digit hand exoskeleton, which addresses the issues of finger tracking and force feedback. It proposes a new approach for the application of the feedback force with a single attachment at the fingertip through a 6DoF kinematic chain. This kinematic linkage allows for unconstrained reach of the fingers within their full workspace and facilitates a sensor system for high resolution 6DOF tracking of the fingertips. At the same time the highly under-actuated mechanism permits application of a bidirectional feedback force at the fingertips. The hand exoskeleton fits an large range of hand sizes and requires no mechanical alignment between the linkage and the fingers, whatsoever. Preliminary results show the efficacy of this system as a tracking and force feedback device for the hand.",

During an off-line learning phase, a classifier that can recognize when a human intends to interact with the robot is trained. At runtime, this trained classifier allows us to recognize humans who intend to interact with, or obstruct, the robot in some way. We validate our approach using both recorded and simulated data in an environment in which some humans intentionally obstruct the robot. Our classifier identifies these potential blockers, thus allowing the robot to safely and efficiently navigate the environment by minimizing the chances of being blocked.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In a robot mounted camera arrangement, hand-eye calibration estimates the rigid relationship between the robot and camera coordinate frames. Most hand-eye calibration techniques use a calibration object to estimate the relative transformation of the camera in several views of the calibration object and link these to the forward kinematics of the robot to compute the hand-eye transformation. Such approaches achieve good accuracy for general use but for applications such as robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery, acquiring a calibration sequence multiple times during a procedure is not practical. In this paper, we present a new approach to tackle the problem by using the robotic surgical instruments as the calibration object with well known geometry from CAD models used for manufacturing. Our approach removes the requirement of a custom sterile calibration object to be used in the operating room and it simplifies the process of acquiring calibration data when the laparoscope is constrained to move around a remote centre of motion. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility to perform hand-eye calibration using components of the robotic system itself and we show promising validation results on synthetic data as well as data acquired with the da Vinci Research Kit.",

        "abstract": "The use of conventional surgical tool holders requires an assistant during positioning and adjustment due to the lack of weight compensation. In this paper, we introduce a robotic arm system with hands-on control approach. The robot incorporates a force sensor at the end effector which realises tool weight compensation as well as hands-on manipulation. On the operating table, the required workspace can be tight due to a number of instruments required. There are situations where the surgical tool is at the desired location but the holder arm pose is not ideal due to space constraints or obstacles. Although the arm is a non-redundant robot because of the limited degrees of freedom, the pseudo-null-space inverse kinematics can be used to constrain a particular joint of the robot to a specific angle while the other joints compensate in order to minimise the tool movement. This allows operator to adjust the arm configuration conveniently together with the weight compensation. Experimental results demonstrated that our robotic arm can maintain the tool position during reconfiguration significantly more stably than a conventional one.",

This paper presents a novel haptic based gait rehabilitation system (HGRS) which has the potential to provide over-ground gait training regimens for post-stroke ambulatory subjects. It consists of a portable cane for kinesthetic sensing and a wearable vibrotactor array for tactile biofeedback. Contact of user with the handle provides light grip force, it serves the purpose of balance assurance and increased muscle activity through light touch concept and vibrotactors contribute in enhancing the gait modification through afferent signal of vibration. Walking trials conducted with stroke patients indicate increased muscle activation and balance, and improved temporal symmetry with use of HGRS. HGRS is capable of assisting physical therapists in training individuals with stroke suffering from gait abnormalities. In addition, it is easy to use and low-cost which makes it reachable to a vast domain of subjects suffering from gait abnormalities.",

Results showed that signal-to-noise ratios of around 15dB could be achieved by the proposed system for a 65dB babble noise plus directional music noise condition. In the same noise condition, subjective intelligibility tests were conducted, and an improvement of 65 to 90% word intelligibility rates could be achieved by using the proposed hearing support system.",

        "abstract": "Common design principles for low cost humanoid robots include a low center of mass height and a large support area for increased static stability. However, such principles limit the bipedal mobility of the robot due to the kinematic constraints involved. In this paper, we present an efficient locomotion controller that utilizes automatically calculated heel and toe lift motions to overcome the kinematic constraints. This helps with uneven terrain traversal by providing additional support, and also enables a dynamic heel-strike toe-off gait with a large stride length. We demonstrate the controller in physically realistic simulations, and on the THOR-RD full-sized humanoid robot and DARwIn-OP miniature humanoid robot.",

But in general a complete object model is not available, in particular when dealing with unknown objects. We propose a method for completing shapes that are only partially known, which is a common situation when a robot perceives a new object only from one direction. Our approach is based on the assumption that most objects used in service robotic setups have symmetries. We determine and rate symmetry plane candidates to estimate the hidden parts of the object. By finding possible supporting planes based on its immediate neighborhood, the search space for symmetry planes is restricted, and the bottom part of the object is added. Gaps along the sides in the direction of the view axis are closed by linear interpolation. We evaluate our approach with real-world experiments using the YCB object and model set [1].",

In particular, we consider a hierarchical coordination strategy, where the environment is partitioned into sectors: coordination on the top layer defines the sequence of sectors to be traveled, while coordination on the bottom layer deals with traffic management inside each sector. In this paper we introduce a novel partitioning algorithm, that defines the sectors in a dynamic manner, taking into account both the shape of the (generally non-convex) environment, and the current distribution of the AGVs. This is achieved exploiting a clustering algorithm, and subsequently defining the sectors based on the geodesic distance.",

We follow a general algorithmic structure that first generates a large set of 6-DOF grasp candidates and then classifies each of them as a good or a bad grasp. Our focus in this paper is on improving the second step by using depth sensor scans from large online datasets to train a convolutional neural network. We propose two new representations of grasp candidates, and we quantify the effect of using prior knowledge of two forms: instance or category knowledge of the object to be grasped, and pretraining the network on simulated depth data obtained from idealized CAD models. Our analysis shows that a more informative grasp candidate representation as well as pretraining and prior knowledge significantly improve grasp detection. We evaluate our approach on a Baxter Research Robot and demonstrate an average grasp success rate of 93% in dense clutter. This is a 20% improvement compared to our prior work.",

The marker system has been extended to incorporate the use of dual camera sensor fusion. The proposed system is specifically designed and planned to be suitable for a real world industrial assignment, namely the setting of painted ink-marker used as an orientation for drilling, measuring or maintenance tasks on the ceiling in an infrastructure inspection work environment. We show with test flights the feasibility of this approach and the ability of the developed platform to do high precision localization and positioning relative to an AR-marker in order to perform an ink-marker placement task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the most important points in path tracking applications, is the capability of the robot to track the desired path as accurately as possible. Results presented in the literature in on-road contexts are convincing, but the case of off-road mobile robots introduces other issues, like bad grip conditions or non-flat ground. These issues can lead to a lack of accuracy of the tracking, even more when we consider high speed. The quality of the tracking depends on the modelling and the control laws used, but it depends also on the path to follow and on the soil conditions. If some small errors may be acceptable, it is sometimes mandatory to have a limited error, in particular when avoiding an obstacle or when moving in a narrow pathway. The aim of the algorithm proposed in this paper is to determine the maximum velocity of the robot during the tracking, for the lateral error to stay below a desired limit. In order to achieve this, a predictive approach taking into account for the evolution of a dynamic model, control laws and actuators properties is proposed. It permits to predict the forthcoming tracking error and consequently to estimate the maximum velocity that the robot can reach in accordance with the maximum deviation allowed.",

        "abstract": "Robotic vision, unlike computer vision, typically involves processing a stream of images from a camera with time varying pose operating in an environment with time varying lighting conditions and moving objects. Repeating robotic vision experiments under identical conditions is often impossible, making it difficult to compare different algorithms. For machine learning applications a critical bottleneck is the limited amount of real world image data that can be captured and labelled for both training and testing purposes. In this paper we investigate the use of a photo-realistic simulation tool to address these challenges, in three specific domains: robust place recognition, visual SLAM and object recognition. For the first two problems we generate images from a complex 3D environment with systematically varying camera paths, camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. For the first time we are able to systematically characterise the performance of these algorithms as paths and lighting conditions change. In particular, we are able to systematically generate varying camera viewpoint datasets that would be difficult or impossible to generate in the real world. We also compare algorithm results for a camera in a real environment and a simulated camera in a simulation model of that real environment. Finally, for the object recognition domain, we generate labelled image data and characterise the viewpoint dependency of a current convolution neural network in performing object recognition. Together these results provide a multi-domain demonstration of the beneficial properties of using simulation to characterise and analyse a wide range of robotic vision algorithms.",

In this work, we present a real-time markerless approach for obtaining high-precision stereo extrinsic calibration using a novel 5-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) and nonlinear optimization on a manifold, which captures the observability property of vision-only stereo calibration. Our method minimizes epipolar errors between spatial per-frame sparse natural features. It does not require temporal feature correspondences, making it not only invariant to dynamic scenes and illumination changes, but also able to run significantly faster than standard bundle adjustment-based approaches. We introduce a principled method to determine if the calibration converges to the required level of accuracy, and show through online experiments that our approach achieves a level of accuracy that is comparable to offline marker-based calibration methods. Our method refines stereo extrinsic to the accuracy that is sufficient for block matching-based dense disparity computation. It provides a cost-effective way to improve the reliability of stereo vision systems for long-term autonomy.",

        "abstract": "For a depalletizing robot to be practical, it has to be able to work skillfully in a limited space with a depalletizinging speed equal to or exceeding that of a human. Our new robot has the following advantages. A gantry robot and a telescopic arm mechanism are adopted so that the robot, although space-saving, has a large workspace. Using camera image and depth image, the robot recognizes the various package stacked complicatedly and decides the handling order of the package. The robot generates the most suitable handling path and performs handling control such that stacks do not collapse. The robot achieves fall prevention of the package and stable conveyance by supporting beneath the package with another arm, the conveyor arm. Moreover, in order to accelerate processing of packages, we thought it was important for the robot to be equipped with a wide end effector capable holding multiple packages simultaneously. Therefore we developed a depalletizing simulator and performed the optimal design of the end effector by using a simulator. This, we were able to realize a compact depalletizing robot with a depalletizing speed equal to that of a human.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a 10 kg tensegrity ball probe that can quickly and precisely deliver a 1 kg payload over a 1 km distance on the Moon by combining cable-driven rolling and thruster-based hopping. Previous research has shown that cable-driven rolling is effective for precise positioning, even in rough terrain. However, traveling large distances using thruster-based hopping, which is made feasible by the lightweight and compliant nature of the tensegrity structure, has not been explored. To evaluate the feasibility of a thruster-based tensegrity robot, a centrally-positioned cold gas thruster with nitrogen propellant was selected, and the system was simulated using the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT) for four hopping profiles on hilly terrains. Optimizing energy efficiency and mechanical capabilities of the tensegrity robot, hopping profiles with a long flight distance per hop, followed by the higher accuracy rolling, are recommended. Simulations also show that thrust regulation can improve energy efficiency. Regulation of thrust magnitude can be achieved using a pressure regulator, but regulation of thrust orientation calls for additional control effort. In this paper, it is demonstrated that gimbal systems as well as shape-shifting control of the tensegrity structure have the potential to regulate thrust orientation. Finally, algorithms for localization and path planning that combine hopping and rolling for energy-efficient navigation are presented.",

The Teleo-Reactive programs (TRs) is a highly cited reactive hierarchical robot control approach suggested by Nilsson and And-Or-Trees are trees used for heuristic problems solving. In this paper, we show that BTs generalize TRs as well as And-Or-Trees, even though the two concepts are quite different. And-Or-Trees are trees of conditions, and we show that they transform into a feedback execution plan when written as a BT. TRs are hierarchical control structures, and we show how every TR can be written as a BT. Furthermore, we show that so-called Universal TRs, guaranteeing that the goal will be reached, are a special case of so-called Finite Time Successful BTs. This implies that many designs and theoretical results developed for TRs can be applied to BTs.",

        "abstract": "Human activity recognition plays an important role in personal assistive robot, being able to recognize human activity and perform corresponding assistive action is a great challenges for personal assistive robot. Human body is an articulated system of rigid segments that can be divided into five parts, but many existing methods always identify actions based on the motion trajectories of whole body. In this paper, taking into account the fact that most actions can be performed by a few limbs and the other limbs should not impact on the action recognition, we proposed an activity recognition method based on limb weights. The weight of each limb is composed of consistency weight and uniqueness weight, which are learned according to the similarity degree among different sequences for each specific action. The covariance descriptor, which is the concatenation of eigenvalues extracted from covariance matrices, is adopted to represent the motion trajectory of each limb. In order to distinguish action instances from each other in the feature sequences, a simple annotation method is used. Experimental results on the Cornell activity dataset and the Lab dataset show that the proposed method not only can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms, but also is appropriate to recognize the actions whose non-core limbs' trajectories are different from each other.",

Different places afford different activity possibilities - sleeping is mostly done in the bedroom, and cooking is mostly done in the kitchen. Semantic place labels like kitchen and bedroom, therefore, provide context with which a robot can better infer human activity. Real rooms, however, often defy simple place labels, as they can be multi-purpose, supporting many different types of human activity. The solution is to identify the spatial affordances associated with the current nexus of human activity - a microlevel place labeling. In this paper, we will demonstrate how to estimate these local spatial affordances by integrating a deep learning based place estimator with human pose estimation. The resulting affordances are then used to improve activity recognition using Bayesian belief network.",

Most of pioneering contributions addressing Co-Working interaction control problems has focused on PID based control.

Non-Smooth optimization is one of recently developed tools that addresses the problem of tuning structured controllers according to H\u221e, H2, and pole placement specifications. In this paper, the problem of force amplification is transcribed into high level H\u221e specifications and is solved using Non-Smooth optimization. The resulting controller is tested on an industrial robot and shows similar performances as the state of the art while respecting some extra robustness certificates. Therefore, thanks to the abstraction level of the proposed technique, it becomes possible to tune interaction controllers with high number of tunable parameters according to complex performance/robustness specifications.",

In this application, however, it is an important concern to ensure the safety of the human and the robot. In the human guidance programming scenario, the operator plans a collision-free path for the robot end-effector, but the robot body might collide with an obstacle while being guided by the operator. In this paper, a novel on-line velocity based collision avoidance algorithm is developed to solve the problem in this particular scenario. The proposed algorithm gives an explicit solution to deal with both collision avoidance and human guidance command at the same time, which provides the operator a better and safer lead through programming experience. The real-time experiment is performed on FANUC LR Mate 200 iD/7L in three different obstacle scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The performance of human-robot collaboration tasks can be improved by incorporating predictions of the human collaborator's movement intentions. These predictions allow a collaborative robot to both provide appropriate assistance and plan its own motion so it does not interfere with the human. In the specific case of human reach intent prediction, prior work has divided the task into two pieces: recognition of human activities and prediction of reach intent. In this work, we propose a joint model for simultaneous recognition of human activities and prediction of reach intent based on skeletal pose. Since future reach intent is tightly linked to the action a person is performing at present, we hypothesize that this joint model will produce better performance on the recognition and prediction tasks than past approaches. In addition, our approach incorporates a simple human kinematic model which allows us to generate features that compactly capture the reachability of objects in the environment and the motion cost to reach those objects, which we anticipate will improve performance. Experiments using the CAD-120 benchmark dataset show that both the joint modeling approach and the human kinematic features give improved F1 scores versus the previous state of the art.",

The 3D map is created using the 3D data from an RGB-D camera mounted on the robot and simultaneously transmitted to a remote server, and then rendered to the VR device. On the other hand, the intentions of the user are inferred using the motion of the head movement based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), and then interpreted into commands to control the robot. We implement the proposed approach based on a modified Pioneer robot platform. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed system.",

However, automation can also result in an increase in system complexity and a corresponding decrease in system transparency, which makes identifying and reasoning about errors in mission plans more difficult. To help explain errors in robotic planning systems, we define a notion of structured probabilistic counterexamples, which provide human-interpretable diagnostic information about requirements violations resulting from complex probabilistic robotic behavior. We propose an approach for generating such counterexamples using mixed integer linear programming and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach via a case study of UAV mission planning demonstrated in the AMASE multi-UAV simulator.",

        "abstract": "Our human-robot collaboration research aims to improve the fluency and efficiency of interactions between humans and robots when executing a set of tasks in a shared workspace. During human-robot collaboration, a robot and a user must often complete a disjoint set of tasks that use an overlapping set of objects, without using the same object simultaneously. A key challenge is deciding what task the robot should perform next in order to facilitate fluent and efficient collaboration. Most prior work does so by first predicting the human's intended goal, and then selecting actions given that goal. However, it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to infer the human's exact goal in real time, and this serial predict-then-act method is not adaptive to changes in human goals. In this paper, we present a system for inferring a probability distribution over human goals, and producing assistance actions given that distribution in real time. The aim is to minimize the disruption caused by the nature of human-robot shared workspace. We extend recent work utilizing Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for shared autonomy in order to provide assistance without knowing the exact goal. We evaluate our system in a study with 28 participants, and show that our POMDP model outperforms state of the art predict-then-act models by producing fewer human-robot collisions and less human idling time.",

Existing methods tend to either take prohibitively long to compute for humanoids or artificially limit the physical capabilities of the humanoid platform by restricting the robot's actions to predetermined trajectories. We present a hybrid planning system which is able to scale well for complex tasks without relying on predetermined robot actions. Our system utilizes the hybrid backward-forward planning algorithm for high-level task planning combined with humanoid primitives for standing and walking motion planning. These primitives are designed to be efficiently computable during planning, despite the large amount of complexity present in humanoid robots, while still informing the task planner of the geometric constraints present in the problem. Our experiments apply our method to simulated pick-and-place problems with additional gate constraints impacting navigation using the DRC-HUBO1 robot. Our system is able to solve puzzle-like problems on a humanoid within a matter of minutes.",

Building upon our recent works, we generalize the classical hybrid force/velocity control design to this situation, handling complementary quantities along the directions of a suitable contact task frame in a dynamically decoupled way. The contact force is estimated online using our residual method together with an external sensor to localize the contact point, and the time-varying contact task frame is obtained analytically from this estimate.

        "abstract": "Most legged animals exploit flexible body and supporting muscles to produce power for dynamic behaviors which results in fast locomotion and additional mobility. Previous works have focused on the symmetric flexible body with massless legs associated to the body. However, body bending in animals during running happens prior to the rear side instead of the middle point of body. Therefore, a quadruped model with a passive spinal joint, asymmetric segmented body, actuated hip joints and legs is introduced. By using a numerical return map, a periodic bounding locomotion of the model is found with optimal sets of initial conditions and proper system parameters. Moreover, this paper investigates the effects of spine flexibility in segmented body on quadrupedal bounding gait. The results show that asymmetric segmented body has bigger spine oscillation, shorter stride period and smaller cost of transport, which helps the robot run more efficiently.",

        "abstract": "This work deals with interactive motion planning processes intended to assist a human operator when simulating industrial tasks such as assembly, maintenance or disassembly in Virtual Reality. Such applications need motion planning on surfaces. We propose an original interactive path planning algorithm with contact, I-RRT-C, based on a RRT-Connect approach. This algorithm is based on a real-time interactive approach allowing both an automatic motion planner and a human operator to jointly explore the workspace. A parameter balances the authority between the computer and the operator to reduce processing times. We improve the guidance by allowing to sample on the surfaces of obstacles. Our method allows to find a path in cluttered environments or to solve contact operations such as insertion or sliding tasks. Last, we present experimental results showing that our interactive path planner with contact brings a significant improvement over state of the art methods in both free and contact space.",

The proposed condition ensure both the positive definiteness and the triangular inequality of 3D inertia matrices as opposed to existing techniques in which the triangular inequality constraint is ignored. This paper presents also a new parametrization that naturally ensures that the inertial parameters are fully physical consistency. The proposed parametrization is exploited to reformulate the inertial identification problem as a manifold optimization problem, that ensures that the identified parameters can always be generated by a physical body. The proposed optimization problem has been validated with a set of experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Illumination changes are a typical problem for many outdoor long-term applications such as visual place recognition. Keypoints may fail to match between images taken at the same location but different times of the day. Although recently some methods are presented for creating shadow-free image representations, all of them have the limitation in terms of dealing with night images and non-Planckian source of lighting. In this paper we present a new method for creating illumination invariant image representation using a combination of two existing methods based on natural image statistics that address the issue of illumination invariance. Unlike previous attempts at solving the problem of illumination invariant representation, the proposed method does not assume the ideal narrow-band color camera nor a calibration step for each environment. We evaluate our method on real datasets to establish its accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method outperforms competing methods for illumination invariant image representation.",

The planner explores the image moment based feature space, impends acceleration to the image features and extends the feature tree. A reactionless visual servoing control law is integrated to extend the tree in the configuration space simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is able to incorporate the necessary coupling between the motions of the the dual arms and the base of the robot to ensure zero base reactions. Additionally, it also gives the flexibility to apply multiple constraints in both the image space and the configuration space. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is exhibited by implementing the algorithm on a numerical model of a 14-DoF dual arm space robot.",

The proposed control architecture has been experimentally tested.",

Cable-driven SEAs also allow flexible installation and remote torque transmission, etc. However, there are still challenges for the impedance control of cable-driven SEAs, such as the reduced bandwidth caused by the elastic component, and the performance balance between reference tracking and robustness. In this paper, a velocity sourced cable-driven SEA has been set up. Then, a stabilizing 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) control approach was designed to separately pursue the goals of robustness and torque tracking. Further, the impedance control structure for human-robot interaction was designed and implemented with a torque compensator. Both simulation and practical experiments have validated the efficacy of the 2-DOF method for the control of cable-driven SEAs.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of a twisting skill to a multi-DOF end effector for manipulating linear deformable objects (LDOs). When manipulating of LDOs such as rope knotting, an important factor is to control torsion. However, controlling torsion is difficult using only the robot arm movement because of the range limit of a manipulator and the danger of collision with the environment such as a table and objects to be tied. On the other hand, implementing the movement into a robot hand as in-hand manipulation means that the robot-arm movement can be compact. In this study, we extract what is needed in a \u201ctwisting skill\u201d, implement them into multi-DOF end effectors mounted on a dual-arm robot, and evaluate the skill. Then, we demonstrate rope manipulation including a knotting task and verify the effect by using a twisting skill. Our results show that the proposed method can be used to control the twisted angle of the rope with the required precision. Furthermore, using the proposed twisting skill, when placing a rope on a table top, the accuracy and reproducibility are improved compared with the case when the skill is not used. Finally, using the proposed method, clove hitches are successfully tied.",

        "abstract": "The property of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method of being mesh free, adaptable and sui table for tracking of individual particles makes it appropriate for approximating swarm behaviors for multi-agent robotics applications. The researchers modeled each of the swarm robots as SPH particles and then subjected them to external forces to exhibit aggregation and force certain formations. The external forces subjected to the SPH particles are gravity forces and container constraints . The containers explored in the study are simple geometrical primitives: sphere and cube . Computer simulations were done to show how SPH can facilitate in forcing swarm formations with the help of bounding primitives. Algorithm benchmarking was done to show how well SPH performs. Results show that SPH performs better than the benchmark algorithm by a margin of 0.703 and 1.016 units for the two set-ups, respectively. Actual robot implementation was also done to verify the effectivity and viability of the proposed algorithm in exhibiting the aggregation behavior. After 15 seconds of system run time, the interparticle distance and motion accuracy reached 96.93% and 91.14%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Safe and effective telemanipulation of concentric tube robots is hindered by their complex, non-intuitive kinematics. Guidance schemes in the form of attractive and repulsive constraints can simplify task execution and facilitate natural operation of the robot by clinicians. The real-time seamless calculation and application of guidance, however, requires computationally efficient algorithms that solve the non-linear inverse kinematics of the robot and guarantee that the commanded robot configuration is stable and sufficiently away from the anatomy. This paper presents a multi-processor framework that allows on-the-fly calculation of optimal safe paths based on rapid workspace and roadmap pre-computation The real-time nature of the developed software enables complex guidance constraints to be implemented with minimal computational overhead. A user study on a simulated challenging clinical problem demonstrated that the incorporated guiding constraints are highly beneficial for fast and accurate navigation with concentric tube robots.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of deep neural networks as function approximators in reinforcement learning. In this paper, an experience replay method is proposed that ensures that the distribution of the experiences used for training is between that of the policy and a uniform distribution. Through experiments on a magnetic manipulation task it is shown that the method reduces the need for sustained exhaustive exploration during learning. This makes it attractive in scenarios where sustained exploration is in-feasible or undesirable, such as for physical systems like robots and for life long learning. The method is also shown to improve the generalization performance of the trained policy, which can make it attractive for transfer learning. Finally, for small experience databases the method performs favorably when compared to the recently proposed alternative of using the temporal difference error to determine the experience sample distribution, which makes it an attractive option for robots with limited memory capacity.",

        "abstract": "Indoor robot localization systems using wireless signal measurements have gained popularity in recent years, as wireless Local Area Networks can be found practically everywhere. In this field, a popular approach is the use of fingerprinting techniques, such as Gaussian Processes. In our approach, we improve Gaussian Processes based mapping using path loss models as priors. Path loss models encode information regarding the signal propagation phenomena into the mapping. Our approach first fits training data to a simple path loss model, and then trains a zero-mean Gaussian Process with the mismatches between the models and the data. Signal strength mean predictions are done using both the path loss model and the Gaussian Process output, while variances are calculated by bounding the Gaussian Process variance using the path loss models. Notably, the main improvement generated by our approach is not an enhanced mean value prediction, but rather a better model variance prediction. This translates into better likelihood estimations, leading to higher localization accuracy. Experiments using data acquired in an indoor environment and our approach as the perceptual likelihood of a dual Monte Carlo localization algorithm are used to demonstrate this improvement. Furthermore, this idea can be extrapolated to other fingerprinting techniques and to applications other than wireless-based localization.",

The robot pose is first obtained individually by the cable length measurements and the cable angle position measurements. A data fusion scheme combining these two types of measurements is then proposed in order to improve the CPDM accuracy.

Redundant manipulators facilitate the problem of Cartesian contact force and torque estimation (CCFE) at the TCP, since an increased amount of joint level information is available for estimating the six components of external wrench. In this paper, we point out that the errors in CCFE estimates arising from inevitable uncertainties in available joint level information (either measurements or estimates) depend on the manipulator configuration. Based on this, an algorithm is proposed that resolves redundancy in an optimal way with respect of the achievable CCFE quality. For a given TCP pose, the joint configuration resulting in minimized CCFE errors is calculated. The proposed method is verified by means of experimental data gathered from a 7DOF manipulator.",

In order to analyze optimal hammering task, the analytical model of external and internal impulses are taken as the measure. Desired hammering task implies that the hammer simultaneously exerts maximum external impulse on nail and minimum internal impulses on robot or human joints. The advantages of dual arm manipulator with muscles over dual arm without muscles and single arm model with muscle and without muscle are presented. Moreover, the effective mass in nailing operation is experimentally obtained for two different materials and it is integrated into the external impulse model of the hammering task.

        "abstract": "Most modern approaches for tactile object recognition with robotic hands do not use proprioceptive data. In those that do, a limited number of objects with similar shapes is recognized. Furthermore, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) based on raw values of joint angles/torques are frequently implemented which requires large sets of training data. In this paper, we present an approach based only on joint angles of a robotic hands to identify the shape of an object regardless its size and position within the hand. A representation of the joint angles is created to endow the robotic hand with proprioception. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented for shape identification using patterns or signatures generated on this representation when the objects are grasped. To illustrate the scope of this method, tests are performed on five shapes present in common objects. Both SVM and SOM trained with signatures were at least 10% more accuracy than the ones trained with raw values of joint angles. Training sets are reduced at least 85% with respect to other works. An accuracy of 94% was obtained on large ranges of dimensions of the shapes and positions.",

        "abstract": "We provide a novel incremental data association method to complement our previous work on acoustic structure from motion (ASFM), which recovers 3D scene structure from multiple 2D sonar images, while at the same time localizing the sonar. Given point features extracted from multiple overlapping sonar images, our algorithm automatically finds the correspondences between the features. Our data association method uses information about the geometric correlations of the entire set of landmarks to reject spurious measurements or false positives that might otherwise have been accepted. For each new sonar measurement, the algorithm uses a gating procedure to narrow the landmark match search space. Using the pruned surviving candidate correspondences, we identify the correct hypothesis based on a posterior compatibility cost, penalizing for null matches to avoid all measurements being declared new landmarks. Unlike other methods, ASFM does not require any planar scene assumptions and uses constraints from more than two images to increase accuracy in both mapping and localization. We evaluate our algorithm in simulation and demonstrate successful data association results on real sonar images.",

Most of these methods assume moving objects as outliers or discard the information provided by them. We propose an algorithm to jointly infer the camera trajectory and the moving object trajectory simultaneously. In this paper, we perform a sparse scene flow based motion segmentation using a stereo camera. The segmented objects motion models are used for accurate localization of the camera trajectory as well as the moving objects. We exploit the relationship between moving objects for improving the accuracy of the poses. We formulate the poses as a factor graph incorporating all the constraints. We achieve exact incremental solution by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem in real time. The evaluation is performed on the challenging KITTI dataset with multiple moving cars. Our method outperforms the previous baselines in outdoor navigation.",

The core of this approach comprises a probabilistic inference scheme that predicts semantic labels for object hypotheses at each new frame. From these hypotheses, recognized scene structures are incrementally constructed and tracked. Semantic labels are inferred using a multi-domain convolutional architecture which operates on the image time series and which enables efficient propagation of features as well as robust model registration. To evaluate this architecture, we introduce a large-scale RGB-D dataset JHUSEQ-25 as a new benchmark for the sequence-based scene understanding in complex and densely cluttered scenes. This dataset contains 25 RGB-D video sequences with 100,000 labeled frames in total. We validate our method on this dataset and demonstrate improved performance of semantic segmentation and 6-DoF object pose estimation compared with methods based on the single view.",

In particular, we compare how semi-dense and fully dense tracking methods, with and without the aid of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), perform with respect to changes in image resolution, shutter speed, frame-rates, as well as image and depth noise. To perform an accurate and unbiased evaluation we employ a series of synthetically generated datasets using a simulated sensor rig composed of an RGB-D camera and an IMU. Our findings show that in the absence of motion blur or for cameras with high enough frame-rates relative to the camera motion, the methods are comparable when taking in consideration both accuracy and computation time.",

The analyzed patterns originate from the observation of humans equipped with protective high-visibility garments that represent common safety equipment in the industrial sector. Exploiting the shape of the observed reflectors we adopt shape matching based on the chamfer distance and infer one of seven discrete body posture labels as well as the approximate upper body orientation with respect to the camera. We then proceed to analyze the NIR images on a pixel scale and estimate a figure-ground segmentation together with human body part labels using classification of densely extracted local image patches. Our results indicate a body posture classification accuracy of 80% and figure-ground segmentations with 87% accuracy.",

This capability is critical for creating robots which can interact socially or collaboratively with humans.

We infer human intent by reverse-engineering a human's decision-making and action planning processes under a Bayesian probabilistic programming framework. We present experiments from a 3D environment which demonstrate that the inferred human intent (1) matches well with human judgment, and (2) provides useful contextual cues for object tracking and action recognition.",

Through running at-scale, passive pitching experiments with different wing designs, we compare the relative importance of wing inertia, wing shape, and wing-actuation pairing. We find wing inertia strongly influences the coupling between stroke and pitch dynamics, which directly impacts lift production and efficiency. Flapping resonance frequency is reduced as wing aspect ratio or area moment increases. Further, wing leading edge design strongly influences chordwise center of pressure, which further impacts pitching dynamics. Based on our experimental results we propose a new wing design and measure 37% increase in mean lift relative to a previous work [1].",

        "abstract": "Much of estimation of human internal state (goal, intentions, activities, preferences, etc.) is passive: an algorithm observes human actions and updates its estimate of human state. In this work, we embrace the fact that robot actions affect what humans do, and leverage it to improve state estimation. We enable robots to do active information gathering, by planning actions that probe the user in order to clarify their internal state. For instance, an autonomous car will plan to nudge into a human driver's lane to test their driving style. Results in simulation and in a user study suggest that active information gathering significantly outperforms passive state estimation.",

        "abstract": "We consider an autonomous exploration problem in which a mobile robot is guided by an information-based controller through an a priori unknown environment, choosing to collect its next measurement at the location estimated to be most informative within its current field of view. We propose a novel approach to predict mutual information (MI) using Bayesian optimization. Over several iterations, candidate sensing actions are suggested by Bayesian optimization and added to a committee that repeatedly trains a Gaussian process (GP). The GP estimates MI throughout the robot's action space, serving as the basis for an acquisition function used to select the next candidate. The best sensing action in the committee is executed by the robot. This approach is compared over several environments with two batch methods, one which chooses the most informative action from a set of pseudo-random samples whose MI is explicitly evaluated, and one that applies GP regression to this sample set. Our computational results demonstrate that the proposed method provides not only computational efficiency and rapid map entropy reduction, but also robustness in comparison with competing approaches.",

Knowledge about a specific internal model can be acquired by means of model learning techniques based on supervised machine learning tools, such as neural networks. One of the main challenges is to specify the starting point for the learning process. We propose a methodology for initial weight estimation based on the robot morphology. We use the generation of saccades in a robotic head as a case study to evaluate the performance of this approach. Our results suggest that this methodology, based on learning the relationship between the morphological parameters of the robot and those in its internal model, improves the quality of weight initialization, resulting in a considerable speed-up in the process of learning the internal model.",

While real world experience is the only way to assess the efficiency and robustness of a robotics system, simulations help to pave the way to actual experiments. But an overall robotics system requires simulations at a level of realism which no holistic simulator can provide, given the wide spectrum of disciplines and physical processes involved. This paper presents a way to integrate various simulators, in a distributed, scalable and repeatable way, to benefit from their different advantages and get the best fitted and accurate simulation for a given robotics system. It depicts how the MORSE open-source robotics simulator is adapted to comply with the High Level Architecture standard, thus allowing the reuse of numerous dedicated realistic simulators. Two examples of the integration of simulators are provided.",

        "abstract": "Eye tracking technology has shown promising results for allowing hands-free control of robotically-mounted cameras and tools. However existing systems present only limited capabilities in allowing the full range of camera motions in a safe, intuitive manner. This paper introduces a framework for the recognition of surgeon intention, allowing activation and control of the camera through natural gaze behaviour. The system is resistant to noise such as blinking, while allowing the surgeon to look away safely at any time. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel approach to control the translation of the camera along its optical axis using a combination of eye tracking and stereo reconstruction. Combining eye tracking and stereo reconstruction allows the system to determine which point in 3D space the user is fixating, enabling a translation of the camera to achieve the optimal viewing distance. In addition, the eye tracking information is used to perform automatic laser targeting for laser ablation. The desired target point of the laser, mounted on a separate robotic arm, is determined with the eye tracking thus removing the need to manually adjust the laser's target point before starting each new ablation. The calibration methodology used to obtain millimetre precision for the laser targeting without the aid of visual servoing is described. Finally, a user study validating the system is presented, showing clear improvement with median task times under half of those of a manually controlled robotic system.",

The knowledge of spatial positions of modules, or at least of the overall shape which the modules form, is the usual prerequisite for reconfiguration planning. We present a general, decentralized algorithm for determining the positions of modules placed on a cubic grid from local sensor information. The connection topology of the robot is arbitrary. We assume that a module can sense the presence of its immediate neighbors on the grid and determine their positions in its own local coordinate system, but cannot sense the orientations of the coordinate systems of its neighbors. Since orientation cannot be directly communicated between modules, the modules can only exchange information about the relative positions of their neighbors. The algorithm aggregates this information over the entire network of modules and narrows down the set of valid positions for each module as far as possible. If there exists a unique locally-consistent assignment of coordinates to all modules then it is found.",

        "abstract": "Service robots are being developed as a supportive aid for elderly people. Those robots are operated by non-expert users in heterogeneous domestic environments. Hence, the ability of a robot to be operated in a more natural human friendly manner enhances the overall satisfaction of the user. Humans prefer to use voice in order to convey instructions. Those voice instructions often include uncertain terms such as \u201clittle\u201d and \u201cfar\u201d. Therefore, the robotic assistants should possess the competency to appropriately interpret the quantitative meanings of such terms. The quantitative meaning of uncertain terms related to the spatial information depends on the spatial arrangement of the environment. This paper proposes a method in order to evaluate the uncertain information in user commands by replicating the natural tendencies of humans about the spatial arrangement of the environment. A module called Occupied Density analyzer has been deployed to analyze the occupied density distribution. A function has been defined to estimate the perceptive distance based on the occupied density distribution. The perception of the uncertain terms is adjusted according to the perceptive distance of that particular scenario. Particulars on rationale behind the proposed method are explained with due attention to the natural human tendencies. Experiments have been carried out in order to evaluate the performance and the behaviors of the proposed system.",

This motivates the need to build systems that have situational awareness to assess how quali ed they are at that moment to make a decision. We call this self-evaluating capability as introspection. In this paper, we take a small step in this direction and propose a generic framework for introspective behavior in perception systems. Our goal is to learn a model to reliably predict failures in a given system, with respect to a task, directly from input sensor data. We present this in the context of vision-based autonomous MAV flight in outdoor natural environments, and show that it effectively handles uncertain situations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel robot programming paradigm. It focuses on reducing the required expertise in robotics to a level that allows shop floor workers to use robots in their application domain without the need of extensive training. Our approach is user-centric and can interpret underspecified robot tasks, enabling communication on an abstract level. Such high-level task descriptions make the system amenable for users that are experts in a particular domain, but have limited knowledge about robotics and are thus not able to specify low-level details and instructions. Semantic models for all involved entities, i.e., processes, workpieces, and workcells, enable automatic reasoning about underspecified tasks and missing pieces of information. We showcase and evaluate this methodology on two industrial use cases from the domains of assembly and woodworking, comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions provided by robot manufacturers.",

Most of them report a lack of functionality, mostly explained by a counter-intuitive control strategy. This paper presents the first implementation of an automatic prosthesis control approach based on natural coordinations between upper limb joints and IMU-based humeral orientation measurement. Two healthy individuals were able to use the prosthetic forearm attached to their upper arm to point at targets in a 3D workspace with a reasonable error. The results demonstrate the potential applications of automatizing the motion of some joints along the upper limb, in the same way as human upper limbs are controlled.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method for automatic robotic needle steering in deformable tissues. The main contribution relies on the use of an inverse Finite Element (FE) simulation to control an articulated robot interacting with deformable structures. In this work we consider a flexible needle, embedded in the end effector of a 6 arm Mitsubishi RV1A robot, and its insertion into a silicone phantom. Given a trajectory on the rest configuration of the silicone phantom, our method provides in real-time the displacements of the articulated robot which guarantee the permanence of the needle within the predefined path, taking into account any undergoing deformation on both the needle and the trajectory itself. A forward simulation combines i) a kinematic model of the robot, ii) FE models of the needle and phantom gel iii) an interaction model allowing the simulation of friction and puncture force. A Newton-type method is then used to provide the displacement of the robot to minimize the distance between the needle's tip and the desired trajectory. We validate our approach with a simulation in which a virtual robot can successfully perform the insertion while both the needle and the trajectory undergo significant deformations.",

While most existing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods suffer from the lack of information near low reward regions, the proposed method alleviates this issue by incorporating (negative) demonstrations of what not to do. To mathematically formulate negative demonstrations, we introduce a novel generative model which can generate both positive and negative demonstrations using a parameter, called proficiency. Moreover, since we represent a reward function using a leveraged Gaussian process which can model a nonlinear function, the proposed method can effectively estimate the structure of a nonlinear reward function.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a learned, place-dependent terrain-assessment classifier that improves over time. Whereas typical methods aim to assess all of the terrain in a given environment, we exploit the fact that many robotic navigation tasks are well-suited to visual-teach-and-repeat navigation where robot motion is restricted to previously driven paths. In such scenarios, we argue that general terrain assessment is not required, and we can instead solve the much easier problem of detecting changes along the path; we sacrifice the ability to generalize off the path in favour of improved performance on the path. Terrain along a pretaught path is compared to terrain seen at the same location during previous, human-supervised traverses, and any significant differences cause that location to be labelled as unsafe. By storing all of our previous experiences, we are able to continuously improve our estimates as we revisit the same locations multiple times. We tested our method on two datasets collected at the University of Toronto and show that we improve over existing place-independent (both learned and not) methods, enabling nearly full autonomy in challenging, varied terrain using only a stereo camera.",

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Iterative Closest Labeled Point (iCLAP) to recognize objects using both tactile and kinesthetic information. The iCLAP first assigns different local tactile features with distinct label numbers. The label numbers of the tactile features together with their associated 3D positions form a 4D point cloud of the object. In this manner, the two sensing modalities are merged to form a synthesized perception of the touched object. To recognize an object, the partial 4D point cloud obtained from a number of touches iteratively matches with all the reference cloud models to identify the best fit. An extensive evaluation study with 20 real objects shows that our proposed iCLAP approach outperforms those using either of the separate sensing modalities, with a substantial recognition rate improvement of up to 18%.",

To reduce this dependency, we introduce a novel architecture called Iterative Hough Forest with Histogram of Control Points that is capable of estimating occluded and cluttered objects' 6D pose given a candidate 2D bounding box. Our Iterative Hough Forest is learnt using patches extracted only from the positive samples. These patches are represented with Histogram of Control Points (HoCP), a \u201cscale-variant\u201d implicit volumetric description, which we derive from recently introduced Implicit B-Splines (IBS). The rich discriminative information provided by this scale-variance is leveraged during inference, where the initial pose estimation of the object is iteratively refined based on more discriminative control points by using our Iterative Hough Forest. We conduct experiments on several test objects of a publicly available dataset to test our architecture and to compare with the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel iterative learning scheme, which generates time-series data comprising the impedance value for human-robot cooperative work, where the human operator moves the end-effector from an initial position to a goal position. The proposed learning scheme iteratively updates time-series data comprising the variable impedance value to minimize a task-oriented cost function. Two types of noise reduction technique are used in the proposed learning scheme, which reduce the noise in the time direction and in the trial direction. The validity of the proposed method was verified based on experiments.",

        "abstract": "We propose an online iterative path optimisation method to enable a Baxter humanoid robot to assist human users to dress. The robot searches for the optimal personalised dressing path using vision and force sensor information: vision information is used to recognise the human pose and model the movement space of upper-body joints; force sensor information is used for the robot to detect external force resistance and to locally adjust its motion. We propose a new stochastic path optimisation method based on adaptive moment estimation. We first compare the proposed method with other path optimisation algorithms on synthetic data. Experimental results show that the performance of the method achieves the smallest error with fewer iterations and less computation time. We also evaluate real-world data by enabling the Baxter robot to assist real human users with their dressing.",

Unfortunately, PCB design for embedded and robotic systems is still a tedious and time consuming activity. In this paper, we present a technique, Just In Time Printed Circuit Board (JITPCB) for designing PCB systems at speeds commensurate with the capability of desktop PCB milling machines. We propose designing boards by writing software circuit generators that wire together and lay out circuit components in a hierarchical and reusable fashion. We have developed a declarative design mechanism allowing users to specify desired input and output peripherals and well as application code. Given this input, our system produces a complete working circuit board design, along with necessary initialization and networking code. Our system is an open framework that allows users to create a set of highly reusable parametric hardware/software modules. We demonstrate our approach by showing some common robotics applications designed with JITPCB to show its utility and generality.",

In the control design, the fluid parameters are not considered to develop a simple low-level controller used for multi degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulators. Instead, mechanical impedance, which represents the effect of joint velocity on joint torque, is reduced using a disturbance observer. The torque tracking performance of the modified system is then improved by a simple proportional-integral-derivative control. When evaluated on two 1-DOF EHAs, the proposed controller guaranteed robustness to external disturbances and variations in the fluid parameters, even though the fluid parameters are not considered.",

The strategy uses kernel density estimation to identify regions with high probability of containing configurations being part of feasible solutions, and use the estimation to bias sampling. The kernel densities are initialized with a uniform distribution and are continuously updated, whenever paths are successfully planned and optimized. The system is thereby self-learning and improves performance over time. The sampler is tested on a variety of planners and against other sampling methods in two different scenarios containing robotic arms with 6 degrees of freedom and compared to a state-of-the-art optimization based planning algorithm. Tests show that the sampler learns fast and improves both time taken for solving problems and the quality of the resulting paths compared to other samplers.",

Most of existing indoor localisation algorithms rely on camera, laser scanner, floor plan or other pre-installed infrastructure to achieve sub-meter or sub-centimetre localisation accuracy. However, in some circumstances these required devices or information may be unavailable or too expensive in terms of cost or deployment. This paper presents a novel keyframe based Pose Graph Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) method, which correlates ambient geomagnetic field with motion pattern and employs low-cost sensors commonly equipped in mobile devices, to provide positioning in both unknown and known environments. Extensive experiments are conducted in large-scale indoor environments to verify that the proposed method can achieve high localisation accuracy similar to state-of-the-arts, such as vision based Google Project Tango.",

To manage appearance changes of target objects, the proposed method incrementally updates an object database using detection results. One of the major problems in updating the appearance model is that the object model can gradually be degraded by accumulated errors and biased to specific views. To solve this problem, our object model is updated according to the selected keyframes, which not only help memorize important views of target objects, but also prevent the holistic appearance model from overfitting. The database is represented as a graph of the registered images, and the importance of the database images is measured by analyzing the constructed graph. Then, the redundant or less important images are discarded from the database. As a result, the database is efficiently maintained while new views of the objects are gradually added. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm efficiently maintains the object database and improves the detection performance compared to previous incremental object learning and detection algorithms.",

The main purpose of the Kilogrid is to complement the Kilobots by overcoming some of their limitations (i.e., limited sensors and actuators), making it easier to experiment and to collect data with large groups of robots. The Kilogrid allows researchers to study scenarios featuring a level of complexity that cannot be reached using the Kilobots alone. The Kilogrid is composed of several modules, where each module contains four cells of 50\u00d750 mm2. The cells allow for bi-directional communication with the Kilobots. Our first version of a Kilogrid is composed of 64 cells and covers a total area of 400\u00d7400 mm2. We demonstrate the features of the Kilogrid with two case studies in which: (i) we extend the sensory system of the Kilobots, (ii) we allow the Kilobots to modify the environment, and (iii) we collect data (e.g., position, state) from the Kilobots while the experiment is running.",

Based on real-time Finite Element Method (FEM), we obtain a globally defined discrete-time kinematic model in the workspace of soft robots. From the kinematic equations, we deduce the soft-robot Jacobian matrix and discuss the conditions to avoid singular configurations. Then, we propose a novel observer based control methodology where the observer is built by Finite Element Model in this paper to deal with the control problem of soft robots. A closed-loop controller for position control of soft robot is designed based on the discrete-time model with feedback signal being extracted by means of visual servoing. Finally, experimental results on a parallel soft robot show the efficiency and performance of our proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new type of an active-caster with a single ball transmission (ACROBAT-S) is proposed. The proposed ball transmission is a novel mechanism which realizes combining of two motor powers together to rotate the single ball in a 2Dway and simultaneously distributing the combined power to a wheel shaft and a steering shaft of an active-caster in an appropriate ratio. The transmission design enables to remove a sensor for detecting the wheel orientation for coordinated control. Also, it would be possible to build an omnidirectional robot with three active casters to be controlled its 3D motion by three motors with no redundancy. The new concept of ACROBAT-S gives many advantages compared with the original ACROBAT since the number of balls is reduced from two to one, therefore the number of friction drive between a ball and rollers or a ball to a ball is also reduced from five to three. These features contribute not only to simplify the mechanism design, but also to enhance its performance since slippages and energy losses would be reduced. To verify the design concept, we derive and analyze a kinematic model of a single ball transmission mechanism. Furthermore the motions of ACROBAT-S are verified by Solid Works 3D simulator. From the results, it is confirmed that the proposed single ball transmission is applicable for an omnidirectional wheel mechanism to realize omnidirectional motions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a kinetostatic model for a needle-sized notched tube continuum joint design, and examine the impact that the design parameters have on both stiffness and joint kinematics. The joint is fabricated by removing a series of asymmetric notches from a metal tube. By fixing a cable to the distal end of the tube, and routing this tendon through the tube's lumen, the joint can be actuated in bending. This simple cutting pattern allows for impressive performance compared to other mechanisms of similar size. However, selecting the cutting geometry using kinematics alone results in many redundant solutions. Since the notches significantly affect the overall structure's stiffness, and limit the maximum forces that it can transmit, a stiffness model can be used to constrain the design-space. Further, because the notch geometry represents a non-prismatic beam configuration, modelling the force-deflection behavior is nontrivial. We have approached this problem using a variation of Castigliano's 2nd Theorem, experimentally validated its performance with several test specimens, and analyzed the behavior of the model over a design space specific to neurosurgical applications. The outcomes of this study aim to aid in the design of joints given task-specific constraints, particularly within the field of surgical robotics.",

        "abstract": "3D scene reconstruction involves the volumetric modeling of space, and it is a fundamental step in a wide variety of robotic applications, including grasping, obstacle avoidance, path planning, mapping and many others. Nowadays, sensors are able to quickly collect vast amounts of data, and the challenge has become one of storing and processing all this information in a timely manner, especially if real-time performance is required. Recently, a novel technique for the stochastic learning of discriminative models through continuous occupancy maps was proposed: Hilbert Maps [18], that is able to represent the input space at an arbitrary resolution while capturing statistical relationships between measurements. The original framework was proposed for 2D environments, and here we extend it to higher-dimensional spaces, addressing some of the challenges brought by the curse of dimensionality. Namely, we propose a method for the automatic selection of feature coordinate locations, and introduce the concept of localized automatic relevance determination (LARD) to the Hilbert Maps framework, in which different dimensions in the projected Hilbert space operate within independent length-scale values. The proposed technique was tested against other state-of-the-art 3D scene reconstruction tools in three different datasets: a simulated indoors environment, RIEGL laser scans and dense LSD-SLAM pointclouds. The results testify to the proposed framework's ability to model complex structures and correctly interpolate over unobserved areas of the input space while achieving real-time training and querying performances.",

        "abstract": "Human-powered lower exoskeletons have gained considerable interests from both academia and industry over the past few decades, and thus have seen increasing applications in areas of human locomotion assistance and strength augmentation. One of the most important aspects in those applications is to achieve robust control of lower exoskeletons, which, in the first place, requires the proactive modeling of human movement trajectories through physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). As a powerful representation tool for motion trajectories, Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) has been used extensively to model human movement trajectories. However, canonical DMPs only offers a general offline representation of human movement trajectory and neglects the real-time interaction term, therefore it cannot be directly applied to lower exoskeletons which need to model human motion trajectories online since different pilots have different trajectories and even one pilot might change his/her intended trajectory during walking. This paper presents a novel Coupled Cooperative Primitives (CCPs) scheme, which models the motion trajectories online. Besides maintaining canonical motion primitives, we also model the interaction term between the pilot and exoskeletons through impedance models and apply a reinforcement learning method based on Policy Improvement and Path Integrals (PI2) to learn the parameters online. Experimental results on both a single Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) platform and a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system demonstrate the advantages of our proposed CCP scheme.",

        "abstract": "Automating assembly processes outside controlled factory environments is still rare, mostly because of the inherent position uncertainties. The use of compliant motions allows robustness against the uncertainty, but automatic planning of compliant motion sequences is not computationally feasible. In this paper, we show how compliant assembly motions can be learned from human demonstrations. A human teacher will kinesthetically demonstrate compliant motions where the physical shapes of assembled parts guide the motion. From these demonstrations, the proposed method identifies desired direction of movement, the number of compliant axes and their directions. We use this information to construct an impedance controller which can reproduce the assembly motion despite uncertainty in the starting position. The method is studied with a KUKA LWR4+ arm in two test setups with different number of physically constrained degrees of freedom. The experimental study shows that the method is able to correctly identify the motion parameters and allows the robot to successfully perform the demonstrated assembly motion from various unseen starting positions.",

However, sophisticated multi-fingered hands are often expensive and fragile. Low-cost soft hands offer an appealing alternative to more conventional devices, but present considerable challenges in sensing and actuation, making them difficult to apply to more complex manipulation tasks. In this paper, we describe an approach to learning from demonstration that can be used to train soft robotic hands to perform dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method uses object-centric demonstrations, where a human demonstrates the desired motion of manipulated objects with their own hands, and the robot autonomously learns to imitate these demonstrations using reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm that allows us to blend and select a subset of the most feasible demonstrations, which we use with an extension of the guided policy search framework that learns generalizable neural network policies. We demonstrate our approach on the RBO Hand 2, with learned motor skills for turning a valve, manipulating an abacus, and grasping.",

        "abstract": "Learning to perform tasks like pulling a door handle or pushing a button, inherently easy for a human, can be surprisingly difficult for a robot. A crucial problem in these kinds of in-contact tasks is the context specificity of pose and force requirements. In this paper, a robot learns in-contact tasks from human kinesthetic demonstrations. To address the need to balance between the position and force constraints, we propose a model based on the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and Cartesian impedance control. The model captures uncertainty over time and space and allows the robot to smoothly satisfy a task's position and force constraints by online modulation of impedance controller stiffness according to the HSMM state belief. In experiments, a KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arm equipped with a force/torque sensor at the wrist successfully learns from human demonstrations how to pull a door handle and push a button.",

However, for manipulation actions mostly kinesthetic teaching is used as these actions require precise knowledge about the interactions between the robot and the object. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows a robot to learn actions carried out by a teacher from observations. We achieve this by first transforming RGBD observations to consistent hand-object trajectories, which are then adapted to the robot's grasping capabilities. Experimental results show that the robot is able to learn complex tasks such as opening doors or drawers.",

This paper proposes a framework for acquiring and applying action knowledge from naive user demonstrations in an interactive simulation environment under varying conditions. The framework combines a flexible constraint-based motion control approach with games-with-a-purpose-based learning using Random Forest Regression. The acquired action models are able to produce context-sensitive constraint-based motion descriptions to perform the learned action. A pouring experiment is conducted to test the feasibility of the suggested approach and shows the learned system can perform comparable to its human demonstrators.",

In particular, we propose a CNN architecture that performs comparably or better than existing methods based on engineered features.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology based on a combination of analytical, numerical and machine learning methods for performing dexterous, in-hand manipulation with simple, adaptive robot hands. A constrained optimization scheme utilizes analytical models that describe the kinematics of adaptive hands and classic conventions for modelling quasistatically the manipulation problem, providing intuition about the problem mechanics. A machine learning (ML) scheme is used in order to split the problem space, deriving task-specific models that account for difficult to model, dynamic phenomena (e.g., slipping). In this respect, the ML scheme: 1) employs the simulation module in order to explore the feasible manipulation paths for a specific hand-object system, 2) feeds the feasible paths to an experimental setup that collects manipulation data in an automated fashion, 3) uses clustering techniques in order to group together similar manipulation trajectories, 4) trains a set of task-specific manipulation models and 5) uses classification techniques in order to trigger a task-specific model based on the user provided task specifications. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is experimentally validated using various adaptive robot hands in 2D and 3D in-hand manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "We propose in this work a new model of how the hidden human knowledge (HHK) of UAV pilots can be incorporated in the UAVs path planning generation. We intuitively know that human's pilots barely manage or even attempt to drive the UAV through a path that is optimal attending to some criteria as an optimal planner would suggest. Although human pilots might get close but not reach the optimal path proposed by some planner that optimizes over time or distance, the final effect of this differentiation could be not only surprisingly better, but also desirable. In the best scenario for optimality, the path that human pilots generate would deviate from the optimal path as much as the hidden knowledge that its perceives is injected into the path. The aim of our work is to use real human pilot paths to learn the hidden knowledge using repulsion fields and to incorporate this knowledge afterwards in the environment obstacles as cause of the deviation from optimality. We present a strategy of learning this knowledge based on attractor and repulsors, the learning method and a modified RRT* that can use this knowledge for path planning. Finally we do real-life tests and we compare the resulting paths with and without this knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Robots are still not able to grasp all unforeseen objects. Finding a proper grasp configuration, i.e. the position and orientation of the arm relative to the object, is still challenging. One approach for grasping unforeseen objects is to recognize an appropriate grasp configuration from previous grasp demonstrations. The underlying assumption in this approach is that new objects that are similar to known ones (i.e. they are familiar) can be grasped in a similar way. However finding a grasp representation and a grasp similarity metric is still the main challenge in developing an approach for grasping familiar objects. In this paper, interactive object view learning and recognition capabilities are integrated in the process of learning and recognizing grasps. The object view recognition module uses an interactive incremental learning approach to recognize object view labels. The grasp pose learning approach uses local and global visual features of a demonstrated grasp to learn a grasp template associated with the recognized object view. A grasp distance measure based on Mahalanobis distance is used in a grasp template matching approach to recognize an appropriate grasp pose. The experimental results demonstrate the high reliability of the developed template matching approach in recognizing the grasp poses. Experimental results also show how the robot can incrementally improve its performance in grasping familiar objects.",

        "abstract": "One of the central tasks for a household robot is searching for specific objects. It does not only require localizing the target object but also identifying promising search locations in the scene if the target is not immediately visible. As computation time and hardware resources are usually limited in robotics, it is desirable to avoid expensive visual processing steps that are exhaustively applied over the entire image. The human visual system can quickly select those image locations that have to be processed in detail for a given task. This allows us to cope with huge amounts of information and to efficiently deploy the limited capacities of our visual system. In this paper, we therefore propose to use human fixation data to train a top-down saliency model that predicts relevant image locations when searching for specific objects. We show that the learned model can successfully prune bounding box proposals without rejecting the ground truth object locations. In this aspect, the proposed model outperforms a model that is trained only on the ground truth segmentations of the target object instead of fixation data.",

        "abstract": "No two robots are exactly the same\u2014even for a given model of robot, different units will require slightly different controllers. Furthermore, because robots change and degrade over time, a controller will need to change over time to remain optimal. This paper leverages lifelong learning in order to learn controllers for different robots. In particular, we show that by learning a set of control policies over robots with different (unknown) motion models, we can quickly adapt to changes in the robot, or learn a controller for a new robot with a unique set of disturbances. Furthermore, the approach is completely model-free, allowing us to apply this method to robots that have not, or cannot, be fully modeled.",

A simple transmission mechanism consisting in a pair of compression springs and a flange bearing is integrated in the shoulder pitch and elbow pitch joints between the servo shaft and the output frame. Joint deflection measurement with potentiometer allows joint torque but also contact force estimation and control. The low stiffness of the compliant finger has been exploited for soft collision detection and obstacle localization, in such a way that the contact forces do not significantly disturb the UAV. Fixed-base experiments have been performed with the arm, including the characterization of the compliant joints and the control of the contact force at wrist point.",

Often not all obstacles in an environment are known prior to the mission execution. Consequently, the ability for replanning during a flight is key for success. Our approach locally optimizes trajectories of grid-based path planning. It preserves obstacle-freeness of the path and ensures smoothness with continuous curvature transition segments. Fast optimization and frequent reoptimization is made possible by means of local multiresolution time discretization. With our extensions, high dimensional flight trajectories incorporating velocities and accelerations can be planned with a time discretization of 100 Hz within the prediction horizon of the underlying controller.",

Astrobee will replace the SPHERES robots which currently operate on the ISS, whose use of fixed ultrasonic beacons for localization limits them to work in a 2 meter cube. Astrobee localizes with monocular vision and an IMU, without any environmental modifications. Visual features detected on a pre-built map, optical flow information, and IMU readings are all integrated into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the robot pose. We introduce several modifications to the filter to make it more robust to noise, and extensively evaluate the localization algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Microneedle insertion is useful for elucidating the processes in living cells and their organelles. However, mechanical puncture by the needle causes traumatic damage to the cell. As a less invasive process, we have developed intracellular needle insertion using femtosecond laser cell ablation. To quickly and precisely position the spot ablated by the laser, we accurately located the needle tip in a 2D image plane. When the needle approaches the cell surface, the only accessible information is the microscope image; the vertical approach of the needle is unknown and must be detected. To this end, we propose an image process that integrates needle recognition, needle-tip localization, image focus measure, and vertical approach detection. The proposed image process was tested in 15 experimental sessions at various locations. The needle tip was reasonably and consistently positioned in the image, and the vertical approach was detected within the safe and plausible ranges.",

        "abstract": "We present a long-range visual signal detection system that is suitable for an unmanned aerial vehicle to find an optical signal released at a desired landing site for the purposes of cargo delivery or rescue situations where radio signals or other communication systems are not available or the wind conditions at the landing site need to be signaled. The challenge here is to have a signal and detection system that works from long range (> 1000m) amongst ground clutter during various seasonal conditions on passive imagery. We use a smoke-grenade as a ground signal, which has the advantageous properties of being easy to carry by ground crews because of its light weight and small size, but when released has a long visual signaling range. We employ a camera system on the UAV with a visual texture feature extraction approach in a machine learning framework to classify image patches as `signal' or `background'. We study conventional approaches and develop a visual feature descriptor that can better differentiate the appearance of the visual signal under varying conditions and, when used to train a random-forest classifier, outperforms commonly used feature descriptors. The system was rigorously and quantitatively evaluated on data collected from a camera mounted on a helicopter and flown towards a plume of signal smoke over a variety of seasons, ground conditions, weather conditions, and environments. Our system was capable of detecting the smoke cloud with both precision and recall rates greater than 0.95 from ranges between 1000m and 1500m. Further, we develop a method to estimate wind orientation and approximate wind strength by assessing the shape of the smoke signal. We present a preliminary evaluation of the wind estimation in conditions with different wind intensities and orientations relative to the approach direction.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant progress in GPS-denied autonomous flight, long-distance traversals (> 100 km) in the absence of GPS remain elusive. This paper demonstrates a method capable of accurately estimating the aircraft state over a 218 km flight with a final position error of 27 m, 0.012% of the distance traveled. Our technique efficiently captures the full state dynamics of the air vehicle with semi-intermittent global corrections using LIDAR measurements matched against an a priori Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Using an error-state Kalman filter with IMU bias estimation, we are able to maintain a high-certainty state estimate, reducing the computation time to search over a global elevation map. A sub region of the DEM is scanned with the latest LIDAR projection providing a correlation map of landscape symmetry. The optimal position is extracted from the correlation map to produce a position correction that is applied to the state estimate in the filter. This method provides a GPS-denied state estimate for long range drift-free navigation. We demonstrate this method on two flight data sets from a full-sized helicopter, showing significantly longer flight distances over the current state of the art.",

In such scenarios the observations obtained in the same region can drastically differ due to changes caused by semi-static objects, such as doors, furniture, etc. In this work, we extend a strategy that represents environment regions using words, based on spatial density information extracted from laser readings. This time, in order to deal with changes in the environment, our method not only builds words representing the real observations made by the robot, but also alternative multi-level words to account for possible changes in a place's observations generated by non-static objects. Place recognition is made by searching matches of sequences of N consecutive words (both real or alternatives). Experiments performed in real and simulated scenarios are shown, and demonstrate the advantages associated to the use of multi-level words.",

In such cases, joystick jerks arising from uncontrolled motions may lead to collisions with obstacles. We here propose a perceptive shared control system that progressively corrects the trajectory as a user manually drives the wheelchair, by means of a sensor-based shared control law capable of smoothly avoiding obstacles. This control law is based on a low complex optimization framework validated through simulations and extensive clinical trials. The provided model uses distance information. Therefore, for low-cost considerations, we use ultrasonic sensors to measure the distances around the wheelchair. The solution therefore provides an efficient assistive tool that does not alter the quality of experience perceived by the user, while ensuring his security in hazardous situations.",

        "abstract": "New vision sensors, such as the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision sensor (DAVIS), incorporate a conventional camera and an event-based sensor in the same pixel array. These sensors have great potential for robotics because they allow us to combine the benefits of conventional cameras with those of event-based sensors: low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, new algorithms are required to exploit the sensor characteristics and cope with its unconventional output, which consists of a stream of asynchronous brightness changes (called \u201cevents\u201d) and synchronous grayscale frames. In this paper, we present a low-latency visual odometry algorithm for the DAVIS sensor using event-based feature tracks. Features are first detected in the grayscale frames and then tracked asynchronously using the stream of events. The features are then fed to an event-based visual odometry algorithm that tightly interleaves robust pose optimization and probabilistic mapping. We show that our method successfully tracks the 6-DOF motion of the sensor in natural scenes. This is the first work on event-based visual odometry with the DAVIS sensor using feature tracks.",

In this context, low obstacles are particularly challenging, as they are often discarded by traditional algorithms. Curb detection methods that can potentially be suitable for the problem usually target roads with clearly defined curbs and sidewalks. We propose a real-time algorithm for the detection of low obstacles (including, but not restricted to curbs), merging 2-D and 3-D information from stereo imaging. A set of candidate object lines is extracted based on their combined 2-D and 3-D features, tracked over time and clustered according to a novel similarity metric. Finally, a 3rd order polynomial spline is fitted to each cluster to represent the obstacle. The proposed system can deal with noisy and incomplete point clouds and keeps the model assumptions to a minimum. To evaluate the algorithm, a new stereo dataset is provided and made available online. We present experiments in different scenarios and lighting conditions, illustrating the applicability of the method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present MO-SLAM, a novel visual SLAM system that is capable of detecting duplicate objects in the scene during run-time without requiring an offline training stage to pre-populate a database of objects. Instead, we propose a novel method to detect landmarks that belong to duplicate objects. Further, we show how landmarks belonging to duplicate objects can be converted to first-order entities which generate additional constraints for optimizing the map. We evaluate the performance of MO-SLAM with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data, where the experimental results verify the capabilities of MO-SLAM in detecting duplicate objects and using these constraints to improve the accuracy of the map.",

It proposes a new methodology for robot ranking, which is based on estimation of the end-effector resistance to cutting forces for several machining tasks, which are optimally located within the robot workspace. To cover wide range of applications, a set of isotropic, quasi-isotropic and extended benchmark tasks are considered. It is shown that regardless of the benchmark problem, seral manipulators are preferable for small and medium tasks while quasi-serial ones' better suit large-dimensional tasks. The proposed technique was applied for the comparison analysis of 10 industrial robots of both serial and quasi-serial architectures with similar working radius and payload of about 200 kg.",

        "abstract": "Mobile microrobots are typically fabricated in a multi-step microfabrication process and then transported into an enclosed workspace for operation. This paper presents a new, 3D printing inspired method for in-situ fabrication of mobile magnetic microrobots with complex topology from a polymer filament on demand directly inside an enclosed operational environment. Through the use of a tip magnet on the filament, the target shape is formed by magnetic guidance from external electromagnetic coils which wirelessly project fields into the workspace as the filament is fed through a hot needle which is inserted into the workspace. A bending model and a shape planner are developed for predicting and controlling the fabrication process. Magnetically-active millimeter-scale robotic devices of different shapes and sizes are fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA) filament with diameter as small as 50 \u00b5m. As a demonstration of the in-situ formation of a functional microrobotic device, a force-sensing microrobot with integrated sensing spring is fabricated inside an enclosed space, and then is used to measure the manipulation force during a pushing experiment by optical deformation measurement. We thus show the utility of the fabrication method for creating complex microrobot shapes remotely in enclosed environments for advanced microrobotic applications, with the potential for scaled down applications in healthcare and microfluidics.",

This trust-seeking robot framework builds upon an online trust inference engine and also incorporates an interactive behavior adaptation technique. We present end-to-end instantiations of trust-seeking robots for distinct task domains of aerial terrain coverage and interactive autonomous driving.

        "abstract": "Surgeons and robots typically use different approaches for bone milling. Surgeons adjust their speed and tool incidence angle constantly, which enables them to efficiently mill porous bone. Surgeons also adjust milling parameters such as speed and depth of cut throughout the procedure based on proximity to sensitive structures like nerves and blood vessels. In this paper we use image-based bone density estimates and segmentations of vital anatomy to make a robot mill more like a surgeon and less like an industrial computer numeric controlled (CNC) milling machine. We produce patient-specific plans optimizing velocity and incidence angles for spherical cutting burrs. These plans are particularly useful in bones of variable density and porosity like the human temporal bone. They result in fast milling in non-critical areas, reducing overall procedure time, and lower forces near vital anatomy. We experimentally demonstrate the algorithm on temporal bone phantoms and show that it reduces mean forces near vital anatomy by 63% and peak forces by 50% in comparison to a CNC-type path, without adding time to the procedure.",

        "abstract": "Environment models are the primary matter to autonomous decisions for mobile robots, and also to cooperation within teams of robots that operate in the same environment. The decisions to take within a robot or a robot team relate to motions, perceptions and communications: various types of environment models are therefore required to evaluate and plan these actions. While the literature abounds with approaches to environment modeling using data perceived by the robots, very few work tackle the problem of managing such models within a team of robots. Managing environment models implies first defining the proper data structures and associated mechanisms that allow both their efficient update and use by the decisional processes that require them, and second ensuring the models consistency as the robots evolve. This article presents the definition of a framework dedicated to the managing of environment models within a robot team. It establishes the principles that govern the framework design, and illustrates them throughout some examples.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current traffic rule handling in autonomous driving relies on non-scalable methods such as explicitly hard-coding sets of logical statements to evaluate rules. This is sufficient for early prototypes but is not scalable for larger systems designed to work in arbitrary locations. Such methods can also become problematic when traversing different geographical entities with changing traffic rules. Additionally, they do not adequately convey the uncertainty of the traffic rule evaluation stemming from uncertainty in sensor measurements. We propose an exchangeable traffic rules module which takes a knowledge base of sentences in first-order logic as input. These sentences consist of a limited number of high-level queries which are independent of local jurisdiction (e.g. can I turn right?). The knowledge base is then compiled into a potentially large logic graph. However, only a relatively small subset of the knowledge base is relevant for specific road geometries (e.g. some of the rules applicable to an intersection is not relevant for a T-junction). Since detailed road maps are available for autonomous driving, this information can be used to resolve these subsets in the knowledge base which only require map knowledge. Therefore, map information can be used to convert a single, large logic graph into a set of smaller, map-optimized logic graphs pruned for specific road geometries. The optimized graphs are then converted into Bayesian networks to facilitate probabilistic inference. Experiments were conducted using a traffic and scenario simulation framework. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance when using map-optimized logic graphs over a traditional first-order logic knowledge base.",

Therefore, the output orthoimage retains global coordinates without ground control points. The final image is fused and visualized instantaneously with a proposed adaptive weighted multiband algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we create a publicly available aerial image dataset with sequences of different environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our system is able to achieve high efficiency and quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We argue that to fully leverage the compliance available in soft pneumatic actuators, they should be controlled using air mass rather than position or force, as is customary in most research in soft robotics. We propose an air-mass controller that can servo to a preset position and also allows for the exploitation of fast, mechanical compliance without additional control burden. The proposed mass control scheme is based on discrete commodity valves and pressure sensors, filling a gap in available mass control systems for small-scale soft continuum actuators. The proposed mass controller exhibits low drift for mass trajectories lasting tens of seconds, without requiring a precise model of the actuator. Continuous mass control enables applications for soft robotics, in which leveraging compliance during actuation is of central importance.",

Among these guarantees, proving the fulfillment of real-time constraints on the software is a key issue, as their violation could result into unexpected and unsafe behaviors. In this paper, we present a methodology to guarantee real-time constraints on component-based software architectures of robots. This methodology relies on the MAUVE language to model the component architecture, and on a set of analysis tools that first estimate the worst case execution time of elementary functions from actual component traces, and then check the real-time constraints of each component. We illustrate this process on the architecture developed for the autonomous navigation of a partially known area by a mobile robot.",

We describe various measures that have been used in the past, discuss their limitations and demonstrate that each is deficient in one or more ways. We propose a new measure of performance for depth estimation that overcomes these deficiencies, and has a number of desirable properties. We show that in various cases of interest the new measure enables visualisation of the performance of a method that is otherwise obfuscated by existing metrics. Our proposed method is capable of illuminating the relative performance of different algorithms on different kinds of data, such as the difference in efficacy of a method when estimating the depth of the ground plane versus estimating the depth of other generic scene structure. We showcase the method by comparing a number of existing single-view methods against each other and against more traditional depth estimation methods such as binocular stereo.",

A guitar pick is antagonistically loaded with two inflatable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) actuators, allowing for the independent control of both position or stiffness through the utilization of one and two PDMS solenoids, respectively. To generate smooth analog pressure signals, the bellows incorporate a controlled leak to atmospheric pressure, having synonymous properties to a low-pass filter circuit when fed a coarse pressure signal through PWM control. Experimental results illustrate a minimum to maximum stiffness range of 76 to 320 Nmm/rad, a maximum cyclical speeds of 2.04 Hz, and a stiffness change rate of 96 Nmm/rad/kPa. Additional to the VSA, alternative PDMS fabrication methods are presented to allow for complex, precise manufacturing of silicone bodies in a low-cost manner.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method of stabilizing hybrid models of torque-constrained, underactuated walking robots - without using nonlinear gait optimization - by leveraging properties of the mechanics of the robot. At its core, the controller stabilizes the transfer of angular momentum from one leg to the next through continuous-time control coupled with hybrid system models that capture impacts that occur at foot strike. In particular, conservation of angular momentum at impact allows for computation of the exact transfer of momentum as a function of the robot's step length and vertical center of mass velocity just prior to foot impact. This motivates the construction of continuous-time reference trajectories for the robot's step length and vertical center of mass with endpoints corresponding to a desired transfer of angular momentum. Stabilization to these trajectories results in stable walking, as indicated by numeric Poincar\u00e9 analysis. The controller is implemented in simulation of a five-link, underactuated 3D robot via Model Predictive Control which provides a means of achieving walking under non-trivial actuation limits.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the merging of appearance-based spatial knowledge among robots having compatible visual sensing. Each robot is assumed to retain its knowledge in its individual long-term spatial memory where i) the place knowledge and their spatial relations are retained in an organized manner in place and map memories respectively; and ii) a \u2018place\u2019 refers to a spatial region as designated by a collection of associated appearances. In the proposed approach, each robot communicates with another robot, receives its memory and then merges the received knowledge with its own. The novelty of the merging process is that it is done in two stages: merging of place knowledge followed by the merging of map knowledge. As each robot's place memory is processed as a whole or in portions, the merging process scales easily with respect to the amount and overlap of the appearance data. Furthermore, the merging can be done in decentralized manner. Our experimental results with a team of three robots demonstrate that the resulting merged knowledge enables the robots to reason about learned places.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discussed the simultaneous intervention problem that arises from human-robot teams. The problem concerns with the case that one human operator has to intervene with several robots at almost the same time and it cannot be handled properly by existing methods. A model predictive control(MPC) based mixed initiative controller was proposed to solve this problem by embedding an intention model into the optimization problem. This method is in essence suitable for general MPC based mixed initiative controllers. The embedded intention model may cause the robot to deviate from its desired trajectory, for which conditions were developed to guarantee that the task completeness is not be affected. A comparison experiment was conducted and results showed that the proposed controller is more efficient and helpful in shortening the intervention time and allowing more robots to be successfully intervened in a simultaneous intervention scenario.",

We study the problem of deploying mobile robots as remote sensors to estimate the parameters of such a model, in particular the intensity parameter \u03bb which measures the mean density of points in a Poisson point process. This problem requires covering an appropriately large section of the domain while avoiding the objects, which we treat as obstacles. We develop a control law that covers an expanding section of the domain and an online criterion for determining when to stop sampling, i.e., when the covered area is large enough to achieve a desired level of estimation accuracy, and illustrate the resulting system with numerical simulations.",

In this paper, we investigate validity of the discretized spatial model of a closed elastica. The discretized closed elastica model can be regarded as a series of rigid bodies connected with passive elastic joints physically, and represented by a set of nonlinear equations derived by discretizing differential equations with boundary conditions as well as Euler equations expressing local minimum elastic energy. The validity of the considered model was studied by comparing the measured shape and the calculated shape from the model. Experimental results using a laser position sensor for shape measurement show that good correspondence between measured and calculated shapes, which supports the validity of the considered model. The constrained force and torque at the tip of an elastica, which can be obtained simultaneously associated with shape calculation, are also verified from measurement by a 6-axes force/torque sensor.",

        "abstract": "We report on the development of a dynamic gait in a robot based on a sagittal-plane and reduced-order model that fits the natural dynamics of the robot. The proposed model, referred to as the two-rolling-legs model with waist actuation (TRLW), consists of two rolling and compliant legs and two rigid bodies connected by an active waist joint. The numerical fixed-point analyses of the model suggest that with adequate touchdown conditions and waist motion, dynamic and periodic bounding and pronking behaviors of the model are achievable. Several identified fixed points of the model, or passive dynamics of the model, serve as the control guidance to initiate bounding and pronking on a newly-developed quadruped robot. The experimental results show that though several un-modeled factors cause behavioral discrepancies between the TRLW model and the robot, the robot can still initiate its dynamic behaviors by directly mapping the leg trajectories of the model onto those of the robot and via a simple pre-set joint position control strategy, without any other state feedback. This work confirms that the dynamic behavior of the robot can be initiated by using the passive dynamics of the reduced-order model.",

        "abstract": "Micro-sized agents can benefit robotic minimally invasive surgery since they can be inserted into the human body and use natural pathways such as arteries and veins or the gastrointestinal tract, to reach their target for drug delivery or diagnosis. Recently, miniaturized agents with shape-changing and gripping capabilities have provided significant advantages in performing grasping, transportation, and manipulation tasks. In order to robustly perform such tasks, it is of utmost importance to properly estimate their overall configuration. This paper presents a novel solution to the problem of estimating and tracking the 3D position, orientation and configuration of the tips of miniaturized grippers from RGB marker-less visual observations obtained by a microscope. We consider this as an optimization problem, seeking for the gripper model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between hypothesized instances of the gripper model and actual observations of the miniaturized gripper. This optimization problem is solved using a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has been evaluated on several image sequences showing the grippers moving, rotating, opening/closing and grasping biological material.",

This paper shows the modeling process of a VSA including energy losses on the example of the DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ). The model includes the full actuator dynamics with losses in electromechanical transformation of the motors. Furthermore, it models bearing and gear friction with stiction, Coulomb friction, viscous friction, and load dependent effects. With the obtained model the energy losses of benchmark trajectories are investigated and compared with a comparable stiff joint actuator.",

        "abstract": "We present FAST-Hex, a novel UAV concept which is able to smoothly change its configuration from underactuated to fully actuated by using only one additional motor that tilts all propellers at the same time. FAST-Hex can adapt to the task at hand by finely tuning its configuration from the efficient (but underactuated) flight (typical of coplanar multi-rotor platforms) to the full-pose-tracking (but less efficient) flight, which is attainable by non-coplanar multi-rotors. We also introduce a novel full-pose geometric controller for generic multi-rotors (not only the FAST-Hex) that outperforms classical inverse dynamics approaches. The controller receives as input any reference pose in \u211d3\u00d7SO(3) (3D position + 3D orientation). Exact tracking is achieved if the reference pose is feasible with respect to the propeller spinning rate saturations. In case of unfeasibility a new feasible desired trajectory is generated online giving priority to the positional part. The new controller is tested with the FAST-Hex but can be used for many other multi-rotor platforms: underactuated, slightly fully-actuated and completely fully-actuated.",

        "abstract": "This paper details a method for identifying a set of piece-wise affine linear models that can be used for control design for flapping-winged flight. The paper focuses on diving maneuvers as the application for these models. The flight conditions during the dive are segmented into separate dynamically similar regions, and least-squares is used to estimate affine linear models for each modeling region. These models are used to compute the reachability sets that satisfy recovery conditions for safe diving. The point within the dive to begin recovery was determined by checking the current pose for inclusion in the backward reachable set. Using this control method, 2.2 meter dives were achieved at a success rate of 60 percent. The data-driven automatic modeling techniques and controller design processes can be extended to additional flight maneuvers, provided sufficient previous data have been collected for model generation of those maneuvers.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainties in base placements of mobile, autonomous industrial robots can cause incomplete coverage in tasks such as grit-blasting and spray painting. Sensing and localization errors can cause such uncertainties in robot base placements. This paper addresses the problem of collaborative complete coverage under uncertainties through appropriate base placements of multiple mobile and autonomous industrial robots while aiming to optimize the performance of the robot team. A mathematical model for complete coverage under uncertainties is proposed and then solved using a stochastic multi-objective optimization algorithm. The approach aims to concurrently find an optimal number and sequence of base placements for each robot such that the robot team's objectives are optimized whilst uncertainties are accounted for. Several case studies based on a real-world application using a real-world object and a complex simulated object are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for different conditions and scenarios, e.g. various levels of uncertainties, different numbers of robots, and robots with different capabilities.",

To predict the trajectory of human hand, a minimum hand jerk model, based on the minimization of integral of squared hand jerk over the movement duration is established. It is shown that within this model the optimal hand trajectory is composed of a fifth order polynomial and two trigonometric terms depending on the natural frequencies of the system and the movement time. A virtual reality-based experimental setup with a haptic simulator is designed, and the prediction by the minimum hand jerk model is verified against experimental data. The theoretical prediction matches the collected data with a reasonable accuracy. The initial experimental results confirm the applicability of the minimum hand jerk model for modeling of human-like reaching movements in dynamic environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present the design and characterization of a novel Passive Variable Stiffness Joint (pVSJ). pVSJ is the proof of concept of a passive revolute joint with controllable variable stiffness. The current design is intended to be a bench-test for future development towards applications in haptic teleoperation purposed exoskeletons. The main feature of the pVSJ is its capability of varying the stiffness with infinite range based on a simple mechanical system. Moreover, the joint can rotate freely at the zero stiffness case without any limitation. The stiffness varying mechanism consists of two torsional springs, mounted with an offset from the pVSJ rotation center and coupled with the joint shaft by an idle roller. The position of the roller between the pVSJ rotation center and the spring's center is controlled by a linear sliding actuator fitted on the chassis of the joint. The variation of the output stiffness is obtained by changing the distance from the roller-springs contact point to the joint rotation center (effective arm). If this effective arm is null, the stiffness of the joint will be zero. The stiffness increases to reach high stiffness values when the effective arm approaches its maximum value, bringing the roller close to the torsional springs' center. The experimental results matched with the physical-based modeling of the pVSJ in terms of stiffness variation curve, stiffness dependency upon the springs' elasticity, joint deflection and the spring's deflection.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies modelling and dynamic analysis of underactuated capsule systems exhibiting friction-induced hysteresis. The motion mechanism is novel in utilizing internal centripetal torques generated by a vibration micro-motor mounted on the platform. Up to now, most investigations in frictional interactions towards capsule systems were confined into static or quasi-dynamic circumstance, where it is difficult to facilitate online use and control. It is the first time the dynamic frictional characteristics (non-reversible drooping and hysteresis) are studied towards these systems. An analytical study is primarily conducted to reveal the non-reversible characteristic for the static friction, the pre-sliding regime as well as the pure sliding regime, and the frictional limit boundaries are identified. Subsequently, the studies are mainly focused on dynamic analysis, including friction-driven vibrational responses and qualitative changes induced by control parameter (mass ratio) in capsule dynamics. It is found that the models predict periodic responses for the parameters considered and the average capsule velocity can be controlled through proper tuning of the control parameter around identified control points. The results demonstrate good captions of experimentally observed frictional characteristics, quenching of friction-induced vibrations and satisfaction of energy requirements.",

In particular, we consider goal babbling architectures that were designed to explore and learn solutions to fields of sensorimotor problems, i.e. to acquire inverse models mapping a space of parameterized sensorimotor problems/effects to a corresponding space of parameterized motor primitives. However, so far these architectures have not been used in high-dimensional spaces of effects. Here, we show the limits of existing goal babbling architectures for efficient exploration in such spaces, and introduce a novel exploration architecture called Model Babbling (MB). MB exploits efficiently a modular representation of the space of parameterized problems/effects. We also study an active version of Model Babbling (the MACOB architecture). These architectures are compared in a simulated experimental setup with an arm that can discover and learn how to move objects using two tools with different properties, embedding structured high-dimensional continuous motor and sensory spaces.",

In contrast to common methods for visual localization that use maps acquired with cameras, we propose a novel approach, which tracks the pose of monocular camera with respect to a given 3D LiDAR map. We employ a visual odometry system based on local bundle adjustment to reconstruct a sparse set of 3D points from image features. These points are continuously matched against the map to track the camera pose in an online fashion. Our approach to visual localization has several advantages. Since it only relies on matching geometry, it is robust to changes in the photometric appearance of the environment. Utilizing panoramic LiDAR maps additionally provides viewpoint invariance. Yet low-cost and lightweight camera sensors are used for tracking. We present real-world experiments demonstrating that our method accurately estimates the 6-DoF camera pose over long trajectories and under varying conditions.",

        "abstract": "From the viewpoint of evolution, vertebrates first accomplished locomotion via motion of the spine. Legs evolved later, to enhance mobility, but the spine remains central. Contrary to this, most robots have rigid torsos and rely primarily on movement of the legs for mobility. The force distributing properties of tensegrity structures presents a potential means of developing compliant spines for legged robots, with the goal of driving motion from the robots core. We present an initial exploration of the morphological design of a tensegrity quadruped robot, the first to the authors' knowledge, which we call MountainGoat, and its impact on controllable locomotion. All parts of the robot, including legs and spine, are compliant. Locomotion is aided by the use of central pattern generators, feedback control via a neural network, and machine learning techniques involving the Monte Carlo method as well as genetic evolution for parameter optimization. Control is demonstrated with three variations of MountainGoat, focusing on actuation of the spine as central to the locomotion process.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a novel motion control approach for biomimetic underwater vehicles with pitching fins. Even though these vehicles are highly maneuverable, the actuation of their different degrees of freedom (DOFs) is strongly coupled. To address this problem, we propose to use smooth DOF prioritization depending on which maneuver the vehicle is about to do. DOF prioritization has allowed us to develop a modular, easily applicable and extendable motion control architecture for U-CAT vehicle, which is meant for archaeological shipwreck penetration. We demonstrate the benefits of this architecture by developing an remotely operated vehicle autopilot for depth and yaw using a nonlinear state feedback controller. We also show the extensibility of the approach by controlling 3 DOFs of a fully autonomous U-CAT. The real-time experimental results show high position tracking precision (depth RMS error: 1.9 cm; yaw RMS error: 2.5\u00b0) Comparative experiments justify the use of DOF prioritization.",

In order to overcome these challenges, we have developed an autonomous plant inspection system using a mobile tracked vehicle. In this paper, we propose an autonomous navigation method for tracked vehicles based on a contact force model that enables the robot to compensate for collisions with obstacles. The model considers the influence of the contact force on the linear and angular motion of the robot. Using the model, the controllable velocity range is derived during collisions. The experimental results show that the robot is safely controlled by complying with velocity constraints. In addition, our method can generate motions such as leaving wall, L-shaped curve and crosswise locomotion in straight passage while navigation alongside the walls. The method allows the robot to smoothly follow a target path, despite colliding with obstacles.",

So far, automatic generation methods have been proposed for lip and head motions of tele-presence robots, based on the speech signal of the tele-operator. In the present study, we aim for extending the speech-driven motion generation methods for laughing speech, since laughter often occurs in natural dialogue interactions and may cause miscommunication if there is mismatch between audio and visual modalities. Based on analysis results of human behaviors during laughing speech, we proposed a motion generation method given the speech signal and the laughing speech intervals. Subjective experiments were conducted using our android robot by generating five different motion types, considering several modalities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of controlling different parts of the face, head and upper body (eyelid narrowing, lip corner/cheek raising, eye blinking, head motion and upper body motion control).",

Vibrotactile illusions occur on the skin when two or more vibrotactile actuators in proximity are actuated in coordinated sequence, causing the user to feel combined sensations, instead of separate ones. By combining these illusions we can produce various sensation patterns that are discernible by the user, thus allowing to convey different information with each pattern. A method to provide information about direction through vibrotactile illusions is introduced on this paper. This method uses a grid of vibrotactile actuators around the arm actuated in coordination. The sensation felt on the skin is consistent with the desired direction of motion, so the desired motion can be intuitively understood. We show that the users can recognize the conveyed direction, and implemented a proof of concept of the proposed method to guide users' elbow flexion/extension motion.",

In this work we present a motion planning and control framework that can be used to automatically plan and execute complicated manoeuvres. The unstable dynamics of the reversing general 2-trailer configuration with off-axle hitching is first stabilised by an LQ-controller and then a pure pursuit path tracker is used on a higher level giving a cascaded controller that can track piecewise linear reference paths. This controller together with a kinematic model of the trailer configuration is then used for forward simulations within a Closed-Loop Rapidly Exploring Random Tree framework to generate motion plans that are not only kinematically feasible but also include the limitations of the controller's tracking performance when reversing. The approach is evaluated over a series of Monte Carlo simulations on three different scenarios and impressive success rates are achieved. Finally the approach is successfully tested on a small scale test platform where the motion plan is calculated and then sent to the platform for execution.",

Since common approaches to on-road trajectory planning turned out to be unsuitable for this task, we instead extended an A*-based planner originally designed for navigation in unstructured environments. Two novel node expansion methods were added to obtain smooth and accurate trajectories that consider the structure of the environment. The first one attempts to find a trajectory connecting the current node directly to the goal by solving a boundary value problem using numerical optimization. The second method leverages a simulated pure-pursuit controller to generate edges (i.e. short motion primitives) that guide the vehicle toward or along the global reference path. As a result, the planner is able to produce smooth paths while retaining the explorative power of A* that is needed to deal with challenging situations in urban driving (e.g., reversing in order to pass a vehicle that stopped unexpectedly). Its practical usefulness was demonstrated during extensive tests on an electric vehicle navigating a mock urban environment as well as on our own autonomous vehicle MuCAR-3.",

Our optimization approach can incorporate various other constraints such as collision avoidance with obstacles, kinematic and dynamics constraints of the manipulator, and fluid dynamics characteristics.

        "abstract": "This paper examines a mission planning problem for a solar-powered unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) which requires the vehicle to visit a series of objective points in minimal time subject to a strict net-energy change constraint. Though related to the Traveling Salesperson Problem, the mission planning problem discussed herein imposes further complexity through additional coupled mixed-variable sets and the strict energy constraint. A scalar field representing the solar radiation of the mission environment is first characterized from a visual-spectrum image. A cascaded particle swarm optimization algorithm, coupled with the integer linear programming technique, is used to generate a time-optimized motion plan and power schedules for the UGV, which guides it to visit the assigned objective points with optimized sequence and paths, and then return to its starting location and orientation while guaranteeing compliance with the net energy gain constraint.",

While generally successful, their performance suffers from increasing problem complexity. In many cases, the full problem complexity is not needed for the entire solution. We present a hierarchical aggregation framework that groups and models sets of obstacles based on the currently needed level of detail. The hierarchy enables sampling to be performed using the simplest and most conservative representation of the environment possible in that region. Our results show that this scheme improves planner performance irrespective of the underlying sampling method and input problem. In many cases, improvement is significant, with running times often less than 60% of the original planning time.",

        "abstract": "Many robotic applications require repeated, on-demand motion planning in mapped environments. In addition, the presence of other dynamic agents, such as people, often induces frequent, dynamic changes in the environment. Having a potential function that encodes pairwise cost-to-go can be useful for improving the computational speed of finding feasible paths, and for guiding local searches around dynamic obstacles. However, since storing pairwise potential can be impractical given the O(|V|2) memory requirement, existing work often needs to compute a potential function for each query to a new goal, which would require a substantial online computation. This work addresses the problem by using diffusion maps, a machine learning algorithm, to learn the map's geometry and develop a memory-efficient parametrization (O(|V|)) of pairwise potentials. Specially, each state in the map is transformed to a diffusion coordinate, in which pairwise Euclidean distance is shown to be a meaningful similarity metric. We develop diffusion-based motion planning algorithms and, through extensive numerical evaluation, show that the proposed algorithms find feasible paths of similar quality with orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed compared with single-query methods. The proposed algorithms are implemented on hardware to enable real-time autonomous navigation in an indoor environment with frequent interactions with pedestrians.",

        "abstract": "Motor channelling is a concept to provide navigation and sensory feedback to operators in master-slave surgical setups. It is beneficial since the introduction of robotic surgery creates a physical separation between the surgeon and patient anatomy. Active Constraints/Virtual Fixtures are proposed which integrate Guidance and Forbidden Region Constraints into a unified control framework. The developed approach provides guidance and safe manipulation to improve precision and reduce the risk of inadvertent tissue damage. Online three-degree-of-freedom motion prediction and compensation of the target anatomy is performed to complement the master constraints. The presented Active Constraints concept is applied to two clinical scenarios; surface scanning for in situ medical imaging and vessel manipulation in cardiac surgery. The proposed motor channelling control strategy is implemented on the da Vinci Surgical System using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and its effectiveness is demonstrated through a detailed user study.",

        "abstract": "Bilateral telemanipulation refers to frameworks in which a human operator manipulates a master robotic interface and a slave robotic device emulates the behavior of the master, while haptic feedback is provided to the operator. For multi-contact bilateral teleoperation wc intend master and slave systems that can establish multiple contact points with the user and with the environment. A paradigmatic example can be a multi-lingered robotic hand teleoperated by the human hand. Two of the most critical issues in this context are: (i) how to provide haptic feedback on multiple points of the human hand; (ii) how to solve the correspondence problem between the human hand and the robotic slave device. In this work, we propose finger-worn devices able to apply a three dimensional vector of force at a specific contact point to solve the multicontact feedback problem. For the correspondence problem, we propose an object-based mapping procedure. The approach is based on two virtual objects, defined both at the master and slave sides, to capture the human hand motion and to compute the related force feedback. The proposed approach has been tested in a telemanipulation framework where the master side was composed of a Leap Motion sensor used to track the hand plus three wearable haptic devices, while a robotic hand/arm system performed a manipulation task as slave.",

In this paper, a real-time approach for the perception of multiple lanes on highways is proposed. Lane markings detected by camera systems and observations of other traffic participants provide the input data for the algorithm. The information is accumulated and fused using GraphSLAM and the result constitutes the basis for a multi-lane clothoid model. To allow incorporation of additional information sources, input data is processed in a generic format. Evaluation of the method is performed by comparing real data, collected with an experimental vehicle on highways, to a ground truth map. The results show that ego and adjacent lanes are robustly detected with high quality up to a distance of 120 m. In comparison to serial lane detection, an increase in the detection range of the ego lane and a continuous perception of neighboring lanes is achieved. The method can potentially be utilized for the longitudinal and lateral control of self-driving vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Robots in domestic environments are receiving more attention, especially in scenarios where they should interact with parent-like trainers for dynamically acquiring and refining knowledge. A prominent paradigm for dynamically learning new tasks has been reinforcement learning. However, due to excessive time needed for the learning process, a promising extension has been made by incorporating an external parent-like trainer into the learning cycle in order to scaffold and speed up the apprenticeship using advice about what actions should be performed for achieving a goal. In interactive reinforcement learning, different uni-modal control interfaces have been proposed that are often quite limited and do not take into account multiple sensor modalities. In this paper, we propose the integration of audiovisual patterns to provide advice to the agent using multi-modal information. In our approach, advice can be given using either speech, gestures, or a combination of both. We introduce a neural network-based approach to integrate multi-modal information from uni-modal modules based on their confidence. Results show that multi-modal integration leads to a better performance of interactive reinforcement learning with the robot being able to learn faster with greater rewards compared to uni-modal scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we develop a new approach for decentralized multi-robot belief space planning in high-dimensional state spaces while operating in unknown environments. State of the art approaches often address related problems within a sampling based motion planning paradigm, where robots generate candidate paths and are to choose the best paths according to a given objective function. As exhaustive evaluation of all candidate path combinations from different robots is computationally intractable, a commonly used (sub-optimal) framework is for each robot, at each time epoch, to evaluate its own candidate paths while only considering the best paths announced by other robots. Yet, even this approach can become computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional state spaces and for numerous candidate paths that need to be evaluated. In particular, upon an update in the announced path from one of the robots, state of the art approaches re-evaluate belief evolution for all candidate paths and do so from scratch. In this work we develop a framework to identify and efficiently update only those paths that are actually impacted as a result of an update in the announced path. Our approach is based on appropriately propagating belief evolution along impacted paths while employing insights from factor graph and incremental smoothing for efficient inference that is required for evaluating the utility of each impacted path. We demonstrate our approach in a synthetic simulation.",

        "abstract": "We propose a self-organising map (SOM) algorithm as a solution to a new multi-goal path planning problem for active perception and data collection tasks. We optimise paths for a multi-robot team that aims to maximally observe a set of nodes in the environment. The selected nodes are observed by visiting associated viewpoint regions defined by a sensor model. The key problem characteristics are that the viewpoint regions are overlapping polygonal continuous regions, each node has an observation reward, and the robots are constrained by travel budgets. The SOM algorithm jointly selects and allocates nodes to the robots and finds favourable sequences of sensing locations. The algorithm has polynomial-bounded runtime independent of the number of robots. We demonstrate feasibility for the active perception task of observing a set of 3D objects. The viewpoint regions consider sensing ranges and self-occlusions, and the rewards are measured as discriminability in the ensemble of shape functions feature space. Simulations were performed using a 3D point cloud dataset from a real robot in a large outdoor environment. Our results show the proposed methods enable multi-robot planning for budgeted active perception tasks with continuous sets of candidate viewpoints and long planning horizons.",

Our survey of the vast literature on the subject highlights two directions to further improve the performance of a multi-robot team. In particular, in a dynamic environment, coordination needs to be adapted to the different situations at hand (for example, when there is a dramatic loss of performance due to unreliable communication network). To this end, we contribute a novel approach for coordinating robots. Such an approach allows a robotic team to exploit environmental knowledge to adapt to various circumstances encountered, enhancing its overall performance. This result is achieved by dynamically adapting the underlying task assignment and distributed world representation, based on the current state of the environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our coordination system by applying it to the problem of locating a moving, non-adversarial target. In particular, we report on experiments carried out with a team of humanoid robots in a soccer scenario and a team of mobile bases in an office environment.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent flight control regulations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are still gaining popularity in civilian and military applications, as much as for personal use. Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting. Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multi-target detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great deal of research on object detection and tracking from a stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small UAVs from a moving camera. In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV. Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective transformation model and then identify distinctive points in the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal traits of each moving object through optical flow matching and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion patterns compared with the background. The performance is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV. Results show that our algorithm can effectively detect and track small UAVs with limited computing resources.",

We aim at minimizing the mean-time-to-find and maximizing the total probability of finding the target. This leads to two types of illustrative performance metrics: minimum time capture and guaranteed capture. We validate the search strategies with respect to these two performance metrics. In addition, we study the effect of different target distributions on the performance of the search strategies. We also consider the practical realization of the proposed algorithms for multi-target search. The search strategies are analytically evaluated, through simulations and illustrative deployments, in open-water with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) and drifting sensor targets.",

Since no assumptions are made on the kinematic structure of the robot, the method can be also applied to different robotic platforms.",

        "abstract": "Conventional path planning algorithms compute a single path through the configuration space. There is no guarantee that a physical robot will be able to track the trajectory while avoiding collisions, particularly in the presence of environmental perturbations and errors in the process model. Sequential composition combines planning and control by computing a sequence of controllers to execute rather than a single trajectory, offering greater safety guarantees. In this paper, we apply sequential composition to multirobot systems in a scalable fashion using M*, an advanced multirobot path planning algorithm. Controllers will vary in size and geometry, and thus take different amounts of time to execute. To handle these differences, we introduce the time augmented joint prepares graph and the approximate time augmented joint prepares graph which simplifies implementation by discretizing time. We validate our approach in a mixed reality test framework.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the problem of distributed path planning for a mobile sensor network comprised of communication-aware robots performing general information gathering missions. Mutual information is derived for distributed sensing over packet erasure channels that model multi-hop communication. We model distributed path planning as a non-cooperative game and derive utility functions that are optimized locally by each robot. Each robot computes the control input in a distributed manner that results in a combined action that can be bounded by the optimal centralized result by utilizing sub-modularity in certain cases. It is shown that when the communication model includes multi-hop communication to expand the coverage of the sensor network, the property of sub-modularity is lost. We further show that the additional global knowledge required for the local computation of utility functions can be learned by simple consensus approaches. Finally, we discuss a sampling approach to approximate the proposed utility functions in order to reduce the associated computational requirements.",

Thus, a strong demand exists to automate this process. Here, we developed an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based nanorobot for in situ sensing molecular interactions for drug discovery. The AFM tip and sample substrate are functionalized by the molecules of interest. Via measuring the interactive binding forces between these two molecules using the AFM based nanorobot, we are able to test the effectiveness of drug candidates on attenuating or enhancing the molecular interactions involved in cell signaling pathways. To measure the single molecular interactions precisely, we developed a new substrate coating method. The new method functionalizes the substrate much more evenly compared with the previous method. We further optimized settings during measuring the interactive binding force, such as coating with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the level of indentation of AFM tip onto the substrate. With these progresses, this nanorobot measures single molecular interactions automated. We further used this nanorobot to test a small peptide, which was designed to attenuate the interactive binding force between focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (AKT), two molecules involved in cell adhesion.",

The proposed approach allows to exploit the distinctive obstacle negotiation capabilities of legged robots, while keeping the complexity low enough to enable planning over considerable distances in short time. We compute typical terrain characteristics such as slope, roughness, and steps to build a traversability map. This map is used to assess the costs of individual robot footprints as a function of the robot-specific obstacle negotiating capabilities for steps, gaps and stairs. Our sampling-based planner employs the RRT* algorithm to optimize path length and safety. The planning framework has a hierarchical architecture to frequently replan the path during execution as new terrain is perceived with onboard sensors. Furthermore, a cascaded planning structure makes use of different levels of simplification to allow for fast search in simple environments, while retaining the ability to find complex solutions, such as paths through narrow passages. The proposed navigation planning framework is integrated on the quadrupedal robot StarlETH and extensively tested in simulation as well as on the real platform.",

In this work, we develop algorithms that allow the robots to autonomously resolve conflicts and complete their tasks with correctness guarantees, when possible. In our approach, the robots autonomously detect conflicts and trigger coordination within the subgroup of robots in conflict. The need-based coordination initiates the execution of a global robot controller on each robot in the subgroup until the robots all reach their current goals. The subgroup of robots then return to their local controllers and continue their execution. Our approach captures both the advantage of decentralized robot control and that of centralized robot control. The transition between centralized and decentralized robot control is seamless with guarantees provided.",

Most of the limitations of RAMIS stem from its nonintuitive user interface and costs. One way to mitigate some of the limitations is to automate surgical subtasks (e.g. suturing) such that they are performed faster while allowing the surgeon to plan the next step of the procedure. One component of successful suture automation is minimizing the internal tissue deformation forces generated by driving a needle through tissue. Minimizing the internal tissue forces requires segmenting the tissue deformation forces from other components of the needle tissue interaction (e.g. friction force). This paper proposes an Unscented Kalman Filter which can successfully model the force components, in particular the internal deformation force, generated by a needle as it is driven through a sample of tissue.",

        "abstract": "Contact force play is a significant role in success of the cardiac ablation. However, it is still challenging to estimate contact force when a catheter is under large bending and multiple contacts. This paper develops a new multi-section static model of the tendon-driven catheters for both real-time intrinsic force sensing and interaction control. The model allows estimating the catheter shape by the external force at arbitrary location. Also, an algorithm is developed for the contact force estimation using the shape estimation with the catheter end-position tracking and tension feedback. In this study, we validated the contact force and shape estimation using a robotic platform, which steers a catheter consisting of 4 tendons with tension feedback. The shape estimation results show that the model can accurately predict the catheter shape; the position difference between measured and estimated was 2.5mm. The results of the contact force estimation show that 3-dimensional contact forces can be estimated accurately using the proposed method. The magnitude of contact force error was 0.0117N with 350Hz update rate.",

The approach estimates the location of a target through the mobile robot's sensor observation frame, which consists of a combination of diffraction and reflection acoustic signals and a 3-D environment geometrical description. This fusion of audio-visual sensor observation likelihoods allows the robot to estimate the NFOV target. The diffraction and reflection observations from the microphone array generate the acoustic joint observation likelihood. The observed geometry also determines far-field or near-field acoustic conditions to improve the estimation of the sound direction of arrival. A mobile robot equipped with a microphone array and an RGB-D sensor was tested in a controlled environment, an anechoic chamber, to demonstrate the NFOV localization capabilities. This resulted in +/- 18 degrees, and less than 0.75 m error in angle and distance estimation, respectively.",

The translational part can be smoothed by a simple Gaussian convolution. We then proposed a novel approach to rotation smoothing. Unlike existing rotation smoothing methods using either iterative optimization methods or stochastic filtering methods, our method allows direct computation of the smoothing result and allows parallelization of the computation. Furthermore, we have done a comparative study on Jia and Evans's method published in 2014 [1], and shown that our method can better smooth an input rotation sequence, with shorter computational time. The smoothed camera path is then used for video stabilisation, which shows fluid and smooth camera motion.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic search algorithms are black-box optimizer of an objective function. They have recently gained a lot of attention in operations research, machine learning and policy search of robot motor skills due to their ease of use and their generality. Yet, many stochastic search algorithms require relearning if the task or objective function changes slightly to adapt the solution to the new situation or the new context. In this paper, we consider the contextual stochastic search setup. Here, we want to find multiple good parameter vectors for multiple related tasks, where each task is described by a continuous context vector. Hence, the objective function might change slightly for each parameter vector evaluation of a task or context. Contextual algorithms have been investigated in the field of policy search, however, the search distribution typically uses a parametric model that is linear in the some hand-defined context features. Finding good context features is a challenging task, and hence, non-parametric methods are often preferred over their parametric counter-parts. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric contextual stochastic search algorithm that can learn a non-parametric search distribution for multiple tasks simultaneously. In difference to existing methods, our method can also learn a context dependent covariance matrix that guides the exploration of the search process. We illustrate its performance on several non-linear contextual tasks.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate velocity-level closed-loop control of a tethered magnetic capsule endoscope that is actuated via serial manipulator with a permanent magnet at its end-effector. Closed-loop control (2 degrees-of-freedom in position, and 2 in orientation) is made possible with the use of a real-time magnetic localization algorithm that utilizes the actuating magnetic field and thus does not require additional hardware. Velocity control is implemented to create smooth motion that is clinically necessary for colorectal cancer diagnostics. Our control algorithm generates a spline that passes through a set of input points that roughly defines the shape of the desired trajectory. The velocity controller acts in the tangential direction to the path, while a secondary position controller enforces a nonholonomic constraint on capsule motion. A soft nonholonomic constraint is naturally imposed by the lumen while we enforce a strict constraint for both more accurate estimation of tether disturbance and hypothesized intuitiveness for a clinician's teleoperation. An integrating disturbance force estimation control term is introduced to predict the disturbance of the tether. This paper presents the theoretical formulations and experimental validation of our methodology. Results show the system's ability to achieve a repeatable velocity step response with low steady-state error as well as ability of the tethered capsule to maneuver around a bend.",

Specifically, the controller is applicable to both linear and nonlinear SEAs and it works well even in the presence of unknown payload parameters and external disturbances. Via the analysis and transformation of the SEA dynamics, a lumped disturbance signal is constructed and a form convenient for controller design is developed. Then, a nonlinear disturbance observer(NDOB) and a sliding-mode control scheme are introduced to synthesize the control law. The performance of the proposed controller is theoretically ensured by Lyapunov analysis. Taking a nonlinear SEA for instance, a series of simulations and hardware experiments are carried out. The results suggest the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method for SEA torque control by comparing it with the cascade-PID controller.",

Previous work in this area relies upon strong assumptions about the labels in the training data; e.g. that are noise-free and that they exist at all. Our approach does not predefine the relevant behaviours or their number, as both are learned directly from observations, similar to real-world human-robot interactions, where labels are neither available. Instead we introduce models that make no assumptions about the state space, by presenting a fully unsupervised nonparametric Bayesian recognition approach, in which we leverage recent advances in state space modelling with automatic inference using probabilistic programming. We demonstrate the utility of full model optimisation using Bayesian optimisation and validate our approach on several challenging problems, using different feature modalities.",

Observation distributions are commonly approximated by parametric models, which are limited in their expressiveness, and may require careful design to suit an application. In this paper, we propose nonparametric distribution regression as a procedure to model sensors. It is a data-driven procedure to predict distributions that makes few assumptions. We apply the procedure to model raw distributions from real sensors, and also demonstrate its utility to a mobile robot state estimation task. We show that nonparametric distribution regression adapts to characteristics in the training data, leading to realistic predictions. The same procedure competes favorably with baseline parametric models across applications. The results also help develop intuition for different sensor modeling situations. Our procedure is useful when distributions are inherently noisy, and sufficient data is available.",

        "abstract": "All the people have their own individual force ranges to feel the sense of touch and its minimum value is called light touch threshold (in short LTT). For instance, if a touching force is very weak, people do not know whether the object is contacted to their skin, even though it is pushing the skin already. This paper presents a novel apparatus to measure the LTT felt by each subject, which is referred to as Active von Frey (AvF) in this paper. As far as the authors know, the LTT measurement device is for the first time proposed in this paper. It is possible for the AvF to provide the touching force ranges from 1[mgf] to 400[mgf]. In order to provide an accurate touching force for the subject, D'Arsonval movement is chosen as an actuator to rotate a touching AvF pin. Both an electric current applied to the D'Arsonval movement and a rotational angle of AvF pin are utilized to calculate the touching force by the electro-mechanical statics. In addition, the image processing technique is used to measure the rotational angle of AvF pin. Finally we show that the LTTs are very different from individual to individual through the experimental results of 10 participants. We hope that the personalized parameters is used to design or control haptic or tele-operation devices for various applications.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Differential flatness is a property of certain systems that greatly simplifies the generation of optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories. Using a differentially flat model, there is no need to integrate the system dynamics to retrieve the states and the constraints of the optimization problem are simpler. Recently, the concept of partial differential flatness has been introduced covering a broader class of systems. In particular, it allows to reduce the need for integration by limiting it to a subset of the states. However, finding an analytical expression for the (partial) differential flatness requires the manipulation of the equations of motion in a very specific manner such that a series of properties are fulfilled. In general, finding such analytical model is not straightforward nor compatible with algorithmic models. In order to tackle this problem, in this paper we present a numerical method to find a (partially) differentially flat model of a system around a collection of states and inputs trajectories. We present results on three underactuated nonlinear systems (cart-pole, planar ballbot and a 3D quadrotor). As use case examples, we show online trajectory re-planning tasks. The validity of the trajectories obtained with the locally flat models is verified by forward integrating the original equations of motion together with an optimal stabilizer.",

For motion planning, a Bi-directional Transition-based Rapidly exploring Random Tree (BiTRRT) algorithm is used to generate trajectories for reaching the desired goals. The complete framework is verified with experiments, and the results show that the robot welding torch is able to transit without collision to desired goals which are close to the tubular joint.",

        "abstract": "We present an object detection and tracking framework integrated into a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system using an RGB-D camera. We propose a compact representation of objects by grouping features hierarchically. Similar to a keyframe being a collection of features, an object is represented as a set of segments, where a segment is a subset of features in a frame. Just like keyframes, segments are registered with each other in a map, which we call an object map. We use the same SLAM procedure in both offline object scanning and online object detection modes. In the offline scanning mode, we scan an object using an RGB-D camera to generate an object map. In the online detection mode, a set of object maps for different objects is given, and the objects are detected via appearance-based matching between the segments in the current frame and in the object maps. In the case of a match, the object is localized with respect to the map being reconstructed by the SLAM system by a RANSAC registration. In the subsequent frames, the tracking is done by predicting the poses of the objects. We also incorporate constraints obtained from the objects into bundle adjustment to improve the object pose estimation accuracy as well as the SLAM reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate our technique in an object picking scenario using a robot arm. Experimental results show that the system is able to detect and pick up objects successfully from different viewpoints and distances.",

Learning to recognize objects requires image representations that are discriminative to relevant information while being invariant to nuisances, such as scaling, rotations, light and background changes, and so forth. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks can learn such representations from large web-collected image datasets and a natural question is how these systems can be best adapted to the robotics context where little supervision is often available. In this work, we investigate different training strategies for deep architectures on a new dataset collected in a real-world robotic setting. In particular we show how deep networks can be tuned to improve invariance and discriminability properties and perform object identification tasks with minimal supervision.",

Our method presents object proposals in 3D space as well as in 2D image thus it can further be applied to following tasks for mobile robots such as 3D location and pose estimation of the target object after successful object detection.

Additionally, our method efficiently reasons about occlusions between robots and takes them into account for the control generation. We evaluate our approach in a number of experiments in which we simulate a team of quadrotor robots flying in three-dimensional space to track a moving target on the ground. We compare our method to other state-of-the-art approaches represented by the random sampling technique, lattice planning method, and our previous method. Our experimental results indicate that our method achieves up to 8 times smaller maximum tracking error and up to 2 times smaller average tracking error than the next best approach in the presented scenarios.",

        "abstract": "We present a tracking system based on ultra-wideband (UWB) radio tranceivers mounted on a robot and a target. In comparison to typical UWB localization systems with fixed UWB tranceivers in the environment we only require instrumentation of the target with a single UWB tranceiver. Our system works in GPS-denied environments and does not suffer from long-term drift and limited fields of view. This paper reports the localization algorithm and implementation details. Additionally, we demonstrate a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy (10cm average position error for a square with side-length of 4m) and application scenarios with a quadrotor flying in close proximity to a person and handling occlusion of the target. Finally, we release our implementation as open-source software.",

        "abstract": "Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging non-invasive brain computer interface (BCI) modality that measures changes in haemoglobin concentrations in the cortical tissue. To date most NIRS studies have used standard multiple subject/session dependent classifiers for neural signal decoding. Such approach is preferable to avoid large degree of variabilities in the acquired data that affects classifier generalization. This study presents a classification algorithm that maintains a good performance under the presence of variability in the NIRS data. It is based on \u03bd- support vector machines and its extensions to a multiple kernel learning framework. Empirical evaluations have shown that through the proposed method one can improve the overall BCI decoding accuracy, and its robustness against the variability in neural data.",

A reduced-order passive and conservative model with translational spinal joint and springy legs is introduced. Numerical return map studies reveal the existence of a confined area of fixed points generating high-speed cyclic bounding motions by exploiting the natural dynamics of the model. The corresponding motion features extensive bidirectional spine deformation. The model displays interesting techniques that result in high-speed locomotion, such as increased flight phase duration and stride length. The obtained results show that the corresponding robot gaits and the associated performance resemble those of its natural counterparts even though the spinal joint lies beyond the bioinspired regime.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we try to draw attention to a particular type of force that has been somehow overlooked in the control of mechanical manipulators: gyroscopic force. At first, we broaden our understanding of gyroscopic effect intrinsic in mechanical systems by reformulating the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation in terms of a gyroscopic part and the non-gyroscopic ones (or Rayleigh type). Then, we propose the use of artificial gyroscopic force to assist existing control laws. As a force that does not do any work, the gyroscopic force can be effectively used in combination with many existing control laws for mechanical systems without affecting their salient features such as the stability or the convergence to a target point. As a specific example, we look into the potential energy shaping parameterized by taskspace variables (also known as the Jacobian transpose method) as a base control law, and combine it with an artificial gyroscopic forcing term. We propose one specific way to design the gyroscopic force as a term quadratic in velocity that operates in reference to a desired velocity field shape (also parameterized in taskspace). The resulting control strategy enables us to shape the intermediate path profiles and thus realizes a taskspace control law that is free from any inverse transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using simulation results with a three-link planar manipulator.",

As these methods are random in nature, the probability of their success is directly related to the expansiveness, or openness, of the underlying planning space. However, little is known theoretically in qualifying the conditions under which user (human)-guided approaches improve the efficiency of sampling-based planners. In this paper, we classify and create simplistic models of common user-guided approaches, and we extend the concept of expansiveness to analyze these models to understand both when and how much user-guidance aids sampling-based planners.",

        "abstract": "We propose a fluidic monostable multivibrator (fMMV) circuit, which is a new flow-switching mechanism in microfluidic chips. Flow control using parallel fMMV circuits does not require an external controller; this is a distinct advantage over various conventional micro-flow control methods. The fMMV circuit mainly consists of an inverter and an RC circuit. Each of the parts uses a microchannel as a resistor, a membrane chamber as a capacitor and a membrane valve as a transistor. The inverter acts as a trigger which opens the membrane valve and the RC circuit delays the closing of the valve, so that flow switching can occur over a time interval. A serial fMMV circuit can switch flows in multiple channels and regulate flowrates with pre-defined durations. By modifying the resistances in fMMV circuits, the flow rates and duration of each phase could be adjusted. For a proof of concept demonstration, we performed experiments using 3 parallel fMMV and 4 parallel fMMV circuit systems and these experiments show the applicability of fMMV circuit to various biochemical processes.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of one DoF robotic hand that makes human laugh by tickling through rubbing underarm. Laughter is attracting research attention because it enhances health by treating or preventing mental diseases. However, laughter has not been used effectively in healthcare because the mechanism of laughter is complicated and is yet to be fully understood. The development of a robot capable of making humans laugh is useful for clarifying the mechanism of laughter because the stimuli by the robot is quantitative and reproductive. Especially, tickling matches to this purpose because the relationship between stimuli and reaction is simpler compared to other techniques. Therefore, this research aimed to develop a robotic hand that can output quantitative and reproductive tickling stimuli for clarifying the mechanism of laughter. Rubbing underarm is selected as a target motion of robot because previous research suggested that this is the best way for making humans feel ticklish. In order to achieve the tickling motion by robots as humans, the required specifications were determined through experimental method. In order to develop a robot that achieves the required fingertip trajectory by simple mechanisms as much as possible, mechanism with crank and link driven by single motor was developed. The result of experimental evaluation shows that the developed robot could make humans laugh by its rubbing motion. In addition, the quantitative tickling motion by developed robotic hand was suggested to be effective for clarifying the mechanism of laughter.",

        "abstract": "One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to complex robotic control tasks is the need to gather large amounts of experience in order to find an effective policy for the task at hand. Model-based reinforcement learning can achieve good sample efficiency, but requires the ability to learn a model of the dynamics that is good enough to learn an effective policy. In this work, we develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that combines prior knowledge from previous tasks with online adaptation of the dynamics model. These two ingredients enable highly sample-efficient learning even in regimes where estimating the true dynamics is very difficult, since the online model adaptation allows the method to locally compensate for unmodeled variation in the dynamics. We encode the prior experience into a neural network dynamics model, adapt it online by progressively refitting a local linear model of the dynamics, and use model predictive control to plan under these dynamics. Our experimental results show that this approach can be used to solve a variety of complex robotic manipulation tasks in just a single attempt, using prior data from other manipulation behaviors.",

Too little help can lead to frustration and stress in the user; an excess of help may lead to low participation and loss of residual skills. Robotic rollators may adapt assistance. The main challenge to cope with this issue is to estimate how much help is needed on the fly, because it depends not only on the person condition, but also on the specific situation that they are negotiating. Clinical scales provide a global condition based estimation, but no local estimator based on punctual needs. Condition also changes in time, so clinical scales need to be recalculated again and again. In this paper we propose a novel approach to estimate users' condition in a continuous way via a robotic rollator. Our work focuses on predicting the value of the well known Tinetti Mobility test from spatiotemporal gait parameters obtained from our platform while users walk. This prediction provides continuous insight on the condition of the user and could be used to modify the amount of help provided. The proposed method has been validated with 19 volunteers at a local hospital that use a rollator for rehabilitation. All volunteers presented some physical or mental disabilities. Our results successfully show a high correlation of spatiotemporal gait parameters with Tinetti Mobility test gait (R2 = 0.7) and Tinetti Mobility test balance (R2 = 0.6).",

        "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in intelligent robotics is to build robots that can learn to use language. To this end, we think that the practical long-term on-line concept/word learning algorithm for robots is a key issue to be addressed. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised on-line learning algorithm that uses Bayesian nonparametrics for categorizing multimodal sensory signals such as audio, visual, and haptic information for robots. The robot uses its physical body to grasp and observe an object from various viewpoints as well as listen to the sound during the observation. The most important property of the proposed framework is to learn multimodal concepts and the language model simultaneously. This mutual learning framework of concepts and language significantly improves both speech recognition and multimodal categorization performances. We conducted a long-term experiment where a human subject interacted with a real robot over 100 hours using 499 objects. Some interesting results of the experiment are discussed in this paper.",

The suggested method considers the visibility of the model points and learns discriminative appearance of the object under gradual changes. It selectively reduces the amount of information to process by excluding non-visible points of the model and removing outliers from data stream, which results in better alignment between the input data and the model. Thus, by providing a good initial pose, it speeds up the iterative procedure of EM-like optimization for pose estimation (i.e., ICP) to achieve better efficiency and robustness. We compiled a new object dataset of RGBD images under camera motion with ground truth poses of the camera and the objects. We have performed experiments on this dataset and obtained promising results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider an online planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. Specifically, a UAV has the task of reaching a goal from a set of possible goals while minimizing the amount of energy required. Due to unforeseen disturbances, it is possible that initially attractive goals might end up being very expensive during the execution. Thus, two main problems are investigated here: i) how to predict and plan the motion of the UAV at run time to minimize its energy consumption and ii) when to schedule next replanning time to avoid unnecessary periodic re-evaluation executions. Our approach considers a nonlinear model of the system for which a model predictive controller is used to determine the desired control inputs for each possible goal. These control inputs are then used to estimate the energy required to reach the different goals. Finally, a self-triggered scheduling policy determines how long to wait before replanning the goal to aim for. The proposed framework is validated through simulations and experiments in which a quadrotor must choose and reach some goal while being subject to external disturbances.",

To obtain the optimal law a decision algorithm for the acceleration along the path has been developed. Remarkably, the algorithm is amenable to online implementation, thus allowing for path replanning. An experimental validation on an ABB IRB140 robot is shown.",

To account for tissue displacements, we designed a method based on visual feedback that updates the interaction model between the needle and the tissue using an unscented Kalman filter. Results obtained from several needle insertions in a soft tissue phantom showed that the method gives good performance in terms of needle trajectory prediction. This model was also considered in a closed-loop control approach to allow automatic reaching of a target.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an online method of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for estimating the positions of multiple moving sound sources and stationary robots and synchronizing microphone arrays attached to those robots. Since each robot with a microphone array can solely estimate the directions of sound sources, the two-dimensional source positions can be estimated from the source directions estimated by multiple robots using a triangulation method. In addition, sound mixtures can be separated accurately by regarding distributed microphone arrays as one big array. To perform these tasks, some methods have been proposed for localizing and synchronizing microphone arrays. These methods, however, can be used only if a single sound source exists because the time differences of arrival (TDOAs) between microphones are assumed to be directly observed. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified state-space model that encodes the source and robot positions and the time offsets between microphone arrays in a latent space. Given the TDOAs and directions of arrival (DOAs) estimated by separating observed mixture sounds into source sounds, the latent variables are estimated jointly in an online manner using a FastSLAM2.0 algorithm that can deal with an unknown time-varying number of moving sound sources.",

Inspired by prior work, we formulate the optimization as a derivative-free stochastic optimization, allowing us to express the cost function in an arbitrary way. The cost function is defined such that information acquisition of target objects is improved, while simultaneously moving towards the goal point. We show the evaluation of our approach on a quadrotor platform in simulation as well as on a real robot. The results show that by using an online optimization approach recognition accuracy is greatly improved, but more importantly the optimized trajectory reduces the uncertainty of the posterior class distribution greatly. Hence, verifying that the optimized trajectory collects more valuable information.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents OpenSwarm, a lightweight easy-to-use open-source operating system. To our knowledge, it is the first operating system designed for and deployed on miniature robots. OpenSwarm operates directly on a robot's microcontroller. It has a memory footprint of 1 kB RAM and 12 kB ROM. OpenSwarm enables a robot to execute multiple processes simultaneously. It provides a hybrid kernel that natively supports preemptive and cooperative scheduling, making it suitable for both computationally intensive and swiftly responsive robotics tasks. OpenSwarm provides hardware abstractions to rapidly develop and test platform-independent code. We show how OpenSwarm can be used to solve a canonical problem in swarm robotics\u2014clustering a collection of dispersed objects. We report experiments, conducted with five e-puck mobile robots, that show that an OpenSwarm implementation performs as good as a hardware-near implementation. The primary goal of OpenSwarm is to make robots with severely constrained hardware more accessible, which may help such systems to be deployed in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "For hydraulic robots, modeling of the control flows is a key issue. The conventional modeling methods are based on the Bernoulli equation (i.e., the control flow is a function of the form equation which needs assumption of steady flow. In robotics, since the actual control flow is not always a steady flow, this paper provides a new practical modeling method without the Bernoulli equation. In a word, the proposed modeling method is a systematic version of the industrial modeling in which table representations are accepted and the assumption of steady flow is not needed. First, based on the input-state equation of hydraulic robots, we propose a new matrix representation of control flows via off-line input-output calculations. Second, based on the projection theorem in the matrix space, the optimal table representation is uniquely determined to be implementable. Finally, in comparison with the conventional modeling method with the Bernoulli equation, the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method is confirmed experimentally. The proposed modeling method is applicable to electric robots with complex friction and so on.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a hybrid visual servoing technique for differentially flat, underactuated systems that is well suited for aggressive dynamics. Standard Position-Based Visual Servoing (PBVS) and Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) approaches for underactuated systems, such as quadrotors, oftentimes do not explicitly ensure that the relevant image features stay in the camera's field of view, especially while the system is performing agile maneuvers. We present a control technique that is designed to mitigate this issue and that results in increased robustness. Given a goal image, we first solve a constrained Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem to find an equilibrium pose which aligns the camera with the goal. We then formulate the task of navigating to the goal pose as an optimal control problem, where a cost over the resulting image feature tracks along the trajectory is minimized which implicitly keeps features in the field of view over the course of the trajectory. The optimization is performed over a polynomial parametrization of the flat outputs of the system to decrease the dimensionality of the optimization. Simulations and physical experiments are performed with a quadrotor system to benchmark the algorithm's performance against a typical PBVS approach.",

However, it typically requires a manual specification of a cost function which often contains several objectives, such as reaching goal positions at different time steps or energy efficiency. Manually trading-off these objectives is often difficult and requires a high engineering effort. In this paper, we present a new approach to specify optimal behavior. We directly specify the desired behavior by a distribution over future states or features of the states. For example, the experimenter could choose to reach certain mean positions with given accuracy/variance at specified time steps. Our approach also unifies optimal control and inverse optimal control in one framework. Given a desired state distribution, we estimate a cost function such that the optimal controller matches the desired distribution. If the desired distribution is estimated from expert demonstrations, our approach performs inverse optimal control. We evaluate our approach on several optimal and inverse optimal control tasks on non-linear systems using incremental linearizations similar to differential dynamic programming approaches.",

The main objective of this work is emulating the aggressive and large angle correction maneuvers, like somersaults, that are performed by human divers. To this end, a planar three link robot, called DiverBot, is proposed. By considering a gravity-free scenario, a local connection is obtained between joint angles and the body orientation, resulting in a reduction in the system dynamics. An optimal control policy applied on this reduced configuration space yielded diving maneuvers that are dynamically feasible. Numerical results show that the DiverBot can execute one somersault without drift and multiple somersaults with minimal drift.",

This is achieved by allowing pre- and post-actuation during the single support phases. Thus, we solve two coupled problems: exact tracking of a given desired ZMP trajectory in the pre- and post-phases (single support), and determination of the desired ZMP during the transition phase (double support). Both are solved while minimizing the overall control energy. We also provide a formal method to assess how the choice of desired ZMP trajectory during the single support phases impacts the overall energy expended during the footstep cycle. Although the obtained solution may not be physically feasible in general, it represents a benchmark to which alternative feasible solutions may be compared. Our approach generalizes previous results that consider only constant output in the pre- and post-phases e.g., allowing pre- and post-phase output from a family of polynomial splines. We evaluate the approach via simulations.",

The robot moves in a known environment following typical trajectories, which can be characterised in statistical terms. One of the main drivers of this paper is its application to assistive robots guiding senior or impaired users in shopping centres or in other public spaces. To localise itself the robot uses onboard sensors such as encoders and inertial platforms. The level of noise in these sensors and the lack of absolute measurements determines a steady growth of the uncertainty on its position. To alleviate the problem, we assume the presence of a number of visual markers deployed in the environment. Whenever the robot comes across one of these sensors, the uncertainty on its position is reset. In the paper, we show a methodology to minimise the number of these sensors and to select their position so that the uncertainty is never worse than a given target threshold with an assigned probability.",

Each robot optimally assigns human identities to tracked faces in its camera view using a local Hungarian algorithm. The gaze-direction and location of the faces are estimated via vision, and a score for each robot-face pair is assigned. Then the system finds the global optimal allocation of robot-to-human selections using a centralized Hungarian algorithm. A useful feature of this method is that robots can be selected by people they cannot see. This is the first demonstration of optimal many-to-many robot-selection HRI.",

        "abstract": "This paper is aimed at developing optimal motion planning for a single autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) equipped with an on-board pollutant sensor that will maximize the sensor-related information available for source seeking. The ASV uses a nonlinear diffusion model of the pollutant source to estimate the intensity/level of the pollution at the present ASV location. The rate of detection of particles depends on the relative distance between the ASV and the source. First, we use a probabilistic map of the source location built through the sensor information for a dynamic motion planning of source seeking based on an entropy reduction formulation, where an appropriately defined Fisher information matrix (FIM) is used for entropy reduction or information gain. We derive the FIM for the set-up and investigate optimal trajectories. Next, we present an online nonlinear Monte Carlo algorithm that uses the obtained sensor information about pollutant at different vehicle locations to update a probabilistic uncertainty map of pollutant source location. As the mission unfolds the ASV motion is computed by considering a moving-horizon interval of decision, which will allow for the inclusion of new information available for optimal motion planning. The proposed motion planning approach is extended to take into account external disturbances and it is able to minimize the uncertainty in the pollutant source. Finally, we provide two case studies to demonstrate efficacy of the proposed motion planning algorithm.",

In this paper we present a novel trajectory generation method for generalization of accurate movements with boundary conditions. Our approach originates from optimal control theory and is based on a second order dynamic system. We evaluate our method and compare it to state-of-the-art movement generation methods in both simulations and a real robot experiment. We show that the new method is very compact in its representation and can reproduce demonstrated trajectories with zero error. Moreover, it has most of the properties of the state-of-the-art trajectory generation methods such as robustness to perturbations and generalisation to new boundary position and velocity conditions. We believe that, due to these features, our method has great potential for various robotic applications, especially, where high accuracy is required, for example, in industrial and medical robotics.",

The work presented here advances the SLIP template toward a biological anchor by adding a third parallel articulating joint, which provides redundancy in the inverse kinematics solution space. Instead of one actuator into which an energy thrust can be added, the total thrust can be distributed between two actuators operating on the lower two leg joints (the hip joint remains passive during stance as in the original SLIP model). It is shown that a careless distribution of the thrust can lead to significant energy loss, so an offline search protocol is presented as a general approach for resolving the optimal thrust distribution ratio between these joints. The results of the offline search are then approximated for rapid computation of this ratio during hopping tests in a high-fidelity simulation engine.",

However, the price to pay for a stable behavior is a degradation in the performance of the teleoperation system. Recently, more flexible and transparency oriented bilateral architectures have been proposed (e.g. TDPN, PSPM, Two-Layer approach) but they are complex to implement and to tune. In [1], a strategy for blending the high performance of the new control methodologies with the simplicity of wave based bilateral teleoperation has been proposed. Nevertheless, while appealing in terms of simplicity, this method is conservative in terms of the transparency that can be achieved. In this paper, we extend the architecture in [1] in order to optimize the use of the energy and for achieving a coupling that is as close as possible to the desired one while preserving the passivity of the overall system.",

We present a method for computing volumes containing the entire possible future occupancy of the human, given its state, faster than real time. The dynamic model of the human is built from analysing a set of archetypal movements performed by test subjects. The occupancy prediction is tested on a publicly available database of motion capture data, and shown to be overapproximative for all movements relating to everyday activities, sport and dance. Our novel algorithm is useful to guarantee safety in human-robot collaboration scenarios.",

This paper extends a popular semi-direct approach to monocular visual odometry known as SVO [1] to work with line segments, hence obtaining a more robust system capable of dealing with both textured and structured environments. The proposed odometry system allows for the fast tracking of line segments since it eliminates the necessity of continuously extracting and matching features between subsequent frames. The method, of course, has a higher computational burden than the original SVO, but it still runs with frequencies of 60Hz on a personal computer while performing robustly in a wider variety of scenarios.",

In this paper we propose three improvements for binary descriptors in their computation and matching that enhance their performance in comparison to traditional binary and non-binary descriptors without compromising their speed. This is achieved by learning some weights and threshold parameters that allow customized matching under some variations such as lighting and viewpoint. Our suggested improvements can be easily applied to any binary descriptor. We demonstrate our approach on the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) descriptor and compare its performance with the traditional ORB and SIFT descriptors on a wide variety of datasets. In all instances, our enhancements outperform standard ORB and are comparable to SIFT.",

        "abstract": "We present POMP (Pareto Optimal Motion Planner), an anytime algorithm for geometric path planning on roadmaps. For robots with several degrees of freedom, collision checks are computationally expensive and often dominate planning time. Our goal is to minimize the number of collision checks for obtaining the first feasible path and successively shorter feasible paths. We assume that the roadmaps we search over are embedded in a continuous ambient space, where nearby points tend to share the same collision state. This enables us to formulate a probabilistic model that computes the probability of unevaluated configurations being collision-free. We update the model over time as more checks are performed. This model lets us define a weighting function for roadmap edges that is related to the probability of the edge being in collision. Our approach is to trade off between these two weights, gradually prioritizing edge length over collision likelihood. We also show that this tradeoff is approximately equivalent to minimizing the expected path length, with a penalty of being in collision. Our experiments demonstrate that POMP performs comparably with RRTConnect and LazyPRM for the first feasible path, and BIT* for anytime performance, both in terms of collision checks and total planning time.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses sound source separation and identification for noise-contaminated acoustic signals recorded with a microphone array embedded in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), aiming at people's voice detection quickly and widely in a disaster situation. The key approach to achieve this is Deep Neural Network (DNN), but it is well known that training a DNN needs a huge dataset to improve its performance. In a practical application, building such a dataset is not often realistic owing to the cost of manual data annotation. Therefore, we propose a Partially-Shared Deep Neural Network (PS-DNN) which can learn multiple tasks at the same time with a small amount of annotated data. Preliminary results show that the PS-DNN outperforms conventional DNN-based approaches which require fully-annotated data in training in terms of identification accuracy. In addition, it maintains performance even when noise-suppressed signals are used for sound source separation training, and partially annotated data is used for sound source identification training.",

In this paper we propose a new direct visual servoing control law that relies on a particle filter to achieve non-local and non-linear optimization in order to increase this convergence area. Thanks to multi-view geometry and image transfer techniques, a set of particles (which correspond to potential camera velocities) are drawn and evaluated in order to evaluate the best camera trajectory. This new control law is validated on a 6 DOF positioning task performed on a real gantry robot and statistical comparisons are also provided from simulation results.",

More precisely, our approach uses two image modalities to perform 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) positioning task. The development aims to partition the control into 3 DOF controlled by the B-scan images acquired with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system and the remaining 3 DOF controlled by the white light images provided by a CCD camera. Moreover, for the control and instead of conventional visual features (e.g., points, lines, moments, etc.) extracted using algorithms combined with visual tracking approaches, our visual servoing method uses the multiresolution wavelet coefficients. The developed method was experimentally validated using a parallel kinematic structure equipped with a Telesto-II OCT benchtop. The validation task consisted of an automatic spatial repositioning of the robotic structure to precisely retrieve the position of an initial optical biopsy. Several tests are achieved, which clearly demonstrate the reliability of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control algorithm that steers a robotic walking assistant along a planned path using electromechanical brakes. The device is modeled as a Dubins' car, i.e., a wheeled vehicle that moves only forward in the plane and has a limited turning radius. In order to reduce the cost of the hardware, no force sensor is employed. This feature hampers the application of control algorithms based on a modulated braking action. A viable solution is based on the application of on/off braking action, thus forcing the vehicle to turn with a fixed turning radius. In order to avoid the annoying chattering behaviour, which is the inevitable companion of all bang-bang solutions, we propose a hybrid controller based on three discrete states that rule the application of the braking action. The resulting feedback controller secures a gentle convergence of the user toward the planned path and his/her steady progress towards the destination. This is obtained by using two independent hystereses thresholds, the first one associated with the approaching phase and the second with the following phases. The system convergence toward the path is formally proved. Simulations and experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the good level of comfort for the user.",

We propose the use of Expected Value of the Final Uncertainty, which summarizes all the possible uncertainties that should be considered. In fully explored environments, this is used to determine the most reliable path to the final position. In partially explored environments, this criteria quantifies the reliability of the path planned in the free space. Tests demonstrate its ability to avoid unreliable paths in fully explored environments as compared to other uncertainty based criteria. In the exploration scenario, potential paths not present in the original graph are proposed using Voronoi Diagram of the space ahead observed by the sensors. A cost function is proposed considering the length of the path as well as the expected final uncertainty, thus including potentially shorter, but still reliable paths. Tests demonstrate the shortest path is preferred as long as it contains loop closures with low uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents initial results of a set of experiments to compare time-delayed teleoperation performance of selected architectures based on two popular passivity based methods, namely, Wave Variables Transformation (WVT) and Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA). Five different architectures widely used and available in literature are selected: 2-channel and 3-channel for both WV and TDPA, and 4-channel based on TDPA. An empirical approach for measuring transparency is proposed, which presents three main qualities: 1) Controller independency 2) Frequency dependency of performance and 3) Removal of the human operator out of the loop. In order to achieve this, the human operator is replaced by a linear actuator equipped with a force sensor. Deterministic interactions between the simulated operator and the rest of the system can thus be easily implemented and registered. Therefore, this approach allows to isolate pure effects of any control method and perform a proper analysis in terms of selected attributes for a desired metrics. In this article, these are chosen to be effective impedance and position tracking error, both in the frequency domain. In addition to the quantitative results, a qualitative analysis is presented which underlines practical implications of each architecture and control method. The comparison sample presented contains five different delays, varying from 0 to 200 milliseconds, five different environmental impedances and 5 bilateral control architectures along with an analysis of the results obtained.",

Such an evaluation method is not only needed to compare different avoidance methods, but also to determine the operational limits of autonomous systems. This work proposes an evaluation framework which can find such limits. The framework comprises two types of tests: detection tests and avoidance tests. For each type, both environment and performance metrics need to be defined. For detection tests such metrics are well known, but for avoidance tests such metrics are not readily available. Therefore a new set of metrics is proposed. The framework is applied to a UAV that uses stereo vision to detect obstacles. Three different avoidance methods are compared in environments of varying difficulty.",

        "abstract": "Despite the existence of powerful formal languages for writing robot controllers, most existing functional modules are written using standard programming languages. The existence of such a code base raises critical challenges: 1. How to enable automated analysis, monitoring, and reuse of existing code given that reasoning directly about code fragments is impractical. 2. How to convey to users the expected level of performance of an autonomous robot? 3. Perhaps most crucial: how to quickly identify abnormal behavior of autonomous robots? This is a key impediment to the deployment of such platforms in open environments. We address these issues through the use of performance-level profiles (PLPs), a formal, yet intuitive, language for specifying the expected properties of functional modules, designed with the above aims in mind. PLPs are motivated by action specification languages, such as PDDL 2.1, but add novel elements important for robotic applications, such as update frequency, run-time statistics, progress measures, and trigger conditions, and take into account the different roles modules can play. PLPs have been used to support monitoring in two projects: an autonomous compact track loader, and a service robot. Additionally, we developed a number of tools for automated monitoring-code generation from PLPs.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a comparison of the five observability indices used for robot calibration. The comparison is realized in order to determine the most appropriate observability index, which allows for the best parameter identification of a calibrated robot, and therefore leading to the best improvement of the robot accuracy. In this study, the accuracy analysis is based on the robot end-effector errors, which are expressed in term of Euclidean errors. The parameter identification process is based on minimizing the residual of the position errors. The actual values of these positions are usually measured by an external measurement device and have measurement noise. The position residuals are calculated in all the calibration configurations, which are selected by using observability indices. An optimal set of configurations is the one reducing the impact of the measurement noise on the parameter identification efficacy. Our study is carried out for the calibration of four robots: two degrees of freedom (DOF) and 6-DOF serial robots, and 2-DOF and 3-DOF planar parallel robots. The comparison of the observability indices was achieved through a Monte Carlo simulation, using 100 different cases for each of the four robots considered. The position measurement noise was assumed to be within a range of \u00b1 200 \u03bcm. Investigations led to conclude that there is a specific index that may be considered the best observability index for robot calibration. Finally, an experimental study has been applied to a LR Mate 200ic FANUC robot and confirms the simulated results.",

The perpendicular accuracy of holes during drilling is crucial one of all the factors influencing the quality of holes. In order to improve the perpendicular accuracy during drilling, this paper presented an attitude adjustment mechanism and attitude adjustment algorithm for the end effector. For the mechanism, it adjusts the drill bit attitude by using double eccentric discs and a spherical pair. After the surface normal vector at drilling point is obtained, double eccentric discs will rotate define angels calculated by using attitude adjustment algorithm based on the shortest time principle to achieve the coincidence of the surface normal vector and the drill bit axis vector if the angle between the normal vector and drill bit axis vector is greater than 0.5\u00b0. To demonstrate the method mentioned above, simulation and experiment are carried out on the aeronautical drilling robot. The results show that the attitude adjustment mechanism and attitude adjustment algorithm can increase the perpendicular accuracy of holes during drilling and satisfy the demand in automatic aircraft assembly.",

A computer vision and control strategy is applied to a diverse set of moving objects (e.g. humans, animals, cars, boats, etc.) integrating multiple UAVs with a stabilized RGB camera. A novel strategy is employed to successfully track objects over a long period, by \u2018handing over the camera\u2019 from one UAV to another. We evaluate several state-of-the-art trackers on the VIVID aerial video dataset and additional sequences that are specifically tailored to low altitude UAV target tracking. Based on the evaluation, we select the leading tracker and improve upon it by optimizing for both speed and performance, integrate the complete system into an off-the-shelf UAV, and obtain promising results showing the robustness of our solution in real-world aerial scenarios.",

The core of the system is a spatio-temporal occupancy grid that explicitly represents the persistence and periodicity of the individual cells and can predict the probability of their occupancy in the future. During navigation, our robot builds temporally local maps and integrates then into the global spatio-temporal grid. Through re-observation of the same locations, the spatio-temporal grid learns the long-term environment dynamics and gains the ability to predict the future environment states. This predictive ability allows to generate time-specific 2d maps used by the robot's localisation and planning modules. By analysing data from a long-term deployment of the robot in a human-populated environment, we show that the proposed representation improves localisation accuracy and the efficiency of path planning. We also show how to integrate the method into the ROS navigation stack for use by other roboticists.",

The proposed algorithm computes trajectories in a multi-robot context to ensure a collision-free exchange, even where congestion is a concern. The quality of the resulting trajectories is determined by the amount of time spent deviating from the original plan while maintaining collision-free, speed-limited polynomial splines. The algorithm is shown through simulation and experiments to be viable with average deviation time gaps of less than 16 seconds and average computation times of under 3 minutes for the presented scenarios with varying numbers of robots and deployment specifications.",

This works on task-planning level, abstracts from motion planning and anticipates the dynamics of the scene using a physics simulation. Instead of avoiding interaction with the environment, we take unintended motion of other objects into account and plan manipulation sequences which minimize the potential damage. Our method can also be used as a validation measure to judge planned motions for their feasibility in terms of damage avoidance. We evaluate our approach on one industrial scenario (autonomous container unloading) and one retail scenario (shelf replenishment).",

Available solutions rely on a rough folding surface or on a comprehensive simulation, both preventing the garment from slipping on the table during folding. This paper proposes a new algorithm for a folding path design respecting the garment material properties and preventing the garment slipping. The folding path is derived based on the equilibrium of forces under the simplifying assumptions of a rectangular and homogeneous garment. This approach allows folding the rectangular garment on a low friction table surface as we demonstrated in the experiments performed by a dual-arm robotic testbed.",

We build up on our previous work and propose an improved approach. While preserving its main modules (mapping, planning and mission handler), the framework now considers motion constraints to plan feasible paths, i.e., those that meet vehicle's motion capabilities. The new framework also incorporates a risk function to avoid navigating close to nearby obstacles, and reuses the last best known solution to eliminate time-consuming pruning routines. To evaluate this approach, we use the Sparus II AUV, a torpedo-shaped vehicle performing autonomous missions in a 2-dimensional workspace. We validate the framework's new features by solving tasks in both simulation and real-world in-water trials and comparing results with our previous approach.",

As a result, the implemented procedure gives an optimal release configuration, temporal control torque profiles satisfying dynamic constraints, and optimal stiffness coefficients for compliant joints. Computational complexity of the nonlinear optimization task was reduced applying a novel motion parametrization method. The proposed method was illustrated for a particular example and experimentally verified with the KUKA LWR4+ arm.",

        "abstract": "Although Point Clouds Registration is a very well studied problem, with many different solutions, most of the approaches in the literature aims at aligning two dense point clouds. Instead, we tackle the problem of aligning a dense point cloud with a sparse one: a problem that has to be solved, for example, to merge maps produced by different sensors, such as a vision-based sensor and laser scanner or two different laser-based sensors. The most used approach to point clouds registration, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), is also applicable to this sub-problem. We propose an improvement over the standard ICP data association policy and we called it Probabilistic Data Association. It was derived applying statistical inference techniques on a fully probabilistic model. In our proposal, each point in the source point cloud is associated with a set of points in the target point cloud; each association is then weighted so that the weights form a probability distribution. The result is an algorithm similar to ICP but more robust w.r.t. noise and outliers. While we designed our approach to deal with the problem of dense-sparse registration, it can be successfully applied also to standard point clouds registration.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to investigate the problem of how to best combine and fuse color and depth measurements for incremental pose estimation or 3D tracking. Subsequently a framework will be proposed that allows to formulate the problem with a unique measurement vector and not to combine them in an ad-hoc manner. In particular, the full color and depth measurement will be defined as a 4-vector (by combining 3D Euclidean points + image intensities) and an optimal error for pose estimation will be derived from this. As will be shown, this will lead to designing an iterative closest point approach in 4 dimensional space. A kd-tree is used to find the closest point in 4D-space, therefore simultaneously accounting for color and depth. Based on this unified framework a novel Point-to-hyperplane approach will be introduced which has the advantages of classic Point-to-plane ICP but in 4D-space. By doing this it will be shown that there is no longer any need to provide or estimate a scale factor between different measurement types. Consequently, this allows to increase the convergence domain and speed up the alignment, whilst maintaining the robust and accurate properties. Results on both simulated and real environments will be provided along with benchmark comparisons.",

        "abstract": "Reliable autonomous navigation is still a challenging problem for robots with simple and inexpensive hardware. A key difficulty is the need to maintain an internal map of the environment and an accurate estimate of the robot's position in this map. Recently, a stigmergic approach has been proposed in which a navigation map is stored into the environment, on a grid of RFID tags, and robots use it to optimally reach predefined goal points without the need for internal maps. While effective, this approach is limited to a predefined set of goal points. In this paper, we extend this approach to enable robots to travel to any point on the RFID floor, even if it was not previously identified as a goal location, as well as to keep a safe distance from any given critical location. Our approach produces safe, repeatable and quasi-optimal trajectories without the use of internal maps, self localization, or path planning. We report experiments run in a real apartment equipped with an RFID floor, in which a service robot either reaches or avoids a user who wears slippers equipped with an RFID tag reader.",

        "abstract": "Localization is a key capability for autonomous vehicles especially in urban scenarios. We propose the use of pole-like landmarks as primary features in these environments, as they are distinct, long-term stable and can be detected reliably with a stereo camera system. Furthermore, the resulting map representation is memory efficient, allowing for easy storage and on-line updates. The localization is performed in real-time by a stereo camera system as a main sensor, using vehicle odometry and an off-the-shelf GPS as secondary information sources. Localization is performed by a particle filter approach, coupled with an Kalman filter for robustness and sensor fusion. This leads to a lateral accuracy below 20 cm in various urban test areas. The system has been included in our autonomous test vehicle and successfully demonstrated the full loop from mapping to autonomous driving.",

        "abstract": "Existing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are not robust in challenging low-texture environments because there are only few salient features. The resulting sparse or semi-dense map also conveys little information for motion planning. Though some work utilize plane or scene layout for dense map regularization, they require decent state estimation from other sources. In this paper, we propose real-time monocular plane SLAM to demonstrate that scene understanding could improve both state estimation and dense mapping especially in low-texture environments. The plane measurements come from a pop-up 3D plane model applied to each single image. We also combine planes with point based SLAM to improve robustness. On a public TUM dataset, our algorithm generates a dense semantic 3D model with pixel depth error of 6.2 cm while existing SLAM algorithms fail. On a 60 m long dataset with loops, our method creates a much better 3D model with state estimation error of 0.67%.",

The fusion design not only provides robust relative attitude estimation between the rigid body and the platform, but also is capable of identifying partial global absolute attitudes without capturing any absolute attitude information. The pose estimation is built on a special design of the coupled kinematic model with the relative measurements between the rigid body and its supporting platform. We compare the fusion design with an alternative kinematic model and the posterior Cramer-Rao bound analyses are presented to show the completely different estimation performances. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) implementation of the fusion design is presented for the bicycle riding application.",

Offering a complete solution: calibration, segmentation and pose estimation, along with approachability analysis for the estimated pose. The work is novel in the sense that the objects to be picked are featureless and uniformly black in colour, hence existing approaches are not directly applicable. A key point involves optimal utilization of range data acquired from the laser scanner for 3-D segmentation using localized geometric information. This information guides segmentation of the image for better object pose estimation, used for pick-and-drop. We analytically assure the approachability of the object to avoid collision of the manipulator with the bin. Disturbance of objects caused during pick up has been modelled, which allows pickup of multiple pellets based on information from a single range scan. This eliminates the necessity of repeated scanning and data conditioning. The proposed method offers high object detection rate and pose estimation accuracy. The innovative techniques aimed at reducing the average pickup time makes it suitable for robust industrial operation.",

        "abstract": "Automated driving relies on fast, recent, accurate, and highly available pose estimates. A single localization system, however, can commonly ensure this only to some extent. In this paper, we propose a multi-sensor fusion approach that resolves this by combining multiple localization systems in a plug and play manner. We formulate our approach as a sliding window pose graph and enforce a particular graph structure which enables efficient optimization and a novel form of marginalization. Our pose fusion approach scales from a filtering-based to a batch solution by increasing the size of the sliding window. We evaluate our approach on simulated data as well as on real data gathered with a prototype vehicle and demonstrate that our solution runs comfortably at 20 Hz, provides timely estimates, is accurate, and yields a high availability.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hierarchical pose graph optimization algorithm, which hierarchically divides a large pose graph into subgraphs and solves the optimization problem for each subgraph independently. Applying a modified graph partitioning algorithm, normalized cut, the original graph could be partitioned into subgraphs, which are conditionally independent on a set of key nodes. A modified normalized cut algorithm is applied to automatically partition a pose graph into several subgraphs, which are independent on each other when conditioned on a small number of keynodes. Preserving keynodes only, a simplified upper level graph is generated by a pose graph sparsification algorithm. Given the optimization results of all keynodes, which are obtained by solving the upper level graph, each subgraph in the lower level can be solved efficiently without concerning other subgraphs. The scale of each optimization is limited during graph partitioning. Therefore, the efficiency of the optimization is improved. Experiments with both public standard datasets and a dataset collected by an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system are conducted to test our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, bowden-cable transmissions have been developed and utilized widely in many robotic applications due to advantages in durability, lightweight, safety, and flexibility. Especially, over the last decade, a substantial number of soft wearable exoskeletons using bowden cables for motion transmission have been designed for human assistance, empowerment and rehabilitation. The major advantage of soft assistive devices driven by bowden-cable transmissions is to allow decentralizing the actuation stages proximally such that their mass has the least effect on the end-effector. Besides the advantage, the main drawback of the bowden cable-driven system comes from the presence of nonlinearities such as friction and backlash hysteresis that affects their control accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a mathematical model for backlash hysteresis and propose a solution based on the nonlinear adaptive control to compensate for the backlash effect. The backlash hysteresis model and control scheme are validated first on a custom-designed test bench and then applied to control a soft exoskeleton in a preliminary human trial.",

For those missions, sensors are equipped with helicopters in order to recognize the environment, and auditory information is one of such information that can be utilized to find the target sound source even if it is occluded by objects. One of the difficulty comes from the fact that the noise generated by rotating rotors distorts the target signal significantly, which leads inaccurate estimate of the target source direction. Besides, the estimate of the attitude and the position of the helicopter is inaccurate, which is another technical issue. This paper proposes a robust sound source position estimation taking such uncertainty into account, and experiment with real flight tests showed that the helicopter was able to estimate the target position within about 2m accuracy.",

While passive compliance can be achieved in numerous ways, this paper uses soft skin, as it does not require complex mechanisms and was easy to integrate in the robot hand (Allegro hand). Softness has proven to significantly ease object grasping, and the current paper shows the importance of softness also for in-hand manipulation. In particular, the simple interpolation strategy between various postures is successful when combined with soft fingertips, with or without force control, but fails with hard fingertips. Objects of varying size, shape and hardness were reliably manipulated. While the soft fingertips enabled good results in our experiments, a sufficiently precise definition of the postures and object size was required. When combining the interpolation control with a force control strategy, bigger errors in defining the posture and object size are possible, without deforming or dropping the object, and the resultant force is lower. As a result, we achieved robust in-hand manipulation between various postures and with objects of different size, shape and hardness.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a data-driven motion planning approach for interaction-aware, socially-compliant robot navigation among human agents. Autonomous mobile robots navigating in workspaces shared with human agents require motion planning techniques providing seamless integration and smooth navigation in such. Smooth integration in mixed scenarios calls for two abilities of the robot: predicting actions of others and acting predictably for them. The former requirement requests trainable models of agent behaviors in order to accurately forecast their actions in the future, taking into account their reaction on the robot's decisions. A human-like navigation style of the robot facilitates other agents\u2014most likely not aware of the underlying planning technique applied\u2014to predict the robot motion vice versa, resulting in smoother joint navigation. The approach presented in this paper is based on a feature-based maximum entropy model and is able to guide a robot in an unstructured, real-world environment. The model is trained to predict joint behavior of heterogeneous groups of agents from onboard data of a mobile platform. We evaluate the benefit of interaction-aware motion planning in a realistic public setting with a total distance traveled of over 4 km. Interestingly the motion models learned from human-human interaction did not hold for robot-human interaction, due to the high attention and interest of pedestrians in testing basic braking functionality of the robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the experimental validation of a novel control strategy that unifies the entire gait cycle of a powered knee-ankle prosthetic leg without the need to switch between controllers for different periods of gait. Current control methods divide the gait cycle into several sequential periods each with independent controllers, resulting in many patient-specific control parameters and switching rules that must be tuned for a specific walking speed. The single controller presented is speed-invariant with a minimal number of control parameters to be tuned. A single, periodic virtual constraint is derived that exactly characterizes the desired actuated joint motion as a function of a mechanical phase variable across walking cycles. A single sensor was used to compute a phase variable related to the residual thigh angle's phase plane, which was recently shown to robustly represent the phase of non-steady human gait. This phase variable allows the prosthesis to synchronize naturally with the human user for intuitive, biomimetic behavior. A custom powered knee-ankle prosthesis was designed and built to implement the control strategy and validate its performance. A human subject experiment was conducted across multiple walking speeds (1 to 3 miles/hour) in a continuous sequence with the single phase-based controller, demonstrating its adaptability to the user's intended speed.",

Our method combines two key insights: (1) a visual 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) pose estimation technique based on 2D-3D point correspondences is used to estimate the object pose in real-time and (2) the rigid transformation from the current to the nominal pose is computed online and the object is reoriented over a sequence of steps. The outcome of this work is a novel method that can be effectively used in the preparatory phase of a manipulation task, to permit a robot to start from arbitrary object placements and configure the manipulated objects to the nominal pose, as required for the execution of a subsequent task. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a full-size humanoid robot (WALK-MAN) using different objects with various pose settings under real-time constraints.",

LiDAR is used to generate a 3D map of the environment and to estimate the location of the sensor in six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). By combing these modules, our system determines the direction to a sound source in 3D global space for a moving robot. From evaluation of the time series of the tracked sound stream, the position of the sound source is estimated by using the Monte Carlo localization approach. When estimated from a moving robot, an approach based on triangulation does not always adequately locate a sound source, because the estimate depends on the relationship between the location of the source and that of the moving robot. The main advantage of the proposed system is that as an audible signal is perceived, it continuously estimates the location of the source. We evaluate the system by performing an experiment using a hand-held sensor.",

        "abstract": "Sound source localization (SSL) is an essential technique in many applications, such as robot audition, human-robot interaction and speech capturing. However, SSL from a binaural input is still a challenging problem, particularly when multiple sources are active simultaneously. In this work, we propose a multi-sources localization framework based on the time-delay compensation (TDC) estimator and clustering analysis. The TDC estimator is a simultaneous operator to estimate binaural cues, which breaks the limitation of independent processors for binaural cues extraction. The multi-sources decision is realized by clustering analysis for the binaural cues of multiple signal frames. In experiments, we demonstrate that the localization performance is improved compared to the methods that assume the number of spatial stationary sources to be known. Results with both simulated and recorded impulse responses show that robust performance can be achieved with limited prior training, and our method is also adaptive to different sound activities.",

        "abstract": "Learning sequential force interaction tasks from kinesthetic demonstrations is a promising approach to transfer human manipulation abilities to a robot. In this paper we propose a novel concept to decompose such demonstrations into a set of Movement Primitives (MPs). The decomposition is based on a probability distribution we call Directional Normal Distribution (DND). To capture the sequential properties of the manipulation task, we model the demonstrations with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Here, we employ mixtures of DNDs as the HMM's output emissions. The combination of HMMs and mixtures of DNDs allows to infer the MP's composition, i.e., its coordinate frames, control variables and target coordinates from the demonstration data. In addition, it permits to determine an appropriate number of MPs that explains the demonstrations best. We evaluate the approach on kinesthetic demonstrations of a light bulb unscrewing task. Decomposing the task leads to intuitive and meaningful MPs that reflect the natural structure of the task.",

It reliably segments objects in cluttered scenarios, even when objects are translucent, reflective, highly deformable, have fuzzy surfaces, or consist of loosely coupled components. The robust performance results from the exploitation of problem structure inherent to the warehouse setting. The proposed method proved its capabilities as part of our winning entry to the 2015 Amazon Picking Challenge. We present a detailed experimental analysis of the contribution of different information sources, compare our method to standard segmentation techniques, and assess possible extensions that further enhance the algorithm's capabilities. We release our software and data sets as open source.",

In order to extract the grinding parameters and strategy from the trajectory of the skilled operator, the manual tool-path is first segmented into tool-path primitives. The order of the manual tool-path primitives will form the grinding strategy. Next, the robotic tool-path primitives are then generated based on the boundaries of the manual tool-path primitive in a computer-aided-manufacturing software. The orientations of the manual tool-path are used to anchor the orientations of the robotic tool-path. Spherical linear interpolation and spherical spline quaternion interpolation are used to interpolate the orientations for the robotic tool-path points along the cross curves, followed by the flow curves respectively. The programmed robotic tool-paths generated were subsequently applied and proven to be able to grind the work-piece to the desired profile within the desired tolerance.",

        "abstract": "There are no mechanical harvesters for the fresh market apple industry commercially available. The absence of automated harvesting technology is a critical problem because of rising production costs and increasing uncertainty about future labor availability. This paper presents the preliminary design of a robotic apple harvester. The approach adopted was to develop a low-cost, `undersensed' system for modern orchard systems with fruiting wall architectures. A machine vision system fuses Circular Hough Transform and blob analysis to detect clustered and occluded fruit. The design includes a custom, six degree of freedom manipulator with an underactuated, passively compliant end-effector. After fruit localization, the system makes a linear approach to the apple and replicates the human picking process. Integrated testing of the robotic harvesting system has been completed in a laboratory environment with a replica apple tree for proof-of-concept demonstration. Experimental results show that the system picked 95 of the 100 fruit attempted with average localization and picking times of 1.2 and 6.8 seconds, respectively, per fruit. Additional work planned in preparation for field evaluation in a commercial orchard is also described.",

The muscles are roughly aligned in three directions, and by driving the muscles selectively, the octopus arm can perform multiple functions such as the contracting, bending, torsion and stiffness alteration. This study aims at the development of a new flexible robotic arm using thin McKibben actuators mimicking the muscle structure of an octopus arm. The McKibben actuator is a well-known pneumatic artificial muscle, and we have developed extremely thin McKibben actuators by using a braiding machine. In this paper, configuration of the flexible arm is proposed. The developed mechanism consists of thirty two thin McKibben actuators arranged in three directions, axial, radial and oblique, imitating the muscle structure of an actual octopus arm. The fundamental motion of the flexible arm is investigated experimentally. The proposed mechanism performs bending, contracting, torsion movements and stiffness alteration like an octopus arm.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots such as hexapods have the potential to traverse unstructured terrain. This paper introduces a novel hexapod robot (Weaver) using a hierarchical controller, with the ability to efficiently traverse uneven and inclined terrain. The robot has five joints per leg and 30 degrees of freedom overall. The two redundant joints improve the locomotion of the robot by controlling the body pose and the leg orientation with respect to the ground. The impedance controller in Cartesian space reacts to unstructured terrain and thus achieves self-stabilizing behavior without prior profiling of the terrain through exteroceptive sensing. Instead of adding force sensors, the force at the foot tip is calculated by processing the current signals of the actuators. This work experimentally evaluates Weaver with the proposed controller and demonstrates that it can effectively traverse challenging terrains and high gradient slopes, reduce angular movements of the body by more than 55% and reduce the cost of transport (up to 50% on uneven terrain and by 85% on a slope with 20 \u00b0). The controller also enables Weaver to walk up inclines of up to 30 \u00b0, and remain statically stable on inclines up to 50 \u00b0. Furthermore, we present a new metric for legged robot stability performance along with a method for proprioceptive terrain characterization.",

        "abstract": "One of the standing challenges in multi-robot systems is the ability to reliably coordinate motions of multiple robots in environments where the robots are subject to disturbances. We consider disturbances that force the robot to temporarily stop and delay its advancement along its planned trajectory which can be used to model, e.g., passing-by humans for whom the robots have to yield. Although reactive collision-avoidance methods are often used in this context, they may lead to deadlocks between robots. We design a multi-robot control strategy for executing coordinated trajectories computed by a multi-robot trajectory planner and give a proof that the strategy is safe and deadlock-free even when robots are subject to delaying disturbances. Our simulations show that the proposed strategy scales significantly better with the intensity of disturbances than the naive liveness-preserving approach. The empirical results further confirm that the proposed approach is more reliable and also more efficient than state-of-the-art reactive techniques.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a quasi-passive dynamic autonomous control (Q-PDAC) for a three-dimensional (3-D) bipedal gait of humanoid robots from start points to goal points. The major approach for 3-D traveling is currently footstep planning by a constantly stable gait with an emphasis on its accurate and secure traveling. However, energy would potentially be wasted when the robot accurately travels according to the planned footsteps. In contrast, a limit-cycle-based gait possesses the good efficiency by a gait speed control, although the accurate and secure traveling is difficult for it. Its gait speed control is unfortunately not enough to freely travel on 3-D spaces: shortages of a turning speed control, trackability of horizontal speed, and stability of the bipedal gait. Hence, the Q-PDAC supplies three proper angular momenta by hip and ankle joints to achieve the turning motion and enhance the trackability of horizontal motion. Three angular momenta are simply designed consistent in the PDAC dynamics, and achieved the sufficient gait speed control for 3-D traveling. As a result, the robot can efficiently travel from the start point to the goal point while following a leader point not to collide with walls.",

In this paper, we propose \u201cR-Crank\u201d, which has a simple four wheels driving configuration with crank links, connecting to ipsilateral front and rear wheels so as to form parallel four-bar linkage systems. The crank links act as legs because their trajectory with respect to the ground become trochoid curve, which is commonly used as leg trajectories for a legged robot. These links achieve high terrain adaptability while maintaining simple structure of the wheeled robot. We developed a prototype model and carried out basic experiments. The robot achieved to climb 0.3 m of a step(76.9% of the wheel diameter), stairs and a snowy slope. In addition, we propose amphibious structure of crank links by installing multiple rigid paddles. The propulsive force generated by the crank links was measured and empirically derived the optimum parameters by using a small-sized experimental apparatus. Finally the robot equipped with the amphibious crank links achieved propulsion on water at 0.13 m/s. We also verified that the robot achieved going up and into water through stairs.",

We utilize shape based representation using local shape context descriptors along with the voting strategy which is supported by unsupervised object proposals generated from 3D point cloud data. Our algorithm starts with a single-view object detection where object proposals generated in 3D space are combined with object specific hypotheses generated by the voting strategy. To tackle the multi-view setting, the data association between multiple views enabled view registration and 3D object proposals. The evidence from multiple views is combined in simple bayesian setting. The approach is evaluated on the Washington RGB-D scenes datasets [1], [2] containing several classes of objects in a table top setting. We evaluated our approach against the other state-of-the-art methods and demonstrated superior performance on the same dataset.",

Unlike most approaches, we propose a way to learn saliency maps directly on a robot, by exploring the environment, discovering salient objects using geometric cues, and learning their visual aspects. More importantly, we provide an autonomous exploration strategy able to drive the robot for the task of learning saliency. For that, we describe the Reinforcement Learning-Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity algorithm (RL-IAC), a mechanism based on IAC (Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity) able to guide the robot through areas of the space where learning progress is high, while minimizing the time spent to move in its environment without learning. We demonstrate first that our saliency approach is an efficient tool to generate relevant object boxes proposal in the input image and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art EdgeBoxes algorithm. Second, we show that RL-IAC can drastically decrease the required time for learning saliency compared to random exploration.",

It allows efficient on-line simultaneous planning and execution of non-holonomic trajectories and enables a robot to adapt to changes in the environment while taking into account robot motion uncertainty.

        "abstract": "With robotic systems reaching considerable maturity in basic self-localization and environment mapping, new research avenues open up pushing for interaction of a robot with its surroundings for added autonomy. However, the transition from traditionally sparse feature-based maps to dense and accurate scene-estimation imperative for realistic manipulation is not straightforward. Moreover, achieving this level of scene perception in real-time from a computationally constrained and highly shaky and agile platform, such as a small an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is perhaps the most challenging scenario for perception for manipulation. Drawing inspiration from otherwise computationally constraining Computer Vision techniques, we present a system combining visual, inertial and depth information to achieve dense, local scene reconstruction of high precision in real-time. Our evaluation testbed is formed using ground-truth not only in the pose of the sensor-suite, but also the scene reconstruction using a highly accurate laser scanner, offering unprecedented comparisons of scene estimation to ground-truth using real sensor data. Given the lack of any real, ground-truth datasets for environment reconstruction, our V4RL Dense Surface Reconstruction dataset is publicly available.",

The proposed framework is able to change its grasp strategies agilely according to the interaction with human. Given human demonstrations, we develop a motion field graph consisting of nodes and edges where the nodes contains reference finger poses and their time derivatives, and the edges indicates the similarity between a pair of nodes. Based on the graph, a new grasping motion can be planned that adapts to the changes of the environment and the interaction. The motion field guarantees smooth motions by integrating the velocities obtained from the demonstrations. To validate the framework, we build a demo system where a human can hand a cup over to a tele-operated robot or a virtual humanoid avatar which are controlled by an another person at a remote location. Also, the virtual avatar can grasp and manipulate a cola can.",

Right at the forefront are small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard cameras, recently demonstrating that vision-based autonomous flights without reliance on GPS are possible, sparking great interest in a plethora of areas. Current solutions, however, still lack in portability and generality struggling to perform outside the controlled laboratory environment, with onboard robotic perception constituting the biggest impediment. Driven by the need for real-time denser scene estimation, in this work we present a dramatically cheap approach enabling estimation of the immediate surroundings of a UAV using the inertial and visual cues from a single onboard camera. Instead of following the recent trend towards dense scene reconstruction, we trade detail of reconstruction for efficiency of estimation, albeit without compromising accuracy. We also present ETHZ CAB building dataset for aerial inspection. We present results against scene ground truth obtained by a millimetre-precise laser scanner.",

For each incoming image, our method first computes a relative depth map to estimate the obstacles nearby. Then, the map is segmented and the most promising Region of Interest (RoI) is identified. Finally, an escape direction is computed within the RoI and a control action is performed accordingly to avoid the obstacles. We tested our approach on a video sequence in a natural environment and compared it against a state-of-the-art method showing better performance, specially in light changing conditions. We also provide online results on a low-cost Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in a controlled environment.",

A novel multi-stage implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter is used to estimate the pose of every point along the manipulator's body using only the position information of each segment tip. Combined with a potential field, the overall algorithm will guide the manipulator tip to a desired target location and, at the same time, keep the manipulator body safe from collisions with obstacles. The results show that the approach works well in a real-time simulation environment that contains moving obstacles in the vicinity of the manipulator.",

For outdoor operation in real-world environments, 3D perception is often provided by sparse 3D LIDAR scanners, which provide accurate but low-density depth maps, and dense stereo approaches, which require significant computational resources for accurate results. Here, taking advantage of the complementary error characteristics of LIDAR range sensing and dense stereo, we present a probabilistic method for fusing sparse 3D LIDAR data with stereo images to provide accurate dense depth maps and uncertainty estimates in real-time. We evaluate the method on data collected from a small urban autonomous vehicle and the KITTI dataset, providing accuracy results competitive with state-of-the-art stereo approaches and credible uncertainty estimates that do not misrepresent the true errors, and demonstrate real-time operation on a range of low-power GPU systems.",

Only images are required as the input. The method mainly consists of feature-based object detection for joints of the UAV shell, outlier rejection based on a sample consensus (SAC) approach and the geometrical model of the shell, reconstruction of the entire region that the shell appears in, and inpainting of the shell. Not only a pure algorithm for general UAVs with passive rotating shells but also an implementation specialized for a UAV that we have been developing are presented. The successfully implemented algorithm was evaluated for actual inspection flights under different conditions. The average rate of successful image restoration was 81.1% at 4.3 fps.",

In this paper, we focus on the problem of 3D rotation estimation with dense depth sensors in environments that consist of piece-wise planar structures, such as corridors and office rooms. An efficient mean-shift paradigm is developed to extract and track planar modes in the surface normal vector distribution on the unit sphere. Robust and piece-wise drift-free behavior is achieved by registering the bundle of planar modes from the current frame with respect to a reference frame using a general \u21131-norm regression scheme. We furthermore add a memory scheme to the regular birth and death of modes, which further compensates accumulated rotational drift when previously discovered modes are revisited. We discuss the robustness issue and evaluate our algorithm on both custom synthetic as well as real publicly available datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate high robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

There are three problems for skating motion: (1) keeping dynamic balance, (2) adequately controlling foot force to suppress slipping at the foot, (3) controlling full-body motion in real-time. For solving these problems, we propose the Skating Motion Generator and the Skating Motion Stabilizer. In the Skating Motion Generator, we separate the slip suppression from motion generation for (3). The separation enables us to generate skating motions in real-time. In the Skating Motion Stabilizer, we adjust the sole pressure distribution of each foot to solve the contradiction between (1) and (2). We show the effectiveness of the proposed controller through the experiments, in which life-sized humanoid HRP-2 pushes the ground and skates on the skateboard. Applying the proposed controller, HRP-2 could successfully accelerate and skate on the skateboard at 0.5[m/s].",

        "abstract": "Localization of a human or a robot in indoor environment prior to initial human-robot interaction is the motivation of this paper. The utilization of Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) by adopting fingerprinting technique is used to compute the location estimation. However, Wi-Fi RSS instability incurred by mutable channel characteristics hampers a wide-spread adoption of RSS based location fingerprinting to real world applications. To overcome RSS instability problem, we propose a new method based on the concept of \u201cinvariant RSS statistics\u201d, where it is defined as the RSS samples collected at each calibration location under minimal random spatiotemporal disturbances. The invariant RSS statistics thus collected forms the reference pattern classes in the space formed by Wi-Fi sources. Fingerprinting is done by identifying the reference pattern class that maximally supports the RSS readings collected at an unknown location for available Wi-Fi sources. The support of RSS readings is defined here as the sum of the likelihood probabilities of individual RSS readings. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides superior performance to conventional ones with the success rate higher by 17%, the printing resolution finer by 30% and, naturally, no performance degradation in time without recalibration. Lastly, we present a design guideline that relates statistically the different levels of the random spatiotemporal disturbances inducing RSS instability to the minimum number of Wi-Fi sources required for achieving a certain class separation degree under the given number of calibration locations to be identified.",

This Continuum Reconfigurable Incisionless Surgical Parallel (CRISP) paradigm involves the use of multiple needle-diameter devices inserted through the skin and assembled into parallel structures inside the body. The parallel structure can be reconfigured inside the patient's body to satisfy changing task requirements such as reaching initially inaccessible locations or modifying mechanical stiffness for manipulation or palpation. Another potential advantage of the CRISP concept is that many small (needle-sized) entry points into the patient may be preferable in terms of both patient healing and cosmesis to the single (or multiple) larger ports needed to admit current surgical robots. This paper presents a mechanics-based model for CRISP forward and inverse kinematics, along with experimental validation.",

In this paper, a novel, accurate, robust and recoverable real-time feature-based tracking framework is presented. The appearance modelling consists of a local and global layer. We propose a recommended keypoint-aware (RKA) tracker, which is fast and accurate, for the former, while the latter employs support vector machine (SVM) to determine the object and background, so that the RKA tracker can be recovered under possible target losing circumstances. Furthermore, the RKA tracker converts the tracking problem into the ranking of samples which provides a score of tracking confidence. Therefore, the priority switching between the local layer and global layer dependent upon the score becomes valid. Extensive experiments have been done by strictly following the visual tracking benchmark v1.0 protocol. The results demonstrate that the proposed novel method outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness, speed and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Multi-concept visual classification is emerging as a common environment perception technique, with applications in autonomous mobile robot navigation. Supervised visual classifiers are typically trained with large sets of images, hand annotated by humans with region boundary outlines followed by label assignment. This annotation is time consuming, and unfortunately, a change in environment requires new or additional labeling to adapt visual perception. The time is takes for a human to label new data is what we call adaptation latency. High adaptation latency is not simply undesirable but may be infeasible for scenarios with limited labeling time and resources. In this paper, we introduce a labeling framework to the environment perception domain that significantly reduces adaptation latency using unsupervised learning in exchange for a small amount of label noise. Using two real-world datasets we demonstrate the speed of our labeling framework, and its ability to collect environment labels that train high performing multi-concept classifiers. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of this label collection process for visual perception as it applies to navigation in outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "In most 6 DOF robot arms, considerable amounts of gravitational torques due to the robot's own weight are applied to pitch joints of the robot, which causes most arms to use high capacity motors and speed reducers. A spring-based counterbalance mechanism can compensate for this gravitational torque, thus leading to a significant reduction in the effect of gravity. However, a simple installation of counterbalance mechanisms at each pitch joint does not work properly because the gravitational torque at each joint is dependent also on the other joints. To achieve multi-DOF counterbalancing, we propose a parallelogram linkage combined with dual counterbalance mechanisms, each being composed of a slider-crank mechanism and springs. Simulations and experimental results showed that the counterbalance robot arm based on the proposed counterbalance mechanisms effectively reduced the torques required to support the robot mass, thus allowing the prospective use of much smaller motors and speed reducers than traditional industrial robots.",

        "abstract": "For generating motions of robots, global search in configuration space is time consuming although it is sometimes indispensable (e.g. collision avoidance in complex environment). Our idea is to use global sampling algorithm not in the state space but in the task nullspace, which is the redundant degrees of freedom of the state space with respect to the task space. Because the task nullspace is smaller than the original search space (state space), fast global sampling is possible. For embedding this hidden task nullspace parameters, we propose a new deep-auto-encoder-based neural network structure. Our approach learns the map from task and task nullspace towards robot's state (Task-State Map, TSM). As the demonstration, the relationship between 28-dof joint angles (state) and the end-effector coordinates of all limbs (task) is learned, and egress postures and reaching postures are generated.",

Although COG viscoelasticity is based on the well-known kinematic relationship between joint stiffness and end-effector stiffness, it provides practical advantages for humanoid motion control. Once the feedback gain in the COG-ZMP model is designed using the control theory, COG viscoelasticity can be applied to directly transform it to joint viscoelasticity. The author names this method as resolved COG viscoelasticity control (RCVC). In particular, this paper proposes RCVC in which the null-space of the COG Jacobian is employed. The validity of the RCVC is verified by simulating whole-body dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Achieving resonance in flapping wings has been recognized as one of the most important principles to enhance power efficiency, lift generation, and flight control performance of high-frequency flapping wing micro air vehicles (MAVs). Most of work on the development of such vehicles have attempted to achieve wing flapping resonance. However, the theoretical understanding of its effects on the response and energetics of flapping motion has lagged behind, leading to sub-optimal design decisions and misinterpretations of experimental results. In this work, we systematically model the dynamics of flapping wing as a forced nonlinear resonant system. Using linear approximation approach, we derived analytic solution for steady-state flapping amplitude, energetics, and characteristic frequencies including natural frequency, damped natural frequency, and peak frequency. Our results showed that both aerodynamic lift and power efficiency are maximized by driving the wing at natural frequency, instead of other frequencies. Interestingly, the flapping velocity is maximized at natural frequency as well, which can lead to an easy experimental approach to identify natural frequency and validate the resonance design. Our models and analysis were validated with both simulations and experiments on ten different wings mounted a direct-motor-drive flapping wing MAV. The result can serve as a systematic design principle and guidance in the interpretations of empirical results.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of sound-source localization (SSL) with a robot head, which remains a challenge in real-world environments. In particular we are interested in locating speech sources, as they are of high interest for human-robot interaction. The microphone-pair response corresponding to the direct-path sound propagation is a function of the source direction. In practice, this response is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic transfer function (ATF) of the two microphones, and it is an important feature for SSL. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF from noisy and reverberant signals in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. First, the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation is adopted to accurately represent the impulse response of the microphone array, and the first coefficient of the CTF is mainly composed of the direct-path ATF. At each frequency, the frame-wise speech auto- and cross-power spectral density (PSD) are obtained by spectral subtraction. Then a set of linear equations is constructed by the speech auto- and cross-PSD of multiple frames, in which the DP-RTF is an unknown variable, and is estimated by solving the equations. Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequencies and used as a feature vector for SSL. Experiments with a robot, placed in various reverberant environments, show that the proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art methods.",

Analyzing the dynamics at point level helps in inferring the fine-grained details of motion. We show results on multiple sequences of the KITTI odometry dataset, where we seamlessly estimate multiple motions pertaining to different dynamic objects. Furthermore, we test our approach on a dataset with pedestrians to show how our method adapts to a case with non-rigid motion. For comparison we use the ground truth from KITTI and show how our method outperforms different ICP-based methods.",

In this paper, we relate the idea of traversability to safety and ease of road usage by defining a novel sensor-data driven metric called Road Traversability Index (RTI). The RTI translate the geometric interaction of vehicle with road into a distance modulated index that can be used as advice for a human driver or an autonomous agent intending to traverse a particular road segment using a specific vehicle. We present a framework in which 3D sensor data is converted into a road model, which in turn is converted into a roadmap based motion planning graph to represent the underlying configuration space. The RTI is defined as a function of the roadmap by axiomatically satisfying all required properties of road traversability. We have tested our algorithmic framework on simulated scenarios to explore safety; and real-world data sets to discover aspects of traversability for vehicles of various types. Experimental results show that RTI is a practical tool that reveals information that may be hidden to human inspection or other methods of assessment that do not explicitly model a vehicle.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robot capable of painting colorful pictures with a visual control system like human artists. It can use only five basic colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black) to mix a variety of colors. After receiving a picture, the Robot Artist creates the artwork in two stages\u2014the underpainting and the refinement. In the underpainting stage, it covers the canvas with a thin layer of acrylic paint, which can effectively set the basic tone of the painting. In the second stage, the robot uses the camera attached to its wrist to obtain the current artwork and refine it repeatedly. During the refinement, the methodology of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) is also introduced to generate hand-painted strokes, which will be painted on the canvas to refine the artworks.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a particular case of a robot body design method which determines a degrees of freedom (DOFs) number and link parameters to maximize a target task performance. The DOFs number is an essential point to be considered in the robot body design problem. In this paper, the target task is to make a long throw, and multi DOFs ball throwing robot is designed. Design parameters are the robot body parameters and its motion pattern, and they are designed to maximize ball flying distance under long throw task conditions. To define the link lengths and the robot DOFs number as design parameters, it is assumed that intermediate links of the robot have identical actuators, and these link parameters are defined as functions of link lengths. These links are chained to construct the whole link system. Because of this assumption, the motion equation, which is utilized in the task conditions, is determined by the given robot DOFs number and link lengths. The proposed method was applied to the ball throwing robot model, and its body parameters and motion pattern were designed in the proposed calculation algorithm. As a result, 5 DOFs robot and its throwing motion were obtained, and the ball flying distance was maximized. The ball flying distance was changed along with the DOFs number, and the effectiveness of the proposed design method was demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Robots are at the position to become our everyday companions in the near future. Still, many hurdles need to be cleared to achieve this goal. One of them is the fact that robots are still not able to perceive some important communication cues naturally used by humans, e.g. gaze. In the recent past, eye gaze in robot perception was substituted by its proxy, head orientation. Such an approach is still adopted in many applications today. In this paper we introduce performance improvements to an eye tracking system we previously developed and use it to explore if this approximation is appropriate. More precisely, we compare the impact of the use of eye- or head-based gaze estimation in a human robot interaction experiment with the iCub robot and na\u00efve subjects. We find that the possibility to exploit the richer information carried by eye gaze has a significant impact on the interaction. As a result, our eye tracking system allows for a more efficient human-robot collaboration than a comparable head tracking approach, according to both quantitative measures and subjective evaluation by the human participants.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous self-assembly allows to create structures and scaffolds on demand and automatically. The desired structure may be predetermined or alternatively it is the result of an artificial growth process that adapts to environmental features and to the intermediate structure itself. In a self-organizing and decentralized control approach the robots interact only locally and form the structure collectively. Designing a complete approach that allows the robot group to collectively decide on where to start the self-assembly, that adapts at runtime to environmental conditions, and that guarantees the structural stability, is challenging and does not yet exist. We present an approach to self-assembly inspired by diffusion-limited aggregation that generates an adaptive structure reacting to environmental conditions in an artificial growth process. During a preparatory stage the robots collectively decide where to start the self-assembly also depending on environmental conditions. In the actual self-assembly stage, the robots create tree-like structures that grow towards light. We report the results of robot self-assembly experiments with 50 Kilobots. Our results demonstrate how an adaptive growth process can be implemented in robots. We briefly describe our future work of how to extend the approach to a 3-d growth process and how robot self-assembly as an open-ended adaptive growth process opens up a multiplicity of future opportunities.",

        "abstract": "Due to the faster-is-slower phenomenon in emergency escape, it is desirable to regulate pedestrian flow at the exit or a bottleneck. Modification of pedestrian facilities was previously studied to increase the efficiency and safety by the transportation community. We propose a robot-assisted pedestrian regulation scheme and study passive human-robot interaction (HRI), where the robot acts as a dynamic obstacle that interacts with pedestrians. Such a robot-assisted solution replaces expensive infrastructure modification with real-time reconfigurability. In the paper, we first formulate a robot-assisted flow optimization problem based on the social force models of pedestrian dynamics with embedded HRI forces. We then present an online learning algorithm based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to generate motion control so that the robot can replan and adapt its motion to real-time pedestrian flows. The ADP control process uses observed flow information only but not the models of pedestrians, and provides feedback control with online learning and control capability. Simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recent works of non-rigid registration have shown promising applications on tasks of deformable manipulation. Those approaches use thin plate spline-robust point matching (TPS-RPM) algorithm to regress a transformation function, which could generate a corresponding manipulation trajectory given a new pose/shape of the object. However, this method regards the object as a bunch of discrete and independent points. Structural information, such as shape and length, is lost during the transformation. This limitation makes the object's final shape to differ from training to test, and can sometimes cause damage to the object because of excessive stretching. To deal with these problems, this paper introduces a tangent space mapping (TSM) algorithm, which maps the deformable object in the tangent space instead of the Cartesian space to maintain structural information. The new algorithm is shown to be robust to the changes in the object's pose/shape, and the object's final shape is similar to that of training. It is also guaranteed not to overstretch the object during manipulation. A series of rope manipulation tests are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Current methods still either require a substantial amount of (supervised) training data and / or strong assumptions on both the environment and the task. In this paradigm, controllers solving these tasks tend to be complex. We propose a paradigm of maintaining simpler controllers solving the task in a small number of specific situations. In order to generalize to novel situations, the robot transforms the environment from novel situations into a situation where the solution of the task is already known. Our solution to this problem is to play with objects and use previously trained skills (basis skills). These skills can either be used for estimating or for changing the current state of the environment and are organized in skill hierarchies. The approach is evaluated in complex pick-and-place scenarios that involve complex manipulation. We further show that these skills can be learned by autonomous playing.",

In order to cover also the docking phase, both robots are equipped with force-torque sensors, and the measured forces and torques are taken to compute the desired motion of the position controlled robots. Since the system dynamics of robots and of free floating bodies obviously differ, for each robot we distinguish between the really executed and the assumed satellite motion. The difference between the two motions is used to adapt the measured forces in such a way that they correspond to the satellite's trajectory. In this way the docking procedure can be visualized by two robots which closely follow the satellites' trajectories. Stability of the robot control is not compromised even if the dynamics of the satellites and the robots are totally different. Simulation results verify the approach.",

This paper contributes with a method to explicitly account for different sources of uncertainty. We also suggest a computational efficient way to consistently modify the constraint specification in order to obtain such robustness. An experimental verification on a visual aided grasping task, where visibility of the object is to be maintained, enlightens the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of achieving the desired robustness.",

        "abstract": "To enable robust dynamic walking on the Atlas robot, we extend our previous work by adding a receding-horizon component. The new controller consists of three hierarchies: a center of mass (CoM) trajectory planner that follows a sequence of desired foot steps, a receding-horizon controller that optimizes the next foot placement to minimize future CoM tracking errors, and an inverse dynamics based full body controller that generates instantaneous joint commands to track these motions while obeying physical constraints. An approximate value function is generated by the CoM planner, and is used to guide the foot placement and inverse dynamics optimizations. The proposed controller is implemented and tested on the Atlas robot. It is capable of walking with strong external perturbations such as recovering from large pushes and traversing unstructured terrain.",

Due to the computational constraints, the required robustness and reliability, it remains a challenge to deploy a fixed-wing UAV with an online-capable, accurate and robust map generation framework. While photogrammetric approaches have underlying assumptions on the structure and the view of the camera, generic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches are computationally demanding. This paper presents a framework that uses the autopilot's state estimate as a prior for sliding window bundle adjustment and map generation. Our approach outputs an accurate geo-referenced dense point-cloud which was validated in simulation on a synthetic dataset and on two real-world scenarios based on ground control points.",

Our convolutional deep learning network architecture, which we also present here, is directly fed with the raw 24000 dimensional sensor signal and performs best by a large margin, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 97.3%.",

        "abstract": "To enable safe motion planning in a dynamic environment, it is vital to anticipate and predict object movements. In practice, however, an accurate object identification among multiple moving objects is extremely challenging, making it infeasible to accurately track and predict individual objects. Furthermore, even for a single object, its appearance can vary significantly due to external effects, such as occlusions, varying perspectives, or illumination changes. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent network architecture called a recurrent flow network that can infer the velocity of each cell and the probability of future occupancy from a sequence of occupancy grids which we refer to as an occupancy flow. The parameters of the recurrent flow network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. The proposed method outperforms three baseline optical flow methods, Lucas-Kanade, Lucas-Kanade with Tikhonov regularization, and HornSchunck methods, and a Bayesian occupancy grid filter in terms of both prediction accuracy and robustness to noise.",

Two fields of study are dealt with in this paper: motion planning and slip estimation. For the motion planner, the CC-RRT* algorithm is combined with LQG-MP. The motion planner uses a chance-constrained approach and considers the role of compensator in the planning step to provide a robust yet non-conservative planner. For the slip estimator, a stable yet practical online approach known as IPEM is used. IPEM compares the integrated prediction with the measurement to calculate appropriate parameters. The methodology performs online slip estimation and re-planning iteratively. This guarantees the safe travel of the vehicle even when there is an unexpected terrain change that can be fatal. The simulation result shows that the iterative estimation and re-planning plays a significant role in ensuring the safety of the vehicle.",

Many works focus on changes detection in previously observed scenes, while a very limited amount of literature addresses moving objects detection. The state-of-the-art method exploits Dempster-Shafer Theory to evaluate the occupancy of a lidar scan and to discriminate points belonging to the static scene from moving ones. In this paper we improve both speed and accuracy of this method by discretizing the occupancy representation, and by removing false positives through visual cues. Many false positives lying on the ground plane are also removed thanks to a novel ground plane removal algorithm. Efficiency is improved through an octree indexing strategy. Experimental evaluation against the KITTI public dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach, both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to the state-of-the-art.",

It is vital for robots to track objects accurately in real time in these applications, so it is necessary to focus on tracking algorithms to improve the robustness, speed and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a real-time robust object tracking algorithm based on a hierarchical ensemble framework which incorporates information including individual pixel features, local patches and holistic target models. The framework combines multiple ensemble models simultaneously instead of using a single ensemble model individually. A discriminative model which accounts for the matching degree of local patches is adopted via a bottom ensemble layer, and a generative model which exploits holistic templates is used to search for the object based on the middle ensemble layer as well as an adaptive Kalman filter. We test the proposed tracker on challenging benchmark image sequences. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art algorithms, especially when the appearance changes dramatically and the occlusions occur.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates sound source mapping in a real environment using a mobile robot. Our approach is based on audio ray tracing which integrates occupancy grids and sound source localization using a laser range finder and a microphone array. Previous audio ray tracing approaches rely on all observed rays and grids. As such observation errors caused by sound reflection, sound occlusion, wall occlusion, sounds at misdetected grids, etc. can significantly degrade the ability to locate sound sources in a map. A three-layered selective audio ray tracing mechanism is proposed in this work. The first layer conducts frame-based unreliable ray rejection (sensory rejection) considering sound reflection and wall occlusion. The second layer introduces triangulation and audio tracing to detect falsely detected sound sources, rejecting audio rays associated to these misdetected sounds sources (short-term rejection). A third layer is tasked with rejecting rays using the whole history (long-term rejection) to disambiguate sound occlusion. Experimental results under various situations are presented, which proves the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Two robust kinematic controllers for position trajectory tracking of a perturbed wheeled mobile robot are presented. We address a final objective of fixed-time pose-regulation, which means that the robot position and orientation must reach desired final values simultaneously in a user-defined time. To achieve that, we propose the robust tracking of adequate trajectories for position, which drives the robot to get a desired final orientation due to the nonholonomic motion constraint. Hence, the main contribution of the paper is a complete strategy to define adequate reference trajectories as well as robust controllers to track them in order to enforce the pose-regulation of a wheeled mobile robot in a desired time. Realistic simulations show the good performance of the proposed scheme even in the presence of strong disturbances.",

        "abstract": "Having a team of robots to perform a task such as mapping is faster and more reliable than doing the same with a single robot, which can be crucial in scenarios such as search and rescue. We are developing a fully distributed framework for collaborative mapping with large robot swarms that is robust to abrupt departure of robots due to malfunctions or network problems. While several approaches to multi-robot mapping have been proposed, most of them either build a collection of local sub-maps, or rely on a central authority to merge maps built by individual robots. Our framework is unique in that it requires no central authority, yet allows robots to simultaneously contribute to a single global map, which is stored in a decentralized fashion. This greatly improves the scalability of our system with respect to number of robots. However, our approach requires systematic coordination among robots in order to make modifications to the map. Unannounced departure of the robots makes coordination challenging, and can potentially make the map inconsistent or result in loss of data. We borrow ideas from the domain of distributed computing to address those challenges. Further, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed system by subjecting it to various conditions in which participating robots fail.",

        "abstract": "Mobile service robots have the potential to improve the efficiency of fruit production in orchards. One of the key tasks that such robots must perform is traversing the rows. Many of the past implementations of row following in orchards have been developed for rows where the trees appear like walls on both sides. Another orchard structure that is used is the pergola, where a sparse array of trunks and posts hold up a canopy, which resembles a ceiling. Navigation in pergola structured environments has received less attention. The variations in the pergola environment- including the presence of tall weeds, hanging branches, undulating terrain and varying geometry-make following the rows a challenging problem. This paper presents solutions for finding the row centreline in pergola structured environments, in the presence of real world variability. A 3D laser scanner is used to measure the positions of posts and trunks, amongst the other features in the pergola. From the extracted features, the mode gradient of nearest neighbours is used to find the row direction and hence the centreline. The practicality of the system is demonstrated by autonomously driving a mobile robot through over 5000 meters of a kiwifruit orchard with a pergola structure, using the row detection method. This method performs favourably compared to an existing method of row detection in kiwifruit orchards.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning in stochastic dynamic uncertain environments is critical in several applications such as human interacting robots, autonomous vehicles and assistive robots. In order to address these complex applications, several methods have been developed. The most successful methods often predict future obstacle locations in order identify collision-free paths. Since prediction can be computationally expensive, offline computations are commonly used, and simplifications such as the inability to consider the dynamics of interacting obstacles or possible stochastic dynamics are often applied. Online methods can be preferable to simulate potential obstacle interactions, but recent methods have been restricted to Gaussian interaction processes and uncertainty. In this paper we present an online motion planning method, Runtime Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (Runtime SES) planning, an inexpensive method for predicting obstacle motion with generic stochastic dynamics while maintaining a high planning success rate despite the potential presence of obstacle position error. Runtime SES planning evaluates the likelihood of collision for any state-time coordinate around the robot by performing Monte Carlo simulations online. This prediction is used to construct a customized Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) in order to quickly identify paths that avoid obstacles while moving toward a goal. We demonstrate Runtime SES planning in problems that benefit from online predictions, environments with strongly-interacting obstacles with stochastic dynamics and positional error. Through experiments that explore the impact of various parametrizations, robot dynamics and obstacle interaction models, we show that real-time capable planning with a high success rate is achievable in several complex environments.",

        "abstract": "Mapping and self-localization in unknown environments are fundamental capabilities in many robotic applications. These tasks typically involve the identification of objects as unique features or landmarks, which requires the objects both to be detected and then assigned a unique identifier that can be maintained when viewed from different perspectives and in different images. The data association and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problems are, individually, well-studied in the literature. But these two problems are inherently tightly coupled, and that has not been well-addressed. Without accurate SLAM, possible data associations are combinatorial and become intractable easily. Without accurate data association, the error of SLAM algorithms diverge easily. This paper proposes a novel nonparametric pose graph that models data association and SLAM in a single framework. An algorithm is further introduced to alternate between inferring data association and performing SLAM. Experimental results show that our approach has the new capability of associating object detections and localizing objects at the same time, leading to significantly better performance on both the data association and SLAM problems than achieved by considering only one and ignoring imperfections in the other.",

Fixed-wing small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) typically have difficulty surveying at low altitudes while quadrotor UAVs, having more maneuverability, suffer from limited flight time. Recent prior work [1] proposes a solar-powered small-scale aerial vehicle designed to transform between fixed-wing and quad-rotor configurations. Surplus energy collected and stored while in a fixed-wing configuration is utilized while in a quad-rotor configuration. This paper presents an improvement to the robot's design in [1] by pursuing a modular airframe, an optimization of the hybrid propulsion system, and solar power electronics. Two prototypes of the robot have been fabricated for independent testing of the airframe in fixed-wing and quad-rotor states. Validation of the solar power electronics and hybrid propulsion system designs were demonstrated through a combination of simulation and empirical data from prototype hardware.",

In this paradigm, a team of robots at fixed start positions must navigate to pre-specified and noninterchangable goal positions. While many algorithms have been proposed for finding optimal solutions to this problem, most methods assume that the robots are kinematic agents, whereas in reality, robots often have high-order dynamics that must be respected by their trajectories. Here, we propose a centralized method for generating trajectories for teams of robots with general nth-order dynamics navigating to labeled goals. Our algorithm is safe and complete and additionally allows for decoupled optimization of each robot's trajectory as a Quadratic Program with linear constraints. We present simulation results for teams of up to 20 robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for safeguarding a mobile manipulator. To overcome the shortcomings of state-of-the-art safeguarding techniques, we present a dynamic approach capable of covering different situations and adapting itself to the situation at hand. The proposed approach is based on the continuous dynamic update of a safety field using both exteroceptive and proprioceptive data. The proprioceptive data are the platform velocity vector and the manipulator position; the exteroceptive data refers to the environment in which the mobile manipulator is moving, namely distances to obstacles acquired by laser scanners. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated in an industrial test case scenario in which the robot had to execute a fetch and carry task while safely coexisting with human workers. Experimental results proved that the use of dynamic protection fields allowed the robot to carry out its tasks with a significant reduction (about 50%) of the execution time.",

We contribute through establishing a novel connection between two major branches of robotics control research, that is, gradient-based methods such as DDP, and Monte Carlo methods such as path integral control (PI) that utilize random simulated trajectory rollouts. One of our key observations is that the Taylor-expansion, central to DDP, can be reformulated in terms of second-order statistics computed of the sampled trajectories. SaDDP makes few assumptions about the controlled system and works with black-box dynamics simulations with non-smooth contacts. Our simulation results show that the method outperforms PI and CMA-ES in both a simple linear-quadratic problem, and a multilink arm reaching task with obstacles.",

The proposed model-based approach makes use of iterative random sampling and a probabilistic potential-field method to generate candidate viewpoints in a non-deterministic manner. Combinatorial optimization is then applied to select the most suitable subset of these candidate viewpoints to complete the given visual inspection or shape reconstruction task. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a number of computational tests that compare its overall performance against two previous methods. A field-test is also performed to demonstrate the method's applicability in a real world UAV-based shape reconstruction task of an outdoor statue.",

For navigation and high-level behavior planning, the robots not only require a persistent 3D model of the static surroundings\u2014equally important, they need to perceive and keep track of dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose a method that incrementally fuses stereo frame observations into temporally consistent semantic 3D maps. In contrast to previous work, our approach uses scene flow to propagate dynamic objects within the map. Our method provides a persistent 3D occupancy as well as semantic belief on static as well as moving objects. This allows for advanced reasoning on objects despite noisy single-frame observations and occlusions. We develop a novel approach to discover object instances based on the temporally consistent shape, appearance, motion, and semantic cues in our maps. We evaluate our approaches to dynamic semantic mapping and object discovery on the popular KITTI benchmark and demonstrate improved results compared to single-frame methods.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for recognizing indoor scenes in object constellations that require object search by a mobile robot, as they cannot be captured from a single viewpoint. In our approach that we call Active Scene Recognition (ASR), robots predict object poses from learnt spatial relations that they combine with their estimates about present scenes. Our models for estimating scenes and predicting poses are Implicit Shape Model (ISM) trees from prior work [1]. ISMs model scenes as sets of objects with spatial relations in-between and are learnt from observations. In prior work [2], we presented a realization of ASR, limited to choosing orientations for a fixed robot head with an approach to search objects that uses positions and ignores types. In this paper, we introduce an integrated system that extends ASR to selecting positions and orientations of camera views for a mobile robot with a pivoting head. We contribute an approach for Next-Best-View estimation in object search on predicted object poses. It is defined on 6 DoF viewing frustums and optimizes the searched view, together with the objects to be searched in it, based on 6 DoF pose predictions. To prevent combinatorial explosion when searching camera pose space, we introduce a hierarchical approach to sample robot positions with increasing resolution.",

The microstructures are magnetized by the magnetic field at 3 T, and assembled by the magnetic self-assembly process. Biological cells were encapsulated in the microstructures and cultured to achieve high density of cells inside structures. The magnetized microstructures were assembled automatically.

We use a sensor suite consisting of multiple cameras and an IMU to maximize perceptual awareness of the surroundings and provide sufficient redundancy against sensor failures. Our approach starts with an online initialization procedure that simultaneously estimates the transformation between each camera and the IMU, as well as the initial velocity and attitude of the platform, without any prior knowledge about the mechanical configuration of the sensor suite. Based on the initial calibrations, a tightly-coupled, optimization-based, generalized multi-camera-inertial fusion method runs onboard the MAV with online camera-IMU calibration refinement and identification of sensor failures. Our approach dynamically configures the system into monocular, stereo, or other multi-camera visual-inertial settings, with their respective perceptual advantages, based on the availability of visual measurements. We show that even under random camera failures, our method can be used for feedback control of the MAVs. We highlight our approach in challenging indoor-outdoor navigation tasks with large variations in vehicle height and speed, scene depth, and illumination.",

        "abstract": "With the recent success of visual features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) in visual robot self-localization, it has become important and practical to address more general self-localization scenarios. In this paper, we address the scenario of self-localization from images with small overlap. We explicitly introduce a localization difficulty index as a decreasing function of view overlap between query and relevant database images and investigate performance versus difficulty for challenging cross-view self-localization tasks. We then reformulate the self-localization as a scalable bag-of-visual-features (BoVF) scene retrieval and present an efficient solution called PCA-NBNN, aiming to facilitate fast and yet discriminative correspondence between partially overlapping images. The proposed approach adopts recent findings in discriminativity preserving encoding of DCNN features using principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-domain scene matching using naive Bayes nearest neighbor distance metric (NBNN). We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed PCA-NBNN framework frequently achieves comparable results to previous DCNN features and that the BoVF model is significantly more efficient. We further address an important alternative scenario of \u201cself-localization from images with NO overlap\u201d and report the result.",

        "abstract": "We investigated different dense multirotor UAV traffic simulation scenarios in open 2D and 3D space, under realistic environments with the presence of sensor noise, communication delay, limited communication range, limited sensor update rate and finite inertia. We implemented two fundamental self-organized algorithms: one with constant direction and one with constant velocity preference to reach a desired target. We performed evolutionary optimization on both algorithms in five basic traffic scenarios and tested the optimized algorithms under different vehicle densities. We provide optimal algorithm and parameter selection criteria and compare the maximal flux and collision risk of each solution and situation. We found that i) different scenarios and densities require different algorithmic approaches, i.e., UAVs have to behave differently in sparse and dense environments or when they have common or different targets; ii) a slower-is-faster effect is implicitly present in our models, i.e., the maximal flux is achieved at densities where the average speed is far from maximal; iii) communication delay is the most severe destabilizing environmental condition that has a fundamental effect on performance and needs to be taken into account when designing algorithms to be used in real life.",

A self-supervised learning approach is proposed that combines a camera and a very small short-range proximity sensor to find the relation between the appearance of objects in camera images and their corresponding distances. The method is efficient enough to run real time on a small camera system that can be carried onboard a lightweight MAV of 19 g. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by computer simulations and by experiments with the real platform in flight.",

Our results gathered over more than 50 hours of real robot experiments indicate that the robot is able to predict the grasp outcome with 93% accuracy. In addition, the robot is able to improve the grasp success rate from 42% when randomly grasping an object to up to 97% when allowed to regrasp the object in case of a predicted failure.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses bird song analysis based on semi-automatic annotation. Research in animal behavior, especially with birds, would be aided by automated (or semiautomated) systems that can localize sounds, measure their timing, and identify their source. This is difficult to achieve in real environments where several birds may be singing from different locations and at the same time. Analysis of recordings from the wild has in the past typically required manual annotation. Such annotation is not always accurate or even consistent, as it may vary both within or between observers. Here we propose a system that uses automated methods from robot audition, including sound source detection, localization, separation and identification. In robot audition these technologies have typically been studied separately; combining them often leads to poor performance in real-time application from the wild. We suggest that integration is aided by placing a primary focus on spatial cues, then combining other features within a Bayesian framework. A second problem has been that supervised machine learning methods typically requires a pre-trained model that may require a large training set of annotated labels. We have employed a semi-automatic annotation approach that requires much less pre-annotation. Preliminary experiments with recordings of bird songs from the wild revealed that for identification accuracy our system outperformed a method based on conventional robot audition.",

        "abstract": "We present a semi-direct visual odometry algorithm for a fisheye-stereo camera. In a tracking thread, we simultaneously track oriented patches and estimate the camera pose. In a mapping thread, we estimate the coordinates and surface normal for each new patch to be tracked. Estimation of the surface normals allows us to track patches over a wide variety of viewpoints. In our algorithm, we do not make use of descriptors and robust descriptor matching to find patch correspondences. Instead, we use photoconsistency-based techniques to find patch correspondences. For tracking, we use sparse model-based image alignment to find the relative motion estimate, and feature alignment to find 2D-3D patch correspondences. For mapping, we use plane-sweeping stereo to find matching patches between stereo images. We also implement a state estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse inertial measurements and relative pose estimates from our visual odometry implementation. We run experiments in two different outdoor environments to validate our algorithm, and discuss the experimental results. Our implementation runs at an average of 42 Hz on a commodity Intel CPU. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other existing semi-direct visual odometry algorithm for a fisheye-stereo camera.",

This work proposes and tests a sensing system based on the changing mutual inductance of wire coils on bellows. A method for modeling the changes in mutual inductance between coils of tightly-packed wires is introduced. Changes in mutual inductance are measured through the self-inductance of a circuit made up of the coils in series. The self-inductance of the circuit measures the bellows bend-angle. The experiments show an approximately quadratic relationship between the bend angle and the measured inductance. From a bend angle of 121 \u00b0 to \u221267 \u00b0 the inductance of the circuit increases by 19 %. The bias-inducing effects of shear strain, torsional strain, non-uniform bending, and nearby metal are also explored.",

        "abstract": "There are many applications where domain-specific sensing, such as accelerometers, kinematics, or force sensing, provide unique and important information for control or for analysis of motion. However, it is not always the case that these sensors can be deployed or accessed beyond laboratory environments. For example, it is possible to instrument humans or robots to measure motion in the laboratory in ways that it is not possible to replicate in the wild. An alternative, which we explore in this paper, is to address situations where accurate sensing is available while training an algorithm, but for which only video is available for deployment. We present two examples of this sensory substitution methodology. The first variation trains a convolutional neural network to regress real-valued signals, including robot end-effector pose, from video. The second example regresses binary signals derived from accelerometer data which signifies when specific objects are in motion. We evaluate these on the JIGSAWS dataset for robotic surgery training assessment and the 50 Salads dataset for modeling complex structured cooking tasks. We evaluate the trained models for video-based action recognition and show that the trained models provide information that is comparable to the sensory signals they replace.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an approach to autonomous navigation using a state observer for sensor based control. In particular, we investigate the task of corridor following in the case of sensory failure (unreliable data) and/or loss of measurement. Our approach uses a virtual sensory frame to project laser rangefinder scans, and builds visual features (namely the position of the vanishing point and the orientation of the corridor median line) to be used in the control law. To insure a safe and smooth navigation even when those parameters cannot be extracted, we design a finite time state observer to estimate the visual features with the objective of maintaining an efficient control of the robot. Simulation and experimental tests validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a technique to efficiently solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for a class of stochastic affine nonlinear dynamical systems in high dimensions. The HJB solution provides a globally optimal controller to the associated dynamical system. However, the curse of dimensionality, commonly found in robotic systems, prevents one from solving the HJB equation naively. This work avoids the curse by representing the linear HJB equation using tensor decomposition. An alternating least squares (ALS) based technique finds an approximate solution to the linear HJB equation. A straightforward implementation of the ALS algorithm results in ill-conditioned matrices that prevent approximation to a high order of accuracy. This work resolves the ill-conditioning issue by computing the solution sequentially and introducing boundary condition rescaling. Both of these additions reduce the condition number of matrices in the ALS-based algorithm. A MATLAB tool, Sequential Alternating Least Squares (SeALS), that implements the new method is developed. The performance of SeALS is illustrated using three engineering examples: an inverted pendulum, a Vertical Takeoff and Landing aircraft, and a quadcopter with state up to twelve.",

Task and motion planning is a hard problem that is essential to long-horizon mobile manipulation. Many approaches divide the problem into two steps: a search for a task plan and task plan refinement to find a feasible trajectory. We apply sequential quadratic programming to jointly optimize over the parameters in a task plan (e.g., trajectories, grasps, put down locations). We provide two modifications that make our formulation more suitable to task and motion planning. We show how to use movement primitives to reuse previous solutions (and so save optimization effort) without trapping the algorithm in a poor basin of attraction. We also derive an early convergence criterion that lets us quickly detect unsatisfiable constraints so we can re-initialize their variables. We present experiments in a navigation amongst movable objects domain and show substantial improvement in cost over a backtracking refinement algorithm.",

Previously we had developed an event-driven controller for gait assistance [1]. We now simulate (or optimize) the gait assistance in ankle pathologies (e.g., weak dorsiflexion or plantarflexion). It is done by 1) utilizing the neuromuscular walking model, 2) parameterizing assistive torques for swing and stance legs, and 3) performing dynamic optimizations that takes into account the human-robot interactive dynamics. We evaluate the energy expenditures and walking parameters for the different gait types. Results show that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy comparing with the assistance of normal gait. Although we need further studies about the pathologies, our simulation model is feasible to design the gait assistance for the ankle muscle weaknesses.",

We adopt existing system identification techniques and show that, with appropriate model parameterization and control optimization, an iterative system identification framework can be effective for designing reference trajectories.

        "abstract": "Recent research in appearance-based mapping has introduced a diverse range of techniques to deal with environments under varying conditions. Common to almost all the existing methods is that they expect a supervised or offline training. Furthermore, some approaches match sequences, assuming constant velocity over the routes. This work addresses the challenges of appearance-based mapping in an online setup without making assumptions or acquiring prior knowledge of the environment. For this purpose, we exploit the topology preserving capability of self-organizing neural networks and learn the perceptual representation of environments using GIST features. Due to the fact that real-world environments are complex and large-scale, we let the network grow while accounting for the amount of error in the network due to perceptual differences among the places. Given the current state of the network and a query image at any time instant, it is possible to identify whether a place comes from the visited location by computing maximum a posteriori estimate over the network. The extensive experiments on three standard datasets, St. Lucia (4 videos), KITTI (2 sequences), and the Oxford City Center dataset, demonstrate the strength of our approach for real-time place recognition while concurrently learning the spatial representation of scenes.",

When identifying an underlying motion, literature mainly focuses on three related topics: motion segmentation, estimation and analysis. These topics are, however, mostly considered separately while integrated approaches are rare. Our approach specifically focuses on analyzing articulated motion from dense point cloud data by simultaneously solving for three topics using an integrated approach. No prior knowledge, such as background regions, number of segments and correspondence, is required since two iterations in this algorithm allow us to seamlessly accomplish integration of the three tasks. The first iteration of the algorithm is performed between segmentation and estimation, followed by the second iteration between motion estimation and analysis. For the first iteration, we propose EM based subspace clustering algorithm. For the second iteration, we simply fuse the motion analysis method from [1] into an iterative motion estimation algorithm. As a result, we can extract label, correspondence and motion of moving objects simultaneously from dense point cloud sequence. In experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real world data.",

This paper proposes a new implementation of direct-phase measurement methods to achieve 3-DoF (degrees of freedom) visual servoing. The proposed algorithm relies on a single frequency tracking rather than a complete 2D discrete Fourier transform that was required in previous works. The method does not require any calibration step and has many advantages such as high subpixelic resolution, high robustness and short computation time. Several experimental validations (in favorable and unfavorable conditions of use) were performed using a XY\u03b4 microrobotic platform.

We leverage techniques from differential geometry and Lie algebra to formulate a cost functional which is intrinsic to the geometric structure of this space and makes physical sense. We propose an approximation technique to generate trajectories on the subgroup SO(3) and use Semidefinite Programming (SDP) to approximate an NP-Hard problem with one which is tractable to compute. From this trajectory on the subgroup, the trajectory generation on the other dimensions of the group becomes a Quadratic Program (QP). For obstacle avoidance, we use a computational geometric technique to decompose the environment into overlapping convex regions to confine the trajectory. We show how this motion planning technique can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a space robot in SE(3) and describe controllers that enable the execution of the generated trajectory. We compare our method to other geometric techniques for calculating trajectories on SO(3) and SE(3), but in an obstacle-free environment.",

In this paper, the model of a snake robot in contact with external objects (or the environment) is derived. Metrics that are coordinateindependent are derived in order to quantify the wrench that a snake robot could exert into these objects.

Social activity recognition is important to study human-human communication and also human-robot interaction. Based on that, this research has threefold goals: (1) recognition of social behavior (e.g. human-human interaction) using a probabilistic approach that merges spatio-temporal features from individual bodies and social features from the relationship between two individuals; (2) learn priors based on physical proximity between individuals during an interaction using proxemics theory to feed a probabilistic ensemble of activity classifiers; and (3) provide a public dataset with RGB-D data of social daily activities including risk situations useful to test approaches for assisted living, since this type of dataset is still missing. Results show that using the proposed approach designed to merge features with different semantics and proximity priors improves the classification performance in terms of precision, recall and accuracy when compared with other approaches that employ alternative strategies.",

        "abstract": "Soft robotics methods such as impedance control and reflexive collision handling have proven to be a valuable tool to robots acting in partially unknown and potentially unstructured environments. Mainly, the schemes were developed with focus on classical electromechanically driven, torque controlled robots. There, joint friction, mostly coming from high gearing, is typically decoupled from link-side control via suitable rigid or elastic joint torque feedback. Extending and applying these algorithms to stiff hydraulically actuated robots poses problems regarding the strong influence of friction on joint torque estimation from pressure sensing, i.e. link-side friction is typically significantly higher than in electromechanical soft robots. In order to improve the performance of such systems, we apply state-of-the-art fault detection and estimation methods together with observer-based disturbance compensation control to the humanoid robot Atlas. With this it is possible to achieve higher tracking accuracy despite facing significant modeling errors. Compliant end-effector behavior can also be ensured by including an additional force/torque sensor into the generalized momentum-based disturbance observer algorithm from [1].",

The design is modular, comprising an hexrotor based propulsion system, and a stack of modules including batteries, cameras for navigation, a screen for telepresence, a robotic arm, space for extension modules, and a pair of docking ports. These ports can be used for docking and for mechanically attaching two Space CoBots together. The kinematics is holonomic, and thus the translational and the rotational components can be fully decoupled. We employ a multi-criteria optimization approach to determine the best geometric configuration for maximum thrust and torque across all directions. We also tackle the problem of motion control: we use separate converging controllers for position and attitude control. Finally, we present simulation results using a realistic physics simulator. These experiments include a sensitivity evaluation to sensor noise and to unmodeled dynamics, namely a load transportation.",

        "abstract": "We address the following question: is it possible to reconstruct the geometry of an unknown environment using sparse and incomplete depth measurements? This problem is relevant for a resource-constrained robot that has to navigate and map an environment, but does not have enough on-board power or payload to carry a traditional depth sensor (e.g., a 3D lidar) and can only acquire few (point-wise) depth measurements. In general, reconstruction from incomplete data is not possible, but when the robot operates in man-made environments, the depth exhibits some regularity (e.g., many planar surfaces with few edges); we leverage this regularity to infer depth from incomplete measurements. Our formulation bridges robotic perception with the compressive sensing literature in signal processing. We exploit this connection to provide formal results on exact depth recovery in 2D and 3D problems. Taking advantage of our specific sensing modality, we also prove novel and more powerful results to completely characterize the geometry of the signals that we can reconstruct. Our results directly translate to practical algorithms for depth reconstruction; these algorithms are simple (they reduce to solving a linear program), and robust to noise. We test our algorithms on real and simulated data, and show that they enable accurate depth reconstruction from a handful of measurements, and perform well even when the assumption of structured environment is violated.",

Vertical structures in the scene are extracted via classification from heterogeneous features computed at the superpixel level. Vertical surfaces are further classified according to their main orientation by fusing oriented line features, floor-wall boundary features and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) with a Random Forest classifier. Oriented line features are used to build an orientation map that considers the main vanishing points. The floor-wall boundary feature attempts to reconstruct the scene shape as if it were observed from a bird's-eye view. Finally, the HOG descriptors are aggregated per superpixel and summarize the gradient distribution at homogeneous appearance regions. Compared to existing methods in the literature which rely only on corners or lines, our method gains statistical support from multiple cues aggregated per superpixel which provide more robustness against noise, occlusion, and clutter.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework to map stationary sound sources while simultaneously localise a moving robot. Conventional methods for localisation and sound source mapping rely on a microphone array and either, 1) a proprioceptive sensor only (such as wheel odometry) or 2) an additional exteroceptive sensor (such as cameras or lasers) to get accurately the robot locations. Since odometry drifts over time and sound observations are bearing-only, sparse and extremely noisy, the former can only deal with relatively short trajectories before the whole map drifts. In comparison, the latter can get more accurate trajectory estimation over long distances and a better estimation of the sound source map as a result. However, in most of the work in the literature, trajectory estimation and sound source mapping are treated as uncorrelated, which means an update on the robot trajectory does not propagate properly to the sound source map. In this paper, we proposed an efficient method to correlate robot trajectory with sound source mapping by exploiting the conditional independence property between two maps estimated by two different Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms running in parallel. In our approach, the first map has the flexibility that can be built with any SLAM algorithm (filtering or optimisation) to estimate robot poses with an exteroceptive sensor. The second map is built by using a filtering-based SLAM algorithm locating all stationary sound sources parametrised with Inverse Depth Parametrisation (IDP). Robot locations used during IDP initialisation are the common features shared between the two SLAM maps, which allow to propagate information accordingly. Comprehensive simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Envisioned applications for humanoid robots call for the design of balancing and walking controllers. While promising results have been recently achieved, robust and reliable controllers are still a challenge for the control community dealing with humanoid robotics. Momentum-based strategies have proven their effectiveness for controlling humanoids balancing, but the stability analysis of these controllers is still missing. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we numerically show that the application of state-of-the-art momentum-based control strategies may lead to unstable zero dynamics. Secondly, we propose simple modifications to the control architecture that avoid instabilities at the zero-dynamics level. Asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is shown by means of a Lyapunov analysis on the linearized system's joint space. The theoretical results are validated with both simulations and experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "To guarantee its balance, a humanoid robot has to respect some contact force constraints. Therefore, traditional controllers generate motions complying with these constraints, but they usually consider the robot as stiff and the joint position perfectly known. However, several robots contain compliant parts in their structure. This flexibility modifies the forces at contacts and endangers balance. However, most solutions to stabilize the robot rely on force sensors. But several humanoid robots aren't equipped with these sensors. This paper has two aims. The first one is to develop a compliance stabilizer using the center of mass position and upper-body orientation through a viscoelastic reaction mass pendulum model. The second objective is to show the performances of such a stabilizer when relying only on an IMU-based state observer. Experimental results on HRP-2 robot show that the stabilization successfully rejects perturbations with high gains using only these IMU signals. Moreover, the actuation of the upper-body orientation provides redundancy, robustness and finally improved performances to the stabilizer.",

Therefore, robots should be able to learn tactile skills through trial and error by using reinforcement learning algorithms. The input domain for such tasks, however, might include strongly correlated or non-relevant dimensions, making it hard to specify a suitable metric on such domains. Auto-encoders specialize in finding compact representations, where defining such a metric is likely to be easier. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn non-linear policies in continuous state spaces, which leverages representations learned using auto-encoders. We first evaluate this method on a simulated toy-task with visual input. Then, we validate our approach on a real-robot tactile stabilization task.",

The robot has an active tail with a circular plate, which the robot rotates to steer on water. We dynamically modeled the platform and conducted simulations and experiments on steering locomotion with a bang-bang controller. The robot can steer on water by rotating the tail, and the controlled steering locomotion is stable. The dynamic modelling approximates the robot's steering locomotion and the trends of the simulations and experiments are similar, although there are errors between the desired and actual angles. The robot's maneuverability on water can be improved through further research.",

Given that legged robots exhibit higher terrain passability than wheeled or tracked platforms when operating in harsh environments, they constitute a challenge for the localization techniques because the camera motion between consecutive frames can be arbitrary due to the motion gait and terrain irregularities. In this paper, we present and evaluate an inertially assisted Stereo Parallel Tracking and Mapping (S-PTAM) method deployed on a hexapod crawling robot in a rough terrain. The considered deployment scenario is motivated by autonomous navigation in an unknown environment in an open loop fashion. The reported results and comparison with an existing RGB-D SLAM technique show the feasibility of the proposed approach and its suitability for navigation of crawlers in harsh environments.",

We create a tangible deformable device that allows users to \u201ctouch\u201d soft tissues and perceive mechanical material properties, in a realistic manner. The device is able to dynamically provide user touch with different stiffness perceptions, thanks to actuators placed at the boundaries. We introduce a control algorithm, based on inverse Finite Element Analysis, which controls the actuators in order to recreate a desired stiffness that corresponds to the contact with soft tissues in the virtual environment. The approach uses antagonistic actuation principle to create a wide range of stiffness. We validate our algorithm and demonstrate the method using prototypes based on simple mechanisms.",

The methodology is introduced and applied to model a soft robotics manipulator as single 3d Timoshenko beam element. The model is then utilized to solve the forward kinematics problem for the manipulator. The algorithm is validated comparing the simulated deflection with the deflection of the physical manipulator for two defined pressure sequences. It is shown that the model behaves in a highly similar fashion in comparison to the manipulator. For both trajectories the maximum position error is close to 6 mm while the error in orientation not more than 18\u00b0. The methodology as described in this work reveals great applicability to the field of soft robots being limited only by the stiffness matrix assembly for the given system. Implementations of inverse kinematics and the effects of external force applications are effectively integrable in the described theory.",

The model presented in this paper characterizes patterns in the historical movement of tagged fish and is used to develop stochastic tracking by a \u201cmodel based control\u201d and a \u201cfeedback control\u201d. These two controllers permit swarms of AUVs to track the transition probabilities of the tagged population between vertices of the model. To validate these controllers, a periodic model is developed for a simulated population based on three months of geolocation data from a kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), and AUV teams utilizing both controllers are simulated in tracking this population. Results show the viability of stochastic controls for multi-AUV tracking of populations whose behavior is well-approximated by the graph-based model. Preliminary trials with physical AUV systems indicate the plausibility of hardware implementation.",

In this paper, we present an effective and efficient strategy-based planning approach to implement the robotic picking from shelves for e-commerce. Making full advantage of a gripper with multiple securing methods, differentiated strategies are modeled as picking primitives with different securing methods. A strategy generator is proposed to produce feasible potential pickings as quickly and as successfully as possible. A strategy evaluator considering reachability, collision, object-bias preference and the securing performance is also presented for ranking the picking strategies. Experiments were conducted to validate that the robotic picker is able to plan a picking strategy within 2 ms and pick daily items from the shelves with an average success rate of 68%.",

Current approaches either rely on appearance-based features which may suffer from lighting and viewpoint changes or require pre-registration between all sensor modalities used. This work presents a framework using structural descriptors for matching LIDAR point-cloud maps and sparse vision keypoint maps. The matching algorithm works independently of the sensors' viewpoint and varying lighting and does not require pre-registration between the sensors used. Furthermore, we employ the approach in a novel vision-laser map-merging algorithm. We analyse a range of structural descriptors and present results of the method integrated within a full mapping framework. Despite the fact that we match between the visual and laser domains, we can successfully perform map-merging using structural descriptors. The effectiveness of the presented structure-based vision-laser matching is evaluated on the public KITTI dataset and furthermore demonstrated on a map merging problem in an industrial site.",

        "abstract": "Optimal control approaches in combination with trajectory optimization have recently proven to be a promising control strategy for legged robots. Computationally efficient and robust algorithms were derived using simplified models of the contact interaction between robot and environment such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM). However, as humanoid robots enter more complex environments, less restrictive models become increasingly important. As we leave the regime of linear models, we need to build dedicated solvers that can compute interaction forces together with consistent kinematic plans for the whole-body. In this paper, we address the problem of planning robot motion and interaction forces for legged robots given predefined contact surfaces. The motion generation process is decomposed into two alternating parts computing force and motion plans in coherence. We focus on the properties of the momentum computation leading to sparse optimal control formulations to be exploited by a dedicated solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our motion generation algorithm computes consistent contact forces and joint trajectories for our humanoid robot. We also demonstrate the favorable time complexity due to our formulation and composition of the momentum equations.",

The localisation approach includes timing information within acoustic messages to create an interrogation scheme similar to that of long-baseline methods, but realised at the application level of the network. In this way, the network itself is able to provide vehicle localisation information, reducing the needs for additional on-board sensors or dedicated deployed platforms/transponders. The aim of this work is to report at sea localisation results as obtained in two completely different application scenarios. The first one is represented by the FP7 MORPH project (HORTA15 sea trial) where the proposed approach has been applied to support navigation of a fleet of AUVs in a tight formation and in very shallow waters. The second application is represented by the NATO STO CMRE multistatic network demonstrator with the acoustic network used to support navigation of AUVs working in large operational areas. In this latter case, results are given from the COLLAB-NGAS14 experimental campaign.",

In the presence of high degrees of freedom, classical machine learning techniques require a number of iterations that increases with the size of the problem, thus convergence of the solution is not ensured. The use of postural synergies determines dimensionality reduction of the search space and allows recent learning techniques, such as Policy Improvement with Path Integrals, to become easily applicable. A key point is the adoption of a suitable reward function representing the goal of the task and ensuring one-step performance evaluation. Force-closure quality of the grasp in the synergies subspace has been chosen as a cost function for performance evaluation. The experiments conducted on the SCHUNK 5-Finger Hand demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm showing skills comparable to human capabilities in learning new grasps and in performing a wide variety from power to high precision grasps of very small objects.",

        "abstract": "Diagnostic blood testing is the most prevalent medical procedure performed in the world and forms the cornerstone of modern health care delivery. Yet blood tests are still predominantly carried out in centralized labs using large-volume samples acquired by manual venipuncture, and no end-to-end solution from blood draw to sample analysis exists today. Our group is developing a platform device that merges robotic phlebotomy with automated diagnostics to rapidly deliver patient information at the site of the blood draw. The system couples an image-guided venipuncture robot, designed to address the challenges of routine venous access, with a centrifuge-based blood analyzer to obtain quantitative measurements of hematology. In this paper, we first present the system design and architecture of the integrated device. We then perform a series of in vitro experiments to evaluate the cannulation accuracy of the system on blood vessel phantoms. Next, we assess the effects of vessel diameter, needle gauge, flow rate, and viscosity on the rate of sample collection. Finally, we demonstrate proof-of-concept of a white cell assay on the blood analyzer using in vitro human samples spiked with fluorescently labeled microbeads.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we face the challenging problem of takeoff and landing on sloped surfaces for a VTOL aerial vehicle. We define the general conditions for a safe and robust maneuver and we analyze and compare two classes of methods to fulfill these conditions: free-flight vs. passively-tethered. Focusing on the less studied tethered method, we show its advantages w.r.t. the free-flight method thanks to the possibility of inclined hovering equilibria. We prove that the tether configuration and the inclination of the aerial vehicle w.r.t. the slope are flat outputs of the system and we design a hierarchical nonlinear controller based on this property. We then show how this controller can be used to land and takeoff in a robust way without the need of either a planner or a perfect tracking. The validity and applicability of the method in the real world is shown by experiments with a quadrotor that is able to perform a safe landing and takeoff on a sloped surface.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework for prioritized constraint-based specification of robot tasks. This framework is integrated with a cognitive robotic system based on semantic models of processes, objects, and workcells. The target is to enable intuitive (re-)programming of robot tasks, in a way that is suitable for non-expert users typically found in SMEs. Using CAD semantics, robot tasks are specified as geometric inter-relational constraints. During execution, these are combined with constraints from the environment and the workcell, and solved in real-time. Our constraint model and solving approach supports a variety of constraint functions that can be non-linear and also include bounds in the form of inequalities, e.g., geometric inter-relations, distance, collision avoidance and posture constraints. It is a hierarchical approach where priority levels can be specified for the constraints, and the nullspace of higher priority constraints is exploited to optimize the lower priority constraints. The presented approach has been applied to several typical industrial robotic use-cases to highlight its advantages compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "The design of legged robots is often inspired by animals evolved to excel at different tasks. However, while mimicking morphological features seen in nature can be very powerful, robots may need to perform motor tasks that their living counterparts do not. In the absence of designs that can be mimicked, an alternative is to resort to mathematical models that allow the relationship between a robot's form and function to be explored. In this paper, we propose such a model to co-design the motion and leg configurations of a robot such that a measure of performance is optimized. The framework begins by planning trajectories for a simplified model consisting of the center of mass and feet. The framework then optimizes the length of each leg link while solving for associated full-body motions. Our model was successfully used to find optimized designs for legged robots performing tasks that include jumping, walking, and climbing up a step. Although our results are preliminary and our analysis makes a number of simplifying assumptions, our findings indicate that the cost function, the sum of squared joint torques over the duration of a task, varies substantially as the design parameters change.",

In this paper, we apply computer vision techniques to image data filtered through human RSVP. We introduce \u201ctask conversions\u201d to integrate the two modalities, applying the precise localization capabilities of computer vision with the detection capabilities of RSVP. We employ naive Bayesian fusion and a novel method, dynamic belief fusion (DBF), in a joint scheme as fusion approaches.

Previously, these two problems have typically been studied in isolation, however joint reasoning is essential to enable robots to complete real manipulative tasks. In this paper, the two problems are addressed jointly and a solution that takes both into consideration is proposed. To do so, a manipulation capability index is defined, which is a function of both the task execution waypoints and the object grasping contact points. We build on recent state-of-the-art grasp-learning methods, to show how this index can be combined with a likelihood function computed by a probabilistic model of grasp selection, enabling the planning of grasps which have a high likelihood of being stable, but which also maximise the robot's capability to deliver a desired post-grasp task trajectory. We also show how this paradigm can be extended, from a single arm and hand, to enable efficient grasping and manipulation with a bi-manual robot. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using experiments on a simulated as well as a real robot.",

        "abstract": "Reliable detection and avoidance of obstacles is a crucial prerequisite for autonomously navigating robots as both guarantee safety and mobility. To ensure safe mobility, the obstacle detection needs to run online, thereby taking limited resources of autonomous systems into account. At the same time, robust obstacle detection is highly important. Here, a too conservative approach might restrict the mobility of the robot, while a more reckless one might harm the robot or the environment it is operating in. In this paper, we present a terrain-adaptive approach to obstacle detection that relies on 3D-Lidar data and combines computationally cheap and fast geometric features, like step height and steepness, which are updated with the frequency of the lidar sensor, with semantic terrain information, which is updated with at lower frequency. We provide experiments in which we evaluate our approach on a real robot on an autonomous run over several kilometers containing different terrain types. The experiments demonstrate that our approach is suitable for autonomous systems that have to navigate reliable on different terrain types including concrete, dirt roads and grass.",

The simulator is a completely novel approach to the design of motion simulation platforms in so far as it uses cables and winches for actuation instead of rigid links known from hexapod simulators. This approach allows to reduce the actuated mass, scale up the workspace significantly, and provides great flexibility to switch between system configurations in which the robot can be operated. The simulator will be used for studies in the field of human perception research and virtual reality applications. The paper dicusses some of the issues arising from the usage of cables and provides a system overview regarding kinematics and system dynamics as well as giving a brief introduction into possible application use cases.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Finding and retrieving resources in unmapped environments is an important and difficult challenge for robot swarms. Central-place foraging algorithms can be tuned to produce efficient collective strategies for different resource distributions. However, efficiency decreases as swarm size scales up: larger swarms produce more inter-robot collisions and increase competition for resources. We propose a novel extension to central-place foraging in which multiple nests are distributed in the environment. In this multiple-place foraging algorithm, robots depart from a home nest but always return to the nest closest to them. We simulate robot swarms that mimic foraging ants using the multiple-place strategy, employing a genetic algorithm to optimize their behavior in the robot simulator ARGoS. Experiments show that multiple nests produce higher foraging rates and lower average travel time compared to central-place foraging for three different resource distributions. Time spent avoiding robot-robot collisions is not always reduced as was expected, primarily because the use of pheromone-like waypoints leads to more collisions when robots forage for clustered resources. These results demonstrate the importance of careful design in order to create efficient multiple collection points to mitigate the central-place bottleneck for foraging robot swarms.",

We derive a novel, exact cellular decomposition method called the Constriction Decomposition Method (CDM) and apply it to complex indoor environments. The CDM rapidly identifies constriction points in the environment and decomposes the environment into easily traversable cells by exploiting the geometric information contained in the environment's straight skeleton. Several heuristic path planning methods that find paths that completely cover each cell are explored. We apply our method on a complex indoor office-like environment and compare our results to existing methods.",

It is composed of mechanical, sensor and control subsystems. The mechanical subsystem includes a wheel-legged mobile platform, a rigid robotic arm and a flexible arm. The mobile platform provides a variety of movement ways to meet the requirement of different mobility. The rigid arm (denoted by arm-a) is a serial manipulator with 4-DOFs. It can be used to grasp and manipulate payloads. The flexible arm (denoted by arm-b) is a manipulator with continuous curve, and a camera is mounted on arm-b. So it can be used to provide visual inspection and measurement information. The sensor subsystem is composed of ultrasonic sensors mounted on the platform and a WIFI camera mounted on arm-b. It provides measurement information and visual inspection for remote control. The control subsystem includes an embedded controller and a PC computer. The former is developed based on an ARM microprocessor, on which the real-time operation system-RT-Thread system runs. The mission decomposition and trajectory planning algorithms are programed in C language and run in the PC. At last, typical experiments are performed. Experiment results verified the robot's mobility, operation capability and remote-control function.",

We employ two complementary methods. The first is based on the estimation of the external wrench (force and torque) due to aerodynamics acting on the robot in flight. Wind velocity is obtained by inverting an identified model of the aerodynamic forces. The second method is based on the estimation of the propeller aerodynamic power, and provides an estimate independent of other sensors. We show how to calculate components of the wind velocity using multiple aerodynamic power measurements, when the poses between them are known. The method uses the motor current and angular velocity as measured by the electronic speed controllers, essentially using the propellers as wind sensors. Verification of the methods and model identification were done using measurements acquired during autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel.",

Our system is light weight, can be run on low cost hardware and is remarkably quick to predict the semantics. In addition to the scene's path affordance it yields a segmentation of the local scene as a composite of distinctive labels - e.g, ground, sky, obstacles and vegetation. To estimate the labels, we combine a very fast and light weight (shallow) image classifier which considers informative feature channels derived from colour images and dense depth maps estimates. Unlike other approaches, we do not use local descriptors around pixel features. Instead, we encompass label-predicted probabilities with a variational approach for image segmentation. Akin to dense depth map estimation, we obtain semantically segmented images by means of convex regularisation. We show how our system can rapidly obtain the required semantics and paths at VGA resolution. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset support the robustness of our system to derive collision-free local routes. An accompanied video supports the robustness of the system at live execution in an outdoor experiment.",

This paper, for the first time, presents analytical and experimental explanations as to how the morphological computation at the goat hoof makes a significant contribution to slip reduction on both smooth and rough surfaces. We conducted experiments using a laboratory made hoof and compared its dynamic behavior against a rounded foot. We recorded forces and position of the hoof to analyze the effect of its shape and the individual contributions from 3-joints in the hoof on the work required to slip. Results state that the work required to move the hoof is more than 3 times that required to move a rounded foot. Additionally, the variables in the transient state are affected not only by the number and type of joints but also by the interaction with the environment. These findings promote the development of new types of feet for robots for all terrain conditions with greater stability and less control complexity.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring and predicting water quality poses significant challenges. Collecting enough information to characterize bodies of water is a critical bottleneck. Collecting data and samples from the surface all the way to the bottom over a short period of time would give water scientists the best spatio-temporal picture. In this paper, we present a small, light-weight, inexpensive water sensing and sampling robot, the \u201cWaterbug\u201d, capable of descending to depths up to 10m, collecting sensor information and a water sample, and returning to the surface. The water sampler also has limited capability to adjust buoyancy to hold depth for the purpose of measuring environmental conditions at specific locations in the water column. It is small enough that a single scientist could carry several in a backpack or it could be deployed by other robotic systems. The low cost of the node makes it feasible for blanket deployment. No tools are required for field servicing and the sample collection chamber is a common syringe that can be swapped quickly for redeployment. The main challenge was developing the system model and algorithm for achieving neutral buoyancy in the presence of system and initial condition variance. Over a range of conditions, we were able to achieve an 80% success rate for meeting the neutral buoyancy criteria and a 100% success rate in capturing a sample and returning to the surface.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of commodity autonomous mobiles, it is becoming increasingly prevalent to recognize under extreme conditions such as night, erratic illumination conditions. This need has caused the approaches using multi-modal sensors, which could be complementary to each other. The choice for the thermal camera provides a rich source of temperature information, less affected by changing illumination or background clutters. However, existing thermal cameras have a relatively smaller resolution than RGB cameras that has trouble for fully utilizing the information in recognition tasks. To mitigate this, we aim to enhance the low-resolution thermal image according to the extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called in TEN, which directly learns an end-to-end mapping a single low resolution image to the desired high resolution image. In addition, we examine various image domains to find the best representative of the thermal enhancement. Overall, we propose the first thermal image enhancement method based on CNN guided on RGB data. We provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate the quality of image and the performance of several object recognition tasks such as pedestrian detection, visual odometry, and image registration.",

We propose a novel approach based on time discretization that leads to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. This problem can be solved using general-purpose MILP solvers in a reasonable time, resulting in a resolution-optimal solution. Moreover, unlike previous work found in the literature, our formulation allows an exact linear modeling (up to the discretization resolution) of second-order dynamic constraints. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, much research has been done to develop various direct teaching schemes, in which an operator directly teaches a robot by hand guiding instead of using a teach pendant. However, conventional direct teaching methods are usually sensor based, thus leading to an expensive solution. To deal with this problem, this study proposes a sensorless hand guiding method based on torque control. The dynamic model of a robot along with the motor current and friction model is used to determine the user's intention to move the end-effector of a robot instead of directly sensing the external force by the user. A friction torque observer is employed for the friction model identification. The proposed method was experimentally verified using a 6 DOF robot. The experimental results show that the proposed sensorless hand guiding scheme is quite useful for practical direct teaching although the sensitivity is slightly lower than the sensor-based approach.",

We present a neural controller that can adapt the compliance of the robot arm in four directions using as input the tactile information from an artificial skin and as output the estimated torque for admittance control-loop reference. This adaption is done in a self-organized fashion with a neural system that learns first the topology of the tactile map when we touch it and associates a torque vector to move the arm in the corresponding direction. The artificial skin is based on a large area piezoresistive tactile device (ungridded) that changes its electrical properties in the presence of the contact. Our results show the self-calibration of a robotic arm (2 degrees of freedom) controlled in the four directions and derived combination vectors, by the soft touch on all the tactile surface, even when the torque is not detectable (force applied near the joint). The neural system associates each tactile receptive field with one direction and the correct force. We show that the tactile-motor learning gives better interactive experiments than the admittance control of the robotic arm only. Our method can be used in the future for humanoid adaptive interaction with a human partner.",

In this paper, we aim to provide a novel framework to automate an existing aircraft for unmanned operations using a humanoid robot, which is capable of manipulating the yoke, levers, switches and pedals to fly the airplane while operating various components such as lights and landing gears just as a human pilot would do. In this manner, the airplane can be converted for automated mode in a very short time without losing airworthiness. For testing, due to the complication of operating the robot in a real airplane, it is validated using a flight simulator, which provides the flight data over the network. The simulator is installed on a motion platform, which makes the robot move around due to the airplane's motion for realism. The proposed method is successfully validated in a series of flight simulations with various scenarios to show the feasibility of humanoid robot operation of an aircraft under various conditions.",

        "abstract": "Although existing mechanics-based models of concentric tube robots have been experimentally demonstrated to approximate the actual kinematics, determining accurate estimates of model parameters remains difficult due to the complex relationship between the parameters and available measurements. Further, because the mechanics-based models neglect some phenomena like friction, nonlinear elasticity, and cross section deformation, it is also not clear if model error is due to model simplification or to parameter estimation errors. The parameters of the superelastic materials used in these robots can be slowly time-varying, necessitating periodic re-estimation. This paper proposes a method for estimating the mechanics-based model parameters using an extended Kalman filter as a step toward on-line parameter estimation. Our methodology is validated through both simulation and experiments.",

        "abstract": "The increasingly pervasive usage of robotic automation not only calls for a high performance of physical robot manipulators, but also implies challenging requirements on 3D robot simulators. A skillful reaction of simulated robots to unpredicted contact forces has become an especially stringent necessity to support the development of emerging applications for which a compliant robotic manipulation is indispensable. This paper focuses on the simulation of physics-based virtual testbeds in which simulated robots are made capable of accommodating external forces exerted by the environment on their manipulators. For this, we integrate methods from multi-body dynamics modeling, advanced robotics, and virtual reality to develop a robotics simulation basis that facilitates the employment of compliant robotic manipulations in simulated applications. The validation of this basis in joint space indicates that a physics-based simulation of robots endowed with active physical interaction control can capture and reflect significant effects which characterize the interactive behavior of physical compliant robots.We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach to unlock competitive advantages in fully simulated applications prone to position uncertainty. Furthermore, we show the potential of using compliant digital twins of physical robots to introduce compliant robotic manipulations into real applications.",

The proposed approach is general enough to cope with multi-contact scenarios, i.e. robot-environment interactions occurring on feet and hands, up to the more general case of whole-body loco-manipulation, in which the robot is in contact with the environment also with the internal limbs, with a consequent loss of contact force controllability. Experimental tests were conducted with the Walk-Man robot (i) standing on flat terrain, (ii) standing on uneven terrain and (iii) interacting with the environment with both feet and a hand touching a vertical wall. Moreover, the influence of unmodeled weight on the robot, and the combination with a higher priority Cartesian tasks are shown. Results are presented also in the attached video.",

In this paper, we introduce a distributed algorithm for 3-D plume tracking using a system of ground and aerial robots in formation. We propose an algorithm that takes advantage of spatially distributed measurements to track the plume in 3-D and lead the robots to the source by integrating three behaviors - upwind movement, plume centering, and Laplacian feedback formation control. We evaluate this strategy in simulation and with real robots in a wind tunnel. For a source close to the ground, results show that a team of robots running our algorithm reaches the source with low lateral error while also tracing the horizontal and vertical plume shape.",

Starting with a perceived model of the environment consisting of geometric primitives like planes or cylinders, we define a hierarchical system for affordance extraction whose foundation are elementary power grasp affordances. Higher-level affordances, e.g. bimanual affordances, result from combining lower-level affordances with additional properties concerning the underlying geometric primitives of the scene. We model affordances as continuous certainty functions taking into account properties of the environmental elements and the perceiving robot's embodiment. The developed formalism is regarded as the basis for the description of whole-body affordances, i.e. affordances associated with whole-body actions. The proposed formalism was implemented and experimentally evaluated in multiple scenarios based on RGB-D camera data. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on a real robotic platform.",

The goal of the paper is to propose a framework to build an omnidirectional depth camera, towards an omnidirectional RGB-D camera system. The main contributions are: an efficient technique to project 3D points from the world to an image of a general non-central catadioptric camera; the definition of the template pattern (for both the projector and camera's images); and the matching between the projection of these features to the world and its respective images. The 3D depth is directly recovered using the template matching approach. In conclusion, we apply some filtering techniques to improve the results. To evaluate the proposed framework, we test the method using synthetic data, under different levels and types of noises, proving that the framework is robust to noise and, thus, can be put into practice.",

Usually, reproducibility is impeded because required information, such as the specification of software versions and their configuration, required data sets, and experiment protocols are not mentioned or referenced in most publications. In order to address these issues, we recently introduced an integrated tool chain and its underlying development process to facilitate reproducibility in robotics. In this contribution we instantiate the complete tool chain in a unique user study in order to assess its applicability and usability. To this end, we chose three different robotic systems from independent institutions and modeled them in our tool chain, including three exemplary experiments. Subsequently, we asked twelve researchers to reproduce one of the formerly unknown systems and the associated experiment. We show that all twelve scientists were able to replicate a formerly unknown robotics experiment using our tool chain.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Micromanipulation during live microscopic imaging relies heavily on good manual controls, dexterity, and hand-eye coordination. However, unassisted manual operations in these procedures greatly limit the speed, repeatability, and ease of operation. This is especially challenging in the case of microinjection where the insertion path needs to be in precise alignment with the imaging plane to avoid damage to cells. In this paper, we proposed an assistive robotic system that facilitates micromanipulation under microscopy. This comes in the form of intelligent robotic vision and guided manipulation. Using user-selected patch similarity, the system registers target templates and provides online coordinated depth compensation that ensures in-plane microinjection without the need for any prior calibration. This vision-based auto-registration approach readily integrates to any existing microscope system uncalibrated. It can also work as a standalone imaging solution with any general digital microscope camera. Experiments show that the similarity-score based depth compensation performed better than the uncompensated method. The method was shown to self-recover from an unfocused position. By robotizing conventional microscopy and micromanipulation procedures, we hope to address traditional latent needs and open up new possibilities in the ways experimental biology is performed.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of numerically efficient planning for legged robot locomotion, aiming towards reactive multi-contact planning as a reliability feature. We propose to decompose the problem into two parts: an extremely low dimensional kinematic search, which only adjusts a geometric path through space; and a dynamic optimization, which we focus on in this paper. This dynamic optimization also includes the selection of foot steps and hand-holds\u2014in the special case of instantaneous foot re-location. This case is interesting because 1) it is a limiting behavior for algorithms with a foot switching cost, 2) it may have merit as a heuristic to guide search, and 3) it could act as a building block towards algorithms which do consider foot transition cost. The algorithm bears similarity both to phase space locomotion planning techniques for bipedal walking and the minimum time trajectory scaling problem for robot arms. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm's efficiency is its use of linear programming with reuse of the active set of inequality constraints. Simulation results in a simplified setting are used to demonstrate the planning of agile locomotion behaviors.",

        "abstract": "The manipulation of objects is an inherent capability of dexterous human hands. However, state-of-the-art prostheses are limited to only forming grasps and gestures due to the low information transfer rate in the human-machine interface. Additionally, in the prosthetic setting the hand is not privy to such global knowledge including the object's shape, weight, friction properties, etc. Existing techniques from robotics that can manipulate objects in this prosthetic setting require compensation terms which are counterproductive to the manipulation task. The incorporation of tactile sensing leads to a simpler control formulation and enables relaxation of several restrictive assumptions inherent in the robotics applications. In this work a novel control system is proposed that incorporates tactile sensing for object manipulation and optimal distribution of contact forces for prosthetic hands. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed control system to manipulate an object, while minimizing the use of frictional forces during manipulation.",

Inspired by SLAM algorithms, our Bayesian approach to this so-called dynamic localization problem divides it into a localization problem and a mapping problem, respectively. To tackle the localization problem we use a particle filter, coupled with a distance filter and a scan matching method, which achieves a more robust localization against dynamic obstacles. For the mapping problem we use an extended sensor model which results in an effective and precise map update effect. We compare our approach against other localization methods and evaluate the impact the map update effect has on the localization in dynamic environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the last decade, multi-rotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have attracted great attention from robotics researchers. Offering affordable agility and maneuverability, multi-rotor aircrafts have become the most commonly used platforms for robotics applications. Amongst the most promising applications are inspection of power-lines, cell-towers, large and constrained infrastructures and precision agriculture. While GPS offers an easy solution for outdoor autonomy, using on-board sensors is the only solution for autonomy in constrained indoor environments. In this paper, we present our results on autonomous inspection of completely dark, featureless, symmetric dam penstocks using cameras and range sensors. We use a hex-rotor platform equipped with an IMU, four cameras and two lidars. One of the cameras tracks features on the walls using the on-board illumination to estimate the position along the tunnel axis unobservable to range sensors while all of the cameras are used for panoramic image construction. The two lidars estimate the remaining degrees of freedom (DOF). Outputs of the two estimators are fused using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). A moderately trained operator defines waypoints using the Remote Control (RC). We demonstrate our results from Carters Dam, GA and Glen Canyon Dam, AZ which include panoramic images for cracks and rusty spot detection and 6-DOF estimation results with ground truth comparisons. To our knowledge ours is the only study that can autonomously inspect environments with no geometric cues and poor to no external illumination using MAVs.",

        "abstract": "Comprised of multiple telescoptic precurved tubes that can independently rotate and translate, concentric tube robots (CTRs) are favorable in minimally invasive surgeries thanks to their small size and considerable dexterity along with curvilinear accessibility. However, there is a lack of investigation on improvement of the surgeons' perception which in turn can be used to guide the telemanipulation. In this work, we proposed an eye-in-hand configuration for the concentric tube robot by adding an endoscope to the tip of the inner tube, which provides direct and intuitive visual sensing ability for the operator. Based on this visual feedback, we further developed two frameworks for the hybrid control of CTR, namely Teleoperation Before Visual Servoing (TBVS) and Teleoperation During Visual Servoing (TDVS). The structures of these two frameworks were elaborated with key algorithms derived. The effectiveness of the proposed methods were demonstrated through a series of experiments both in free space and in a confined environment (inside a skull model). The results manifested that the visual guidance had the potential of assisting the operator to control the CTR more efficiently.",

The essential element of the proposed method is a multi-modal interface that provides the robot with the feedback about the human motor behaviour in real-time. The human muscle activity measurements and the arm force manipulability properties encode the information about the motion and impedance, and the intended configuration of the task frame, respectively. Through this human-in-the-loop framework, the developed hybrid controller of the robot can adapt its actions to provide the desired motion and impedance regulation in different phases of the cooperative task. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in a two-person sawing task that requires an appropriate complementary behaviour from the two agents.",

        "abstract": "In industrial environments, such as metallurgic facilities, human operators are exposed to harsh conditions where ambient air is often polluted with quartz, dust, lead debris and toxic fumes. Constant exposure to respirable particles can cause irreversible health damages and thus it is of high interest for occupational health experts to monitor the air quality on a regular basis. However, current monitoring procedures are carried out sparsely, with data collected in single day campaigns limited to few measurement locations. In this paper we explore the use and present first experimental results of a novel heterogeneous approach that uses a mobile robot and a network of low cost sensing nodes. The proposed system aims to address the spatial and temporal limitations of current monitoring techniques. The mobile robot, along with standard localization and mapping algorithms, allows to produce short term, spatially dense representations of the environment where dust, gas, ambient temperature and airflow information can be modelled. The sensing nodes on the other hand, can collect temporally dense (and usually spatially sparse) information during long periods of time, allowing in this way to register for example, daily variations in the pollution levels. Using data collected with the proposed system in an steel foundry, we show that a heterogeneous approach provides dense spatio-temporal information that can be used to improve the working conditions in industrial facilities.",

This absence of oversight motivates the need for an online monitoring system, specifically for robots operating in difficult environments. We develop a test methodology and set of online monitoring metrics by extending methods for characterizing robotic-systems using offline metrics. We implement this test methodology in an unstructured, outdoor environment and show the resulting performance information gained from our online monitoring solution. This online monitoring approach is generalizable such that it characterizes any robotic system that meets our set of hardware and software criteria.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Achieving real-time perception is critical to developing a fully autonomous system that can sense, navigate, and interact with its environment. Perception tasks such as online 3D reconstruction and mapping have been intensely studied for terrestrial robotics applications. However, characteristics of the underwater domain such as light attenuation and light scattering violate the brightness constancy constraint, which is an underlying assumption in methods developed for land-based applications. Furthermore, the complex nature of light propagation underwater limits or even prevents subsea use of real-time depth sensors used in state-of-the-art terrestrial mapping techniques. There have been recent advances in the development of plenoptic (also known as light field) cameras, which use an array of micro lenses capturing both intensity and ray direction to enable color and depth measurement from a single passive sensor. This paper presents an end-to-end system to harness these cameras to produce real-time 3D reconstructions underwater. Our system builds upon the state-of-the-art in online terrestrial 3D reconstruction, transferring these approaches to the underwater domain by gathering real-time color and depth (RGB-D) data underwater using a plenoptic camera, and performing dense 3D reconstruction while compensating for attenuation effects of the underwater environment simultaneously, using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to achieve real-time performance. Results are presented for data gathered in a water tank and the proposed technique is validated quantitatively through comparison with a ground truth 3D model gathered in air to demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate accurate 3D models of objects underwater in real-time.",

        "abstract": "Learning of inverse dynamics modeling errors is key for compliant or force control when analytical models are only rough approximations. Thus, designing real time capable function approximation algorithms has been a necessary focus towards the goal of online model learning. However, because these approaches learn a mapping from actual state and acceleration to torque, good tracking is required to observe data points on the desired path. Recently it has been shown how online gradient descent on a simple modeling error offset term to minimize tracking at acceleration level can address this issue. However, to adapt to larger errors a high learning rate of the online learner is required, resulting in reduced compliancy. Thus, here we propose to combine both approaches: The online adapted offset term ensures good tracking such that a nonlinear function approximator is able to learn an error model on the desired trajectory. This, in turn, reduces the load on the adaptive feedback, enabling it to use a lower learning rate. Combined this creates a controller with variable feedback and low gains, and a feedforward model that can account for larger modeling errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, in simulation and on a real system.",

        "abstract": "We address the challenging problem of tracking a moving target in cluttered environments using a quadrotor. Our online trajectory planning method generates smooth, dynamically feasible, and collision-free polynomial trajectories that follow a visually-tracked moving target. As visual observations of the target are obtained, the target trajectory can be estimated and used to predict the target motion for a short time horizon. We propose a formulation to embed both limited horizon tracking error and quadrotor control costs in the cost function for a quadratic programming (QP), while encoding both collision avoidance and dynamical feasibility as linear inequality constraints for the QP. Our method generates tracking trajectories in the order of milliseconds and is therefore suitable for online target tracking with a limited sensing range. We implement our approach on-board a quadrotor testbed equipped with cameras, a laser range finder, an IMU, and onboard computing. Statistical analysis, simulation, and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This work demonstrates fast motion planning for robot locomotion that is optimized for terrain with complex dynamics, specifically, rapid penetration of granular media. Gait planning is critical for many legged locomotion control approaches, but they typically assume rigid ground contact. We aim to extend these planning methods to include terrain dynamics we see in the natural world, like sand and dirt, which can both deform and fluidize. Using an added-mass description of collective grain motion, we formulated a model of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic terrain effects that is both principled and representable with closed-form dynamics. As a result, we present a model and fast optimization formulation which solves accurate motion plans on granular media with tractable solving times (6.4\u20133.8 seconds). For validation, we optimized open-loop motor trajectories for a testbed jumping robot to jump to a target apex height from a bed a loosely packed poppy seeds, a model granular medium. While jumps optimized for rigid ground were anemic on granular media, terrain-aware trajectories hit within 6% of their target. This demonstrates the potential for robot locomotion which meets practical task demands, all while being aware of the terrain beneath it.",

In trajectory planning, arc-length parameterization is used to separate path planning and time planning so that they can be done independently. After path is planned, time planning along the planned path can be given freely to meet our requirement, such as speed and acceleration adjustment for the protection of motors, optimization for dynamics analysis, dynamic obstacle avoidance and so on. Results from simulations and experiments authenticate the validity of our motion generation method.",

The diversity of robots active in non-laboratory environments is growing constantly, and to this end we present an approach for users to be able to easily teach a skill to a robot with any body configuration. Our proposed method requires a motion trajectory obtained from human demonstrations via a Kinect sensor, which is then projected onto a corresponding human skeleton model. The kinematics mapping between the robot and the human model is learned by employing Local Procrustes Analysis, which enables the transfer of the demonstrated trajectory from the human model to the robot. Finally, the transferred trajectory is modeled using Dynamic Movement Primitives, allowing it to be reproduced in real time. Experiments in simulation on a 4 degree of freedom robot show that our method is able to correctly imitate various skills demonstrated by a human.",

        "abstract": "An effective robot trajectory representation should encode all relevant aspects of the desired motion. For kinematic representations, this means that both the spatial course of the trajectory and its speed profile must be specified. The concept of dynamic movement primitives (DMP) provides a kinematic representation that fully specifies these two aspects of motion. They are, however, not separated from each other within the DMP representation. This can be problematic when movements with significant speed variations are compared within movement recognition and skill learning algorithms. In such comparisons it is often important to distinguish between the spatial and temporal aspects of motion. In this paper we propose a new representation based on dynamic movement primitives, where spatial and temporal aspects are well separated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed representation for statistical learning of robot skills and movement recognition and compare the performance with standard DMPs, where temporal and spatial aspects of motion are intertwined.",

The goal is to make the inspection process safer and more efficient and facilitate data collection about tree cavities, which are important for the conservation of biodiversity in forest ecosystems. This work focuses on two key enabling technologies, namely a vision-based cavity detection system and strategies for high level control of the MAV and manipulator. The results of both simulation and real-world experiments are discussed at the end of the paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robot has the potential to manipulate wide range of tools in daily life. Arms and legs of humanoid robot contribute this ability. Above all, manipulation tasks for vehicles which are the same size as a life-sized humanoid or larger size than it require the operational motion by both arms and legs of humanoid robot. In addition to the arms and legs cooperative motion control, it is also important for humanoid robot to stabilize self posture during driving vehicle. In this research, we focus on the arms-legs-integrated manipulation task for tricycle controlled by humanoid robot. We propose dual manipulators control law that is defined as active manipulator which works movable objects such as handle and crank, and passive manipulator which follows the movement of this objects. We discuss the self stabilizing strategy for humanoid robot by both active manipulating legs as well as manipulation strategy for objects. Furthermore, this paper contributes the strategy of recognition and planning for outside obstacle situations and configures the tricycle manipulation system. Applying this proposed system, we show the experimental result for tricycle manipulation by life-sized humanoid robot HRP2-JSK on obstacle-mixed situation.",

Despite progress in symbolic motion planning, many challenges remain, including addressing scalability for multi-robot systems and improving solutions by incorporating human intelligence in an adaptive fashion. In this paper, we use local communication, observation, control protocols, and compositional reasoning approaches to decompose the planning problem to address scalability. To address solution quality and adaptability, we use a dynamic and computational trust model to aid this decomposition and to implement real-time switching between automated and human motion planning. A simulation is provided demonstrating the successful implementation of these methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, an ongoing work for verifying the behavior of a twisted string actuator in contact with a sliding surface or guided through a sheath is presented. The twisted string actuation system is particularly suitable for very compact and light-weight robotic devices, like artificial limbs and exoskeletons, since it allows the implementation of powerful tendon-based driving systems, based on small-size DC motors characterized by high speed, low torque and very limited inertia. One of the major limitations of this actuation system is by now related to the fact that the string should not be in contact with any obstacle, because this contact will alter the twisting angle propagation along the string and, eventually, completely stop the string twisting. This design constraint imposes a straight path between the motor and the linear load attached to the other string end. After the presentation of the basic properties of the twisted string actuation system, the model of the twisted string in contact with a sliding surface is discussed. The behavior of the system has been then experimentally verified and discussed. A preliminary evaluation of control strategies for compensating the side effects generated by the contact of the twisted string with the sliding surface is also presented.",

Such a platform would be ideal for distributed robotics applications because it combines the portability and deployment simplicity of a small airframe with the long flight time of a solar UAV. Methods to design and predict properties of a two meter solar UAV are described including airframe type selection, mass estimation, and propulsion requirements. A simplified approach to predict flight time is presented as well as an improved metric for quantifying multiday flight robustness. Maximum flight time for the two meter airframe considered is estimated to be greater than ten hours which is an order of magnitude improvement over reported commercially available options. In terms of multi-day flight capability, total mass is predicted to be within the bounds of a realizable aircraft based on extrapolation from larger experimentally tested multi-day solar UAVs.",

        "abstract": "Electrotactile stimulation has been used to provide sensory information of forearm prosthesis to users. Although conventional sensory feedback method, where one electrode expresses sensory information of only one finger, could provide force information of three fingers by using three electrodes, it showed less cognitive accuracy when more than two electrodes were stimulated simultaneously compared to individual stimulation. To improve the cognitive accuracy, we presented a sensory feedback method called two-channel electrotactile stimulation for the thumb, index and middle fingers using only two electrodes. The force information of the index and middle fingers was delivered into two electrodes, respectively, by intermittent stimulation. The information of the thumb was delivered to the user by inserting additional offset pulses onto the channel of the index finger based on an assumption that the force of thumb is proportional to the sum of the forces of the index and middle fingers. The presence of offset pulses in the channel indicates the binary state of thumb if it contacts with an object or not. We conducted two psychophysical experiments where healthy subjects classified the binary states of each finger and identified intensity from two-channel stimuli. The cognitive accuracies for intensity identification were 78.8% and 62.2% for the intermittent stimulation and conventional method, respectively, and accuracy for classifying the fingers was 93.1% for every combination of the three fingers. The results demonstrated that the proposed two-channel electrotactile stimulation could be an attractive method to express the information of fingers of prosthesis with high accuracy.",

The user uses an arm-waving gesture as a signal to attract the UAV's attention from a distance. Once this signal is detected, the UAV approaches the user using appearance-based tracking until it is close enough to detect the human's face. Once in this close-range interaction setting, the user is able to use hand gestures to communicate its commands to the UAV. Throughout the interaction, the UAV uses colored-light-based feedback to communicate its intent to the user. We developed this system to work reliably with a low-cost consumer UAV, with only computation off-board. We describe each component of this interaction system, giving details of the depth estimation strategy and the cascade predictive flight controller for approaching the user. We also present experimental results on the performance of the complete system and its individual components.",

        "abstract": "We propose a submap-based technique for mapping of underwater structures with complex geometries. Our approach relies on the use of probabilistic volumetric techniques to create submaps from multibeam sonar scans, as these offer increased outlier robustness. Special attention is paid to the problem of denoising/enhancing sonar data. Pairwise submap alignment constraints are used in a factor graph framework to correct for navigation drift and improve map accuracy. We provide experimental results obtained from the inspection of the running gear and bulbous bow of a 600-foot, Wright-class supply ship.",

        "abstract": "A surprising phenomenon is observed in a microfluidic channel where suspending microbeads are spontaneously aligned into lines. Microbeads are randomly distributed in the channel at a relatively high velocity (3.27 \u00b5m/ms), but start to align into lines at a relatively low velocity (0.05 \u00b5m/ms). The alignment has been repeated with and without obstacles in the channel. The phenomenon is interpreted as an unintended acoustic wave being around the experimental environment, and the wave resulted in a standing wave which moves the microbeads towards the nodes of the standing wave. By using a frequency analyzer, it is found that a pulse-width-modulation controller in the system generated high-frequency signals, which is the most possible wave source for the alignment. The experimental results are presented, and characteristics of acoustic wave are analyzed. The phenomenon could contribute to microfluidic applications for achieving acoustic alignment without complex fabrication of interdigital transducers.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Interaction control is a mature, but still, current area of research in robotics. Various approaches have been developed for passive and active force regulation and tracking, e.g. impedance control, direct force and hybrid force-position control. The latter method implements a force feedback outer loop on top of a position controller inner loop, where commands are issued with respect to a compliant frame. However, if the compliant frame undergoes a rigid transformation, e.g. in order to specify the same task relative to another reference frame, then commands can be rendered non-compliant with the task at hand. As a consequence, the robot can be damaged or hurt somebody, this is further aggravated by the rigidness of a position controller. In the present paper, we propose a unified impedance and hybrid force-position control scheme to address such issues. The unified controller benefits from the impedance control compliance while an explicit force value can be achieved. Furthermore, we augment the designed controller with a kinestatic filter, which ensures that the commanded pose and wrench are consistent with a given task model. We validate the designed system through experiments with a lightweight robot (LWR). The proposed approach finds applications in industrial settings where interactions with the environment are required in order to fulfill a task and the system must be robust w.r.t. input commands.",

Local estimators are assumed to have access only to local information and no structure is assumed about the topology of the communication network, which need not be connected at all times. Iterative Covariance Intersection (ICI) is used to reach consensus over priors which might become correlated, while consensus over new information is handled using weights based on a Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain (MHMC). We establish bounds for estimation performance and show that our method produces unbiased conservative estimates that are better than CI.

        "abstract": "Safe and robust grasping of unknown objects is a major challenge in robotics, which has no general solution yet. A promising approach relies on haptic exploration, where active optimization strategies can be employed to reduce the number of exploration trials. One critical problem is that certain optimal grasps discoverd by the optimization procedure may be very sensitive to small deviations of the parameters from their nominal values: we call these unsafe grasps because small errors during motor execution may turn optimal grasps into bad grasps. To reduce the risk of grasp failure, safe grasps should be favoured. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm, unscented Bayesian optimization, that performs efficient optimization while considering uncertainty in the input space, leading to the discovery of safe optima. The results highlight how our method outperforms the classical Bayesian optimization both in synthetic problems and in realistic robot grasp simulations, finding robust and safe grasps after a few exploration trials.",

We demonstrate in simulation that the proposed algorithm can outperform existing methods. We then highlight how our approach can be used to generate force and torque profiles from experimental data, and how this information can later be used for controller design.

In this work, we mimic such a behavior on a humanoid robot and propose a computational model that extracts depth information without requiring the kinematic model of the robot. First, we show that, during fixational head/eye movements, proprioceptive cues and optic flow lie on a low dimensional subspace that is a function of the depth of the target. Then, we use the generative adaptive subspace self-organizing map (GASSOM) to learn these depth-dependent subspaces. The depth of the target is eventually decoded using a winner-take-all strategy.

        "abstract": "Powered transfemoral prostheses are robotic systems that aim to restore the mobility of transfemoral amputees by mimicking the functionalities of healthy human legs. The advantage of using a powered prosthetic device is the enhanced performance on various terrains. One of the most frequent terrain found during daily locomotion (other than flat ground) is the surface with slope. In this work, we introduce a framework to generate upslope walking gaits automatically utilizing an online algorithmic formulation. This approach is inspired from analyzing human gait characteristics during upslope walking. In particularly, it is found that the ankle and knee trajectories of upslope walking share a similar pattern with flat ground walking during the middle section (from 20% to 80%) of one step. This observation motivates us to propose an approach of blending the first portion of nominal flat ground gaits with a set of cubic splines to achieve upslope gaits. Importantly, parameters of these cubic splines are solved using an online optimization, which gives the users ability to traverse in different terrains without using any intention detection algorithm. For the last portion of a step, an impedance controller with low gains is considered upon the contact of prosthetic legs to the ground, which allows the users to step onto unknown terrains. The proposed framework is validated on a custom transfemoral prosthesis AMPRO II with showing automatic motion switches between flat ground and upslope walking.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots typically possess sensors of different modalities, such as colour cameras, inertial measurement units, and 3D laser scanners. Often, solving a particular problem becomes easier when more than one modality is used. However, while there are undeniable benefits to combine sensors of different modalities the process tends to be complicated. Segmenting scenes observed by the robot into a discrete set of classes is a central requirement for autonomy as understanding the scene is the first step to reason about future situations. Scene segmentation is commonly performed using either image data or 3D point cloud data. In computer vision many successful methods for scene segmentation are based on conditional random fields (CRF) where the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution to the segmentation can be obtained by inference. In this paper we devise a new CRF inference method for scene segmentation that incorporates global constraints, enforcing the sets of nodes are assigned the same class label. To do this efficiently, the CRF is formulated as a relaxed quadratic program whose MAP solution is found using a gradient-based optimisation approach. The proposed method is evaluated on images and 3D point cloud data gathered in urban environments where image data provides the appearance features needed by the CRF, while the 3D point cloud data provides global spatial constraints over sets of nodes. Comparisons with belief propagation, conventional quadratic programming relaxation, and higher order potential CRF show the benefits of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Fall detection systems have been proposed to prevent additional injuries following fall accidents. This paper introduces an easily learnable fall detection system based on the data of an individual patient in a hospital room. The improvement of low performance using a single accelerometer at wrists and the inconvenience of sensor attached to a waist in the conventional approach was concentrated on by integrating heart rate signals to the conventional acceleration approach and changing the sensor location from a waist to wrists. As for the optimal heart rate feature selection, we proposed a four-feature vector combination (root mean square of successive differences, standard deviation of successive differences, normal to normal 50, normal to normal 20) with correlation and mutual information analysis in addition to mean absolute deviation selected as an accelerometer feature. To easily acquire and train the patients' fall data, our system was based on unsupervised learning approaches using Gaussian mixture models for optimal classifiers with the optimal cluster number decided by cluster validation index of square error sum. A 10-fold cross validation was applied for a final performance evaluation where each threshold for separating fall state from non-fall state was automatically decided in several comparison groups, which were created on the basis of fusion timing and used sensors. As a result, despite sensors attached to the wrist, the wearable inconvenience of the conventional is overcome using the feature-level fused approach between heart rates and accelerations with the accuracy up to 98.39 %, which is closest to 99.34 % of the case using a single accelerometer located at the waist.",

        "abstract": "All over the world, people find joy and amusement in playing hand-clapping games such as \u201cPat-a-cake\u201d and \u201cSlide.\u201d Thus, as robots enter everyday human spaces and work together with people, we see potential for them to entertain, engage, and assist humans through cooperative clapping games. This paper explores how data recorded from a pair of commonly available inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn on a human's hands can contribute to the teaching of a hand-clapping robot. We identified representative hand-clapping activities, considered approaches to classify games, and conducted a study to record hand-clapping motion data. Analysis of data from fifteen participants indicates that support vector machines and Markov chain analysis can correctly classify 95.5% of the demonstrated hand-clapping motions (from ten discrete actions) and 92.3% of the hand-clapping game demonstrations recorded in the study. These results were calculated by withholding a participant's entire dataset for testing, so these results should represent general system behavior for new users. Overall, this research lays the groundwork for a simple and efficient method that people could use to demonstrate hand-clapping games to robots.",

This problem consists of finding the rigid transformation that relates the scanning reference and the endoscopic camera pose, and the non-rigid transformation undergone by the liver w.r.t its scanned state. Most of the state-of-the-art methods assume a known initial registration. Here, we propose a method that permits to recover the deformation undergone by the liver while simultaneously finding the rotational and translational parts of the transformation. Our formulation considers the boundaries of the liver with its surrounding tissues as hard constraints directly encoded in an energy minimization process. We performed experiments on real in-vivo data of human hepatic surgery and synthetic data, and compared our method with related works.",

To this end, we propose a probabilistic n-gram language model learned from observation of human locomotion tasks. Human motion data is automatically segmented according to detected contacts of the body with the environment to provide support, that is, support poses, which are further subdivided with regard to whole-body configuration. These poses are subsequently used to train a language model, whose words are the poses, and whose sentences represent sequences of poses. Then, we propose a planning algorithm that, given the constraints imposed by a task, finds the sequence of transitions with the highest probability according to our language model. We have applied our approach to 140 motion capture recordings of locomotion tasks that involve using one or both hands for support. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach is able to generate complex sets of pose transitions, and shows promising results regarding its application to more complex tasks.",

We develop an approach that: 1) pre-processes the observations and maps them into a new space with both reduced dimensions and a linear relationship to the estimation states; and 2) estimates the uncertainty of resulting outputs using data perturbation. The result is that deep learning approaches can be combined with more traditional filtering approaches like the Kalman filter (KF) to achieve state-of-the-art real-time performance. We validate the method by presenting the first real-time application of underwater robot localization using an imaging sonar. The proposed technique shows similar localization accuracy to benchmark approaches while simultaneously achieving real-time performance.",

We are inspired by the general problem of K-choice games as a proxy for many decision making applications in dynamical systems. We model the human as a Markovian controller based on gathered experimental data, that is, a non-deterministic control input with known likelihoods of control actions associated with certain configurations of the state-space. We use reachability analysis to predict the outcome of the resulting discrete-time stochastic hybrid system, in which the outcome is defined as a function of the system trajectory. We suggest that the resulting expected outcomes can be used to validate the cognitive model against actual human subject data. We apply our method to a two-choice game in which the human is tasked with maximizing net coverage of a robotic swarm that can operate under rendezvous or deployment dynamics. We validate the corresponding ACTR cognitive model generated with the data from eight human subjects. The novelty of this work is (1) a method to compute expected outcome in a hybrid dynamical system with a Markov chain model of the human's discrete choice, and (2) application of this method to validation of cognitive models with a database of actual human subject data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new method with impulse spectrum is presented as a more general way for vibration control of the robotic arm of flexible multiple links. An impulse spectrum is directly responsible for basic processions. The multiple ODE of the arm is analyzed as an LTI system fit for superposition due to its dynamically relative constant. The study shows that the impulse spectrum proposed to suppress vibration of the multiple links driven by a joint is dependent on the spectral functions of individual subsystem modes. An oscillatory matrix built with spectral functions of higher orders is derived for multi-degree optional design of the multilink, multi-mode spectrum robust against multiple parameters perturbation. Nonlinear programming is discussed to shorten a band spectrum. The band spectra are proposed, presented for wider robustness against variation of frequencies in the vicinity of a centered frequency, and for band robustness over grouped frequencies. Finally simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical work, and the satisfactory results are achieved.",

The paper also presents the results of a 14-participant user study for both needle passing and knot tying sub-tasks, showing that virtual fixture assistance for novice users increases the needle passing exit point accuracy, reduces the number of errors (suture slip) in knot tying, and simultaneously decreases the task completion time and overall operator workload.",

The brute-force approach to determine the optimal visibility map is computationally expensive, and prohibitive with dynamic obstacles. We contribute the Robot-Dependent Visibility Map (RDVM) as a close approximation to the optimal, and an effective algorithm to compute it. The RDVM is a function of the robot's shape, initial position, and sensor model. We first overview the computation of RDVM for the circular robot case in terms of the partial morphological closing operation and the optimal choice for the critical points position. We then present how the RDVM for any-shape robots is computed. In order to handle any robot shape, we introduce in the first step multiple layers that discretize the robot orientation. In the second step, our algorithm determines the frontiers of actuation, similarly to the case of the the circular robot case. We then derive the concept of critical points to the any-shape robot, as the points that maximize expected visibility inside unreachable regions. We compare our method with the ground-truth in a simulated map compiled to capture a variety of challenges of obstacle distribution and type, and discuss the accuracy of our approximation to the optimal visibility map.",

This collaborative localization technique is built upon a relative pose estimation strategy between two or more cameras with the capability of estimating accurate metric poses between each other even through fast motion and continually changing environments. Through synchronized feature detection and tracking with a robust outlier rejection process, classical multiple view geometry concepts have been utilized for obtaining scale-ambiguous relative poses, which are then refined through reconstruction and pose optimization to provide a metric estimate. Furthermore, we present the implementation details of this technique followed by a set of results which involves evaluation of the accuracy of the pose estimates through test cases in both simulated and real experiments. Test cases include keeping one camera stationary as the other is mounted on a quadrotor which is then flown through various types of trajectories. We also perform a quantitative comparison with a GPS/IMU localization technique to demonstrate the accuracy of our method.",

This problem is challenging both from a detection point of view, as there are no markers on the targets available, and from a tracking perspective, due to misdetection and false positives. Furthermore, the methods need to be computationally light, despite the complexity of computer vision algorithms, to be used on UAVs with limited payload. To address these issues we propose a multi-staged framework that incorporates fast object detection using an AdaBoost-based approach, coupled with an on-line visual-based tracking algorithm and a recent sensor fusion and state estimation method. Our framework allows for achieving real-time performance with accurate object detection and tracking without any need of markers and customized, high-performing hardware resources.",

The method combines the advantages of adaptive underactuation with the robustness of visual servoing algorithms by employing simple action sets in actuator space, called precision manipulation primitives (PMPs). It is shown that, with this approach, reliable precision manipulation is possible even without joint and force sensors by using only minimal gripper kinematics information. An adaptation method is also utilized in the vision loop to enhance the system's transient performance. The proposed methods are analyzed with experiments using various target objects and reference signals. The results indicate that underactuated hands, even with minimalistic sensing and control via visual servoing, can provide a simple and inexpensive solution to allow low-fidelity precision manipulation.",

In this system, two cameras work together with the laser-scanner for motion estimation. The distance of the points detected by laser-scanner are transformed and treated as the depth of image features, which improves the robustness and accuracy of the pose estimation. The output of visual odometry is used as an initial pose in the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and the motion trajectory is optimized by the registration result. We finally get the MAV's state by fusing IMU with the pose estimation from mapping process. This method maximizes the utility of the point clouds information and overcomes the scale problem of lacking depth information in the monocular visual odometry.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a vision-based approach for estimating the configuration of, and providing control signals for, an under-sensored robot manipulator using a single monocular camera. Some remote manipulators, used for decommissioning tasks in the nuclear industry, lack proprioceptive sensors because electronics are vulnerable to radiation. Additionally, even if proprioceptive joint sensors could be retrofitted, such heavy-duty manipulators are often deployed on mobile vehicle platforms, which are significantly and erratically perturbed when powerful hydraulic drilling or cutting tools are deployed at the end-effector. In these scenarios, it would be beneficial to use external sensory information, e.g. vision, for estimating the robot configuration with respect to the scene or task. Conventional visual servoing methods typically rely on joint encoder values for controlling the robot. In contrast, our framework assumes that no joint encoders are available, and estimates the robot configuration by visually tracking several parts of the robot, and then enforcing equality between a set of transformation matrices which relate the frames of the camera, world and tracked robot parts. To accomplish this, we propose two alternative methods based on optimisation. We evaluate the performance of our developed framework by visually tracking the pose of a conventional robot arm, where the joint encoders are used to provide ground-truth for evaluating the precision of the vision system. Additionally, we evaluate the precision with which visual feedback can be used to control the robot's end-effector to follow a desired trajectory.",

The VR environment provides a Google Street View-like interface for users to familiarize themselves with the robot's working environment, specify high-level landmarks, and determine task-level motion commands related to each landmark. Our system builds a roadmap by using the pose graph from the vSLAM outputs. Based on the roadmap, the high-level landmarks, and task-level motion commands, our system generates an output path for the robot to accomplish the navigation task. We present data structures, architecture, interface, and algorithms for our system and show that, given ns search-type motion commands, our system generates a path in O(ns(nr lognr+mr)) time, where nr and mr are the number of roadmap nodes and edges, respectively. We have implemented our system and tested it on real world data.",

We demonstrate how to reconstruct the 3-D location of curve landmarks from a stereo pair without searching for point-based stereo correspondences and how to compare the 3-D shape of curve landmarks between chronologically sequential stereo frames to solve the data association problem. We present a method to combine curve landmarks for mapping purposes, resulting in a map with a continuous set of curves that contain fewer landmark states than conventional sparse point-based SLAM algorithms. Note, to combine curves, we assume the curved landmarks are fixed to a larger curved object naturally occurring in the scene. While our algorithm is less accurate than point-based SLAM algorithms, we are able to create maps with considerably less landmark states and our algorithm can operate in settings lacking texture.",

        "abstract": "Disaster response robots for searching in a narrow area have limited space to mount tactile sensors, but the operators require sensory feedback to recognize contact situations with the surrounding environment. This study proposes a new approach to transmitting contact information of a remote-operated snake-like robot called Active Scope Camera (ASC) to the operator using simple configurations for the sensing and display methods. For the sensing side, we develop a contact estimation method with a limited number of tactile sensors. We establish the method to localize the contact position and the magnitude by sensing multiple propagated vibrations based on experiments and formulations. Preliminary experiments show that the developed method estimates a collision angle with high probability (93.8% at the worst condition) at several collisional situations. For the display side, we combine visual and vibrotactile feedback to provide the operator both directional and temporal cues to perceive contact events. The proposed visualization method uses colored bars, peripherally superposed on the video image, to show the estimated contact location and magnitude. A single DoF vibrotactile feedback is used for a joystick interface to control the head movement of the ASC. The effect of vibrotactile feedback on the response time to contact events is evaluated. Finally, we investigate the performance of the operation by identifying the contact behavior at simulated scenarios. Experimental results show that collision times per operation time is decreased by the developed feedback system compared with a simple video-based operation.",

The main idea is the proposition of an augmented voltage/frequency rate dependent modeling of the friction force based on a multi-state elasto-plastic formulation. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the model in the time and the frequency domains. As a case of study, the proposed model is used to define a control strategy in order to detect collisions when the nano-robotic system is operating inside a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This application demonstrates the need of a voltage/frequency rate dependent modeling.",

To reduce the redundancy of mechanical structure and the moving payload for the robot, the mobile platform and the mechanical arm could work as a unity, i.e. the mechanical arm can switch into a leg of the robot to reduce payload during moving modes. Experimental results validated key performance of the robot, including locomotion accuracy and efficiency, compact volume and low power consumption. The integrated design concept illustrated the adaptability in diverse unstructured indoor environments, enlarging the manipulation workspace, and enhancing the energy efficiency.",

Although very few life-sized humanoid robots are completely waterproof, we can easily make these humanoid robots watertight by putting a waterproof suit on them. In water, humanoid robots are influenced by the two forces due to the water: buoyancy and drag force. We take buoyancy into account when generating a walking pattern because the force is large and easy to estimate before walking. However, drag force is small and difficult to precisely predict and therefore, we treat the force as an unknown disturbance. In our method, we modify footsteps based on the Capture Point in order to deal with large disturbances. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods through an experiment in which a life-sized humanoid robot walks on a floor, stairs and debris in water.",

If necessary, the humanoid robot can adapt to other technologies even when these technologies make it different from humans. In a real environment or a disaster environment, humanoid robots are a good solution to assist humans. However, the stability problem of biped locomotion remains. In this paper, we introduce a new strategy of attaching a wheel to our humanoid robot in order to achieve mobility efficiency with a bipedal walking and wheel driven mode. Additionally, this strategy can enhance the stability. Through the proposed method, the humanoid robot can traverse uneven terrain and climb stairs with a walking motion, and can move safely with wheels on the ground. In addition, a method will be presented that can enhance the performance of wheel movement by using redundant joints and sensors on the humanoid robot. Various experiments and the DARPA Robotics Challenge results validate the efficiency and the feasibility of the proposed strategy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present motion optimization algorithms for computing manipulation motions in presence of obstacles. Our approach builds a geometric representation of the workspace by constructing Riemannian metrics using electric potentials emanating from the workspace obstacles. Velocity of the robot's body is measured with respect to this metric instead of traditional Cartesian velocity. Empirical results demonstrate that Riemannian metrics are better handled by optimizers that leverage objective and constraint functions' second order information. This information encodes how the Riemannian geometry of the modeled workspace pulls back into the configuration space. We also show that despite the additional computational burden of computing the electric-potential based metric, it results in faster overall convergence than reasoning on Euclidean geometry alone. Evaluation is made efficient by cashing the electric potential in voxel grids and using Tri-cubic spline interpolation to assess the potentials gradient.",

The learned cost maps are constructed directly from raw sensor measurements, bypassing the effort of manually designing cost maps as well as features. When deploying the cost maps, the trajectories generated not only replicate human-like driving behaviour but are also demonstrably robust against systematic errors in putative robot configuration. To achieve this we deploy a Maximum Entropy based, non-linear IRL framework which uses Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) to represent the cost model underlying expert driving behaviour. Using a deep, parametric approach enables us to scale efficiently to large datasets and complex behaviours while being run-time independent of dataset extent during deployment. We demonstrate scalability and performance on an ambitious dataset collected over the course of one year including more than 25k demonstration trajectories extracted from over 120km of driving and 13 different drivers. We evaluate against a carefully designed cost map and, in addition, demonstrate robustness to systematic errors by learning precise cost-maps even in the presence of system calibration perturbations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The task of whole-body motion planning for humanoid robots is challenging due to its high-DOF nature, stability constraints, and the need for obstacle avoidance and movements that are efficient. Over the years, various approaches have been adopted to solve this problem such as bounding-box models and jacobian-based techniques. More commonly though, sampling-based algorithms are employed for this task since they perform admirably well in high-dimensional spaces. As an alternative, search-based planners offer improvements in terms of optimality and consistency of the solution. However, they are normally considered impractical for high-dimensional motion planning. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based motion planning framework for humanoid robots that circumvents the drawbacks traditionally associated with search-based planners while catering to the specific requirements of humanoid motion planning. This is achieved primarily through a combination of informative yet computationally inexpensive heuristics, carefully crafted motion primitives as atomic actions, and a whole body inverse kinematics solver for achieving desired end effector orientations. The experimental results show the ability of our framework to perform complex motion planning tasks quickly and efficiently.",

HighWiFi coverage provides a way to localize even low-cost robots that do not need to be equipped with expensive exteroceptive sensors or excessive computational power to run visual-based SLAM algorithms. Since current trend in robotics is in mass-deployment of low-cost, replaceable robots, we focus our efforts in this direction as well. Possible solution is combination of high-tech robots deployed as support assuring reliable localization for the low-cost robots that are actually doing the job. The proposed scenario is to use one SLAM robot to map WiFi signal strength in the working area and provide it to a low-cost robot to correct drift of its 6-DOF gyro-odometry localization system. For this purpose, we extend Gaussian-processes-based WiFi localization algorithms to full 3D and experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in 2 mapping and 7 localization sorties performed on different dates spanning four months.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for estimation and identification of shear wind and discrete gusts of a previously unknown wind field by using an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). Wind estimation and identification is key in energy-efficient trajectory planning and dynamic soaring applications. The research proposes an approach for mapping a complete wind field from the collected data. Therefore, the generated map also describes areas where UAS has not passed through. The proposed method consists of the next steps: 1) the wind vector is estimated in each UAS position; 2) wind data are fitted into a Weibull probability density function and meeting the Prandtl's power law relationship; 3) scale factor of the Weibull distribution and the power law coefficient are computed; 4) wind feature detection such as shear layer and gusts is performed from the relation wind magnitude vs. altitude obtained; and finally 5), data could be extrapolated to generate the complete wind field. Novel aspects and advantages include the optimization of the scale factor from the estimated wind data by using a genetic algorithm, the identification of wind features separately, and the possibility to apply the method online. Real data of flight have been used to validate the method and many simulations and studies have been performed to test and analyze the proposed method in different scenarios.",

In contrast to prior work on wearable force feedback gloves, we focus on creating a low cost and lightweight device that renders a force directly between the thumb and three fingers to simulate objects held in pad opposition (precision) type grasps. Leveraging low-power brake-based locking sliders, the system can withstand over 100N of force between each finger and the thumb, and only consumes 0.24 mWh (0.87 joules) for each braking interaction. Integrated sensors are used both for feedback control and user input: time-of-flight sensors provide the position of each finger and an IMU provides overall orientation tracking. This paper describes the mechanical design, control strategy, and performance analysis of the Wolverine system and provides a comparison with several existing wearable haptic devices.",

        "abstract": "This work presents the development of iT-Knee, a novel modular knee exoskeleton that makes use of a torque transmission interface to deliver pure assistive torque to the knee articulation, with the objective to act as rehabilitation tool, or a single joint add-on exoskeleton device for power augmentation. The specific kinematics features employed by iT-Knee can accommodate not only the translational of the knee instantaneous center of rotation in the sagittal plane and on its orthogonal direction, but also the knee varus/valgus angle as well as the internal/external rotation tibia movements delivering pure torque only around the flexion/extension movement. This functionality results in superior transparency and comfortability which allow prolonged period of use without generating significant discomfort. The iT-Knee kinematics, its mechanism, implementation, and actuation are introduced. The Self-aligning feature combined with a fast lock/release mounting system on the human leg shortens the setup time required to wear it, increasing its user-friendly perception. iT-Knee uses a torque controlled actuation unit to generate torque around the knee flexion extension enabling the implementation of several interaction control schemes that combine assistive functionality on demand with high back drivability and transparency during unloaded free motions of the human knee. Experimental results are presented and effectively demonstrate the functionality of the iT-Knee device.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Millirobots have increasingly become popular over the past several years, especially for swarm-behavior studies, allowing researchers to run experiments with a large number of units in limited workspaces. However, as these robots have become smaller in size, their sensory capabilities and battery life have been reduced. A number of these have also been customized, with few off-the shelf components, exhibiting integral (i.e., non-modular) designs. In response to the above concerns, this paper presents a novel open-source millirobot with a modular design based on the use of easily sourced elements and off-the-shelf components. The proposed milli-robot-Toronto (mROBerTO), is a 16\u00d716 mm2 robot with a variety of sensors (including proximity, IMU, compass, ambient light, and camera). mROBerTO is capable of formation control using an IR emitter and detector add-on. It can also communicate via Bluetooth Smart, ANT+, or both concurrently. It is equipped with an ARM processor for handling complex tasks and has a flash memory of 256 KB with over-the-air programming capability.",
