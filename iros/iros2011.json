        "abstract": "Many industries require contactless transport and positioning of delicate or clean objects such as silicon wafers, glass sheets, solar cell or flat foodstuffs. The authors have presented a new form of contactless distributed manipulation using induced air flow. Previous works concerned the evaluation of the maximal velocity of transported objects and one degree-of-freedom position control of objects. This paper introduces an analytic model of the velocity field of the induced air flow according to the spatial configuration of vertical air jets. Then two degrees-of-freedom position control is investigated by exploiting the linearity property of the model. Finally the model is validated under closed-loop control and the performances of the position control are evaluated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Increased demand for powered wheelchairs and their inherent mobility limitations have prompted the development of omnidirectional wheelchairs. These wheelchairs provide improved mobility in confined spaces, but can be more difficult to control and impact the ability of their users to embody the wheelchair. We hypothesize that control and embodiment of omnidirectional wheelchairs can be significantly improved by providing intuitive control with 3-DOF haptic feedback that directly corresponds to the degrees of freedom of an omnidirectional wheelchair. This paper introduces a novel 3-DOF Haptic Joystick designed for the purpose of controlling omnidirectional wheelchairs. When coupled with range finders, it is able to provide the user with feedback that improves the operator's awareness of the area surrounding the vehicle and assists the driver in obstacle avoidance. The haptic controller design and a stability analysis of the coupled wheelchair joystick systems are presented. Experimental results of the coupled systems validate the ability of the controller to influence the trajectory of the wheelchair and assist in obstacle avoidance.",

By utilizing a laser rangefinder mounted on a rover platform, we have demonstrated an approach that is able to create globally consistent maps of natural, unstructured 3D terrain. The framework presented in this paper utilizes a sparse-feature-based approach, and conducts data association using a hybrid combination of feature constellations and dense data. To maintain global consistency, the measurements are resolved using a batch alignment algorithm, which is reinforced with batch outlier rejection to improve its robustness. Finally, a map is created from the alignment estimates and the dense data. Validation is provided using data gathered at two different planetary analogue facilities.",

By mounting a laser scanner at a swinging platform, the spatial information of passengers inside the area of interest can be reconstructed in a form of 3D points. Multiple laser scanners are integrated together by semi-auto calibration procedures. Background map is generated through histogram analysis of scan maps, and is further applied for 3D moving object detection. An improved version of mean-shift clustering algorithm is proposed to extract individual passengers efficiently. In addition, quantified crowdness analysis is conducted from different aspects to indicate the situation inside the surveillance area according to the extraction results of passengers. The proposed system was tested in a central subway station in Tokyo and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Payload recognition is an important ability for autonomous industrial vehicles. While scanning laser rangefinders are commonly used on autonomous vehicles, most provide only 2D range scans. The goal of this research is to use the 2D range data to accurately identify an initially unknown 3D asymmetric payload. Typical approaches to payload recognition use either artificial markers or models with relatively tight constraints on the shape. We relax these constraints and allow the system to determine the most appropriate representation of the target object using an unsupervised learning approach. A set of target scan segments from the training set is reduced to a reference set with a high discrimination capability. The system uses the reference set in a classifier that evaluates incoming scans and monitors areas in the environment that potentially contain target objects. Upon a high enough confidence, a target is declared. Once trained, the system is able to accurately recognise a target object in different environments. The reduced reference set classifier shows faster convergence to a target classification than one developed with a full feature set and another with k-means clustering.",

In such missions, a key factor for the successful completion is the knowledge of the terrain's morphology. In this paper, we introduce a two-step centralized procedure to align optimally a swarm of flying vehicles for the aforementioned task. Initially, a single robot constructs a map of the area of interest using a novel monocular-vision-based approach. A state-of-the-art visual-SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera while, simultaneously, building an incremental map of the surrounding environment. The map generated is processed and serves as an input in an optimization procedure using the cognitive adaptive methodology initially introduced in [1], [2]. The output of this procedure is the optimal arrangement of the robot team, which maximizes the monitored area. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated using real data collected from aerial robots in different outdoor areas.",

In particular, we address the problem of tracking deformable 3-dimensional (3D) curvilinear objects from stereo images. We propose an approach based on discrete Markov random field (MRF) optimization to track, in 3D, a thread modeled by a non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS). We evaluate its accuracy off-line on synthetic and real data and illustrate its use for an automatic scissors command within an assistance system based on the da Vinci tele-surgical robot.",

        "abstract": "Over the last eight years, significant scientific effort has been dedicated on the problem of 3-D surface reconstruction for structural systems. However, the critical area of marine structures remains insufficiently studied. The research presented here focuses on the problem of 3-D surface reconstruction in the marine environment. This work is an extension of our previous approach, in which a surface vehicle that was equipped with a powerful laser scanner was designed and used to scan the above-water part of the marine structure of interest. Here we propose the design of a novel surface vehicle that is capable of using laser scanners and a side-looking sonar to scan marine structures both above and below the waterline. We also study the issue of downsampling the dataset in order to perform efficient surface reconstruction of the considered 3-D geometry, and we present a methodology for combining and integrating data from the above- and below-water parts of the structure. To illustrate the proposed robotic platform and validate our algorithms, we present results from a set of experiments in the Singapore Sea. Specifically, we present 2 different maps: the above-water map and the combined above-and below-water map. In both cases, we have two different maps: a lower quality map, that can be generated on-line, and a higher quality map that is generated off-line. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the only one that provides a 3-D model for both above- and below-water parts of marine structures. In this work we assumed a GPS-denied environment, without using any other navigation sensor such as DVL or INS.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing human activities from common color image sequences faces many challenges, such as complex backgrounds, camera motion, and illumination changes. In this paper, we propose a new 4-dimensional (4D) local spatio-temporal feature that combines both intensity and depth information. The feature detector applies separate filters along the 3D spatial dimensions and the 1D temporal dimension to detect a feature point. The feature descriptor then computes and concatenates the intensity and depth gradients within a 4D hyper cuboid, which is centered at the detected feature point, as a feature. For recognizing human activities, Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Gibbs sampling is used as the classifier. Experiments are performed on a newly created database that contains six human activities, each with 33 samples with complex variations. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed features for the task of human activity recognition.",

Three examples introduce various aspects of gait creation and analysis: a stability study of a passive dynamic walker determines the ideal position of the leg's center of mass, the cost of transportation is minimized for a prismatic monopod hopper based on series elastic actuators, and a basic controller is created for the model of a bounding robot.

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Navigation (MRN) aims at navigating artificial or synthetic untethered micro-devices and microrobots using an upgraded clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system. For larger MRI-based navigated entities, past experiments proved that software-based upgrades only were sufficient. But for microrobots with an overall diameter of only a few tens of micrometers for travelling in narrower blood vessels, hardware upgrades need to be added to the MR scanner, resulting in a MRN system capable of generating 3D magnetic propulsion gradients on the microrobots well above the ones that could be generated by a clinical MRI scanner relying on software-upgrades only. But with the variety of models of clinical scanners coped with many versions of related operating software dedicated to MR imaging, implementing such upgrades that could operate with these scanners becomes a real challenge. As such, a new MRN platform architecture independent of the types of MR scanners is proposed and preliminary experimental data validating the potential of such microrobotic navigation system architecture integrated with a commercially available scanner are reported. The expected steering capabilities of the platform were evaluated initially using a special probe in the form of a magnetic catheter mimicking an anisotropic microrobot. Such special probe also allowed for easier recordings of the gradient steering force that would be induced on such microrobot while validating the technique for catheter steering which is also an important aspect since catheterization is often used for releasing the microrobots in larger arteries. Similarly, MR tracking of the same microrobot was also validated with the new system, confirming that tracking feedback data can be gathered in order to perform closed-loop navigation control.",

The joint mimics the curved profiles of the femur and tibia bones and also mimics the four-bar motion of the cruciate ligaments. The bio-inspired design has the same desirable features of a natural knee joint including compactness, a moving centre of rotation, high strength, high stiffness and locking in the upright position. These characteristics are important for mobile robots where there are often tight space and mass limitations. Numerical analysis and experimental tests have shown that the new hinge joint has superior performance to a pin jointed hinge in terms of stiffness and mechanical advantage.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new car transportation system, iCART II (intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Robot Transporters - type II), based on \u201ca-robot-for-a-wheel\u201d concept. A prototype system, MRWheel (a Mobile Robot for a Wheel), is designed and downsized less than the half of the conventional robot used in iCART (intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Robot Transporters). In general, it is very difficult for mobile robots such as MRWheel to move to desired positions without motion errors caused by slipping, etc. Therefore we propose a decentralized control algorithm for car transportation in coordination by using a leader-follower type multiple robot system. The proposed algorithm enables the followers to estimate and reduce the motion errors and then enables the robots to transport a car to a desired position, even if the motion errors occur. In addition, we discuss how the external force applied to each robot during transporting a car, such as an inertial and friction force, is shared among the robots, and we propose a model-based external force estimation and compensation method. The proposed control algorithm is applied to the system, and the results of car transportation experiment confirm its validity.",

        "abstract": "Robust climbing in unstructured environment has been one of the long-standing challenges in robotics research. Among others, the control of large adhesion forces is still an important problem that significantly restricts the locomotion performance of climbing robots. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel approach to autonomous robot climbing which makes use of Hot Melt Adhesion (HMA). The HMA material is known as a very economical solution to achieve large adhesion forces, and the forces can be varied by controlling its material temperature. For locomotion in both inclined and vertical walls, this paper investigates the basic characteristics of HMA material, and proposes a design and control of climbing robot that uses the HMA material for attaching and detaching its body to the environment. The robot is equipped with servomotors and thermal control units to actively vary the temperature of the material, and the coordination of these components enables the robot to walk against the gravitational forces even with a relatively large body weight. A real-world platform is used to demonstrate locomotion on a vertical wall, and the experimental result explains feasibility and overall performances of this approach.",

In this paper we want to discuss the benefits and the disadvantages of the two approaches, showing a direct comparison between the information which can be obtained from the two categories of sensors. Results obtained on the new iCub arm, which integrates torque sensing capabilities at joint level will be presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a biologically inspired spiking neural network based haptic object recognition system is proposed. A number of different encoding schemes to convert the haptic measurements into spike train are proposed and investigated for haptic object recognition and compared with existing encoding schemes. The spiking neural network was trained using a supervised training approach that is based on the steepest descent algorithm. During the training, firing threshold of the hidden layer neurons were modified in such a way that the ability of the system in recognising different objects is maximised. A multiplexing scheme is used to convert the parallel spike train of the hidden layer into a serial stream. To convert the output spike train into a reliable feature that represents the shape of an object, moment of the spikes with respect to a reference time is calculated. A robot hand with three fingers that have the same number of degrees of freedom as the human fingers was used for testing the system. The hand was made to grasp different objects and the joint angles were recorded. These recorded angles were converted into spike train using different encoding schemes and applied as input to the network. Test results show that the performance of the system varies depending on the input encoding scheme and with the best encoring scheme the system can recognise 100% of 7 different objects.",

Both approaches utilise a statistically optimal bundle adjustment formulation that incorporates Vision, IMU and GPS observations into the map and pose optimisation process. Our first approach employs a novel pose-only formulation that optimises relative camera poses based on vision feature matches between frames, while incorporating IMU and GPS information. Our approach is related to, but differs from existing pose-graph techniques by formulating a set of 1D epipolar constraints for features matched between two camera frames, rather than minimising 4D feature re-projection errors, or marginalising feature states. We compare results of the method to a second approach which estimates both 3D features and poses together, using airborne vision, IMU and GPS data collected in an ecology mapping application. The results demonstrate a reduction in the computational complexity during optimisation for the pose-only approach, while producing equivalent accuracy in the reconstructed 3D terrain map.",

This applies as much to robotics as anywhere else, where how to easily deploy the complex web of software components that make up a complete robot system is a well-known problem. We have developed an experimental tool for the deployment and configuration of components using RT-Middleware. It is based on the supervision tree concept. Components are organised into a hierarchy of sub-systems and managed in these groups. The use of a supervision tree ensures that dependencies between components are managed when errors occur, and that errors will propagate up the tree to a supervisor that is capable of handling them.",

The first one predicts whether the perturbed system can be stopped in a final static state while maintaining fixed contacts with the environment. This prediction can be seen as a dynamic stability indicator. The second one consists of a strategy that stabilizes the system, when stability cannot be reached, through a contact change chosen as the best one among a set of a priori possible contact changes.",

The collaborative constraints guide the motion of multiple robots such that the spatial and temporal relationships are maintained between them, while following human input motion objectives. We demonstrate this control architecture for the task of manipulating a surgical knot to a target point. The teleoperation system uses four arms from a da Vinci Surgical System\u00ae (two master manipulators and two slave manipulators), with custom electronics and software. It extends previous work, which focused on a cooperatively controlled system where the motions of two robots were directly controlled by user-applied forces. Our current system enables us to effectively evaluate the accuracy of the knot positioning task and completion time in a clinically realistic setup for Minimally Invasive Surgery",

In this paper, we explore controlling a truly continuously deformable structure with a CPG-like network. Our recently completed soft wormlike robot with a continuously deformable outer mesh, along with a continuum analysis of peristalsis, has suggested the neural control investigated here. We use a Wilson-Cowan neuronal model in a continuum arrangement that mirrors the arrangement of muscles in an earthworm. We show that such a system is well suited to incorporate sensory input and can create both rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity. The system can be controlled using straightforward descending signals whose effects are largely decoupled and can modulate the properties from CPG-like behaviors to static waves. This approach will be useful for designing robotic systems that express multiple adaptive behavioral modes.",

The key idea is to develop, for each robot, an observer of the collective system's state; each local observer is updated by only using information of the state of the robot and of its neighbors. The local observers' estimations are then used by the individual robots to cooperatively track an assigned time-varying reference for the weighted centroid. Convergence of the scheme is proven for both fixed and switching communication topologies, as well as for directed and undirected communication graphs. Numerical simulations relative to different case studies are illustrated to validate the approach.",

In this paper, an on-line placement algorithm is proposed that computes where the robot must next move so as to sample its environment uniformly and densely. The algorithm guarantees the minimum number of measurements per unit length of the observed space, obtaining a high and uniform spatial measurement density. It provides a Next-Best-View relative to a robot's current position while satisfying a locally-defined constraint function based on the sampling density of points. Three variants of this algorithm, suitable for different practical applications are demonstrated with experiments on real robots in interesting scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This study describes a novel method for automatically obtaining the attitude of an aircraft from the visual horizon. A wide-angle view of the environment, including the visual horizon, is captured and the input images are classified into fuzzy sky and ground regions using the spectral and intensity properties of the pixels. The classifier is updated continuously using an online reinforcement strategy and is therefore able to adapt to the changing appearance of the sky and ground, without requiring prior training offline. A novel approach to obtaining the attitude of the aircraft from the classified images is described, which is reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient to implement. This method is therefore suited to real-time operation and we present results from flight tests that demonstrate the ability of this vision-based approach to outperform an inexpensive inertial system.",

All motors are grounded in the base to decrease inertia and increase compactness near the user's hand. An aluminum-aluminum friction differential allows for actuation of pitch and yaw with mechanical robustness while allowing a cable transmission to route through its center. This novel cabling system provides simple, compact, and high-performance actuation of the radial DOF independent of motions in pitch and yaw. We show that the device's capabilities are suitable for general haptic rendering, as well as specialized applications of spherical kinematics such as laparoscopic surgery simulation.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel computationally efficient approach to obstacle detection that is applicable to both structured (e.g. indoor, road) and unstructured (e.g. off-road, grassy terrain) environments. In contrast to previous works that attempt to explicitly identify obstacles, we explicitly detect scene regions that are traversable - safe for the robot to go to - from its current position. Traversability is defined on a 2D grid of cells. Given 3D points, we map them to individual cells and compute histograms of elevations of the points in each cell. This elevation information is then used in a graph based algorithm to label all traversable cells. In this manner, positive and negative obstacles, as well as unknown regions are implicitly detected and avoided. Our notion of traversability does not make any flat-world assumptions and does not need sensor pitch-roll compensation. It also accounts for overhanging structures like tree branches. We demonstrate that our approach can be used with both lidar and stereo sensors even though the two sensors differ in their resolution and accuracy. We present several results from our real-time implementation on realistic environments using both lidar and stereo.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new framework for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF), that can be applied to floor-cleaning robots which are equipped with sparse and short-range sensors. To overcome the sensor limitations, the entire region is divided into several local maps, which are assumed to be independent to each other. The local maps are estimated by a local RBPF SLAM, and then the trajectory of the local map origin is estimated by a global RBPF SLAM. To compensate for the severe sensing limitations, we also adopt the assumption that the indoor environments consist of many orthogonal lines. This assumption significantly enhances the filter performance. The proposed SLAM framework is combined with a coverage path planning algorithm, and the resulting robot system is capable of online simultaneous coverage and SLAM. The algorithm was embedded into a real mobile robot platform and tested in a real home environment to assess the robustness of the proposed method.",

Traditional systems use separate interfaces such as touchscreens or control panels in order to operate the robot, or to communicate its state and prospective actions to the user. Transferring human communication, such as gestures to technical non-humanoid robots, creates various opportunities for more intuitive human-robot-interaction. Interaction shall no longer require a separate interface such as a control panel. Instead, it should take place directly between human and robot. To explore intuitive interaction, we identified gestures that are relevant for co-working tasks from human observations. Based on a decomposition approach we transferred them to robotic systems of increasing abstraction and experimentally evaluated how well these gestures are recognized by humans. We created a human-robot interaction use-case in order to perform the task of handling dangerous liquid. Results indicate that several gestures are well perceived when displayed with context information regarding the task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-centralized Cooperative Localization (CL) under severe communication constraints, i.e., when each robot can communicate only a single bit per real-valued (analog) measurement. Existing approaches, such as those based on the Sign-of-Innovation Kalman filter (SOI-KF) and its variants, require each robot to process quantized versions of both its local (i.e., recorded by its own sensors) and remote (i.e., collected by other robots) measurements. This results in suboptimal performance since each robot has to discard information that is available in its own analog measurements. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid estimation scheme that enables each robot to process both quantized (from remote sensors) and analog (from its own sensors) measurements. Specifically, we first present the hybrid (H)-SOI-KF, a direct extension of the SOI-KF, for processing both types of measurements. Secondly, we introduce the modified (M)H-SOI-KF, that uses an asymmetric encoding/decoding scheme to incorporate additional information during quantization (based on the hybrid estimates locally available to each robot), resulting in substantial accuracy improvement. Lastly, we present extensive simulations which demonstrate that both hybrid estimators not only outperform the SOI-KF, but also achieve accuracy comparable to that of the standard (analog) centralized Kalman filter.",

        "abstract": "Continuum robots offer significant advantages for surgical intervention due to their down-scalability, dexterity, and structural flexibility. While structural compliance offers a passive way to guard against trauma, it necessitates robust methods for online estimation of the robot configuration in order to enable precise position and manipulation control. In this paper, we address the pose estimation problem by applying a novel mapping of the robot configuration to a feature descriptor space using stereo vision. We generate a mapping of known features through a supervised learning algorithm that relates the feature descriptor to known ground truth. Features are represented in a reduced sub-space, which we call eigen-features. The descriptor provides some robustness to occlusions, which are inherent to surgical environments, and the methodology that we describe can be applied to multi-segment continuum robots for closed-loop control. Experimental validation on a single-segment continuum robot demonstrates the robustness and efficacy of the algorithm for configuration estimation. Results show that the errors are in the range of 1\u00b0.",

This offset (which we term CLPT error) has characteristics that are not previously seen in free-drifting ocean sampling platforms with no active control. CLPT error growth over time is exponential until it reaches a turning point that depends only on the resolution of the ocean model, after which the error growth is bounded by polynomial functions of time. In the ideal case, a theoretical lower bound on the steady-state CLPT error can be derived. These characteristics are proved theoretically for particles moving in a planar flow field. The method of CLPT may be applied to improve the accuracy of ocean circulation models and navigation performance of marine robots.",

To facilitate the situation and avoid the explicit specification of this parameter, the limiting case of the post-movement period tending to infinity is analyzed for several classes of the control plant.

        "abstract": "In recent years, flexible robotic catheter systems have been developed for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. These systems commonly include a passive flexible catheter, which is biocompatible, and an active servo system which provides the actuation for the flexible catheter. To relate control actuation motion of the servo system to catheter motion, models of continuous catheters have been developed. A typical approach is to assume a kinematic model in which the catheter maintains constant curvature along its length when articulated. However, this approach cannot explain the nonlinear behavior of the catheter when the effect of internal friction is considered. In this paper we present a lumped-parameter modeling approach that allows for the inclusion of nonlinear effects, including friction. The proposed approach has been used to model a prototype catheter where internal friction is modeled using a modified Dahl friction model. To evaluate the efficacy of the modeling approach, the simulation results were compared to an experimental catheter prototype. Results show that the proposed approach significantly improves simulation accuracy as compared to the case where friction is not considered. In addition, the effects of friction on catheter performance were investigated using the developed modeling approach.",

We present a novel relative localization system that consists of two complementary modules: a monocular vision module and a target module with four active or passive markers. The core localization algorithm running on the modules determines the marker positions in the camera image and derives the relative robot pose in 3D space. The system is supported by a prediction mechanism based on regression. The modules are tested successfully in experiments with a quadrotor helicopter as well as on a team of two e-puck robots performing a coverage task. The relative localization system provides accuracies of a few centimeters in position and up to a few degrees in orientation. Furthermore, the system is lightweight, with low complexity and system requirements, which enables its application to a wide range of mobile robot platforms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a multi-tiered full-size road vehicle steering controller that simultaneously considers kinematics and dynamics. The kinematic controller embeds a surface for converging to the desired path that is tuned based upon vehicle capability in order to provide robust yaw rate references commands. The dynamic controller then establishes a sliding surface for yaw rate error convergence that allows the controller to be tuned based upon vehicle speed. The dynamic controller is designed to be robust to lateral disturbances characterized by side-slip angle, which is estimated by a robust observer. Simulations verify capabilities of this system with various speeds and road friction coefficients. Experiments using a full scale road vehicle with lateral disturbances demonstrate this approach at low speeds.",

The X-Arm-2 is a highly power-dense impedance-type haptic device that (1) can interact with natural human arm movement of varying operators without requiring adjustments and creating constraint forces, (2) provides crisp force-feedback through high actuator bandwidth, low residual friction and good joint torque sensor resolution, (3) has a low total mass of only 6.2 kg and (4) low inertia through a human-oriented mixed implementation of Bowden-cable relocated and directly-integrated DC actuators.",

The principle of operation of CompAct-VSA is based on a lever arm mechanism with a continuously regulated pivot point. The proposed concept allows for the development of an actuation unit with a wide range of stiffness and a fast stiffness regulation response. The implementation of the actuator makes use of a cam shaped lever arm with a variable pivot axis actuated by a rack and pinion transmission system. This realization results in a highly integrated and modular assembly. Size and weight are indeed an open issue in the VSAs design, which ultimately limit their implementation in multi-dof robotic systems. The paper introduces the mechanics, the principle of operation and the model of the actuator. Preliminary results are presented to demonstrate the fast stiffness regulation response and the wide range of stiffness achieved by the proposed CompAct-VSA design.",

Until now the developed service guide robots only navigates through the aisles of the museums without concerning the people's movement. Then, the main purpose of the work presented in this article is to develop a nonlinear controller to allow a robot to guide a person through a specific environment until it reaches a desired point taking into consideration the movement capability of the guided person. Besides the controller a person detection and tracking is also necessary in order to accomplish the guidance task. The person detection and tracking are done by using omnidirectional images. The stability of the proposed controller is proved through the Lyapunov analysis. Some experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

It is well known that IMU bias, and calibration errors between camera and IMU frames can impair the achievement of high-quality estimates through the fusion of visual and inertial data. The main contribution of this work is the design of new observers to estimate pose, IMU bias and camera-to-IMU rotation. The observers design relies on an extension of the so-called passive complementary filter on SO(3). Stability of the observers is established using Lyapunov functions under adequate observability conditions. Experimental results are presented to assess this approach.",

        "abstract": "A novel revolute nonlinear series elastic actuator called the HypoSEA is presented. The actuator uses a hypocycloid mechanism to stretch a linear spring in a nonlinear way. The actuator is optimized for highly dynamic tasks such as running and jumping, as it features a 120Nm torque capability and more than 30J of passive energy storage. When combined with a suitable controller, using the spring as an energy buffer can greatly reduce the work done by the rotor during periodic motions. The design has exceptionally low reflected mechanical impedance, making it robust against repeated impact loads. The nonlinear stiffening spring is optimized for the nonlinearities typically found in revolute-jointed hopping robots, and may be adjusted offline using a pretensioning mechanism. Finally, the low effective stiffness around the zero-torque equilibrium allows for extremely sensitive force control.",

Yet most previous works focus mainly on intrinsic calibration by modeling its systematic errors and noises while extrinsic calibration is also an important factor when constructing sensor fusion system. In this paper, we present a calibration process that can correctly transfer the depth measurements onto the color image. We use 2.5D pattern so that sufficient reprojection error can be considered for both color and ToF cameras. The issues on obtaining the correct correspondences for this pattern are discussed. In the optimization stage, the depth constraint is also employed to ensure the depth measurements to lie on the pattern plane. The strengths of the proposed method over previous approaches are evaluated in several robotic applications which require precise ToF and camera calibration.",

Here, we present a 3-DOF master-slave system based on human self-touch characteristics and a validation experiment using an arranged version of the conventional RHI paradigm. In this new version, participants can contact with the rubber hand by manipulating the master device with their right hand and actively touch their own left hand through the slave device. The results demonstrate that the master-slave system can be successfully used to manipulate body-parts ownership, opening up the way to new studies concerning self-touch and body representation.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at mobility enhancement of flexible underwater robots. For this purpose, a novel propulsion method utilizing both static and dynamic deformation of a flexible planar structure is proposed. By actuating the planar structure in two dimensions, various propulsive motions can be generated and the realization of various robotic movements can be expected. Two prototypes of such kind of robots with square and circular shape driven by two pieces of piezoelectric fiber composites has been developed. As the experimental results, the movements with multiple DOFs, holonomic and non-holonomic movements have been realized by the robots. The motion mechanism for the movements are discussed by simulation results.",

        "abstract": "The study of decomposition of body movement into motor primitives is evolving in neuroscience. Meanwhile, in robotics, the motor control of human-like musculoskeletal robots is difficult due to redundant degrees of freedom (DOF) of the robot body. The application of the concept of decomposing into units of motor function to robotics is anticipated to render the control of the robot low-dimensional. We try to achieve fewer-DOF control of a human-like musculoskeletal robot by using our knowledge of the units of motor function based on muscular coordination. In this paper, we introduce \u00bfthe agonist-antagonist muscle pairs (A-A) ratio\u00bf and \u00bfA-A activity.\u00bf These parameters are defined by using electromyographic (EMG) data for describing the coordination between the agonist and antagonist muscles. Human running is decomposed into two units of motor function using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for these parameters. We propose a new method of modular control of a musculoskeletal leg robot using the extracted patterns of muscle coordination, and we thus find kinematic meanings of the patterns of muscle coordination.",

A high performance spring component with wire actuation is employed for two-degree of freedom (DOF) bending joint, and two-DOF tendon drive system is implemented by four pneumatic cylinders. Using a continuum model for the kinematics, a PD controller with static and dynamic compensation is designed for the position control, which shows a good performance at the sufficient working frequency for surgical operations. The forceps manipulator can estimate external forces using a disturbance observer. A link approximation model is introduced to design the observer as the first intuitive approach. The force estimation can be achieved with an accuracy of 0.2 N in the basic straight posture.",

It is the first quadruped Whegs\u2122 robot of this scale. It uses differential steering and the user can rapidly change its running gear to and from tracks and wheel-legs. This is also the first implementation of carbon fiber wheel-legs on a Whegs\u2122 vehicle. The carbon-fiber reduces the mass moment of inertia eight times compared to previous aluminum designs. The running gear can be changed in 30 seconds and the resulting connections are secure. GeoSystems Zippermast allows a camera to be deployed as high as eight feet above the robot. The robot is 47.6 cm long, can travel 1.9 meters per second on its tracks, and can climb 15 cm obstacles using its wheel-legs. A two-speed transmission is being developed to permit it to run more slowly on wheel-legs for better control on irregular terrain.",

Using a standard receding horizon control framework, we compute a sequence of short-horizon optimal trajectories that can be computed in real-time. We also compute a global path that is updated only occasionally. Because the environment is very large, we presume that the global path cannot be updated in real-time. By selecting a terminal state cost in the finite-time optimal control problem that approximates the cost-to-go, we are able to propose a formal condition under which the sequence of dynamically feasible trajectories is guaranteed to converge to a desired goal location. Moreover, we show that the global path need be updated only when the formal condition is not satisfied, which allows us to delay update of the global path.",

Despite recent efforts to simplify the calculation of feature descriptors, a faster computation comes often to the disadvantage of weakening the invariance to rotation or scale. Recently, Tola et al. introduced DAISY, a new local feature descriptor for wide-baseline matching across stereo image pairs. It is shown that DAISY outperforms SIFT in terms of matching accuracy while being computed significantly faster. This paper takes on the idea of DAISY by proposing a rotational invariant extension of the descriptor, called O-DAISY, and outlining its implementation on FPGA to achieve real time performance. The results are benchmarked against its original version and against the widely used descriptors BRIEF and SURF on a standardized image set.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a scalable information theoretic approach to infer the state of an environment by distributively controlling robots equipped with sensors. The robots iteratively estimate the environment state using a recursive Bayesian filter, while continuously moving to improve the quality of the estimate by following the gradient of mutual information. Both the filter and the controller use a novel algorithm for approximating the robots' joint measurement probabilities, which combines consensus (for decentralization) and sampling (for scalability). The approximations are shown to approach the true joint measurement probabilities as the size of the consensus rounds grows or as the network becomes complete. The resulting gradient controller runs in constant time with respect to the number of robots, and linear time with respect to the number of sensor measurements and environment discretization cells, while traditional mutual information methods are exponential in all of these quantities. Furthermore, the controller is proven to be convergent between consensus rounds and, under certain conditions, is locally optimal. The complete distributed inference and coordination algorithm is demonstrated in experiments with five quad-rotor flying robots and simulations with 100 robots.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new technique for social mobile robot speech recognition based on scene-associated training models. The key contribution of the paper is a real-time framework that reduces the effect of room reverberation and ambient noise, a challenging problem in speech recognition. In classical approaches, anechoic sound is used to train the model, with the main focus on removing reverberation or noise from the sound. Our technique differs in that we train a number of speech recognizers directly from the reverberated sound, by associating each recognizer with a unique visual scene, to deal with the varying reverberation properties of different rooms. By extracting local features from a captured image and recognizing a scene, the robot can use the appropriate speech recognizer that is trained for the particular structural properties of that scene. We tested our method by using a baseline speech recognition model (HTK) across a variety of rooms and different levels of background noise. The results show that the association between a visual scene and a corresponding speech recognizer greatly improves the robot's speech recognition accuracy, together with increasing the computational speed of recognition, compared to competing techniques.",

Automatically adjusting its joint axes, the proposed device is not only capable of guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy, but also extends the usable range of motion for the knee joint. Moreover, the adjustability feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the exoskeleton, allowing more effective time be spend on exercises instead of wasting it for adjustments. The proposed system is different from the similar works in literature in that it supports both passive translational movements of the knee joint and independent active control of these degrees of freedom. In particular, we introduce implementation details of a prototype that features compact design and combines the power of three actuators to achieve high rotational torques, detail the model based impedance controller utilized to adjust interaction forces and present the experimental characterization of the exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Making biomimetic robots move like natural animals is an interesting problem, because this topic involves not only the low level algorithm that controls the movement of robots' bodies and limbs but also the high level control strategy that deals with different kinds of situations. Based on a certain biological assumption, a self-tuning multi-phase CPG for snake robots is proposed. This method imitates the control strategy of natural snake's movement in different environments, which enables the snake robot to move more quickly and naturally. Through kinematic and dynamic analysis of snake robots, optimal control parameters are chosen for the decision strategy. Due to the intrinsic property of the multi-phase CPG, this model can change the movement patterns and control parameters autonomously according to external information. As a result, such neural control provides a powerful but simple way to self-tune adaptable behaviors in snake robots.",

Especially, if encoders are not mounted on the motor shaft but on the output side of geared motors, high encoder resolutions are required. Resolution requirements may increase further if velocities are to be derived from the encoder signals, e.g., for motion control purposes. To avoid noise amplification problems when estimating angular rates from encoder signals, angular velocity sensors may be employed instead. However, a significant drawback of angular rate sensors - particularly of cheap MEMS gyroscopes - is their drift.",

We present a model of state space coverage as a function of the number of nodes in the tree, for holonomic systems in expansive configuration spaces. Based on two simplifying assumptions, we develop a stochastic difference equation, whose expected value exponentially converges to one as the number of nodes increases. The convergence rate is related through a closed form expression to the step size and a Lipschitz constant. Using a grid-based coverage measurement, we present experimental evidence supporting the model across a range of dimensions, obstacle densities and parameter choices.",

We put an accent on the sparse formulation and point out a number of advantages that it presents. In particular, motion generation with variable center of mass (CoM) height, as well as variable discretization of the preview window, come at a negligible additional computational cost. We present a sparse formulation that comprises a diagonal Hessian matrix and has only simple bounds (while still retaining the possibility to generate motions for an omnidirectional walk). Finally, we present the results from a customized code used to solve the underlying quadratic program (QP).",

Motivated by a fixed-speed, fixed-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that tracks an unpredictable target, we seek to control the turning rate of a planar Dubins vehicle. We introduce stochasticity in the problem by assuming the target performs a random walk, which both aides in the computation of a smooth value function and further accounts for all realizations of target kinematics. A Bellman equation based on an approximating Markov chain that is consistent with the stochastic kinematics is used to compute a control policy that minimizes the expected value of a cost function based on a nominal UAV-target distance. Our results indicate how uncertainty in the target motion affects the control law, and simulations illustrate that the control can further be applied to any continuous, smooth trajectory with no need for further computation.",

        "abstract": "An efficient automatic solution to the feature-based simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) of mobile robots operating in conditions where a number of competing objectives operate simultaneously is proposed. The formulation quantitatively measures the merit of incoming data with respect to multiple priorities, automatically adjusting the amount of observations to be used in the estimation process for the best possible combined outcome. The methodology enables a selection mechanism which can efficiently exploit the observations available to the robot to best fulfil the objectives of differing tasks throughout the course of a mission, e.g. localisation, mapping, exploration, feature distribution, searching for specific objects or victims, etc. The work is particularly motivated by navigation in three-dimensional terrains, and an example considering the objectives of robot localisation and map expansion in a search and rescue environment using an RGB-D camera is utilised for discussion and results.",

The gait rehabilitation system can provide mobility for an overground locomotion in forward walking and turning by a mobile platform. The exoskeleton modules are mounted on the mobile platform and attached to the lower limbs and pelvis in parallel. The synchronized motion generation for the exoskeleton modules is provided by virtue of the inverse kinematic model analysis. The pelvic trajectory is predefined and ten points are specified within one gait cycle to obtain the foot trajectory from the designated step length and height. The trajectory is obtained via curve fitting based on these specified points. On the other hand, in order to keep the desired foot trajectory, the pelvic motion is compensated to accommodate hip and knee joint angles. The proposed generation method is tested on the gait system and it has demonstrated the effectiveness and smoothness of the system.",

The approach employs idempotent and generalized pseudoinverse matrices to augment operator(s) control with some level of assistance/autonomy. An application specific task-space weighting matrix is introduced to adjust the relative weight of autonomous control with respect to human-centered teleoperation control. The task-space weighting matrix allows for a smooth continuous transition from completely autonomous to shared control, and to completely human teleoperated control. Experiments with a twin-armed mobile slave robot demonstrate the feasibility and basic functionality of the controller.",

Such controller allows setting different gains for the controller, according to the values of the velocity of the trajectory and the values of the tracking error. The noise inherent to the robot odometry is treated by the fuzzy controller itself, not requiring the use of filters. The stability of the developed controller is proven based on the theory of Lyapunov. Experimental results are also presented, and show that the proposed controller is effectively able to guide the robot during a trajectory tracking task.",

Our calibration method is based on the Correlated Random Walk (CRW) model, and consists in minimizing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance between the step length and step angle distributions of real and simulated trajectories generated by the robots. First, we validate this method by calibrating a physics-based motion model of a single 3-cm-sized robot floating at a water/air interface under fluidic agitation. Second, we extend the focus of our work to multi-robot systems by performing a sensitivity analysis of our stochastic motion model in the context of Self-Assembly (SA). In particular, we compare in simulation the effect of perturbing the calibrated parameters on the predicted distributions of self-assembled structures. More generally, we show that the SA of water-floating robots is very sensitive to even small variations of the underlying physical parameters, thus requiring real-time tracking of its dynamics.",

        "abstract": "A medical robotic system for teleoperated laser microsurgery based on a concept we have called \u201cvirtual scalpel\u201d is presented in this paper. This system allows surgeries to be safely and precisely performed using a graphics pen directly over a live video from the surgical site. This is shown to eliminate hand-eye coordination problems that affect other microsurgery systems and to make full use of the operator's manual dexterity without requiring extra training. The implementation of this system, which is based on a tablet PC and a new motorized laser micromanipulator offering 1\u00b5m aiming accuracy within the traditional line-of-sight 2D operative space, is fully described. This includes details on the system's hardware and software structures and on its calibration process, which is essential for guaranteeing precise matching between a point touched on the live video and the laser aiming point at the surgical site. Together, the new hardware and software structures make both the calibration parameters and the laser aiming accuracy (on any plane orthogonal to the imaging axis) independent of the target distance and of its motions. Automatic laser control based on new intraoperative planning software and safety improvements based on virtual features are also described in this paper, which concludes by presenting results from sets of path following evaluation experiments conducted with 10 different subjects. These demonstrate an error reduction of almost 50% when using the virtual scalpel system versus the traditional laser microsurgery setup, and an 80% error reduction when using the automatic laser control routines, evidencing great improvements in terms of precision and controllability, and suggesting that the technological advances presented herein will lead to a significantly enhanced capacity for treating a variety of internal human pathologies.",

        "abstract": "A novel controller using Center of Gravity (COG) planning based on the Centroidal Moment Pivot (CMP) criterion with Ground Reaction Force (GRF) feedback is presented. High level motion planning of the robot is done by planning a reference CMP trajectory that lies within the support polygon. In order to ensure rotational stability, the controller regulates the distance between the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and the reference CMP through COG manipulation. A reference COG trajectory is generated from the measured GRF and a simplified model of the rotational dynamics of the robot. The reference COG is then decomposed into reference joint velocities via kinematic resolution of the COG Jacobian. Planar simulations show that modifying the COG trajectory using the CMP criterion with GRF feedback increases the controller's robustness to external disturbances compared to a ZMP based controller. Additionally, the results show that the constant non-zero momentum generated by external disturbances can be regulated by minimizing the difference between the reference CMP and ZMP positions, without explicitly regulating the momentum about the COG.",

        "abstract": "We present ARGoS, a novel open source multi-robot simulator. The main design focus of ARGoS is the real-time simulation of large heterogeneous swarms of robots. Existing robot simulators obtain scalability by imposing limitations on their extensibility and on the accuracy of the robot models. By contrast, in ARGoS we pursue a deeply modular approach that allows the user both to easily add custom features and to allocate computational resources where needed by the experiment. A unique feature of ARGoS is the possibility to use multiple physics engines of different types and to assign them to different parts of the environment. Robots can migrate from one engine to another transparently. This feature enables entirely novel classes of optimizations to improve scalability and paves the way for a new approach to parallelism in robotics simulation. Results show that ARGoS can simulate about 10,000 simple wheeled robots 40% faster than real-time.",

In this paper we consider the problem of robot motion planning for large robot teams in the industrial domain. We present adaptive road map optimization (ARMO) that is capable of adapting the road map whenever the environment has changed. Based on linear programming, ARMO computes an optimal road map configuration according to environmental constraints (including human whereabouts) and the demand for transportation tasks from loading stations in the plant. For detecting dynamic changes, the environment is described by a grid map augmented with a hidden Markov model (HMM). We show experimentally that ARMO outperforms decoupled planning in terms of computation time and time needed for task completion.",

In this paper, we minimize that overhead time by allowing a simple hand to abort early and retry as soon as it realizes that the task is likely to fail. We present two key contributions. First, we learn a probabilistic model of the relationship between the likelihood of success of a grasp and its grasp signature\u2014the trace of the state of the hand along the entire grasp motion. Second, we model the iterative process of early abort and retry as a Markov chain and optimize the expected time to completion of the grasping task by effectively thresholding the likelihood of success. Experiments with our simple hand prototype tasked with grasping and singulating parts from a bin show that early abort and retry significantly increases efficiency.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A large number of applications use motion capture systems to track the location and the body posture of people. For instance, the movie industry captures actors to animate virtual characters that perform stunts. Today's tracking systems either operate with statically mounted cameras and thus can be used in confined areas only or rely on inertial sensors that allow for free and large-scale motion but suffer from drift in the pose estimate. This paper presents a novel tracking approach that aims to provide globally aligned full body posture estimates by combining a mobile robot and an inertial motion capture system. In our approach, a mobile robot equipped with a laser scanner is used to anchor the pose estimates of a person given a map of the environment. It uses a particle filter to globally localize a person wearing a motion capture suit and to robustly track the person's position. To obtain a smooth and globally aligned trajectory of the person, we solve a least squares optimization problem formulated from the motion capture suite and tracking data. Our approach has been implemented on a real robot and exhaustively tested. As the experimental evaluation shows, our system is able to provide locally precise and globally aligned estimates of the person's full body posture.",

They are ones of important factors for the system performance evaluation in addition to physical support functions of the system. The active air mat which is installed in interface parts of the exoskeleton enables a wearer to attach and release the exoskeleton in an easy way and a short time by quickly inflating the air chambers to hold a human arm or deflating them to release. The air mat adaptively fills a gap between a human arm of various sizes and an exoskeleton. In addition, the air mat minimizes constriction of blood flow by changing contacting areas with a human arm from the periphery to the trunk. The exhaust air from the deflating air chamber is used to ventilate around skin surface so that humidity of the skin could keep low by the ventilation. The active air mat is evaluated through some experiments from the viewpoint of pressure distribution, blood flow, wearing time, releasing time, body-holding rigidity, and temperature and humidity of a human skin in resting and working states.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a new endoscope robot system for general sinus surgery. The proposed endoscope can be bent in accordance with a user's intension at the time of inserting the endoscope into the sinus area, and it was designed to be bent up to 180 degrees and its diameter is about 4mm. The design of the proposed endoscope uses a spring backbone, which allows flexibility of the mechanism. A design method to determine design parameters for this device is proposed. The performance of the proposed system is verified by integration of the robot device and simulator.",

        "abstract": "Remote controlled robots on offshore oil and gas platforms can potentially reduce costs and improve environment, health and safety issues. A key to successful remote control is to provide onshore operators with a sufficient overview of the processes offshore. To this end, robot manipulators constitute flexible camera platforms, compared to e.g. simple pan-tilt units, for monitoring offshore operations. In this paper, we present a system solution and experimental results for real-time active camera control with obstacle avoidance for industrial manipulators based on weighted pseudoinverse redundancy resolution method. We extend the pseudoinverse solution for joint limit avoidance in combination with obstacle avoidance such that joint limits are gracefully avoided. A novel choice of stereographic projection provides robustness with respect to global stability and singularities. Implementation issues are addressed and the monitoring approach is experimentally validated on two Kuka KR-16 robot manipulators. Experimental results show that a follower robot with a camera is able to monitor and track a leader robot while simultaneously avoiding collisions. In addition, a robot control system architecture which ensures efficient and safe testing of new Matlab-implemented robot controllers is presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates an implementation of pool-based active learning through uncertainty sampling using a Variational Dirichlet Process (VDP) model. The VDP is used for both pre-clustering and classification, and is extended to incorporate fixed labels from an oracle (human annotator). Three different uncertainty sampling techniques are explored - least confident sampling, margin sampling and entropy based sampling. Clustering with the VDP is done in a completely unsupervised manner, without the need to specify the number of clusters. This appears particularly useful in improving the results when there are only few labelled samples, or if the cost of labelling is high. Results are shown for a toy dataset and the performance is compared to similar implementations using an Expectation Maximisation model (EM) and a Naive Bayes classifier (NB). The VDP active learning framework is tested on a stereo image dataset obtained by an autonomous underwater vehicle that covers several linear kilometres and consists of thousands of stereo image pairs. Our results show that combining an active learning strategy with the VDP significantly reduces the number of labelled images required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.",

We first introduce a seven-nodes viscoelastic model for approximating the outline and the dynamic characteristics of the object. Then, we show a shaping method of the object's outline, where the ratio between the object's length in the grasping direction and that in the perpendicular one is controlled by using a parallel jaw gripper. Based on the plastic deformation distribution for the integrated input stress, the proposed method can actively manage the final object's outline. In addition to the contribution on simplifying the gripper's degree of freedom, this method has the advantage that the handling time is drastically reduced, compared with the position based passive method. We finally show the experimental results for confirming the validity of the proposed method.",

Especially for autonomous robots, it is also necessary to make the system as simple as possible, and binaural configuration is thought to be the minimum setup for auditory systems as animals achieve practical hearing with two ears. However, the limitation of the number of ears leads insufficient performance such as accuracy in sound localization, or sound source separation. In order to overcome those difficulties, this paper proposes a novel artificial soft pinna that can move, or deform its shape actively. The developed pinna has deformable skin of silicon rubber with wires controlled by motors, and it is covered by a fur cover. Considering applications of the proposed device for auditory robots, fundamental characteristics such as accuracy of motion and auditory characteristics were investigated through experiments, which is the main contribution of the paper.",

Also, an intelligent and self-stable mechanical system is indispensable. While much effort of current research has been devoted to the development of variable impedance joint actuators, this paper deals with the important question of how to determine the actuation requirements of a compliant, musculoskeletal robot that is targeted at fast dynamic motions. In a step-by-step approach, design decisions for the elastic humanoid robot BioBiped1 are presented. Using multibody system dynamics models and simulations, incorporating bidirectional series elastic actuator models and a realistic ground contact model, we analyze the actuation requirements of the employed electrical motors for computer generated hopping and human data based running motions. The numerical simulation results are accompanied by videos of the dynamics simulations. Recent experiments on the real hardware have indicated that the selected motor-gear units and elastic transmissions support the desired dynamic motion goals.",

In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning a policy to adapt a system's controller based on the value of these external conditions in order to always perform well (i.e., maximize system output). In addition, we are concerned with systems for which it is expensive to run experiments, and therefore restrict the number that can be run during training. We formally define the problem setup and the notion of an optimal control policy. We propose two algorithms which aim to find such a policy while minimizing the number of system output evaluations. We present results comparing these algorithms and various other approaches and discuss the inherent tradeoffs in the proposed algorithms. Finally, we use these methods to train both simulated and physical snake robots to automatically adapt to changing terrain, and demonstrate improved performance on test courses with changing environments.",

The objective is to develop and evaluate techniques for missions in which several robots cooperate among themselves, interacting with a group of people. The robots detect people behaviors and act consequently adopting different strategies. Probabilistic techniques for robust cooperative detection of group and individual behavior are developed from the range finder information. Environment perception and cooperative motion planning techniques adaptable to the situation observed are developed and jointly used with the reactions to the people's behavior. In order to evaluate the system, we propose a scenario where the robots guide a group of people to a goal position. This scenario has been tested in simulations and in real experiments, to validate the techniques developed.",

        "abstract": "We present our novel Adaptive Multi-Affine (AMA) feature-matching algorithm that finds correspondences between two views of the same non-planar object. The proposed method only uses monocular images to robustly match clusters of 2-D features according to their relative position on the object surface; finally, AMA adaptively finds the best number of clusters that maximizes the number of matching features. We use AMA to recover a feature tracker from failure (e.g., loss of points due to occlusions or deformations), by robustly matching the features in the images before and after such events. This is paramount in Augmented-Reality (AR) systems for Minimally-Invasive Surgery (MIS) to cope for frequent occlusions and organ deformations that can cause the tracked image-points to drastically reduce (or even disappear) in the current video. We validated our approach on a large set of MIS videos of partial-nephrectomy surgery; AMA achieves an increased number of matches, as well as a reduced feature-matching error when compared to state-of-the-art method.",

        "abstract": "The work described in this paper concerns the problem of detecting loop-closure situations whenever an autonomous vehicle returns to previously visited places in the navigation area. An appearance-based perspective is considered by using images gathered by the on-board vision sensors for navigation tasks in heterogeneous environments characterized by the presence of buildings and urban furniture together with pedestrians and different types of vegetation. We propose a novel probabilistic on-line weight updating algorithm for the bag-of-words description of the gathered images which takes into account both prior knowledge derived from an off-line learning stage and the accuracy of the decisions taken by the algorithm along time. An intuitive measure of the ability of a certain word to contribute to the detection of a correct loop-closure is presented. The proposed strategy is extensively tested using well-known datasets obtained from challenging large-scale environments which emphasize the large improvement on its performance over previously reported works in the literature.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a human shape reconstruction method from multiple cameras in daily living environment, which leads to robust markerless motion capture. Due to continual illumination changes in daily space, it had been difficult to get human shape by background subtraction methods. Recent statistical foreground segmentation techniques based on graph-cuts, which combine background subtraction information and image contrast, provide successful results; however, they fail to extract human shape when furniture such as tables and chairs are moved. In this paper, we focus on the results of face detectors that would be independent of such background changes and help to improve the robustness under movement of background objects. We propose a robust human shape reconstruction method with the following two characteristics. One is iterative image segmentation based on graph-cuts to integrate head position information into shape reconstruction. The other is high-precision head tracker to keep multi-view consistency. Experimental results show that proposed method has enhanced human pose estimation based on reconstructed human shape, and enables the system to deal with dynamic environment.",

        "abstract": "Receding horizon control strategies have proven effective in many control and robotic applications. These methods simulate the state a certain time horizon into the future to choose the optimal trajectory. However, in many cases, such as in mobile robot navigation, the selection of an appropriate time horizon is important as too long of a time horizon can amplify the detrimental effects caused by environmental uncertainties in the prediction of the future state while too of a short horizon will lead to reduced performance. In this paper we strike a balance between these two conflicting objectives by first introducing a receding horizon method for navigation founded on schema-based behaviors. We then suggest a method of adapting the time horizon by minimizing a cost function which balances the performance of the underlying control problem (which prefers longer horizons) with the performance of our state prediction (which prefers shorter time horizons). We illustrate the operation with an example which shows the usefulness of our navigation scheme with an adaptive time horizon.",

It is based on an adaptive Kalman filter that predicts the next state of the moving target, processing the position information provided by a head-mounted stereo camera. The trajectory tracking control at the task level combines a proportional feedback and a feedforward term. The gains of both control actions are adapted in order to provide optimal dynamic response for unknown arbitrary target trajectories. Inverse differential kinematics is evaluated so that human-like joint motions are achieved. To exploit kinematic redundancy, a weighted pseudoinverse is realized that takes into account different optimization criteria. Additional self-motions of the head are also considered. Experimental results on the head of the humanoid robot ARMAR-III are presented.",

Specifically, we propose an adaptive time horizon to truncate the velocity obstacle so that its boundary closely, yet conservatively, approximates the boundary of the set of states from which collision is unavoidable. We wish to develop a representation such that any velocity vector that does not penetrate the velocity obstacle is safe, i.e. an avoidance maneuver exists, and any that does is not. Such clear partitioning between safe and unsafe velocities would allow safe planning with only one step look ahead, and can produce faster trajectories than the conservative trajectories produced when using an infinite time horizon. The computation of the adaptive time horizon is formulated as a minimum time problem, which is solved numerically for each static or moving obstacle. It is used in an on-line planner that generates locally time optimal trajectories to the goal. The planner is demonstrated for static and moving obstacles, and for on-line motion planning in a crowded dynamic environment.",

        "abstract": "There have been notable advances in learning to control complex robotic systems using methods such as Locally Weighted Regression (LWR). In this paper we explore some potential limits of LWR for robotic applications, particularly investigating its application to systems with a long horizon of temporal dependence. We define the horizon of temporal dependence as the delay from a control input to a desired change in output. LWR alone cannot be used in a temporally dependent system to find meaningful control values from only the current state variables and output, as the relationship between the input and the current state is under-constrained. By introducing a receding horizon of the future output states of the system, we show that sufficient constraint is applied to learn good solutions through LWR. The new method, Receding Horizon Locally Weighted Regression (RH-LWR), is demonstrated through one-shot learning on a real Series Elastic Actuator controlling a pendulum.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new needle deflection model that is an extension of prior work in our group based on the principles of beam theory. The use of a long flexible needle in percutaneous interventions necessitates accurate modeling of the generated curved trajectory when the needle interacts with soft tissue. Finding a feasible model is important in simulators with applications in training novice clinicians or in path planners used for needle guidance. Using intra-operative force measurements at the needle base, our approach relates mechanical and geometric properties of needle-tissue interaction to the net amount of deflection and estimates the needle curvature. To this end, tissue resistance is modeled by introducing virtual springs along the needle shaft, and the impact of needle-tissue friction is considered by adding a moving distributed external force to the bending equations. Cutting force is also incorporated by finding its equivalent sub-boundary conditions. Subsequently, the closed-from solution of the partial differential equations governing the planar deflection is obtained using Green's functions. To evaluate the performance of our model, experiments were carried out on artificial phantoms.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an automated truck platoon that has been developed under a national ITS project named Energy ITS. The project, started in 2008, aims at energy saving and global warming prevention with ITS technologies. A platoon of 3 fully-automated trucks currently drives at 80 km/h with the gap of 10 m on a test truck and along an expressway before public use, under not only steady state driving but also lane changing. The lateral control is based on the lane marker detection by the computer vision, and the longitudinal control is based on the gap measurement by 76 GHz radar and lidar in addition to the inter-vehicle communications of 5.8 GHz DSRC. The radar and lidar also work as the obstacle detection. The feature of the technologies is the high reliability, aiming at the near future introduction. Fuel consumption measurement on a test track and along an expressway shows that the fuel can be saved by about 14 %. The evaluation simulation shows that the effectiveness of the platooning with the gap of 10 m when the 40 % penetration in heavy trucks is 2.1 % reduction of CO2 along an expressway. The introduction scenario is also discussed.",

A five-mode sliding control is incorporated into position-position, force-force, and force-position teleoperation architectures. While on/off valve pneumatic actuators have previously been modeled as having three discrete operating modes, an extension to five discrete control levels as proposed here helps to improve the actuator dynamic performance and reduce the switching activities of the valves. Stability and transparency analyses of the closed-loop teleoperation system are carried out. The proposed control design is experimentally tested on a single-degree-of-freedom pneumatic teleoperation system. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracies in terms of position and force tracking in the teleoperation system.",

Most systems employ some form of 3D perception to create internal representations of space (maps) to support tasks such as navigation, manipulation and interaction. The creation and update of such representations may represent a significant effort in the overall computation performed by the robot. In this paper we propose an architecture based on the concept of Expected Perception that allows lightweight map updates whenever the course of action happens according to the robot's expectations. It is only when the robot's predictions and the real world outcomes differ, that corrections must be done at its full extent. We performed experiments and show results in a real robotic platform with stereo (3D) perception where map corrections are proposed by simple image level (2D) comparisons.",

Our robot incrementally learns semantic task structures during joint task execution using hierarchically clustered Hidden Markov Models. A semantic labeling of recognized task segments is acquired from the human partner through speech. After a small number of repetitions, the robot uses an anticipated task progress to generate a feed-forward set point for an admittance feedback control scheme. This paper describes the framework and its implementation on a mobile bi-manual platform. The evolution of the robot's task knowledge is presented and discussed.

The improvements consist of a fuzzy logic (FL) procedure for foot stance phase detection and an indirect Kalman filter (IKF) for drift correction based on the typical zero-updating (ZUPT) measurement and our proposed angular updating (AUPT) pseudo-measurement. We illustrate our findings using a real time implementation of the proposed approach. Experiments were conducted in an indoor configuration along 300 m trajectory leading to a position accuracy less than 15 cm.",

Lossy data compression is an effective approach for reducing a data size of such textures when delivering them through the Internet. This study developed an objective index that well described material-like textures' quality changes caused by data compression processes. We introduced a linear combination of the power and amplitude spectra that were weighted by the inverse of a detection threshold curve of vibrotactile stimuli. This combination described the quality deterioration of compressed textures to an accuracy of approximately 80%. These objective indices enhance the development of the lossy data compression algorithms without psychological evaluation tests of subjective quality changes in the textures.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A sliding window filter (SWF) is an appealing smoothing algorithm for nonlinear estimation problems such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), since it is resource-adaptive by controlling the size of the sliding window, and can better address the nonlinearity of the problem by relinearizing available measurements. However, due to the marginalization employed to discard old states from the sliding window, the standard SWF has different parameter observability properties from the optimal batch maximum-a-posterior (MAP) estimator. Specifically, the nullspace of the Fisher information matrix (or Hessian) has lower dimension than that of the batch MAP estimator. This implies that the standard SWF acquires spurious information, which can lead to inconsistency. To address this problem, we propose an observability-constrained (OC)-SWF where the linearization points are selected so as to ensure the correct dimension of the nullspace of the Hessian, as well as minimize the linearization errors. We present both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experimental results which show that the OC-SWF's performance is superior to the standard SWF, in terms of both accuracy and consistency.",

Our sensor consists of laser-machined Invar sheets that are assembled into a three dimensional beam. A capacitive displacement sensor is used to measure displacement of a target plate when the beam rotates, and the output voltage is correlated to applied torque. Sensor bandwidth, range, and resolution are designed to match the criteria of the robotic fly experiments while remaining insensitive to off-axis loads. We present a final sensor design with a range of \u00b1130\u00bfNm, a resolution of 4.5nNm, and bandwidth of 1kHz.",

They allow developers to compose a distributed application from a set of interacting components. Though these frameworks provide rich functionality, often they fail to cope with non-functional aspects (e.g., network scalability, predictability of system behavior) involved in system design, especially in distributed settings. This research sets out to address aforementioned quality attributes by introducing a pragmatic model, Protocol Stack View (PSV), for the analysis of distributed robotic software. The model relies on the fact that a distributed software can be viewed in terms of three main elements: components, ports and connectors. It specifically focuses on structure and semantics of software connectors on the implementation level. To prove effectiveness and usefulness of PSV a set of experiments were conducted to analyze scalability and to determine the configurable elements that affect it. The experiments are based on the comparison of communication infrastructure provided by two existing software packages, namely ROS and ZeroMQ.",

While the continuity is ensured for any a priori fixed number of tasks -even in ill-conditioned configurations-, the control resulting from a hierarchical stack-of-task computation may not be continuous under some discrete events. In particular, we study how the continuity of the stack-of-task control computation is affected under discreet scheduling operations such as on-the-fly priority switching between tasks, or tasks insertion and removal, which changes the number of tasks in the stack controller. Different ways to formulate a hierarchy of tasks are presented together with their continuity properties, which is thoroughly analyzed under such discreet scheduling operations.",

        "abstract": "The importance of the organization of angular momenta during walking has been suggested by the efforts of researchers to use it to control and stabilize walking robots. However, there has been little attention to the use of angular momenta as a metric of human walking or to gain insights into the control of walking. This paper analyzes the angular momenta of the whole body (WBAM) and body segments of during walking. The normalized angular momenta about the body center of mass (CoM) of the body segments were computed about all three coordinate axes. The normalized angular momenta were small (<0.03) and well controlled in all groups. Principal component analyses (PCA) of the angular momenta suggested that the angular momenta of the body segments were not independent and more than 95% of the variability of the whole body angular momentum could be accounted for with only three principal components (PCs) for all groups. In addition, the PCs of each plane were found to be similar between individuals and independent of walking velocity and subject morphology. The framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis was used to get further insights into the control mechanisms of the WBAM. In particular we observed that in the sagittal plane, the central neural system (CNS) takes advantage of the segment redundancy to regulate the time profile of the WBAM from stride to stride. We found that during the stance phase, this regulation makes the WBAM repeatable from stride to stride while during the double support phase it was used to adjust the WBAM from stride to stride. Based on these results, it is shown that the WBAM is a variable whose value is regulated by the CNS during walking activities. Future work in robotics may wish to further investigate the use of similar control schemes that simulate human angular momentum organization.",

        "abstract": "In this work we present a new approach for detecting loop closures in a real-time online setting. The Loop Closure Detection problem is important in visual SLAM applications and different approaches exist to deal with this problem. Most of these approaches are based on the Bag-of-Words approach, and assume a fixed visual vocabulary can work in different types of environments. However BOW is known to introduce perceptual aliasing. By using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) we are able to compute image similarity and detect loop closures by using visual features directly without vector quantization as in BOW and also LSH does not require a prior visual vocabulary. We show the effectiveness of our approach empirically by comparing it to the Bag of Words (BOW) approach which is the dominant method of selecting candidate loop closing images. Our method is fast enough for realtime applications and its accuracy is significantly better than the BOW approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Applications ranging from planetary exploration to military operations require small unmanned ground vehicles to traverse deformable terrains such as sand or moist earth. Crossing such terrains can be difficult because failure to generate enough traction can result in immobilization and mission failure. Thus, the ability to accurately predict a vehicle's traction on deformable terrain is critical. Traditionally this has been accomplished via terramechanics based on Bekker theory. However, it has been shown that classical terramechanics loses considerable accuracy when applied to vehicles with wheels less than 50cm in diameter. This paper details the development of a modification to the pressure-sinkage relationship used in Bekker theory that explicitly includes a dependence on wheel diameter. The new model is integrated into a numerical simulation that predicts the tractive performance of an experimental unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Field tests are performed on sandy terrain, and the results validate the simulated predictions. The new model is found to be significantly more accurate than previous models.",

The redundancy at this level of the tasks is due to a large number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of the arm-hand system. This redundancy constitutes a big challenge to the planning and control tasks of the robot. For this kind of tasks, human has his own choices privileging certain configurations over the others. These choices come from a long learning process which implicitly takes into account the mechanical constraints of the system. In this work, we concentrate our effort on deciphering certain mechanical constraints, \u00bftenodesis\u00bf phenomenon in particular, in order to solve the redundancy and imitate the human natural gestures in the tasks of grasping or in-hand manipulation.",

One of the key issues is to find out the optimal way of allocating the assembly subtasks to both human and robot. In this paper, a model for assembly strategy generation and selection for human and robot coordinated (HRC) cell assembly is proposed. A Dual Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) model is theoretically researched and then built based on a practical assembly task for human and robot coordination. Based on GSPN, Monte Carlo method is carried out to study the time cost and payment cost for possible strategies, and Multiple-Objective Optimization (MOOP) method related Cost-effectiveness analysis is adopted to select the optimal ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the simulation and experimental results.",

Furthermore, a robot is not only subject to the ego noise, but also to the ambient noise of the environment, both having different short-term signal characteristics. Because ego-motion noise generated by the motors is non-stationary, and the BackGround Noise (BGN) is stationary, one single noise estimation method is unable to track the changes in both noise spectra rapidly and accurately. Therefore, we propose to use the combination of two different noise estimation methods adequate for each one of co-existing noise types in a unified framework: 1) a stationary noise estimation method called Histogram-based Recursive Level Estimation (HRLE) and 2) a non-stationary noise estimation method called Template-based Estimation (TE). In this paper, we evaluate the performance of several single-channel based noise estimation techniques in terms of their prediction accuracy and quality of the speech signals enhanced by spectral subtraction methods. The experimental results show that our system, compared to the conventional single-stage noise estimation methods, achieves better performance in attaining signal quality and improving word correct rates.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, \u201cuser-cooperative\u201d control strategies are commonly used in robot-assisted motor (re-)learning. User-cooperative strategies enable compliant haptic interactions between robot and user: the robot only intervenes as needed, instead of forcing the user to follow a fixed predefined movement. However, the effectiveness of user-cooperative control is contro-versially discussed. Recent studies indicate that the effectiveness of user-cooperative control strategies will be enhanced when every user is individually provided with an optimal amount of assistance or challenge. In conventional motor (re-)learning, such an optimal amount of assistance or challenge is successfully applied by physiotherapists and trainers.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A desirable property of path planning for robotic manipulation is the ability to identify solutions in a sufficiently short amount of time to be usable. This is particularly challenging for the manipulation problem due to the need to plan over high-dimensional configuration spaces and to perform computationally expensive collision checking procedures. Consequently, existing planners take steps to achieve desired solution times at the cost of low quality solutions. This paper presents a planning algorithm that overcomes these difficulties by augmenting the asymptotically-optimal RRT* with a sparse sampling procedure. With the addition of a collision checking procedure that leverages memoization, this approach has the benefit that it quickly identifies low-cost feasible trajectories and takes advantage of subsequent computation time to refine the solution towards an optimal one. We evaluate the algorithm through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of seven, twelve, and fourteen degree of freedom manipulation planning problems in a realistic simulation environment. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides significant improvements in the quality of both the initial solution and the final path, while incurring almost no computational overhead compared to the RRT algorithm. We conclude with a demonstration of our algorithm for single-arm and dual-arm planning on Willow Garage's PR2 robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new asynchronous approach for haptic rendering of deformable objects. When stiff nonlinear deformations take place, they introduce important and rapid variations of the force sent to the user. This problem is similar to the stiff virtual wall for which a high refresh rate is required to obtain a stable haptic feedback. However, when dealing with several interacting deformable objects, it is usually impossible to simulate all objects at high rates. To address this problem we propose a quasi-static framework that allows for stable interactions of asynchronously computed deformable objects. In the proposed approach, a deformable object can be computed at high refresh rates, while the remaining deformable virtual objects remain computed at low refresh rates. Moreover, contacts and other constraints between the different objects of the virtual environment are accurately solved using a shared Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). Finally, we demonstrate our method on two test cases: a snap-in example involving non-linear deformations and a virtual thread interacting with a deformable object.",

Introduced for the algorithm development is a quaternion feedback structure, where bias terms in the gyroscope rate information, appearing in the phase-locked loop, are identified with the theoretical guarantee of the global and asymptotical stability. The bias-term identification and modification process is performed continuously without the influence of the disturbance by combining the proposed disturbance evaluation scheme and the conventional vector matching method. Practical validity of the presented framework is fully evaluated by experiments. The evaluation result shows that the approach in this paper can offer drift-free performance with property of disturbance attenuation and rejection under arbitrary high-frequency attitude test motion of spatial rotation and translation.",

This microhand system could perform dexterous tasks such as cell rotation, single cell pick-and-place, cell patterning, and measurement of mechanical properties of living cells. However, it is a tedious task to manipulate micro objects manually. In order to improve the efficiency of the system, automated micromanipulation is required. This paper describes how to automate micromanipulation for this two-fingered microhand so that it can perform desired tasks more efficiently, more accurately, and faster. By integrating an All-In-Focus imaging system to the microhand system, 3D positions of the two microfinger tips and micro target objects can be obtained. These 3D positions are necessary for the microhand to handle the target object automatically. We demonstrate this capability by a pick-and-place task with multi-sized microspheres. Short time for object grasping and success rate over 70% for all cases could be achieved.",

The framework is based on spinal pedicle data obtained from computed tomography (CT) images, and provides optimal insertion trajectories and pedicle screw sizes. The proposed approach begins with a safety margin estimation for each potential insertion trajectory that passes through the pedicle volume, followed by procedures to collect a set of insertion trajectories that satisfy operation safety objectives. Among the trajectory candidates, the insertion trajectory, which maximizes the insertable depth of a pedicle screw into the vertebral body, is then chosen as optimal, because the insertable depth enhances the strength of the transpedicular screw-vertebra interface after spinal fusion surgery. The radius of a pedicle screw was chosen as 70% of the pedicle radius. This framework has been tested on 68 spinal pedicles of 8 patients requiring spinal fusion. It was successfully applied, resulting in an average success rate of 100% and a final safety margin of 2.11\u00b10.17mm.",

However, increasing the efficiency of today's transportation infrastructure will require intelligent traffic control mechanisms that work hand in hand with intelligent vehicles. To this end, Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control mechanism called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed in simulation that by studying the problem from a multiagent perspective, intersection control can be made more efficient than existing control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. We extend their study beyond the case of an individual intersection and examine the unique implications and abilities afforded by using AIM-based agents to control a network of interconnected intersections. We examine different navigation policies by which autonomous vehicles can dynamically alter their planned paths, observe an instance of Braess' paradox, and explore the new possibility of dynamically reversing the flow of traffic along lanes in response to minute-by-minute traffic conditions. Studying this multiagent system in simulation, we quantify the substantial improvements in efficiency imparted by these agent-based traffic control methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robot that acquires multi-modal information, i.e. auditory, visual, and haptic information, fully autonomous way using its embodiment. We also propose an online algorithm of multimodal categorization based on the acquired multimodal information and words, which are partially given by human users. The proposed framework makes it possible for the robot to learn object concepts naturally in everyday operation in conjunction with a small amount of linguistic information from human users. In order to obtain multimodal information, the robot detects an object on a fla surface. Then the robot grasps and shakes it for gaining haptic and auditory information. For obtaining visual information, the robot uses a hand held small observation table, so that the robot can control the viewpoints for observing the object. As for the multimodal concept formation, the multimodal LDA using Gibbs sampling is extended to the online version in this paper. The proposed algorithms are implemented on a real robot and tested using real everyday objects in order to show validity of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to enable a humanoid robot to autonomously climb up spiral staircases. This task is substantially more challenging than climbing straight stairs since careful repositioning is needed. Our system globally estimates the pose of the robot, which is subsequently refined by integrating visual observations. In this way, the robot can accurately determine its relative position with respect to the next step. We use a 3D model of the environment to project edges corresponding to stair contours into monocular camera images. By detecting edges in the images and associating them to projected model edges, the robot is able to accurately locate itself towards the stairs and to climb them. We present experiments carried out with a Nao humanoid equipped with a 2D laser range finder for global localization and a low-cost monocular camera for short-range sensing. As we show in the experiments, the robot reliably climbs up the steps of a spiral staircase.",

        "abstract": "We examine the problem of planning paths for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect data from an underwater sensor network. The sensors in the network are equipped with acoustic modems that provide noisy, range-limited communication. The AUV must plan a path that maximizes the information collected while minimizing travel time or fuel expenditure. This problem is closely related to the classical Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), but differs in that data from a particular sensor has a probability of being collected depending on the quality of communication. We propose methods for solving this problem by extending approximation algorithms for variants of TSP, and we compare our proposed algorithms to baseline strategies through simulated experiments with varying levels of communication quality. Our simulations utilize a realistic model of acoustic communication to determine the probability of acquiring data from each sensor. The results demonstrate that planning the tour for the entire network while exploiting the communication model during planning improves performance versus myopic methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an implementation of autonomous indoor aerial gripping using a low-cost, custom-built quadrotor. Such research extends the typical functionality of micro air vehicles (MAV) from passive observation and sensing to dynamic interaction with the environment. To achieve this, three major challenges are overcome: precise positioning, sensing and manipulation of the object, and stabilization in the presence of disturbance due to interaction with the object. Navigation in unstructured, GPS-denied environments is achieved using a visual SLAM algorithm that relies on an onboard monocular camera. A secondary camera, capable of detecting infrared light sources, is used to estimate the 3D location of the object, while an under-actuated and passively compliant manipulator is designed for effective gripping under uncertainty. The system utilizes nested PID controllers for attitude stabilization, vision-based navigation and gripping. The quadrotor is therefore able to autonomously navigate, locate and grasp an object, using only onboard sensors.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in autonomous navigation for lightweight flying robots in indoor environments. Miniature airships, which are an instance of such robots, are especially challenging since they behave nonlinearly, typically are under-actuated, and also are subject to drift. These aspects, paired with their high-dimensional state space, demand efficient planning and control techniques. In this paper, we present a highly effective approach to autonomous navigation of miniature blimps in mapped environments which applies a multi-stage algorithm to accomplish strongly goal-directed tree-based kinodynamic planning. It performs path-guided sampling and optimally selects actions leading the robot towards sampled subgoals. Based on this, our approach can quickly provide a partial trajectory, which is extended and refined in the consecutive planning steps. The navigation system has been implemented and is able to reliably operate a robotic blimp in a real-world setting. Further experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms a standard tree planner.",

Current solutions for perch-and-stare applications utilize various methods to create an aircraft that can land on a limited set of surfaces that are typically horizontal or vertical planes. This paper presents a bio-inspired concept that allows for passive perching on cylindrical-type surfaces. The prototype provides compliant gripping through the use of an underactuated foot. A mechanism inspired by songbird anatomy is integrated that utilizes rotorcraft weight as a way to passively actuate the foot. Successful perching trials on two rods of differing diameters were performed and are discussed. The purpose of this initial design is to act as a proof of concept for the mechanical action of the mechanism; our results demonstrate that passive perching can be achieved through the integration of underactuated gripping with mechanism-generated mechanical advantage.",

        "abstract": "Joint limits avoidance is a crucial issue in sensor-based control. In this paper we propose an avoidance strategy based on a low-level data fusion. The joint positions of a robot arm are considered as features that are continuously added to the control scheme when they approach the joint limits, and removed when the position is safe. We expose an optimal tuning of the avoidance scheme, ensuring the main task is disturbed as little as possible. We propose additional strategies to solve the particular cases of unsafe desired position and local minima. The control scheme is applied to the avoidance of joint limits while performing visual servoing. Both simulation and experimental results illustrate the validity of our approach.",

        "abstract": "In mobile robot path tracking applications, an autonomous vehicle is steered to stay as close as possible to a desired path. If lateral wheel slip is an important variable, as it is the case at high speed and due to low tire-ground friction in off-road applications, limits of the steering actuators, the major input constraints of the system, have a major influence on the tracking control performance. This paper presents an algorithm to control the longitudinal velocity, a secondary control variable, of a mobile robot in order to respect the boundedness of the steering angle, and thus to improve the vehicle safety. The applicability of the algorithm has been verified through experiments with an off-road mobile robot.",

Approaches that rely on the visual appearance of distinct scenes have recently been developed and applied to large scale SLAM scenarios. FAB-Map is maybe the most successful of these systems. Our paper proposes BRIEF-Gist, a very simplistic appearance-based place recognition system based on the BRIEF descriptor. BRIEF-Gist is much more easy to implement and more efficient compared to recent approaches like FAB-Map. Despite its simplicity, we can show that it performs comparably well as a front-end for large scale SLAM. We benchmark our approach using two standard datasets and perform SLAM on the 66 km long urban St. Lucia dataset.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient and featureless approach to Bathymetric Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) that utilizes a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) and Gaussian Process (GP) Regression to provide loop closures in areas where little to no overlap with previously explored terrain is present. To significantly reduce the memory requirements of this approach (thereby allowing for the processing of large datasets) a novel map representation is also introduced that, instead of directly storing estimates of seabed depth, records the trajectory of each particle and synchronizes them to a common log of bathymetric observations. Upon detecting a loop closure each particle is then weighted by matching new observations to the current predictions generated from a local reconstruction of their map using GP Regression. Here the spatial correlation in the environment is fully exploited, allowing predictions of seabed depth to be generated in areas that may not have been directly observed previously. The particle resampling that is performed therefore not only enforces self-consistency in overlapping sections of the map but additionally enforces self-consistency between neighboring map borders. The results demonstrate how observations of seafloor structure with partial overlap can be used by bathymetric SLAM to improve map self consistency when compared to Dead Reckoning fused with Long-Baseline observations. In addition we show how mapping corrections can still be achieved even when no map overlap is present.",

The method consists of 1) segmentation of trajectory data into staying or moving and classification of the segments and 2) prediction by time-series association rules from transition events of each segment. The method predicts the start time of target behaviors for daily life support, such as eating, taking a bath etc. The time lag between the prediction and the target behavior can be set up manually, thus the method is adaptable to a variety of supporting systems. The experimental results using real residents' trajectory data of almost two years demonstrate that prediction of behaviors by the proposed method is feasible.",

We have also developed an autonomous instructor in simulation and used it to generate training data from which we have cloned controllers. The resulting controllers perform at a level comparable to that of a human expert.

A localization algorithm should be robust, it should give the estimate of unreliability and it should be able to recover from errors. The above requirements are often trade offs with the computational complexity. This paper presents a global localization algorithm that matches a local point map (acquired e.g. with a laser range finder) to a global map. The algorithm makes a discrete search using a best-first branch and bound method to efficiently compute the globally optimal pose estimate. Moreover, the degree of ambiguity of the pose estimate can be determined as the algorithm yields all potential pose solution candidates within the search space. Experimental results are given to show the behavior and performance analysis of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The ability to manipulate deformable objects, such as textiles or paper, is a major prerequisite to bringing the capabilities of articulated robot hands closer to the level of manual intelligence exhibited by humans. We concentrate on the manipulation of paper, which affords us a rich interaction domain and that has not yet been solved for anthropomorphic robot hands. A key ability needed for this is the robust tracking and modelling of paper under conditions of occlusion and strong deformation. We present a marker based framework that realizes these properties robustly and in real-time. We compare a purely mathematical representation of the paper manifold with a soft-body-physics model and demonstrate the use of our visual tracking method to facilitate the coordination of two anthropomorphic 20 DOF Shadow Dexterous Hands while they grasp a flat-lying piece of paper, using a combination of visually guided bulging and pinching.",

        "abstract": "When collaboration between human users and robots involves physical interaction, the importance of the safety issue arises. We propose a method to transfer to robots several tasks demonstrated by the user through kinesthetic teaching and subsequently learned using a weighted combination of dynamical systems (DS). The approach used to encode the desired skills ensures a safe robot behavior during the task reproduction, allowing physical interaction with the user who can employ the manipulator as a tangible interface. By using a force sensor-less impedance controller with a back-drivable robot, this concept is exploited in two physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) scenarios. The first considers an emergency situation in which the user can stop or pause a task execution by grasping and moving the robot away from the region of space associated to the skill. The second studies the possibility to select one among several learned tasks and switch to its execution by physically guiding the robot towards the task region.",

The properties of a 3D bearing-formation are analyzed, and a minimal set of bearings needed for its definition is provided. We also design a novel decentralized formation control almost globally convergent and able to maintain bounded and non-vanishing inter-distances among the agents despite the absence of direct distance measurements. Furthermore, we develop a multi-master/ multi-slave teleoperation setup in order to control the overall behavior of the group and to convey to the human operator suitable force cues, while ensuring stability in presence of delays and packet losses over the master-slave communication channel. The theoretical framework is validated by means of extensive human/hardware in-the-loop simulations using two force-feedback devices and a group of quadrotors.",

Especially, grasping and manipulation require new approaches that can accommodate for an object's variable and changing appearance. In this paper, we present a system that is capable of fully autonomously transforming a clothing item from a random crumpled configuration into a folded state. We describe a method to compute valid grasp poses on the cloth which accounts for deformability. Our algorithm includes a novel fold detection and grasp generation strategy, which suggests grasp poses on cloth folds. Machine learning techniques are used to evaluate these grasp poses. In our experiments, we use a stock PR2 robot whose two arms alternatingly perform grasps on a T-shirt equipped with fiducial markers. The goal of this grasp sequence is to bring the T-shirt into a configuration from which the robot can fold it. In several experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our approach.",

        "abstract": "We describe the design of an active soft ankle-foot orthotic device powered by pneumatic artificial muscles for treating gait pathologies associated with neuromuscular disorders. The design is inspired by the biological musculoskeletal system of a human foot and a lower leg, and mimics the muscle-tendon-ligament structure. A key feature of the device is that it is fabricated with flexible and soft materials that provide assistance without restricting degrees of freedom at the ankle joint. Three pneumatic artificial muscles assist dorsiflexion as well as inversion and eversion. The prototype is also equipped with various embedded sensors for gait training and gait pattern analysis. The prototype is capable of 12\u00b0 dorsiflexion from a resting position of an ankle joint and a 20\u00b0 dorsiflexion from plantarflexion. Results of early feedback control experiments show controllability of ankle joint angles. Ultimately, we envision a system that not only can provide physical support to improve mobility but also can increase safety and stability during walking, while enhancing muscle usage and encouraging rehabilitation.",

Similar to the cockroach's motion, the gait is composed by two stages: rearing stage to lift the front side of the body, and lifting stage to maneuver the center of mass of the body to pass the edge of the step. The inclinometer is utilized to detect the height of the step during crossing, so the robot can automatically adjust the gait to cross the steps with different heights.

We combine mechatronic compliance with structural compliance due to the use of flexible materials. And we explore how these capabilities allow to enforce morphological computation in the design of robust dynamic locomotion. We also investigate the use of compliance to design semi-passive motor primitives using the torso and the arms as a system of accumulation/release of potential/kinetic energy.",

These subsystems, which include the statically unstable body, multiple highly actuated fins, oscillatory neural controllers, and distributed senses, are not often studied as mutually dependent systems. This research program is developing biorobotic models of these systems and integrating the systems into a biorobotic fish so that interdependencies can be explored during free swimming. The robot body was derived from a bluegill sunfish, and has a tunable mass distribution and a mixture of rigid and flexible sections so that dynamical characteristics of the fish body can be explored. Five highly deformable fins have structural properties scaled to those of biological fins and can create gait patterns for steady swimming and maneuvers. A first generation artificial CPG has been programmed for each fin on a network of five low power microcontrollers. Finally, a dedicated biorobotic pectoral fin has been developed and instrumented with distributed sensory systems so relevant physical (e.g., fin curvature) and hydrodynamic (e.g., pressure) data can be identified and used to predict fin force for closed loop control.",

The presented methods include (i) the derivation of a Capture Point (CP) control principle based on the natural dynamics of the linear inverted pendulum (LIP), which stabilizes the walking robot and motivates (ii) the design of a CP tracking and a CP end-of-step controller. The exponential stability of the CP control law is proven. Tilting is avoided by proper projection of the commanded zero moment point. The robustness of the derived control algorithms is analyzed analytically and verified in simulation and experiments.",

        "abstract": "We present a learning-based approach for minimizing the electric energy consumption during walking of a passively-compliant bipedal robot. The energy consumption is reduced by learning a varying-height center-of-mass trajectory which uses efficiently the robot's passive compliance. To do this, we propose a reinforcement learning method which evolves the policy parameterization dynamically during the learning process and thus manages to find better policies faster than by using fixed parameterization. The method is first tested on a function approximation task, and then applied to the humanoid robot COMAN where it achieves significant energy reduction.",

It is different from other learning problems as the agent starts with uninterpreted observations and commands, and with minimal prior information about the world. in this paper, we give a mathematical formalization of this aspect of the problem. We argue that the vague constrain of having \u201cno prior information\u201d can be recast as a precise algebraic condition on the agent: that its behavior is invariant to particular classes of nuisances on the world, which we show can be well represented by actions of groups (diffeomorphisms, permutations, linear transformations) on observations and commans. We then introduce the class of bilinear gradient dynamics sensors (BGDS) as a candidate for learning generic robotic sensorimotor cascades. We show how framing the problem as rejection of group nuisances allows a compact and modular analysis of typical preprocessing stages, such as learning the topology of the sensors. We demonstrate learning and using such models on real-word range-finder and camera date from publicly available datasets.",

        "abstract": "Building facade detection is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in mobile robotics and semantic scene understanding. In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with an accurate segmentation of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for segmenting and labeling an input image that for each pixel, seeks to answer the question \u00bfIs this pixel part of a building facade, and if so, which one?\u00bf The proposed method determines a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar model. The corresponding disparity map and a discriminative classification provide prior information for a two-layer Markov Random Field model. This MRF problem is solved via Graph Cuts to obtain a labeling of building facade pixels at the mid-level, and a segmentation of those pixels into particular planes at the high-level. The results indicate a strong improvement in the accuracy of the binary building detection problem over the discriminative classifier alone, and the planar surface estimates provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.",

In this paper, an innovative simulation framework for the simulation of tendon-driven robots is presented. It consists of a generic physics simulator capable of utilizing CAD robot models and a set of additional tools for simulation control, data acquisition and system investigation. The framework software architecture has been designed using component-based development principles to facilitate the framework extension and customization. Furthermore, for inter-component communication, the operating-system and programming language independent Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) [1] has been used which simplifies the integration of the framework into existing software environments.",

We perform an error bound analysis for caging grasps derived in this manner and provide theoretical values of this bound for four micro-parts of interest. We demonstrate experimental results of the caging micromanipulation transport primitive using these feature-defined grasps and compare them with the expected error bounds.

This research demonstrates the use of a capacitive skin sensor for collision detection. Tests demonstrate that the sensor reduces impact forces and can detect and characterize collision events, providing information that may be used in the future for force reduction behaviors. Various parameters that affect collision severity, including interface friction, interface stiffness, end tip velocity and joint stiffness irrespective of controller bandwidth are also explored using the sensor to provide information about the contact force at the site of impact. Joint stiffness is made independent of controller bandwidth limitations using passive torsional springs of various stiffnesses. Results indicate a positive correlation between peak impact force and joint stiffness, skin friction and interface stiffness, with implications for future skin and robot link designs and post-collision behaviors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a sensor fusion system of cameras and 2D laser sensors for 3D reconstruction. The proposed system is designed to capture data on a fast-moving ground vehicle. The system consists of six cameras and one 2D laser sensor. In order to capture data at high speed, we synchronized all sensors by detecting the laser ray at a specific angle and generating a trigger signal for the cameras. Reconstruction of 3D structures is done by estimating frame-by-frame motion and accumulating vertical laser scans. The difference between the proposed system and the previous works using two 2D laser sensors is that we do not assume 2D motion. The motion of the system in 3D space (including absolute scale) is estimated accurately by data-level fusion of images and range data. The problem of error accumulation is solved by loop closing, not by GPS. The moving objects are detected by utilizing the depth information provided by the laser sensor. The experimental results show that the estimated path is successfully overlayed on the satellite images.",

        "abstract": "The variable stiffness actuation (VSA) technology has been recently developed and applied in robotic arms. Mechanism robustness, high peak torque and velocity, and stiffness adjustment flexibility are key benefits of VSA joints. However, the achievable Cartesian stiffness by uncoupled VSA joints is limited. Therefore we suggest and analyze the use of an active impedance controller in combination with the passive joints to further increase the stiffness range. An algorithm to optimize the passive and active Cartesian stiffness is proposed to achieve a desired Cartesian stiffness as precise as possible. The algorithm was implemented and tested on the VSA robot DLR Hand Arm System. Experimental results and measurements of the active/passive impedance algorithm are shown.",

        "abstract": "In the field of bioscience, such as regeneration medicine and cloning, the manipulation and analysis for cells are performed by many researchers. However, manual operation for such micro objects is not feasible and practical for beginner operators. As for the problem, we have developed a two-fingered microhand supporting manual operation. Using the microhand, we can manipulate cells i.e., grab, rotate, carry, and so on - like when using chop sticks. The stiffness measurement of a cell is a key approach in single cell analysis techniques. It is important in indicating cell condition, because the stiffness of a cancer cell is lower than that of a normal cell as an example. However, measuring stiffness is very difficult, because deformations of cell are plasticly, and many researches to measure the stiffness of cell don't deal with plastic deformation. So, in this paper, the cell hardness is calculated instead of cell stiffness by measuring the reaction force caused in the process of cell deformation via a micro force sensor attached to the end-effector of the microhand. Our results point out that this can be one efficient measurement method for acquiring cell hardness. In this paper, three topics are discussed. First one is the fabrication of the end-effector with micro force sensor. Second one is the method of measuring hardness of cell. As a last one, the hardness of the fibroblastic cell is measured by proposed method and the effectiveness of the proposal technique is shown.",

The proposed sensor is commonly used as the sensing component in optical computer mice. The performance of the sensor was tested against objects with various optical properties to get a measure of slip detection accuracy for objects that an amputee may encounter on a daily basis. The sensor was found to accurately detect motion for the majority of the tested surfaces, with the exception of transparent surfaces or those with very high reflectivity. This research may help the development of a controlled prostheses that could assist an amputee in grasping an object for long periods of time without dropping it.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a vision-based algorithm to autonomously track and chase a moving target with a small-size flying UAV. The challenging constraints associated with the UAV flight led us to consider a density-based representation of the object to track. The proposed approach to estimate the target's position, orientation and scale, is built on a robust color-based tracker using a multi-part representation. This object tracker can handle large displacements, occlusions and account for some image noise due to partial loss of wireless video link, thanks to the use of a particle filter. The information obtained from the visual tracker is then used to control the position and yaw angle of the UAV in order to chase the target. A hierarchical control scheme is designed to achieve the tracking task. Experiments on a quad-rotor UAV following a small moving car are provided to validate the proposed approach.",

However, its ability to be used as a source of propulsion for artificial microsystems is of great interest to the micro-robotics community; its high efficiency in converting chemical energy to motion is highly attractive for microsystems that demand a low payload and high rate of actuation. In this paper, we describe the behavior of Serratia marcescens bacteria-propelled polystyrene beads in the presence of a chemoattractant, L-threonine. We compare the results of this chemotactic behavior to that bacteria-propelled bead without a chemoattractant. The results from this analysis indicate a clear sign of directionality, as well as an improved bead velocity, for the bacteria-attached microbeads in the presence of a chemoattractant.",

In previous work, risk-bounded searches were shown to offer in excess of 70% efficiency increases over normal heuristic search methods. The technique relies on precomputing distance estimates to landmarks which are then used to produce probability distributions over exact heuristics for use in heuristic searches such as A* and D*. The location and number of these landmarks therefore influence greatly the efficiency of the search and the quality of the risk bounds. Here four new methods of selecting landmarks for risk based search are evaluated. Results are shown which demonstrate that landmark selection needs to take into account the centrality of the landmark, and that diminishing rewards are obtained from using large numbers of landmarks.",

        "abstract": "High-rise tasks in agriculture, forestry and building industry requires robots possessing climbing function. Motivated by these potential applications and inspired by the climbing motion of animals such as inchworms, we have developed a novel biped climbing robot - Climbot. Built with a modular approach, the robot consists of five 1-DoF joint modules connected in series and two special grippers mounted at the ends. With this configuration, Climbot is able not only to climb a variety of media, but also to grasp and manipulate objects, and hence is a \u201cmobile\u201d manipulator. In this paper, we first introduce the development of this novel robot, and then illustrate three climbing gaits based on the unique configuration of the robot. Experiments of climbing poles are carried out to verify the climbing functions and to demonstrate potential application of the proposed robot.",

This clustering algorithm improves the computational scaling of the contingency planner by limiting the total number of required contingency paths while preserving the performance advantages of exhaustive contingency planning. This algorithm seeks to maximize dissimilarity between trajectory clusters with regard to their potential effect on a robot's future path. Simulation results show that the clustering algorithm allows a robot to maintain many of the benefits of contingency planning while requiring fewer contingency paths.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Detection of internal puncture during manual needle insertion is challenging due to the large friction force between a needle shaft and surrounding tissue, which masks small changes in force at the needle tip. A novel robotic coaxial needle insertion assistant was developed to enhance operator perception during epidural puncture. The coaxial needle separates the cutting force at the needle tip from shear friction on the needle shaft. When the assistant is inactive, the human operator controls the motion of the coaxial needle. When the assistant is active under position control, a motor controls the motion of the outer needle, while the operator controls only the motion of the inner needle. When the assistant is active under force control, the operator controls the motion of the entire needle, but receives force feedback that is a scaled version of the force applied by the needle tip to the tissue. The effectiveness of the assistant in enabling puncture detection was tested in an experiment in which users were asked to puncture artificial tissues with the assistant inactive and active. Results show that the ratio of successful to unsuccessful puncture detection was higher with the assistant than without. In addition, users were more confident that they could perceive the moment of puncture. However, when the users successfully perceived puncture, overshoot with the assistant was larger than without.",

        "abstract": "Attention operators based on 2D image cues (such as color, texture) are well known and discussed extensively in the vision literature but are not ideally suited for robotic applications. In such contexts it is the 3D structure of scene elements that makes them interesting or not. We show how a bottom-up exploration mechanism that fuses 2D saliency-based conspicuity with spatial abstraction resulting from the coherent plane estimation and stereo line detection is well suited for typical indoor robotics tasks. This spatial abstraction is performed by a joint probabilistic model which takes the interaction of stereo line detection and 3D supporting plane estimation into consideration. By maximizing the probability of the joint model, our method facilitates reduction of false-positive stereo line detection and refines the estimation of supporting surface simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate and plausible attention.",

We achieve this by fusing measurements from the onboard inertial sensors on each platform with information obtained from feature correspondences between the two cameras using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This forms a flexible stereo rig, providing the ability to treat the two robots as one single dynamic sensor, which can adapt to the environment and thus improve environmental mapping, obstacle avoidance and navigation. We demonstrate the power of this approach on both simulation and real datasets, employing two micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) to illustrate successful operation over general 3D motion.",

Our system processes images from a monocular camera and combines this information with domain knowledge. The recognition works on-line and in real-time, it is independent of the test person, but limited to predefined view-points. Main contributions of this paper are the extensible, multi-level modeling of the robot's vision system, the efficient activity and motion recognition, and the asynchronous information fusion based on generic processing of mid-level recognition results. The complementarity of the activity and motion recognition renders the approach robust against misclassifications. Experimental results on a real-world data set of complex kitchen tasks, e.g., Prepare Cereals or Lay Table, prove the performance and robustness of the multi-level recognition approach.",

Two different bag-of-words saliency metrics are introduced\u2014global saliency and local saliency. Global saliency measures the rarity of an image throughout the entire data set, while local saliency describes the amount of texture richness in an image. The former is important in measuring an overall global saliency map for a given area, and is motivated from inverse document frequency (a measure of rarity) in information retrieval. Local saliency is defined by computing the entropy of the bag-of-words histogram, and is useful to avoid adding visually benign key frames to the map. The two different metrics are presented and experimentally evaluated with indoor and underwater imagery to verify their utility.",

        "abstract": "Research on robotic manipulation has primarily focused on grasping rigid objects using a single manipulator. It is however evident that in order to be truly pervasive, service robots will need to handle deformable objects, possibly with two arms. In this paper we tackle the problem of using cooperative manipulators to perform towel folding tasks. Differently from other approaches, our method executes what we call a momentum fold - a swinging motion that exploits the dynamics of the object being manipulated. We propose a new learning algorithm that combines imitation and reinforcement learning. Human demonstrations are used to reduce the search space of the reinforcement learning algorithm, which then quickly converges to its final solution. The strengths of the algorithm come from its efficient processing, fast learning capabilities, absence of a deformable object model, and applicability to other problems exhibiting temporally incoherent parameter spaces. A wide range of experiments were performed on a robotic platform, demonstrating the algorithm's capability and practicality.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach to obtain a localisation that is robust to smoke by exploiting multiple sensing modalities: visual and infrared (IR) cameras. This localisation is based on a state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm. First, we show that a reasonably accurate localisation can be obtained in the presence of smoke by using only an IR camera, a sensor that is hardly affected by smoke, contrary to a visual camera (operating in the visible spectrum). Second, we demonstrate that improved results can be obtained by combining the information from the two sensor modalities (visual and IR cameras). Third, we show that by detecting the impact of smoke on the visual images using a data quality metric, we can anticipate and mitigate the degradation in performance of the localisation by discarding the most affected data. The experimental validation presents multiple trajectories estimated by the various methods considered, all thoroughly compared to an accurate dGPS/INS reference.",

        "abstract": "Ground segmentation is critical for a mobile robot to successfully accomplish its tasks in challenging environments. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised radar-vision classification system that allows an autonomous vehicle, operating in natural terrains, to automatically construct online a visual model of the ground and perform accurate ground segmentation. The system features two main phases: the training phase and the classification phase. The training stage relies on radar measurements to drive the selection of ground patches in the camera images, and learn online the visual appearance of the ground. In the classification stage, the visual model of the ground can be used to perform high level tasks such as image segmentation and terrain classification, as well as to solve radar ambiguities. The proposed method leads to the following main advantages: (a) a self-supervised training of the visual classifier, where the radar allows the vehicle to automatically acquire a set of ground samples, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual labeling; (b) the ground model can be continuously updated during the operation of the vehicle, thus making it feasible the use of the system in long range and long duration navigation applications. This paper details the proposed system and presents the results of experimental tests conducted in the field by using an unmanned vehicle.",

It lets robots guide each other's navigation by exchanging messages containing navigation information through the wireless network formed among the swarm. We study the use of this algorithm in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the swarm guides a single robot to a target, while in the second, all robots of the swarm navigate back and forth between two targets. In both cases, the algorithm provides efficient navigation, while being robust to failures of robots in the swarm. Moreover, we show that in the latter case, the system lets the swarm self-organize into a robust dynamic structure. This self-organization further improves navigation efficiency, and is able to find shortest paths in cluttered environments. We test our system both in simulation and on real robots.",

The torque generated can only be measured by placing torque sensor on each joint, which makes the joint bulky and heavy, adding extra load to be carried by robot. In this paper we proposed a compact and light weight design for the torque sensor. This sensor can measure torque of robots links by detecting torsion. The optical technique is used to detect angular displacement in the joints. The torque can be calculated by using torque and twist-angle relation. The proposed design is simulated by FEM software (ANSYS) and it shows successful measurements of the torque with a load capacity of 50 Nm, which is sufficient for the torque generated in wearable and quadruped robots joints. The designed optical torque sensor is manufactured by EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining). The optical torque sensor was calibrated and several experiments were conducted to ratify its feasibility with the wearable and quadruped robots.",

In this family of applications, a tunnel environment is incrementally mapped with range sensors from a mobile robot to recover scene geometry. Distinguishing contributions of this work include an unprecedented number of configurations evaluated utilizing common methodology and metrics as well as a significant in situ environmental component lacking in prior characterization work. Sensors are experimentally compared against both an ideal geometric target and in example void environments such as a mine and underground tunnel. Three natural groupings of sensors were identified from these results and performances were found to be strongly cost-correlated. While the results presented are specific to the experimental configurations tested, the generality of tunnel environments and the metrics of reconstruction are extensible to a spectrum of outdoor and surface applications.",

However, interpretation of the produced video data for the digestive tract on each patient is left to naked eyes of medical staffs. Such a process is very tedious and time-consuming with the average inspection time about two hours for a whole WCE video. To overcome this big problem, automatic WCE video analysis is required. In this paper, we propose a comparative study of several image based features that may be suitable for WCE video abstract, which may be a good candidate to reduce the burden of physicians. Color, texture and motion features built from images are investigated and compared to show their performance in representing video content for a WCE video abstract. Preliminary experimental results of these features for WCE video abstract are also demonstrated and discussed. It is found that textural and motion features may be suitable candidates for visual frame depiction for WCE video abstract in terms of visual content representation and compression ratio. Clinical validation of our work remains to be implemented in the near future.",

In this work, swimming of helical micro robots with magnetic heads inside tubes is modeled with the resistive force theory (RFT) and validated with experiments conducted in glycerin filled mini glass channels placed in rotational magnetic fields. The time-averaged forward velocities of magnetically driven micro swimmers that are calculated by the RFT model agree very well with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a simple model of human's musculoskeletal system to identify the computation that a compliant physical body can achieve. A one-joint system driven by actuation of the springs around the joint is used as a computational device to compute the temporal integration and nonlinear combination of an input signal. Only a linear and static readout unit is needed to extract the output of the computation. The results of computer simulations indicate that the network of mechanically coupled springs can emulate several nonlinear combinations which need temporal integration. The simulation with a two-joint system also shows that, thanks to mechanical connection between the joints, a distant part of a compliant body can serve as a computational device driven by the indirect input. Finally, computational capability of antagonistic muscles and information transfer through mechanical couplings are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Asymptotically optimal motion planning algorithms guarantee solutions that approach optimal as more iterations are performed. Nevertheless, roadmaps with this property can grow too large and unwieldy for fast online query resolution. In graph theory there are many algorithms that produce subgraphs, known as spanners, which have guarantees about path quality. Applying such an algorithm to a dense, asymptotically optimal roadmap produces a sparse, asymptotically near optimal roadmap. Experiments performed on typical, geometric problems in SE(3) show that a large reduction in roadmap edges can be achieved with a small increase in path length. Online queries are answered much more quickly with similar results in terms of path quality. This also motivates future work that applies the technique incrementally so edges that won't increase path quality will never be added to the roadmap and won't be checked for collisions.",

        "abstract": "For reasoning about the safety of a robot system, it is sufficient to pretend the robot to reach an Inevitable Collision Sate (ICS). Otherwise, there exists no future trajectory which can avoid a collision. The usage of ICS is limited due to its computational complexity. One reason for this is, that the ICS computation cannot be done separately for each obstacle. Hence, ICS needs to be recomputed from scratch if another object appears in the scene. The main contribution of this paper is a modified ICS calculation which allows to compute the union of ICS sets in a sequential manner, thus reducing the computational requirements in case of new obstacles. Therefore, two novel ICS-Checker algorithms are presented reducing the computational effort. Furthermore, this novel calculation is used to reduce the probability of being in an ICS regarding an unforeseen obstacle.",

This representation is enabled by a five-layered component structure which this paper describes.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel constraint-based six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) haptic rendering algorithm for simulating both contact forces and torques between interacting rigid bodies. We represent an object using a hierarchy of spheres, i.e., a sphere-tree. Such a representation allows fast detection of multiple contacts/collisions among objects and facilitates contact constraint formulation. Given a moving graphic tool as the avatar of the haptic tool in the virtual environment, we constrain its position and orientation, i.e., its six dimensional configuration, by solving a constrained optimization problem. The constraints in the 6-D configuration space (C-space) of the graphic tool is obtained and updated through on-line mapping of the non-penetration constraint between the spheres of the graphic tool and those of the other objects in the three dimensional physical space, based on the result of collision detection. The problem is further modeled as a quadratic programming problem and solved by classic active-set methods. Our algorithm has been implemented and interfaced with a 6-DoF Phantom Premium 3.0. We demonstrate its performance in dental surgery simulations involving complex, multi-contact virtual environments. Our method enables stable operations and realistic feel of haptic sensation.",

We present an O(nv log(nv) + n2v) (n the number of nodes, v the number of vehicles) route planning algorithm for a single robot, which can find the minimum-time route given a set of existing route plans that it may not interfere with. In addition, we present an algorithm that can propagate delay through the plans of the robots in case one or more robots are delayed. This delay-propagation algorithm allows us to implement a Pareto-optimal plan repair scheme, in which one robot can improve its route plan without adversely affecting the other robots. We compare this approach to several plan repair schemes from the literature, which are based on the idea of giving a higher priority to non-delayed agents.",

A novel controller is proposed, which exploits the natural by-products of the teach-by-showing process, to help the robot navigate this non-convex space. Examining the user-demonstrated trajectories that lead up to the reference image, we use a combination of stochastic optimization techniques and classical optimization techniques to extract the relevant cost functions and constraints for servoing. We hypothesize that we can leverage the user's sensory capabilities and knowledge of the workspace to alleviate the burden of modeling system constraints explicitly. We verify this hypothesis via realistic experiments on a Barrett WAM 7-DOF manipulator equipped with a Sony XC-HR70 camera to show the comparative efficacy of this approach.",

        "abstract": "We address the distributed assembly of a structure by a team of homogeneous robots. We present an algorithm to partition 2- and 3-D assembly tasks into N separate subtasks that satisfy local and global precedence constraints between the assembly components. The objective is to achieve a partitioning that minimizes the workload imbalance between the robots and maximizes assembly parallelization. The algorithm consists of three phases: 1) an initial allocation of the subtasks to each robot via a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm; 2) a component trading protocol to balance each robot's workload without violating any constraints; and 3) the creation of an assembly plan for each robot that minimizes conflicts during execution. We present simulation results for three variants of the algorithm and experiments using our multi-robot testbed.",

We present an extension to existing work on a distributed controller for robotic construction of simple structures. Our previous work described a set of adaptive algorithms for constructing truss structures given a target geometry using continuous and graph-based equal-mass partitioning [1], [2]. Using this work as a foundation, we present an algorithm which performs construction tasks and conforms to physical constraints while considering those constraints to parallelize tasks. This is accomplished by defining a mass function which reflects the priority of part placement and prevents physically impossible states. This mass function generates a set of pointmasses in \u211dn, and we present a novel algorithm for finding a locally optimal, equal-mass, convex tessellation of such a set.",

        "abstract": "In the emerging field of soft robotics, there is an interest in developing new kinds of sensors whose characteristics do not affect the intrinsic compliance of soft robot components. Additionally, non-invasive shape and deflection sensors may provoke improved solutions to assist in the control of mechanical parts in these robots. Herein, we introduce a novel method for deflection sensing where an LED element and a photodiode are placed on to two substrates connected physically or virtually at a deflection point. The deflection angle between the two planes can be extracted from the LED light intensity detected at the photodiode due to the bell-shaped angular intensity profile of the emitted light. The main advantage of this system is that the components are not in physical contact with the deflection region as in the case of strain gauges and similar sensing methods. The sensor is characterized in a range of deflections of 105-180 degrees, showing a near 1 degree resolution. The experimental data are compared to simulations, modeled by ray tracing. The light intensity vs. deflection angle measurements in our setup display a maximum difference of 9% and an average difference of approximately 5% with respect to the model. Finally, a shape monitoring system has been developed using the proposed concept for a flexible PCB. The system is composed of 12 deflection sensors that operate at frame rate of 33 Hz. This device could be applied to monitor the body shape of a soft robot.",

The paper studies the use of numerical conformal mapping for constructing the containment indicator function for an arbitrary two-dimensional geometry. The idea of using conformal mapping is to transform the original shape of interest into a simpler target shape (e.g. disk, rectangle), which can then be characterized by elementary functions. Computational methods for finding the desired conformal maps are also studied. The procedure can be formulated as a convex optimization problem and computed efficiently.",

We have incorporated robot odometry into the video pipeline, allowing video quality to be selectively reduced at times when odometry suggests that such a reduction will not adversely affect task performance of human operators. We found that selectively reducing video quality significantly reduced bandwidth usage, increasing the robot's responsiveness and controllability, while having no measurable effect on task performance.",

The new method can be applied in a generic path following problem and it is based on combinations of clothoids with line segments and circular arcs, providing a general curvature profile. The main advantage is that generated paths take into account lower and upper bounds of curvature and sharpness which implies smoother and safer trajectories, not considered in other methods. It is shown that the proposed method has better performance with respect to settling time, overshoot and little influence on design parameters. As application, a vision-based path following continuous-curvature control problem has been implemented on an industrial forklift vehicle in order to show the advantage of the method.",

Passively-steered rovers have no steering motors, but rely on differential wheel velocities to change the axle steer angles. This passive steering design is reliable and efficient but more challenging to control than powered steering designs, especially when driving on rough terrain. A controller based on 2-D kinematics fails to accurately maintain the desired trajectory when traversing obstacles. The presented 3-D kinematic controller uses inertial and proprioceptive sensing to modify commanded steer angles and wheel velocities, greatly improving steering accuracy. Validation in simulation and physical experiments is presented. These results are significant because they establish the viability of the passive-steering configuration for precise navigation.",

Most research mainly focused on either the stability or telepresence of the telerobotic systems. Few studies have investigated the effects of the confidence of the teleoperator on the performance of the teleoperation. The confidence of the teleoperator is of significant importance to the efficiency and safety of the telerobotic systems. This paper proposes a concept named quality of teleoperator (QoT) to represent the confidence of the decisions and commands generated by the teleoperator. The value of QoT is computed based on a set of mental states of the teleoperator. Based on the QoT, a control adjustment mechanism is designed to enhance the efficiency and safety of the telerobotic systems. Experiments were implemented on a manipulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new cooperative active target-tracking strategy for a team of heterogeneous robots equipped with 3-D range-finding sensors. Our strategy is active, in the sense that the robots will track one or multiple moving targets while minimizing the combined uncertainty about the targets' position. We introduce a gradient-based control approach that encompasses the three major optimum experimental design criteria and relies only on robots' relative position measurements. The Kalman-Bucy filter is used for estimation fusion. Applications of the proposed strategy are shown to an experimental scenario featuring a team of double-integrator aerial vehicles and nonholonomic ground robots cooperatively tracking the motion of a human subject for a gait-monitoring task.",

        "abstract": "In this work we investigate cooperative inference in multi-agent systems where uncertainty is modeled by the grid structured pairwise Markov random field. A framework is proposed, which we term the multi-agent Markov random field, that decomposes the global inference problem into inter-agent belief exchanges over a hypertree topology and local intra-agent inference problems. Due to the exponential complexity of exact inference, we propose a loopy belief propagation algorithm for approximate inference over appropriately formed local generalized cluster graphs. Both synchronous and intelligent message passing are considered and a grid scale-invariant scheme based on the notion of regions of influence in a cluster graph is presented. The algorithms are simulated over a grid workspace with a team of virtual Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), with the goal of spatial plume detection in oceanographic data captured from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. We show that while the exact method produces predictably accurate and smooth grid maps, the approximate method competes well in terms of plume detection rate with the region of influence message passing scheme excelling over large tasks due to a lack of dependence on grid size.",

        "abstract": "Particle filters for mobile robot localization must balance computational requirements and accuracy of localization. Increasing the number of particles in a particle filter improves accuracy, but also increases the computational requirements. Hence, we investigate a different paradigm to better utilize particles than to increase their numbers. To this end, we introduce the Corrective Gradient Refinement (CGR) algorithm that uses the state space gradients of the observation model to improve accuracy while maintaining low computational requirements. We develop an observation model for mobile robot localization using point cloud sensors (LIDAR and depth cameras) with vector maps. This observation model is then used to analytically compute the state space gradients necessary for CGR. We show experimentally that the resulting complete localization algorithm is more accurate than the Sampling/Importance Resampling Monte Carlo Localization algorithm, while requiring fewer particles.",

We address the specific task of path planning for a global network of ocean-observing floats. These submersibles are typified by the Argo global network consisting of over 3000 sensor platforms. They can control their buoyancy to float at depth for data collection or rise to the surface for satellite communications. Currently, floats drift at a constant depth regardless of the local currents. However, accurate current forecasts have become available which present the possibility of intentionally controlling floats' motion by dynamically commanding them to linger at different depths. This project explores the use of these current predictions to direct float networks to some desired final formation or position. It presents multiple algorithms for such path optimization and demonstrates their advantage over the standard approach of constant-depth drifting.",

To address this issue, we focus on the slithering motion of snakes, which have numerous antagonistic muscle-tendon chains that span several tens of vertebrae. From theoretical analyses based on the continuum model, the acceleration of the body in the longitudinal direction is found to be proportional to the number of segments spanned by each muscle. On the basis of this theoretical result, we propose a decentralized control scheme for the efficient locomotion of a multi-articular snake-like robot. We conduct simulations using this control scheme, and the results show that the locomotion efficiency increases as the number of segments spanned by each muscle increases",

This flexibility also makes it possible to use robot deflection to estimate external forces applied to the robot. This \u201cintrinsic force sensing\u201d concept is particularly useful for thin continuum robots where application constraints preclude the use of traditional force sensors. This paper describes an Extended Kalman Filter approach to estimate forces applied at the tip of a continuum robot using only uncertain pose measurements and a kinematic-static model of the robot with uncertainty.",

The trilateral filter makes use of reflectivity as well as spatial and intensity information so that geometric features, such as jump and roof edges, are preserved while smoothing. The range image inpainting technique based on belief propagation recovers a deteriorated range image using not only the adjacent range values but also the continuity of the reflectance image. We conduct simulations and experiments using synthesized images and actual range images taken by a laser scanner and verify that the proposed techniques suppress noise while preserving jump and roof edges and repair deteriorated range images.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method and apparatus for building dense visual maps of large scale 3D environments for real-time localisation and navigation. A spherical ego-centric representation of the environment is proposed that is able to reproduce photo-realistic omnidirectional views of captured environments. This representation is novel in that it is composed of a graph of locally accurate augmented spherical panoramas that allows to generate varying viewpoints through novel view synthesis. The spheres are related by a graph of 6dof poses which are estimated through multi-view spherical registration. To acquire these models, a multi-baseline acquisition system has been designed and built which is based on an outward facing ring of cameras with diverging views. This configuration allows to capture high resolution spherical images of the environment and compute a dense depth map through a wide baseline dense correspondence algorithm. A calibration procedure is developed for an outward facing camera ring that imposes a loop closing constraint, in order to obtain a consistent set of extrinsic parameters. This spherical sensor is shown to acquire compact, accurate and efficient representations of large environments and is used for real-time model-based localisation.",

One fundamental question in utilizing depth cameras is how to best extract features from depth frames. Motivated by local descriptors on images, in particular kernel descriptors, we develop a set of kernel features on depth images that model size, 3D shape, and depth edges in a single framework. Through extensive experiments on object recognition, we show that (1) our local features capture different aspects of cues from a depth frame/view that complement one another; (2) our kernel features significantly outperform traditional 3D features (e.g. Spin images); and (3) we significantly improve the capabilities of depth and RGB-D (color+depth) recognition, achieving 10\u201315% improvement in accuracy over the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "Biological inspiration has long been pursued as a key to more efficient, agile and elegant control in robotics. It has been a successful strategy in the design and control of robots with both biologically abstracted and biomimetic designs. Behavioral studies have resulted in a good understanding of the mechanics of certain animals. However, without a better understanding of their nervous systems, the biologically-inspired observation-based approach was limited. The findings of Hess and B\u00fcschges, and Ekeberg et al. describing the neural mechanisms of stick insect intra-leg joint coordination have made it possible to control models of insect legs with a network of neural pathways they found in the animal's thoracic ganglia. Our work with this model, further informed by cockroach neurobiological studies performed in the Ritzmann lab, has led to LegConNet (Leg Controller Network). In this paper we show that LegConNet controls the forward stepping motion of a robotic leg. With hypothesized additional pathways, some later confirmed by neurobiology, it can smoothly transition the leg from forward stepping to turning movements. We hypothesize that commands descending from a higher center in the nervous system inhibit or excite appropriate local neural pathways and change thresholds, which, in turn, create a cascade of reflexes resulting in behavioral transitions.",

A compact design with high stiffness and high-fidelity instrumentation is presented, allowing for precise assessment and dynamic interaction. The device has two degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing independent control of hand opening/closing and forearm rotation. Each degree of freedom is equipped with a brake to allow independent training of either DOF or to assess isometric force through the two six-axis force/torque sensors located beneath the exchangeable finger fixations. The design, safety features and performance evaluation of the device are discussed and preliminary results from a study on grasping performed with healthy subjects are presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Off-road operational conditions require large sus- pension displacements and a significant clearance between the ground and the main frame, yielding to an elevated position of the vehicle mass center. Consequently, this makes the vehicle more likely to turn over when cornering fast. This paper proposes a new design, and its associated control, of an active device which improves the stability of fast rover moving up to 10 m/s. The proposed design can be equipped on any off-road chassis which has independent suspensions. We propose the using of an active anti-roll system allowing the control of the roll angle and thus improving the vehicle stability, especially when turning or when moving on slopping ground. The proposed system increases the controllability of the vehicle, by giving access to the roll angle which is usually uncontrollable. We develop a model based predictive controller for the roll dynamics, which minimizes the load transfer during cornering and the energy consumed by the actuators. The control model is based on a dynamic model of the rover and on a stability criteria defined by the lateral load transfer. Dynamic simulation, carried out for different rover trajectories with different speeds, show the benefit of the proposed active system and the validity of the control approach.",

        "abstract": "Research on legged locomotion has encountered its limits in human-made actuation technology. Building a structure and an actuation system capable of performing like a biological muscle for the dynamic locomotion of a mid- to large-sized machine is prohibitive. Novel technologies are being explored with the aim of improving actuator performance. This paper describes the development of a robotic leg for agile locomotion. The main aim is to imitate the multidisciplinary performance of the natural muscle by means of hybridizing conventional and new technologies for the development of large power, large force, lightweight, force-controlled, compliant robotic legs. A preliminary leg prototype has been developed. The actuation system is based on the hybrid use of series elasticity and magneto-rheological dampers which provides variable compliance for natural-looking motion and improved interaction with the ground. Experiments with the real leg prototype provide a positive assessment of the target leg features.",

Normal forces applied upon the cell under study are estimated via frequency shifts of the resonators. In this paper, we develop a theoretical study for predicting and optimizing the structure's sensitivity. As a proof of concept, we also report the fabrication and experimental characterization of a first prototype. In ambient conditions, our prototype presently offers a quality factor of ~700, and a linear sensitivity of ~5.75 Hz/\u00bfm. In addition, we report the implementation of a compact and low-cost optical fiber setup to monitor the resonators' frequency. Potential applications are illustrated with the measurement of forces applied on lobster eggs.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the design and fabrication approach to increase the success rate of single particle dispensing. Two pairs of capacitance sensors are placed in a biochip to detect the flow velocity of particles, and the air pressure is applied to eject particles by synchronizing the timing. Comprehensive design theory, which is taken into account of the back pressure caused by air pressure, the response time of the system, sensor property, and the delay of the dispensing from the air pressure, is developed in order to minimize the disturbance of the system and maximize the throughput of the ejection system. Then, the system has capability to eject 3 particles/sec and maximum flow velocity is 10 mm/s. The novelty of the system is that the biochip is disposable which is unlike the conventional mechanical inkjet system and it can prevent contamination. Therefore, the fabricated disposable biochip based on photolithography is low cost and the drive system is reusable. Finally, we succeed in automatic dispensing of a single particle (=100 \u00b5m) from a biochip to culture well atmosphere using developed cell ejection system with the success rate of 50 %.",

Bio-inspired actuators and mechanisms have been developed to pan and tilt a camera with comparable characteristics as a human eye. To meet the stringent space/weight requirement of mobile robotic applications, a compact camera-orienting mechanism is proposed. We specifically aim at matching the size of a human eye. Through the arrangement of two parallel placed actuators and flexible mechanisms, uncoupled pan and tilt motions can be provided in a smaller space. The flexible mechanisms utilize the deflection of flexible beams to replace the kinematic joints; thus they have fewer parts and can be easily rescaled to fit a smaller space. After a formulation to find the optimal mechanism configuration, the design is verified by implementing a prototype. The novel orienting mechanism is expected to serve as an alternative for robotic vision devices.",

        "abstract": "Focusing on the physical interaction between people and machines within safety constraints in versatile situations, this paper proposes a new, efficient actuation approach, continuous-state coupled elastic actuation (CCEA), to provide oncoming human-machine systems with an intrinsic programmable stiffness capacity to shape output force corresponding to the deviation between human motions and set positions of the system. As one of all the possible CCEA systems, a prototype of a 2-DOF coupled elastic actuator is designed to provide a compromise between performance and safety. Using a pair of antagonistic four-bar linkages, the inherent stiffness of the system can be adjusted dynamically. Compared to the state-of-the-art variable stiffness actuators, the CCEA system is unique in that it can achieve near zero mechanical stiffness in an efficient way. In addition, a human-robot interaction model is built to investigate the controlled bandwidth and safety of the CCEA system. For the application of assistive exercises, this study also proposes two kinds of controls for assistive exercises. Finally, a CCEA exoskeleton is built for elbow rehabilitation. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to show some desired properties of the proposed CCEA system.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a design method of a static balancing mechanism using unit gravity compensators (e.g., 1-dof gravity compensator). In the design of a multi-dofs static balancing mechanism it is necessary to determine how many springs (or unit gravity compensators) are required and where they should be placed. This problem can be overcome by computing the mapping matrix between the joint space and gravity compensator space. The mapping matrix is obtained by analyses of the potential energy function. The number of rows of the mapping matrix indicates the amount of unit gravity compensators and linear joint constraints representing locations of unit gravity compensators. Example studies are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulations are performed in that static balancing mechanisms designed by the proposed method can counterbalance the gravitational torques completely.",

For this purpose an interface in the form of a grip was designed that allows the user to intuitively steer and drive the colonoscope. The Grip controls the orientation of the tip as if the colonoscope were a stiff instrument that pivots at the anus of a patient. To test the principle, experiments were conducted on a simulator operated by novice subjects. Initial experiments show a significant decrease in introduction time of 156 seconds (p<0.005). This technology will enhance current colonoscopy practice and open up possibilities for future applications of colonoscopy.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an MRI-compatible, 1-axis force sensing unit which is designed to be used as a haptic interface on an MRI compatible robot. Recently, it became a popular research direction to enable MRI in surgical operations and brain studies with the help of robotic devices. However, due to high magnetic field in MRI environment, conventional sensors and robots cannot be used in MRI rooms. Existing MRI-compatible force sensors have limited number of degrees of freedom or they do not offer compact solutions for multiple-axis sensing. In this paper, a compact 1-axis force sensing unit which employs a compliant displacement amplification mechanism is introduced and then analyzed for better sensitivity and accuracy. A combination of multiple proposed sensing units can be assembled to have a force sensor with desired number of degrees of freedom. Prototypes made of delrin and ABS-plastic are tested. Experiments indicated that the proposed sensor is suitable for force sensing and fully compatible to MRI. Also, the sensor made of delrin is superior in mechanical performance and MRI compatibility to ABS-plastic sample.",

The presented design can be inserted into the stomach in a folded configuration and be unfolded into a working configuration to perform stitching. It uses pre-curved super-elastic NiTi (Nickel-Titanium) alloy needle to facilitate the stitching motion.

The design of this kind of systems is challenging because simultaneously tele-controlling multiple robots exceeds the ability of one single operator. The intelligence and autonomy of the robots need to be integrated into the system. Besides, the communication between the operator and the multi-robot system and the communication among the multiple robots are both subject to communication constraints like time delays and packet losses. This paper designs a non-time based method to realize the single-operator-multi-robot system with random communication delay. The system is designed based on the non-time based teleoperation method and a proposed perceptive coordination method. The random delay problem and the problem of simultaneously tele-controlling multiple robots by a single operator are resolved. Experiments implemented on a multi-robot system illustrated the effectiveness of the design.",

        "abstract": "The ability to perceive a robot's local environment is one of the main challenges in the development of mobile ground robots. Here, we present a robust model-based approach for detection and tracking of road networks in rural terrain. To get a rich environment representation, we fuse the complementary data provided by a 3D LIDAR and an active camera platform into an accumulated, colored 3D elevation map of the terrain. Additionally, we use commercially available GIS data to get a rough idea about the geometry of the road network ahead of the robot. This way, the system is able to dynamically adjust the geometric model used within a particle filter framework for both detection and estimation of the road network's geometry. The estimation process makes use of edge- and region-based image features as well as obstacle information, all supplied by the dense terrain map. Instead of tuning the likelihood functions used within the particle filter's cue fusion concept by hand, as commonly done, we apply supervised learning techniques to derive an appropriate weighting of all features. We finally show that the proposed approach enables our ground robot MuCAR-3 to autonomously navigate on rural- and dirt-road networks.",

For robotic applications, its realtime frame rates create the potential for image-based instrument tracking and servoing. These capabilities can enable improved instrument visualization, compensation for tissue motion as well as surgical task automation. Continuum robots, whose shape comprises a smooth curve along their length, are well suited for minimally invasive procedures. Existing techniques for ultrasound tracking, however, are limited to straight, laparoscopic-type instruments and thus are not applicable to continuum robot tracking. Toward the goal of developing tracking algorithms for continuum robots, this paper presents a method for detecting a robot comprised of a single constant curvature in a 3D ultrasound volume. Computational efficiency is achieved by decomposing the six-dimensional circle estimation problem into two sequential three-dimensional estimation problems. Simulation and experiment are used to evaluate the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The determination of a rigid-body position and orientation from the position of a number of its points is one of the fundamental problems in kinematics. This problem arises in robotics, biomechanics, automatic guided vehicles, real-time control of space structures, etc. Under ideal conditions, it is possible to apply classical methods to find a body's position and orientation. However, in the presence of noise, these methods yield results that are unreliable and inconsistent. Two existing and a new method for determining position and orientation from noisy point coordinate data are presented. The theoretical analysis of the methods combined with an extensive simulation process led to conclusions about their behavior in different situations. The proposed method yields better orientation estimates than the other two methods, yielding reliable results both for absolute and relative position measurements and for low and high noise levels.",

        "abstract": "To determine object geometry in unstructured environments, sensors must be mechanically robust, must exert only low forces on objects during exploration, and must be able to scan large regions efficiently without risk of damaging objects or sensors. Joint-angle sensors on compliant joints provide an appealing option for this task. An algorithmic framework is presented that allows them to be used for contact detection and to determine object geometry without requiring tactile arrays or other complicated contact location sensors. This volumetric approach to using proprioceptive sensors provides improvements in accuracy over other existing approaches based on the intersection of planes and lines.",

        "abstract": "Unlike a conventional articulated manipulator, where only the gripper manipulates objects, a continuum manipulator, such as a multi-section trunk/tentacle robot, is promising for deft manipulation of a wide range of objects of different shapes and sizes. Given an object, a continuum manipulator tries to grasp it by wrapping around and squeezing it. A main open problem is how to determine if the object can be grasped and if so, the whole-arm wrapping around configurations of the robot to grasp it, which we call grasping configurations. In this paper, we provide a general and complete analysis of grasping configurations of a spatial continuum manipulator consisting of three constant-curvature sections, for any given 3-D object. We formulate conditions for existence of solutions and describe how to determine valid grasping configurations. Our method can extend to general continuum manipulators of n constant-curvature sections (where n \u2265 3).",

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel, deterministic closed-form solution for computing the scale factor and the gravity direction of a moving, loosely-coupled, and monocular vision-inertial system. The methodology is based on analysing delta-velocities. On one hand, they are obtained from a differentiation of the up-to-scale camera pose computation by a visual odometry or visual SLAM algorithm. On the other hand, they can also be retrieved from the gravity-affected short-term integration of acceleration signals. We derive a method for separating the gravity contribution and recovering the metric scale factor of the vision algorithm. The method thus also recovers the offset in roll and pitch angles of the vision reference frame with respect to the direction of the gravity vector. It uses only a single inertial integration period, and no absolute orientation information is required. For optimal sensor-fusion and metric scale-estimation filters in the loosely-coupled case, it has been shown that the convergence of the fusion of an up-to-scale pose information with inertial measurements largely depends on the availability of a good initial value for the scale factor. We show how this problem can be tackled by applying the method presented in this paper. Finally, we present results in simulation and on real data, demonstrating the suitability of the method in real scenarios.",

This method has first applied to a biped robot with telescopic legs and later to a robot with actuated knee joints. In parametric excitation walking, mechanical energy is increased by periodic up-and-down motion of the center of mass. While parametric excitation walking with telescopic legs has verified by an experimental robot, that with actuated knees has not yet as far as we know. The purpose of this paper is to present demonstration experiment of parametric excitation walking with a kneed biped robot. To do this, we develop an experimental kneed biped robot having four parallel legs with semicircular feet. In the experiment, the robot achieves walking on a level ground more than 15 steps. We also measure the movements of the robot during walking by a 3D motion capture and compare with simulation results.",

        "abstract": "It is often difficult for orthopedic surgeons to avoid LCL injury during ACL reconstruction. In this paper, we developed a steerable drill for ACL reconstruction to avoid LCL injury in the process of making a bone tunnel. There are two special requirements for the steerable drill mechanism. One is having sufficient flexibility to bend and avoid LCL while cutting the bone. The other is rigidity to avoid the buckle at the base of the drill when external force is exerted on the drill tip. These two requirements cannot be met simultaneously by using the previous material with uniform stiffness throughout its length. We therefore adopted a spring sheath with stiffness that varied between the top and base of the drill. This spring sheath has high stiffness at the base and low stiffness at the top. We performed the experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the drill with uniform and non-uniform stiffness by comparing each result. Consequently, it was confirmed that the drill with non-uniform stiffness achieved 6 times the bending deformation and with 30% lower force as preventing the buckling compared to the drill with uniform stiffness. Subsequently, we presented a discussion concerning the reason for the experimental result, based on a physical long column model which simulated the steerable drill. In addition, at the end of this paper, a newly-developed control method to make the arbitrary trajectory of the bone tunnel using a steerable drill with non-uniform stiffness was described.",

        "abstract": "Cleaning of glass windows for buildings is a dangerous work for human. Automatic cleaning for glass windows has been, thus, expected. Authors have developed an autonomous small-sized robot which can be used for glass window's cleaning even on not fully-flat walls. There are two major ways for the motion control of the autonomous cleaning mobile robot, which are reaction-based control method and model-based control method. Efficiency of the cleaning using the reaction-based method is lower than one using the model-based method. This study aims to develop a high efficiency and high reliable glass cleaning robot. Thus, we adopt the model-based method for the control of the cleaning robot. For the efficient and reliable cleaning, the robot should follow a desired path accurately. However, the trajectory tracking on a window is not so easy because of gravity and other dynamical effects. Moreover, even if the robot follows the desired path exactly, the robot can not assure a complete cleaning of the glass window. Therefore, the paper discusses a trajectory tracking control problem on the glass window, and also proposes a novel dirt detect sensor and a motion control method to guarantee the completeness of glass window cleaning. The validity of those proposed methods is confirmed by experiments using a window cleaning robot which attracts a window by magnetic force.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We have developed a slip sensor which is knitted by tension-sensitive electro-conductive yarns. When elongating this yarn, its resistance will drop remarkably. Because the yarn is mainly sensitive to deformation along its main axis, a special way to knit these yarns has been proposed to form a slip sensor. This sensor is used in detection of the human fingertip's slip during rubbing action on its surface. We found that, a simple derivative of the sensor's output was sufficient to detect slippage. However, in some cases, the sensor gets troublesome to distinguish between change of normal load and the occurrence of slip, since human implements their action without caring much about keeping the stable applied force on the sensor. Therefore, a well-known DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) method is employed to overcome this problem. As a result, depending on the purpose of the application, several data processing methods are employed to detect slippage of human's rubbing action, or robotic fingertip. Results in this paper promise an applicable sensory mean, which can be employed in haptic devices, teleoperation, or robotic skin.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a traveling wave type miniature ultrasonic motor using a foil type stator is proposed. The developed motor has a simple mechanism without being a piezoelectric vibrator in itself. Traveling waves from the vibrator source propagate to the foil type stator through the long-length waveguide. Unlike an ordinary ultrasonic motor, the developed motor rotates in the same direction as the traveling wave. To clarify the reverse rotational phenomenon, transient response analysis was executed. The result showed that the foil type motor driving principal was different from that of the general ultrasonic motor which was driven by elliptical motion of the elastic body surface, the main driving force was the generated symmetric lamb wave which rotates the coil surface forward direction. A rotation experiment using the developed prototype motor was executed. Rotational speed was found to be 6,380 rpm and starting torque was 698.8 \u00b5Nm when the ideal gap between rotor and stator was realized.",

The sensor applies an unique design of analog net-structure circuit, which enables all-face mounting on various peripheries and fast-response/simplification of information processing. Thus, the sensor is especially available for avoiding sudden contact with rapidly approaching objects for mobile robots, robot arms, robot hands, and other robotic systems. In this paper, the structure and the detecting principle of the sensor are firstly described, then, its detection property is tested by experiments. The result shows that the sensor recognizes the angle of the nearby object with accuracy of 3[deg]. Furthermore, as practical use of the sensor, a large size model is produced for a mobile robot to achieve omni-directional sensing. By using the application model, two detection methods are discussed on situations where the number or the positions of the nearby objects differs.",

These robots can realize several functions, such as path tracking, gravity compensation on a slope, and collision avoidance function, by controlling only the servo brakes. They employ passive dynamics with respect to the force applied by a human. In this paper, we derive and analyze a feasible braking force/moment that is necessary for controlling the robot with servo brakes. We reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the feasible braking force/moment of each robot developed by us. In addition, we propose a new passive type double wheel caster unit, called PDC, on the basis of the analysis. We develop a prototype PDC called PDC-P1. Finally, we handle a long object by two PDC-P1s actually, and realize the path tracking function as example to confirm its validity.",

From this standpoint, some musculoskeletal humanoid robots have been developed in recent years. However, existing musculoskeletal robots did not have upper body with several DOFs to balance their bodies statically or did not have enough power to perform dynamic tasks. We think the musculoskeletal structure has two significant properties: whole-body flexibility and whole-body coordination. Using these two properties can enable us to make robots' performance better than before. In this study, we developed a humanoid robot with a musculoskeletal system that is driven by pneumatic artificial muscles. To demonstrate the robot's capability in static and dynamic tasks, we conducted two experiments. As a static task, we conducted a standing experiment using a simple feedback control and evaluated the stability by applying an impulse to the robot. As a dynamic task, we conducted a walking experiment using a feedforward controller with human muscle activation patterns and confirmed that the robot was able to perform the dynamic task.",

Motivated by the use of nonverbal communications as a conflict resolution mechanism by humans, this study investigates the communicative capabilities reflected in the trajectory characteristics of hesitation gestures during human-robot collaboration. Hesitation gestures and non-hesitation human arm motions were recorded from a series of reach-and-retract tasks and embodied on a 6-DOF robot arm. A total of 86 survey respondents watched and scored recordings of these motions according to whether they recognized hesitation gestures as exhibited by both the human and the robot. Using the survey's statistical evidence indicating that hesitation trajectories embodied in an articulated robot arm can be recognized by human observers, we identified trajectory characteristics of hesitation gestures. The contribution of our work is an empirically grounded robot trajectory specification that provides communicative cues for conflict resolution during collaborative reaching scenarios.",

State of the art modules typically use electromagnetic motors for mobility and self-reconfiguration. However, electromagnetic motor performance reduces upon downscaling to the mesoscale. The smallest self-contained module uses shape memory alloy which is inherently inefficient, slow, and difficult to position control. This work surveys available actuation technologies with respect to appropriate figures of merit. It concludes that dielectric elastomer actuation is promising. We present the design and experimental analysis of an agonist-antagonist dielectric elastomer actuator configuration 7 times smaller than previously demonstrated. Demonstrations with two modules show module bending up to 15\u00b0 in various modular robot morphologies. In addition, we demonstrate parallel actuation: a pair of modules acting in parallel can lift twice the load a single module can.",

We utilize the differential flatness of the system to provide a feed forward input. The system model derived allows for arbitrary changes in yaw and is not limited to small roll and pitch angles. We demonstrate in hardware the ability to follow a highly maneuverable path while tracking a time-varying heading command.",

This controller maps the bicycle dynamics into a point mass located at a center of oscillation with an additional degree of freedom of yaw dynamics. A state transformation is performed that reveals structure in the yaw dynamics resembling a Lie\u00bfnard system. A candidate Lyapunov function inspired by this structure is used to assess the stability of the yaw dynamics while tracking straight-line trajectories and steady turns. The basin of attraction of the controller is limited by actuator constraints and the presence of unstable equilibrium points during turns with high lateral acceleration. The controller properties and the stability of yaw dynamics are demonstrated in simulation.",

Then, we address two specific decentralized control applications: rendezvous and formation control.

In this paper, task features are encoded as constraints of a learned planning model. In order to extract the relevant constraints, the human teacher demonstrates a set of tests, e.g. a scene with different objects, and the robot tries to execute the planning model on each test using constrained motion planning. Based on statistics about which constraints failed during the planning process multiple hypotheses about a maximal subset of constraints, which allows to find a solution in all tests, are refined in parallel using an evolutionary algorithm. The algorithm was tested on 7 experiments and two robot systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops an information (inverse-covariance) based method for efficient fusion and distributed estimation of large scale terrain. The output resembles a standard triangulated irregular network (TIN) terrain representation. However the proposed method uses distributed information fusion to estimate the elevations of the mesh vertices. This terrain mapping system is intended to use multiple scanning vehicles for online monitoring of the terrain for automated mining operations or other multi-vehicle field robotics systems. The method is based on a pre-specified regular finite-element mesh to define the set of estimated state variables. The method maintains a joint Gaussian distribution of the mesh vertices' elevations, in the information (inverse-covariance) form. The mesh elevations are estimated jointly given the irregular terrain observations, together with smoothness terms. The smoothness terms enable interpolation into unobserved regions as well as reducing noise. In the information form, the observations and smoothness terms are additive and the information matrix remains sparse in a fixed pattern, enabling constant-memory fusion of observations, efficient distribution among multiple sensing platforms and efficient solving for the estimates and uncertainty. Results show the reduction in data size for the fused observations compared to the raw observations, whilst still obtaining large scale high quality terrain maps. This paper focuses on a hierarchical distributed system in which each node estimates a subset of its parent's region, with the top-level node estimating a terrain map of the whole area. This paper compares two methods for the distributed communication from parent to child: An exact but expensive method, and an approximate fast method. Results compare the communication cost and resulting level of estimation approximation, showing that the marginalised information is expensive and the approximation is acceptable without it.

        "abstract": "Electrical stimulation (ES) is one of the solutions for drop foot correction. Conventional ES systems deliver predefined stimulation pattern to the affected muscles. However, time-variant muscle response may influence the gait performance as they are difficult to be taken into account in advance. Therefore, closed-loop ES control is important to obtain desired gait in presence of muscle response variation. In this work, a dual predictive control, which consists of two nonlinear generalized predictive controllers, is proposed to track desired torque. The stimulated muscle dynamics are modeled by Hammerstein cascades, with one representing stimulation to activation, the other representing activation to torque. Ankle dorsiflexion torque and ES-evoked EMG of tibialis anterior were recorded experimentally for model identification. The control scheme is validated by following desired torque trajectories with the identified model. The results show that the stimulation pattern obtained from the dual predictive control can produce good torque tracking according to the current muscle condition.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new dynamic model for a carangiform robotic fish by merging rigid-body dynamics with Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory. In addition, we refine the model by introducing an effective approach to the evaluation of time-varying drag force and moment coefficients. It is known that these coefficients vary with the angle of attack, but the angle of attack oscillates constantly for a carangiform robotic fish because of the recoil motion of the body. By examining the individual effects of tail beat bias, frequency, amplitude on the attack angle, we find that the bias has much more dominant impact than the other two factors. Based on this observation, we develop a convenient scheme for determining the drag force and moment coefficients, as a function of the tail beat bias. Experimental results on a robotic fish prototype propelled with a servo-controlled rigid tail have verified the proposed model. In particular, we show that the pressure force at the tail tip, which is often ignored in related literature, plays a significant role in the dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme for adapting the drag force and moment coefficients is also demonstrated through the comparison with a model that uses constant drag coefficients.",

We first introduce a one-dimensional viscous model to approximate the object deformation characteristics, focusing on the final shape of the object. Assuming that the plate has two degrees of freedom: a translational motion and a rotational one, we derive two sufficient conditions to deform the object: one to enlarge it and the other to contract it.

Therefore, dexterous and flexible behavior of these systems as well as guaranteeing safe interaction are crucial for that progress. We address these issues in terms of control strategies for the whole body of DLR's humanoid Justin. Via impedance control laws, we enable the robot to realize main tasks compliantly while, at the same time, taking care of aspects like physical limitations and collision avoidance with its own structure and the environment autonomously. The controller provides a natural redundancy resolution between the arms, the torso and the wheeled platform. A low-dimensional task space interface is proposed that can be used by planning tools. Thereby, planning time can be saved significantly. Experimental results on DLR's Justin are presented to validate our approach.",

The soft-robotics control architecture of the robotic system ensures safe physical human robot interaction as well as stable behaviour while operating in an unstructured environment. Muscular control is realised via surface electromyography, a non-invasive and simple way to gather human muscular activity from the skin. A standard supervised machine learning system is used to create a map from muscle activity to hand position, orientation and grasping force which then can be evaluated in real time\u2014the existence of such a map is guaranteed by gravity compensation and low-speed movement. No kinematic or dynamic model of the human arm is necessary, which makes the system quickly adaptable to anyone. Numerical validation shows that the system achieves good movement precision. Live evaluation and demonstration of the system during a robotic trade fair is reported and confirms the validity of the approach, which has potential applications in muscle-disorder rehabilitation or in teleoperation where a close-range, safe master/slave interaction is required, and/or when optical/magnetic position tracking cannot be enforced.",

A swarm of robots with high-quality sensors and actuators is expected to out-perform a swarm of robots with low-quality sensors and actuators. This paper directly investigates the relationship between hardware quality and swarm performance. We take three common components of swarm algorithms (trail following, swarm expansion, and shape formation) and measure how they are affected by two common types of hardware inaccuracy (communication bearing reception error, and movement error) both in simulation and with E-Puck robots. We find that large amounts of both types of hardware error are required before performance appreciably decreases.",

        "abstract": "Given the ease that humans have with using a keyboard and mouse in typical, non-colocated computer interaction, many studies have investigated the value of co-locating the visual field and haptic workspaces using immersive virtual reality (VR) modalities. Significant understanding has been gained by previous work comparing physical tasks against VR tasks, visuo-haptic co-location versus non-colocation, and even visuo-haptic rotational misalignments in VR. However, few studies have explored all of these paradigms in context with each other and it is difficult to do inter-study comparisons because of the variation in tested motor tasks. Therefore, the goal for the current study was to characterize human performance of Fitts' point-to-point reaching task - an established test of manual performance - in the physical, co-located/non-colocated VR, and rotated VR visualization conditions. A key finding was the significant decrease observed in end-point error for tasks performed in a co-located virtual reality environment. The results also showed cyclic performance degradations due to rotational visuo-haptic misalignments that were consistent with trends reported by the literature.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot path planning is abstracted as the problem of computing a set of non-colliding paths on a graph for multiple robots. A naive search of the composite search space, although complete, has exponential complexity and becomes computationally prohibitive for problems with just a few robots. This paper proposes an efficient and complete algorithm for solving a general class of multi-robot path planning problems, specifically those where there are at most n-2 robots in a connected graph of n vertices. This paper provides a full proof of completeness. The algorithm employs two primitives: \u201cpush\u201d, where a robot moves toward its goal until no progress can be made, and \u201cswap\u201d, that allows two robots to swap positions without altering the position of any other robot. Additionally, this paper provides a smoothing procedure for improving solution quality. Simulated experiments compare the proposed approach with several other centralized and decoupled planners, and show that the proposed technique improves computation time and solution quality, while scaling to problems with 100s of robots, solving them in under 5 seconds.",

The size of the pose graph has a substantial influence on the runtime and the memory requirements of a SLAM system, which hinders long-term mapping. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient information-theoretic compression of pose graphs. Our approach estimates the expected information gain of laser measurements with respect to the resulting occupancy grid map. It allows for restricting the size of the pose graph depending on the information that the robot acquires about the environment or based on a given memory limit, which results in an any-space SLAM system. When discarding laser scans, our approach marginalizes out the corresponding pose nodes from the graph. To avoid a densely connected pose graph, which would result from exact marginalization, we propose an approximation to marginalization that is based on local Chow-Liu trees and maintains a sparse graph. Real world experiments suggest that our approach effectively reduces the growth of the pose graph while minimizing the loss of information in the resulting grid map.",

        "abstract": "The ability to plan their own motions and to reliably execute them is an important precondition for autonomous robots. In this paper, we consider the problem of planning the motion of a mobile manipulation robot in the presence of deformable objects. Our approach combines probabilistic roadmap planning with a physical deformation simulation system. Since the physical deformation simulation is computationally demanding, we use efficient Gaussian process regression to estimate the deformation cost for individual objects based on training examples. We generate the training data by employing a simulation system in a preprocessing step. Consequently, no simulations are needed during runtime. We implemented and tested our approach on a mobile manipulation robot. Our experiments show that the robot is able to accurately predict and thus consider the deformation cost its manipulator introduces to the environment during motion planning. Simultaneously, the computation time is substantially reduced compared to a system that employs physical simulations online.",

        "abstract": "Geolocation of a ground object or target of interest from live video is a common task required of small and micro unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs and MAVs) in surveillance and rescue applications. However, such vehicles commonly carry low-cost and light-weight sensors providing poor bandwidth and accuracy whose contribution to observations is nonlinear, resulting in poor geolocation performance by standard techniques. This paper proposes the application of an efficient over-parameterized state representation to the problem of geolocation that is able to handle large, time-varying, and non-Gaussian sensor error to produce better geolocation estimates than typical approaches and which provides computing and communication benefits in applications such as predictive control and distributed collaboration. We evaluate our filter on real flight data, demonstrating its ability to efficiently produce a solution with tight confidence bounds given highly uncertain data.",

The framework consists of a Bayesian network (BN) integrated with a novel multi-variate discretization model. The BN models the probabilistic relationships among tasks, objects, grasping actions and constraints. The discretization model provides compact data representation that allows efficient learning of the conditional structures in the BN. To evaluate the framework, we use a database generated in a simulated environment including examples of a human and a robot hand interacting with objects. The results show that the different kinematic structures of the hands affect both the BN structure and the conditional distributions over the modeled variables. Both models achieve accurate task classification, and successfully encode the semantic task requirements in the continuous observation spaces. In an imitation experiment, we demonstrate that the representation framework can transfer task knowledge between different embodiments, therefore is a suitable model for grasp planning and imitation in a goal-directed manner.",

Similarly, elastically-suspended loads have the potential to increase the energy efficiency of legged robot locomotion. External loads and the inherent mass of a legged robot, such as batteries, electronics, and fuel, can be elastically-suspended from the robot with compliant springs, passively reducing the energetic cost of locomotion. An experimental prototype hexapod robot with a novel elastic load suspension mechanism based on the Christie suspension system is developed and utilized to test the energy efficiency of legged robot locomotion with elastically-suspended loads versus rigidly-attached loads. Elastically-suspended loads are shown to reduce the energetic cost of locomotion compared to rigidly-attached loads. Thus, the speed, operation time, or load carrying capacity could be increased for robots that utilize elastically-suspended loads.",

The potential energy of the robot-environment system is shaped in a way that its local equilibrium implies the application of the desired force onto the contact surface. This potential shaping is realised based on the available contact force feedback. Also, it is shown how force feedback can be employed to modulate the amount of energy externally injected by a source subsystem, and with this achieve exact force convergence. Experimental results are presented to validate this approach.",

Central to our formulation is the fundamental idea that as an agent participating in coverage approaches a low energy reserve the team should cooperatively adjust the coverage formation to allow the agent to return to a designated base station, where it can recharge before rejoining the effort. Towards this end, we build upon recent efforts in employing Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT)-based coverage control laws by defining a policy that exploits a power-dependent weighting scheme that embeds an agent's trade-off to achieve its coverage mission and to maintain a desired energy reserve to guarantee its own safety. Stability of the proposed approach is considered, and we show that coupling our continuous controller with a straightforward switching mechanism guarantees every agent will return to its base station safely. Simulation results are presented to verify and demonstrate the utility of the proposed control scheme.",

In our approach, a robot inviting a physical connection actively recruits the best located neighboring robot and guides the recruit to the location on its chassis where the connection is required. The proposed mechanism relies on local, high-speed communication between connection inviting robots and their recruits. Communication is based on a hybrid technology that combines radio and infrared to provide local relative positioning information when messages are transmitted between adjacent robots. Experiments with real robotic hardware show that EDSA is precise (misalignment of only 1.2\u00b0 on average), robust (100% success rate for the experiments in this study) and fast (16.1 seconds on average from a distance of 80 cm).

Without any a-priori knowledge about the objects, the task of the robot is to correctly enumerate how many of them are in the scene and segment them from the background. Our approach builds on top of state-of-the-art computer vision methods, generating object hypotheses through segmentation. This process is combined with a natural dialog system, thus including a 'human in the loop' where, by exploiting the natural conversation of an advanced dialog system, the robot gains knowledge about ambiguous situations. We present an entropy-based system allowing the robot to detect the poorest object hypotheses and query the user for arbitration. Based on the information obtained from the human-robot dialog, the scene segmentation can be re-seeded and thereby improved. We present experimental results on real data that show an improved segmentation performance compared to segmentation without interaction.",

Different pressure levels at finger contacts could be responsible factors concerning the perception of forces on a tool. In this paper, an experimental study was done to verify if pressure stimulation to the thumb and index fingers on a precision grip position could alter the perception of force. We requested participants to perform a psychophysical experiment by holding a grounded pen-type interface having a single degree of freedom which induces pressure sensation using air suction. Perceived force was observed to increase when pressure was applied increasingly. Experimental results suggested that vacuum pressure can be used as a complementary tactile stimulus for inducing force sensation. This study had confirmed that negative pressure stimulus can be used to augment force perception.",

        "abstract": "Tactile sensations experienced by humans, such as roughness and softness, require not only high-frequency (200 Hz) but also lower-frequency vibrations (< 50 Hz). However, such low frequencies are difficult to achieve with small actuators that can be integrated into mobile devices. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for enhancing human vibrotactile sensitivity. We focused on a phenomenon whereby simultaneous contact with vibratory and stationary surfaces enhances human vibrotactile sensitivity, which we call stationary-boundary-contact (SBC) enhancement. SBC produces a line sensation along the gap between the vibratory and stationary surfaces. In this study, we determined the detection thresholds for SBC-enhanced sensitivity under several conditions. Psychophysical experiments showed that the detection thresholds of SBC were reduced by more than three times at low frequencies as compared to those under normal conditions. We then investigated the mechanism behind SBC enhancement by using a finite element model for the skin. Static and dynamic deformation analyses indicated that the dynamic impact of skin against the edge of a stationary surface contributes to an increase in the vibration frequency of the skin. This hypothesis was also supported by the psychophysical experiment, which showed that an edge-rounded stationary surface had less effect on sensitivity enhancement. Finally, we investigated possible SBC arrangements for practical applications on the basis of line sensation.",

        "abstract": "Registering an object with respect to a robot's coordinate system is essential to industrial assembly tasks such as grasping and insertion. Touch-based registration algorithms use a probe attached to a robot to measure the positions of contact, then use these measurements to register the robot to a model of the object. In existing work on touch-based registration, the selection of contact positions is not typically addressed. We present an algorithm for selecting the next robot motion to maximize the expected information obtained by the resulting contact with the object. Our method performs 6-DOF registration in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering (RBPF) framework. Using the 3D model of the object and the current RBPF distribution, we compute the expected information gain from a proposed robot motion by estimating the expected entropy that the RBPF distribution would have as a result of being updated by the proposed motion. The motion that provides the maximum information gain is selected and used for the next measurement, and the process is repeated. We compare various methods for estimating entropy, including approximations based on kernel density estimation. We demonstrate entropy-based motion selection in fully automatic and human-guided registration, both in simulations and on a real robotic platform.",

Providing intra-abdominal mobility and rethinking handles design are two solutions to increase comfort and precision of gestures. Based on previous work that determined the optimal intra-abdominal kinematics, this study analyses the influence of handle design on both gesture and ergonomic performance. A virtual reality laparoscopic simulator was developed to perform an experimental comparison between two novel robotized instruments and standard ones. A group of 10 surgeons and 6 researchers in robotics carried out two representative surgical tasks with each instrument. Based on instrument and arm segments tracking, a gesture performance index and an ergonomic performance index were computed. The study demonstrates that distal mobilities combined with improved handle design and integration increase ergonomic level during laparoscopy and facilitate complex gestures.",

We consider a 2 dof model for the human wrist with non intersecting joints and a similar model for the exoskeleton. We assume a viscoelastic attachment between the human hand and the handle of the exoskeleton which on one side allows the different kinematics of the exoskeleton to follow the human wrist and, on the other side, induces reaction forces at all joints, in particular causing discomfort. We quantify discomfort as the amount of potential energy stored in the deformation of the viscoelastic attachment. For a specific exoskeleton implementation, based on kinematic simulations, we report the kinematic mismatch (i.e. differences between the human joints and the corresponding exoskeleton joints) as well as the reaction forces arising when the human joints assume postures throughout their physiological range of motion. Considering a typical distribution of joint offset for humans (derived from literature) and the asymmetry in the discomfort function (derived from our simulations) we address the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d problem and propose an optimal joint offset for the exoskeleton, based on the minimization of the aggregate loss function.",

For this a multi-target recursive Bayes filter, the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density filter (GM-PHD), fed by a circle detector is used. This recently developed filter avoids the need to enumerate all possible data association decisions, making them computationally efficient. Over time, a mixture of Gaussians is propagated as tracks, predicted into the future and then sent to the robot. By learning a prior from training data we are focusing on detections that are likely to lead to a catchable trajectory which increases robustness. We evaluate the tracker's performance by comparing it with ground truth data, assessing tracking performance as well as the prediction precision of single tracks. Reasonable prediction performance is acquired right from the start, leading to a good overall catching rate.",

        "abstract": "The curvatures of an object play an important role in the shape reconstruction of that object. In this research, we suggest a method of estimating unknown curvatures using a coarse-resolution force torque sensor. First, a method of estimating unknown curvatures using large motions in terms of rolling and sliding is proposed. Next, a tracking algorithm for an unknown surface based on an inner position loop control algorithm is presented. An application of this method to the finger of a robot hand is also discussed. Finally, the algorithm is verified by simulations and experiments for several cylinders with different radii.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to evaluate Thermoresponsive Gel probe (GeT probe) which was newly developed and also a method of manipulating microobjects in liquid. The proposed GeT probe realizes the pick and place of microobjects using adhesion to the thermoresponsive gel. The probe has a microheater, which can generate the thermal gel at the probe tip. The 10 wt% poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) solution, which is gelled over 32 \u00b0C, was used as a thermoresponsive polymer. The 3 dimensional structures were assembled by the probe. The temperature at the probe tip was analyzed using Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis in this paper. The fixation force by the thermal gel was also measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever. The results of temperature analysis show that the probe temperature was less than 50 \u00b0C even if the gel diameter is more than 200 \u00b5m. The enough gel was generated to handle cells even if the tip temperature was less than 40 \u00b0C. The results indicate that the probe can handle cells in a viable condition. And the measured fixation force was \u00b5N order force. The results show that the probe can generate larger force compared to optical tweezers, and the probe can generate enough force to handle large objects such as egg cells. The handling of microobjects in pure water was finally demonstrated by the probe. The results indicate that the environment for the probe application is not restricted in the thermoresponsive polymer solution. The evaluation in this paper shows that the GeT probe can contribute to handling microobjects, especially living cells.",

To optimize functionality of each module, a concept separating functionality from power supply is proposed and applied in immobile payload items which can be combined with mobile modules in varying configurations autonomously. By allowing consumers and power sources to connect to common power bus, the concept enhances flexibility, reusability and performance of modular robotic systems. The power management system based on the concept is implemented and evaluated. The experimental results show that power is efficiently transferred in power bus among individual modules, consumer modules without battery packs can be kept alive during switching, and the power management system can protect individual modules from hardware faults reliably.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we try to establish newly technique that the components of the biological clock are reconstituted into the liposome. In other words, we try to produce a nano size clock, capsulated into the liposome, made by protein molecules. The circadian clock is a basic cellular system found in almost all organisms. This clock generates self-sustained oscillations under constant conditions with a \u2248 24-hour (circadian) period. In cyanobacteria, circadian clock could be reconstituted in vitro only by mixing the three clock proteins, KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). So we reconstitute these proteins and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into phospholipid-coated microdroplet and confirmed the clock function. The clocks in phospholipids-coated microdroplet indicate long period more than 24 hour. In this case, period length became 35 hour, self-sustaining oscillation was reaming with little dumping. To reveal why the time cycle became long period, we observed localization of Kai proteins in phospholipid-coated microdroplets by using fluorescents labeled Kai proteins under fluorescent (conforcal) microscopy. From the observation of localization of Kai proteins, we found KaiB protein was distributed equivalently, on the other hand, KaiC protein was located near membrane of phospholipid-coated microdroplet. These results indicate that deferent localization between Kai proteins cause long period oscillation.",

Two of the approaches use gridmap data. A gridmap integrates each measurement in a chronological order. The third approach analyzes moving objects ahead of the ego vehicle. One approach has been published previously, the other two are new. A range estimation is necessary on country roads and completes each approach. All approaches are evaluated using a huge dataset of country roads. The driven trajectory is taken as ground truth for the evaluation. The advantages and disadvantages are determined for each approach. The results show the new approach based on gridmap data performs up to 78% better than the known one. The other new approach using moving objects as input information yields estimations which are about three times more accurate than the ones from the known approach.",

        "abstract": "Object localization using wireless sensor networks (WSN) often requires data from many sensor nodes and different types of sensors for position estimation. This incurs a heavy communication load, which can cause packet loss, communication delay and much energy consumption, deteriorating the performance of object localization. Here we employ an event-driven Gaussian process in order to learn the position of an unknown object using WSN with multiple types of sensors. In the event-driven framework, each sensor node transmits data only when decision criteria are satisfied. We consider the error-bounded algorithm as the decision criteria based on the measurement history of each sensor node. The overall communication between sensor nodes is reduced, thus increasing energy-efficiency of the network and relieving the concentration of communication traffic at the base node. Experiments to track the position of a mobile robot are conducted using a multi-sensor WSN, and the comparison is made between the event-driven framework and the conventional approach in which sensors transmit data at a constant sampling rate. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed event-driven Gaussian process approach.",

        "abstract": "BOLT is a lightweight bipedal ornithopter capable of high-speed dynamic running and effecting transitions between aerial and terrestrial locomotion modes. The gait dynamics of both quasi-static and dynamic locomotion are examined through the use of an on-board accelerometer, part of a one gram electronics package also containing a processor and radio. We discuss the accelerations in the context of the traditional spring-loaded inverted pendulum model seen in nearly all legged locomotion in organisms. Flapping wings are shown to provide damping along with propulsive force. The aerodynamic forces of the flapping wings also impart passive stability to the robot, enabling it to run bipedally with only a single actuator. BOLT transitions from ground running to aerial hovering in as little as one meter of runway. Overall, the advantages provided by wings in terrestrial locomotion, coupled with aerial capabilities, allow BOLT to navigate complex three dimensional environments, switching between locomotion modes when necessary.",

We report two alignment calibration methods employing only internal vehicle navigation sensors for velocity, acceleration, attitude, and depth. Results from laboratory experiments comparing these methods to previously reported techniques indicate satisfactory performance of the proposed methods.",

Experimental results show that it is possible to obtain grasp synthesis for a large set of objects both in the case of precision or power grasps by using only a very limited set of dominant eigengrasps. The tasks here presented are planned with an initial hold of the hand followed by reach and grasp phases, that are unique for each object/grasp combination, during which the robotic hand posture evolves continuously within a subset of the hand configuration space given by the two predominant eigenpostures.

In this paper, we present an experimental study of nineteen non-expert human subjects cooperatively carrying a long object with a robot partner. Our results demonstrate that human cooperative carrying behavior is much more complex than previously supposed, which has significant implications on the development of intelligent, physically interactive robot assistants.",

In our previous work, simulation studies revealed that a quadruped robot produces walk and trot patterns through dynamic interactions among the robot's mechanical system, the oscillator network system, and the environment. These studies also showed that a walk-trot transition is induced by changing the walking speed. In addition, the gait-pattern transition exhibited a hysteresis similar to that observed in the locomotion of humans and animals. The aim of the present study is to verify such dynamic characteristics in the gait generation of quadrupedal locomotion in the real world by developing and evaluating a quadruped robot.",

The master side, represented by a human operator, controls the group motion and receives suitable force feedback cues informing her/him about the remote slave motion status. Passivity theory is exploited for guaranteeing stability of the slave side and of the overall teleoperation channel.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method to estimate the relative motion of a vehicle from images of a single camera. The biggest problem in visual motion estimation is data association; matched points contain many outliers that must be detected and removed so that the motion can be estimated accurately. A very established method for robust motion estimation in the presence of outliers is the five-point RANSAC algorithm. Five-point RANSAC operates by generating motion hypotheses from randomly-sampled minimal sets of five-point correspondences. These hypotheses are then tested against all data points and the motion hypothesis that after a given number of iterations returns the largest number of inliers is taken as the solution to the problem. A typical drawback of RANSAC is that the number of iterations required to find a suitable solution grows exponentially with the number of outliers, often requiring thousands of iterations for typical data from urban environments. Another problem is that - due to its random nature - sometimes the found solution is not the \u201cbest\u201d solution to the motion estimation problem. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for relative motion estimation in the presence of outliers, which does not rely on RANSAC. Contrary to RANSAC, motion hypotheses are not generated from randomly-sampled point correspondences, but from a \u201cproposal distribution\u201d that is built by exploiting the vehicle non-holonomic constraints. We show that not only is the proposed algorithm significantly faster than RANSAC, but that the returned solution may also be better in that it favors the underlying motion model of the vehicle, thus overcoming the typical limitations of RANSAC. Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides the likelihood of the motion estimate, which can be very useful in all those applications where a probability distribution of the position of the vehicle is required (e.g., SLAM). Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared to that of the sta... Show More",

        "abstract": "For achieving dynamic manipulation capabilities that are comparable to human performance in terms of speed, energetic properties, and robustness, intrinsic elasticity is widely proposed as a necessary robot design element. In this paper we show how passive compliance can be exploited for a 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) cyclic ball dribbling task with a 7-DoF articulated Cartesian impedance controlled DLR Lightweight Robot III. For this, the robot is equipped with an elastic hand, which extends the contact time and therefore, also enlarges both, observability and controllability of the ball. We show via simulation and experiment that it is possible to achieve a stable dynamic cycle based on a 1 DoF analysis from [1] for the main axis together with control strategies for the secondary translations and rotations of the task. The scheme allows also the continuous tracking of a desired dribbling height and horizontal position. As a human is able to dribble blindly, we decided to solve the task by force sensing only, i.e. no vision is used for our approach, however, it could be easily incorporated.",

The resulting trajectories are smooth and free of local minima. A BVP planner has been recently used to compute trajectories in known inhomogeneous environments, corresponding to different degrees of traveling difficulties. In this case, we locally distort the potential field generating regions with high or low preferences for navigating. In this paper, we extend this idea, generating an strategy allowing the robot to explore an unknown environment dynamically considering environment preferences.

        "abstract": "Lidar and visual imagery have been broadly utilized in computer vision and mobile robotics applications because these sensors provide complementary information. However, in order to convert data between the local coordinate systems, we must estimate the rigid body transformation between the sensors. In this paper, we propose a robust-weighted extrinsic calibration algorithm that is implemented easily and has small calibration error. The extrinsic calibration parameters are estimated by minimizing the distance between corresponding features projected onto the image plane. The features are edge and centerline features on a v-shaped calibration target. The proposed algorithm contributes two ways to improve the calibration accuracy. First, we use different weights to distance between a point and a line feature according to the correspondence accuracy of the features. Second, we apply a penalizing function to exclude the influence of outliers in the calibration data sets. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of our extrinsic calibration algorithm, such as comparison of the RMS distance of the ground truth and the projected points, the effect of the number of lidar scan and image, and the effect of pose and range of the calibration target. In the experiments, we show our extrinsic calibration algorithm has calibration accuracy over 50% better than an existing state of the art approach. To evaluate the generality of our algorithm, we also colorize point clouds with different pairs of lidars and cameras calibrated by our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Direct transformation of sampling-based motion planning methods to the Information-state (belief) space is a challenge. The main bottleneck for roadmap-based techniques in belief space is that the incurred costs on different edges of the graph are not independent of each other. In this paper, we generalize the Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) framework to obtain a Feedback controller-based Information-state RoadMap (FIRM) that takes into account motion and sensing uncertainty in planning. The FIRM nodes and edges lie in belief space and the crucial feature of FIRM is that the costs associated with different edges of FIRM are independent of each other. Therefore, this construct essentially breaks the \u201ccurse of history\u201d in the original Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which models the planning problem. Further, we show how obstacles can be rigorously incorporated into planning on FIRM. All these properties stem from utilizing feedback controllers in the construction of FIRM.",

        "abstract": "In biological and medical sciences, optical microscopes are widely used. By using the microscope, we can observe cellular dynamics including intracellular ions and molecules tagged with fluorescent dyes at a high magnification. However, a freely motile cell easily escapes from a field of view and a focal plane of the typical microscope. Therefore, we propose a novel auto-focusing (AF) algorithm and develop an AF and tracking microscope. XYZ positions of a microscopic stage are visual feedback controlled to focus and track the cell automatically. A bright-field image is used to estimate a cellular position. XY centroids are used to estimate XY positions of the tracked cell. To estimate a Z position, we use a diffraction pattern around the cell membrane. This estimation method is so-called Depth from Diffraction (DFDi). However, this method is not robust for individual differences between cells because the diffraction pattern depends on each cellular shape, reflective index and transparency. Therefore, in this study, we propose a real-time correction of DFDi by using 2D Laplacian of a center region of the cell as a goodness of the focus. To evaluate the performance of our developed algorithm and microscope, we auto-focus and track a freely moving paramecium. In this experimental result, the paramecium is auto-focused and kept inside the scope of the microscope during 45s. The evaluated focal error is within 5[\u00b5m], while a length and a thickness of the paramecium are about 200[\u00b5m] and 50[\u00b5m], respectively.",

The main idea is to use the reduced convolution and filter the boundary by using the topological properties of the Minkowski sum. The main benefit of this proposed approach is from the fact that, in most cases, the complexity of the complete convolution is much higher than the complexity of the final Minkowski sum boundary. Therefore, the traditional approach often wastes a large portion of the computation on computing the arrangement induced by the complete convolution that is later on thrown away. Our method is designed to specifically avoid this waste of computation. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than the existing methods.",

Fast wheel-terrain interaction models suitable for real-time applications are thus important. In this paper, closed-form analytical expressions of the integrated stress equations were derived by quadratic approximation of the stresses along the wheel-soil interface. Meanwhile, the bulldozing resistance and the influence of grousers are also modeled for more accurate prediction of the vehicle motion. A non-iterative method was proposed to estimate the wheel-soil contact geometry, i.e., the entry angle, according to the wheel load, by approximating the vertical pressure distribution with a sinusoidal function or linear function depending on the sinkage exponent of the soil. Computation efficiency is improved by avoiding traditional recursive solution of the model under binary search. Online prediction and real-time control could be possible by using the developed closed-from wheel-soil interaction model and the entry angle estimator.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a fast plane extraction algorithm for 3D range data. Taking advantage of the point neighborhood structure in data acquired from 3D sensors like range cameras, laser range finders and Microsoft Kinect, it divides the plane-segment extraction task into three steps. The first step is a 2D line segment extraction from raw sensor data, interpreted as 2D data, followed by a line segment based connected component search. The final step finds planes based on connected segment component sets. The first step inspects 2D sub spaces only, leading to a line segment representation of the 3D scan. Connected components of segments represent candidate sets of coplanar segments. Line segment representation and connected components vastly reduce the search space for the plane-extraction step. A region growing algorithm is utilized to find coplanar segments and their optimal (least square error) plane approximation.

        "abstract": "This article presents a new technique to visual people tracking that combines feature-based object detection with feature tracking. In comparison to tracking by detection techniques which are frequently employed by feature-based approaches, the explicit tracking of detected features achieves a speed up of the overall tracking process and allows to adapt the chosen features on-line; this way, the tracker can specialize itself to tracking a specific object and gain an improved robustness in multi-object scenarios. Our approach uses a fast version of an implicit shape model detector (ISM) trained on people to initially find a person. The tracking process itself is then based on tracking the features found by the detector. Features are tracked by carrying out a correspondence search from frame to frame in combination with a voting scheme for determining a person's center position in the image. The approach does not require a motion model for the objects and is robust against bumpy or jerky motions of the camera. To further improve robustness, the feature set is continuously updated in order to adapt to changes in appearance. Experiments show that the proposed system is able to track multiple people. It also can re-identify persons after periods of occlusion and distinguish them from each other, even if they are looking similar. The system was tested on the BoBoT dataset and on a small mobile robot following a person traversing rough grassland.",

        "abstract": "An active needle is proposed for the development of MRI guided percutaneous procedures. The needle uses internal laser heating, conducted via optical fibers, of a shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator to produce bending in the distal section of the needle. Active bending of the needle as it is inserted allows it to reach small targets while overcoming the effects of interactions with surrounding tissue, which can otherwise deflect the needle away from its ideal path. The active section is designed to bend preferentially in one direction under actuation, and is also made from SMA for its combination of MR and bio-compatibility and its superelastic bending properties. A prototype, with a size equivalent to standard 16G biopsy needle, exhibits significant bending with a tip rotation of more than 10\u00b0. A numerical analysis and experiments provide information concerning the required amount of heating and guidance for design of efficient optical heating systems.",

Jumping at small sizes requires the quick release of stored energy to accelerate the robot to its takeoff velocity. Two approaches to this energy release are considered. The first is similar to the method used by most larger jumping robots and insects; energy is stored mechanically and generates thrust against the ground upon release. A new microfabrication process incorporates polymer springs for the robot leg and the resulting 4mm \u00d7 4mm \u00d7 0.3mm jumping mechanism has been launched over 32 cm into the air by hand. The second approach utilizes stored chemical energy and generates thrust by expelling gas from a chemical reaction. This energetic material has been combined with sensing, control, and power on a 4mm \u00d7 7mm \u00d7 4mm polymer chassis, and jumps in response to light stimuli have reached 8 cm in height.",

In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for deriving a recursive Gaussian state estimator for fitting conics to data corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. For this purpose, the original exact implicit measurement equation is reformulated with the help of suitable approximations as an explicit measurement equation corrupted by multiplicative noise. Based on stochastic linearization, an efficient Gaussian state estimator is derived for the explicit measurement equation. The performance of the new approach is evaluated by means of a typical ellipse fitting scenario.",

In this work, we demonstrate autonomous flight control of a 13 gram ornithopter capable of flying toward a target without remote assistance. For autonomous flight control, we developed 1.0 gram control electronics integrated with a microcontroller, inertial and visual sensors, communication electronics, and motor drivers. We also developed a simplified aerodynamic model of ornithopter flight to reduce the order of the control system. With the aerodynamic model and the orientation estimation from on-board inertial sensors, we present flight control of an ornithopter capable of flying toward a target using onboard sensing and computation only. To this end, we developed a dead-reckoning algorithm to recover from the temporary loss of the target which can occur with a visual sensor with a narrow field of view. As a result, the 28 cm wing-span ornithopter flying toward a target landed within a radius of 0.5 m from the target with more than 85% success (N = 20).",

This work highlights inconsistencies in the presentation of motion rules used for flocking, by implementing the well known rule by Hamilton on a robot system. We address a common assumption regarding the form of input to the motion rule: detection of whole agents and suggest that such detection is not necessarily justified. Our multi-robot system successfully exhibits flocking behaviors using an alternative detection method based entirely on low level sensor data. Furthermore, we show (under certain parameter settings), the behaviors exhibited by the agent-based and sensor-based detection are equivalent. We also discuss the various dynamics and implications the chosen detection process has on the behaviors of a motion rule.",

Our strategy combines two ideas: a flight phase strategy, which commands a hip angle trajectory prior to touchdown, and a stance phase strategy, which treats the spring-mass system as a force-controlled actuator and commands forces according to an ideal model of the passive dynamics. This combined strategy is self-stable for changes in ground height or ground impedance, and thus does not require an accurate ground model. Our strategy is promising for robotics applications, because there is a clear distinction between the passive dynamic behavior and the active controller, it does not require sensing of the environment, and it is based on a sound theoretical background that is compatible with existing high-level controllers.",

Parallel mechanism has been widely introduced to haptic device for advantageous benefits such as a high rigidity, a high output force, a high accuracy and a high backdrivability by its multi-legged structure and fixed actuators on the base. In parallel mechanism, the arm configuration can be asymmetric depending on the position, and thus it influences to the force producibility - an ability of force generation. Therefore, an evaluation on the force producibility is a critical issue for a further development of haptic device using parallel mechanism. In this paper, we propose a new approach for improvement of force producibility on a redundant parallel mechanism by using its redundant DOF. Our previously presented redundant parallel mechanism, DELTA-R, was used to show the feasibility of the concept. The forward kinematic model of DELTA-R was modified to decouple the output of X and Y axes to two arms, in taking into account the geometric conditions. In the proposed model, the output of X and Y axes are decoupled to two arms, and the effectiveness was tested in analytical and experimental manners. In addition, to adequately address the force producibility of parallel mechanism for haptic applications, we propose an evaluation technique, Extremal Force Diagram (EFD).",

        "abstract": "Robotics has been supplemented by the growing body of techniques associated with formal languages. One remaining challenge for bottom-up formal methods is to provide effective abstractions to their top-down counterparts in order to achieve a seamless integration. This paper describes our efforts to tackle this challenge in the domain of spatial behavior. Our general goal is to understand principles involved in the formation of hierarchic representations that can greatly simplify the control and planning tasks. We propose that this hierarchy be built from the bottom-up according to formal language principles, while incorporating principles from dynamical systems theory. The general idea is that relevant interactions between the agent's dynamics, task and environment are manifested as patterns. Compared to other approaches these patterns are not based on abstract, high-level constructs but convey a form of meaning that inherently ties the system's dynamics, environment and task characteristics. Understanding the natural principles underlying hierarchic organization of behavior is a fundamental step toward developing formal languages dealing with dynamical systems. It can be applied to help understand spatial intelligence and eventually help design more versatile and adaptive agents.",

The operators are required to command only one unit in the head, then commands for the rest of the units are automatically calculated to track the path of the preceding units. The proposed method estimates the tracking error expressed in the Frenet frame using past velocity commands in order to determine the control inputs. Since the past velocity commands stored at discrete points are used for estimation of the tracking error, we also propose a method to dynamically change the data storage interval for reducing the amount of data stored, without losing the accuracy of estimation.

        "abstract": "Biped walking improves the circulation of blood as well as bone density of the lower limbs, thereby enhancing the quality of life (QOL). It is significant not only to healthy people but also to physically challenged persons such as complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The purpose of this paper is to propose an estimation algorithm that infers the intention related to the forward leg-swing in order to support the gait for complete SCI patients wearing an exoskeleton system called a Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL), and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through a clinical trial. The proposed algorithm infers the patient's intention in synchronization with the deviation of the center of the ground reaction force (CoGRF) that is observed immediately before a person starts walking. The patient conveys this intention by inducing the deviation of the CoGRF, using crutches or handrails with both of his/her arms. In the clinical trial, we confirmed that the algorithm inferred the patient's intention to swing the leg forward, and achieved a smooth gait in synchronization with it. As a result, the gait speed and cadence of the SCI patient with HAL during the 10-meter walking test increased to 6.67 [m/min] and 20 [steps/min], respectively after several trials.",

One of the main appealing tasks is gas mapping, i.e., the characterization of the chemical properties (concentration, dispersion, etc.) of the air within an environment. Current approaches rely on a robot using standard localization and mapping techniques to fuse gas measures with spatial features. These approaches require sophisticated sensors and/or high computational resources. We propose a minimalistic approach, in which one or multiple low-cost robots exploit the ability to store information in the environment, or \u00bfstigmergy\u00bf, to effectively compute an artificial potential leading toward the likely location of the gas source, as indicated by a highest gas concentration or fluctuation. The potential is computed and stored directly on an array of RFID tags buried under the floor. Our approach has been validated in extensive experiments performed on real robots in a domestic environment.",

        "abstract": "The distinctive feature of modular robots consists in their reconfigurable mechanical structure, as they are assembled on-demand from basic mechatronic units. This implies that kinematic models of the robots need to be computed on a case-by-case basis for each specific assembly, which is a manual and hence time-consuming and error-prone procedure. We propose to automate this process by automatically computing such kinematic models starting from simple descriptions of the modules and their assemblies. This automated computation is supported by our toolchain for programming arbitrary modular robots in arbitrary configurations, presented in this paper. We contribute two novel results through this approach. First, a high-level programming language that provides kinematic abstractions for arbitrary modular robots, in contrast to the robot-specific solutions currently available. Second, a programming abstraction to subsume multiple kinematically equivalent robot assemblies into a so-called kinematic configuration, hence eliminating the need to explicitly enumerate and program each of them. These contributions advance current techniques for modular robot programming by demonstrating a tool that a) targets multiple mechanical platforms, offering the first general solution for modular robot programming, and b) raises the abstraction level by allowing users to reason and program in terms of standardized kinematic models that are automatically mapped to physical robot configurations by the toolchain.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for interactive modeling of objects and object relations based on real-time segmentation of video sequences. In interaction with a human, the robot can perform multi-object segmentation through principled modeling of physical constraints. The key contribution is an efficient multi-labeling framework, that allows object modeling and disambiguation in natural scenes. Object modeling and labeling is done in a real-time segmentation system, to which hypotheses and constraints denoting relations between objects can be added incrementally. Through instructions such as key presses or spoken words, a scene can be segmented in regions corresponding to multiple physical objects. The approach solves some of the difficult problems related to disambiguation of objects merged due to their direct physical contact. Results show that even a limited set of simple interactions with a human operator can substantially improve segmentation results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the locomotor behaviors of a biped robot on a splitbelt treadmill using a locomotion-control system composed of nonlinear oscillators with phase resetting. Our results show that the robot establishes stable walking on the treadmill at various speeds of the belts due to modulation of the rhythm and phase by phase resetting. In addition, the phase differences between the leg movements shifted from out of phase, and duty factors were autonomously modulated depending on the speed discrepancy between the belts occurring through dynamic interactions among the robot's mechanical system, the oscillator control system, and the environment. Such shifts of phase differences between the leg movements and modulations of duty factors are observed during human splitbelt treadmill walking, and our results suggest that our dynamic model using the robot and oscillator control system reflects a certain essence of the ability to produce adaptive locomotor behaviors.",

Existing solutions are often strongly related to (1) a specific kind of mission and (2) the nature of the considered AUVs. So, it is difficult to reuse these approaches when switching to another mission context. This paper proposes a generic multi-agent based layered architecture for designing and specifying AUV flotillas at a high level of abstraction, regardless of the AUVs characteristics and skills. To this end, an organizational model is used to ease and regulate interactions between heterogeneous AUVs and combined with a behavioral reactive approach for limiting communication.",

In this paper, we propose to extend this hierarchical approach by using a cascade of quadratic programs to handle simultaneously the robot dynamics, inequality and equality constraints, and multiple non-coplanar unilateral contacts. First, we detail the proposed generic inverse-dynamics solver. Then, we prove that the model used to handle contacts encompasses the classical zero-moment-point balance condition. Finally, as an example of the capabilities of the method, we generate a complex motion where the humanoid robot HRP2 sits down on an armchair, using the armrests as additional contacts, while ensuring joint position and velocity limits.",

This framework describes both the local maneuverability in the neighborhood of each shape the system can assume and the cyclic maneuverability achieved by executing gaits from a library. Additionally, the gait-level analysis includes tools that direct the search for gaits whose inclusion into the library will usefully improve the maneuverability.

In this paper, we propose a novel grasping algorithm that uses active vision as basis. The algorithm uses the curvature information obtained from the silhouette of the object. By maximizing the curvature value, the pose of the robot is updated and a suitable grasping configuration is achieved. The algorithm has certain advantages over the existing methods: It does not require a 3D model of the object to be extracted, and it does not rely on any knowledge base obtained offline. This leads to a faster and still reliable grasping of the target object in 3D. The performance of the algorithm is examined by simulations and experiments, and successful results are obtained.",

        "abstract": "For some time now machine learning methods have been widely used in perception for autonomous robots. While there have been many results describing the performance of machine learning techniques with regards to their accuracy or convergence rates, relatively little work has been done on developing theoretical performance guarantees about their stability and robustness. As a result, many machine learning techniques are still limited to being used in situations where safety and robustness are not critical for success. One way to overcome this difficulty is by using reachability analysis, which can be used to compute regions of the state space, known as reachable sets, from which the system can be guaranteed to remain safe over some time horizon regardless of the disturbances. In this paper we show how reachability analysis can be combined with machine learning in a scenario in which an aerial robot is attempting to learn the dynamics of a ground vehicle using a camera with a limited field of view. The resulting simulation data shows that by combining these two paradigms, one can create robotic systems that feature the best qualities of each, namely high performance and guaranteed safety.",

        "abstract": "Robot audition, which aims at multiple simultaneous human-robot communications in noisy environments, has undergone rapid development since last decade. For a common scenario, robot audition systems usually generate a huge amount of chronological data. These data fall into several categories: sound source locations and orientations, separated sound sources and recognized speeches. In order to efficiently assist people in understanding and analyzing the scenario, it is necessary to organize the data in a delicate way. To achieve this goal, we suggest Speech Arrow which conveys recognized speeches in animated arrow shaped frames. Speech Arrow is highly integrated, intuitive and vivid. In this paper, a single pane auditory scene visualizer is implemented to support Speech Arrow. The visualizer is 3D real-time virtual reality system based on the open source robot audition system HARK. It includes two versions, one of which restores original auditory scenes with offline raw data. The other analyzes and displays online instant data without any delay to help hearing impaired people. We demonstrate that our visualizer improves auditory awareness considerably with experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the theoretical background and practical implementation of a large-scale, low-performance haptic remote control setup. The experimental system consists of a pair of KUKA Light Weight Robots (LWR) coupled to a Willow Garage Personal Robot (PR2) via two different robotic frameworks. The haptic \u201cperformance\u201d is, of course, not comparable to dedicated haptic applications, but has its use as a test-bed for interaction between \u201clegacy\u201d service robot systems, that have not been especially designed for mutual haptic interaction. We discuss some major application problems, and the future work needed for nonuniform robot coupling. Beside haptic coupling, we provide the human operator with visual feedback. To this end, the head movements of the human operator are coupled to the head movement of the PR2 and the images of the eye cameras are displayed to the human operator using a wearable display. The presented teleoperation application is furthermore an example of the integration of two component-based robotic frameworks namely OROCOS (Open Robot Control Software)and ROS (Robot Operating System) Experimental results regarding the haptic coupling are presented using an \u201cartistic\u201d painting task for qualitative results, and a hard contact at the slave side for quantitative results.",

For the design of a robotic bee (RoboBee) it is necessary to optimize across the design space for minimum weight and power consumption to increase flight time; however, the design space of a single component is large, the interconnectedness and tradeoffs across components must be considered, and interdisciplinary collaborations cause different component design timelines. In this work, we show how the development of a hardware in the loop (HWIL) system for a flapping wing microrobot can simplify and accelerate evaluation of a large number of design choices. Specifically, we explore the design space of the visual system including sensor hardware and associated optical flow processing. We demonstrate the utility of the HWIL system in exposing trends on system performance for optical flow algorithm, field of view, sensor resolution, and frame rate.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we relax the assumption of network connectivity within the sensor network and introduce mobile communication relays to the network. This addition converts the homogeneous sensor network to a heterogeneous one. Based on the communication geometry of both sensing and communication relay agents we derive communication constraints within the network that guarantee network connectivity. We then define a heterogeneous proximity graph that encodes the communication links that exist within the heterogeneous network. By specifying particular edge weights in the proximity graph, we provide a technique for biasing particular connections within the heterogeneous sensor network. Through a minimal spanning tree approach, we show how to minimize communication links within the network which allows for larger feasible motion sets of the sensing agents that guarantee the network remains connected. We also provide an algorithm that allows for adding communication links to the minimal spanning tree of the heterogeneous proximity graph to create a biconnected graph that is robust to a single node failure. We then combine a prioritized search algorithm and the communication constraints to provide a decentralized prioritized sensing control algorithm for a heterogeneous sensor network that maintains network connectivity.",

In this regard, previous groups have suggested simplified motor tasks involving dual robotic interfaces. However, these interfaces involved arm movements with a high degree of kinematic and muscle redundancy. This paper introduces a simple, yet versatile dual-wrist robotic interface, Hi5, that allows us to investigate the motor processes behind human-human and bimanual interaction control, and avoid confounds inherent of arm movements. This paper presents the design of Hi5 and the implemented safety measures. Performance tests then demonstrate its capacity to yield high dynamics, and exhibit low values for inertia and friction. Preliminary experiments show how Hi5 allows us to analyze the specific kinematic, torque and muscle activation patterns of each partner and disambiguate their roles in force and impedance control.",

In addition to the formal description of the approach, we present an implementation for tabletop manipulation tasks and an information-driven exploration algorithm for autonomously building a hierarchical map from sensor data. We evaluate our approach using real-world as well as simulated data. The results demonstrate that our method is able to efficiently represent 3D environments at high levels of detail. Compared to a monolithic approach, our maps can be generated significantly faster while requiring significantly less memory.",

        "abstract": "The on-chip fabrication and manipulation of microstructures are expected to be applied for single cell analysis system such as cell manipulation and measurement tools. In this paper, we previously present a methodology for fabricating and assembling microstructures inside a microfluidic channel. By the illumination of patterned UV-ray through the mask under a microscope, microstructures with arbitrary shape are made of the photo-crosslinkable resin inside microfluidic device. The microstructures are fabricated at the desired place inside microfluidic channel and manipulated by optical tweezers. Based on the technique which can manipulate multiple points simultaneously by high-speed scanning of a single laser with galvanometer mirror, a rotational microstructure made of a microgear and a rotation axis is assembled and rotated. We also report two methods of solution replacement inside microfluidic channel which reduces viscosity of solvent in order to improve manipulation performance. By adjusting the concentration of photo-crosslinkable resin and replacing solution components, the viscosity of solvent inside channel can be changed. The manipulation speed of the rotational microstructure increases when the viscosity of solvent decreases, because the viscosity resistance for the movement of microstructure is weaker inside lower viscosity solvent. We fabricate rotational microstructures inside lower viscosity solvent and evaluate the movement efficiency compared with microstructures inside former high viscosity solvent.",

        "abstract": "The hand-eye problem consists in computing the poses between pairs of different coordinate frames fixed to the same rigid body from measurements of such poses as the body moves. Various procedures have been proposed over the past two decades for solving this problem in presence of noise, especially for a robot as the moving body. As a matter of fact, different formulations of the problem in terms of the well known AX=XB or AX=ZB equations implement different flavors of an error minimization procedure, either least-square or non-linear, on the basis of a common algebra. It is shown in this paper that better results in terms of accuracy can be obtained outside the conventional approach. Rather than fitting the calibration matrices out of a number of random poses, the presented method superimposes easily programmable robot poses in order to attain a set of constant manifolds, like points, circles and axes, among the different coordinate frames. Such manifolds are used for identifying the constant relationships between the coordinate frames that are in fact the poses under estimation. The proposed method presents the implementation of a simple robot motion routine for generating the manifolds. Standard mathematical tools are used for fitting the manifolds out of an actual realization of the procedure with tracked markers. The geometry of the proposed manifolds also reduces the propagation of the measurement noise that usually affects the conventional computation based on relative poses. Results are given in simulation and with a real setup in comparison with the most popular state-of-the-art algorithms.",

The backdrivability is important and necessary for robots that operate around our life space to guarantee the safety of us, themselves and environments. A rotational actuator with a high reduction ratio reducer has been commonly used in traditional robotics field, but it cannot realize the high-backdrivability without any sensory feedback. In this study, several high-backdrivable shaft actuators are used instead of it. Moreover, the CVT mechanism which is brought by a novel configuration of the parallel mechanism is employed effectively. To utilize multiple shaft actuators with the CVT mechanism is able to surmount a drawback of the shaft actuator whose output force is relatively weak. A simple 1 DOF manipulator is proposed as the first step of this study. Firstly, its kinematic and dynamic models are given. Next, a PD type feedback control signal to regulate the arm's angle and the CVT simultaneously is designed. A static relation between an output end-point force and the CVT mechanism is analyzed. Finally, several fundamental experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed mechanism.",

Due to the nature of modular robots, we address problems that include requirements on the geometry and motion characteristics of the robot; these requirements are captured using traits in the specification that are then used in the control generation process. Outlined in this paper is our approach for generating all the lower levels of control for a modular robot given the high-level problem statement. The approach includes the use of a configuration-gait-trait library for characterizing modular robots and tools for populating this library such as a physics-based simulator and gait creator.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for mobile robot exploration based on the idea of frontier exploration which suggests navigating the robot toward the boundaries between free and unknown areas in the map. A global occupancy grid map of the environment is constantly updated, based on which a global frontier map is calculated. Then, a histogram based approach is adopted to cluster frontier cells and score these clusters based on their distance from the robot as well as the number of frontier cells they contain. In each stage of the algorithm, a sub-goal is set for the robot to navigate. A combination of distance transform and A* search algorithms is utilized to generate a plausible path toward the sub-goal through the free space. This way keeping a reliable distance from obstacles is guaranteed while searching for the shortest path toward the sub-goal. When such a path is generated, a B-spline interpolated and smoothed trajectory is produced as the control reference for the mobile robot to follow. The whole process is iterated until no unexplored area remains in the map. The efficiency of the method is shown through simulated and real experiments.",

        "abstract": "Handing over objects to humans is an essential capability for assistive robots. While there are infinite ways to hand an object, robots should be able to choose the one that is best for the human. In this paper we focus on choosing the robot and object configuration at which the transfer of the object occurs, i.e. the hand-over configuration. We advocate the incorporation of user preferences in choosing hand-over configurations. We present a user study in which we collect data on human preferences and a human-robot interaction experiment in which we compare hand-over configurations learned from human examples against configurations planned using a kinematic model of the human. We find that the learned configurations are preferred in terms of several criteria, however planned configurations provide better reachability. Additionally, we find that humans prefer hand-overs with default orientations of objects and we identify several latent variables about the robot's arm that capture significant human preferences. These findings point towards planners that can generate not only optimal but also preferable hand-over configurations for novel objects.",

The objectives of this paper are the layout optimization of exhibits to reduce congestion and the amenity space design. For these purposes, macro modeling of human swarm behavior and the optimization method of a layout of exhibits are required. So far, human swarm behavior has been modeled by two-dimensional vector field and individual behavior is represented by dynamics including collision avoidance vector of individuals. In this paper, we extend the human model to multi-dimensional dynamics in order to represent individual characteristics in measured data and visitors' stopping to view exhibits. In addition, a layout of exhibits is optimized based on the proposed model by minimizing collision avoidance vector. The proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments using swarm robots which consist of autonomous mobile robots and radio controlled robots. The results show that the comfortable exhibition space is designed.",

In an experiment subjects had to assemble a tower by combining six cubes with several bolts for their own without the influence of a robot or any other technical device. To estimate the current action of the human, we have trained composite HMMs. After the successful evaluation on disjunct experimental data sets, the models are transferred to the assistive robotic system JAHIR, where the same assembly tasks was executed. A new 3D occupancy grid approach was used to determine the hand positions of the worker. The positions were then used to compute the inputs of the analysis HMMs. The workflow of the right hand could be recognized with an accuracy of 92:26% which is nearly as good as the recognition rate of reference experiments",

An accurate imitation of human motion and a robust bipedal walking motion are, however, hardly realized together. We therefore focus on only three characteristics of human walking motion: single toe support, knee stretching, and swing leg motion. Based on a conventional pattern generator, single toe support is added, waist height is changed in order to stretch the knees as much as possible, and swing leg motion is generated approximating the human's motion. The generated motion is then filtered to provide a feasible pattern. In addition, the stabilizer is improved in order to keep the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) within the tiny support polygon during the single support phase with toe link. Finally, we successfully demonstrate the generated walking pattern with the robot HRP-4C.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hybrid visual tracking algorithm that combines two discriminative trackers. Discriminative trackers treat tracking as a classification problem, that is, they try to distinguish targets from backgrounds, and usually the trackers incorporate classifiers. The two trackers collectively determine the new object location via a process called confidence fusion. The two trackers are aimed to complement the ability of discrimination. To achieve this goal, one tracker extracts image features pixel by pixel, and the other extracts image features over several rectangular regions. In addition, the corresponding classifiers are trained using different learning algorithms. We not only model object tracking as a binary classification problem but also model it as a three-class classification problem. On-line learning algorithms are used to update the classifiers during tracking so that the trackers are adaptive to the variations of the appearance of the target. A set of rules including tracker switching and confidence fusion is devised to synthesize the two trackers. The experimental results show that our approach is competitive with other popular tracking algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses capillary self-alignment assisted hybrid microassembly of chips on low precision patterns, in both the precision of the dimension and the precision of the edge smoothness. Special segmented patterns having jagged edges have been purposely designed and fabricated to mimic some real-world RFID antennas. Experimental tests have been carried out to investigate influence of the dimension and the edge jaggedness on the yield and accuracy of the self-alignment, using 730 \u00d7 730 \u00d7 70 \u00bfm RFID chips as the test samples. The results show that the self-alignment occurs reliably with releasing bias less than 300 \u00bfm in both horizontal axes, despite the variation in size of the segmented pattern and edge jaggedness. However, both the dimension and the edge jaggedness affect the alignment accuracy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Let us consider the control problem of bilateral teleoperation over the Internet. One of its important, yet, often overlooked, aspects is its hybrid nature, that is, the (nonlinear) master and slave robots are continuous-time systems with sampled-data controls, while the Internet between them is a discrete-time packet-switching communication channel with the communication unreliability (e.g., varying-delay, packet-loss, data duplication/swapping, etc.). To tackle this problem, a hybrid proportional-derivative (PD) type control framework has recently been proposed in [1], which, by utilizing the hybrid nature, can enforce closed-loop passivity and asymptotic position/force coordination, by compensating for the Internet's communication unreliability solely via device viscous damping. This scheme of [1], yet, requires large device damping when the communication delay/loss is large, thus, would not be so suitable if the device's un-tunable damping is low, but, the communication unreliability is severe. In this paper, extending the results of [1], [2], [3], we propose a novel virtual-proxy based hybrid teleoperation control framework, which can passify the Internet's communication unreliability through the virtual proxy's tunable discrete damping, thus, removing the requirement of large device damping of [1] and rendering a more flexible framework than [1], while providing explicit position feedback via the PD-action. Simulation is also performed to verify the theory.",

This article addresses the identification procedure for this model. The deformation phase uses a PieceWise Affine (PWA) model.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple yet novel method for recognition of certain sorts of moving entities incorporating their shape and motion patterns. Although shape features have been commonly employed in object recognition, motion characteristics are in general not integrated to geometric models. In the interest of utilizing the motion attributes, the trajectories are investigated to extract the \u2018coherence quality\u2019 of the entities. Besides, at every step a geometric shape model is adopted and the parameters defining the shape model are utilized in obtaining the prior probabilities of the entities being a member of a particular class of interest. The coherence quality is used to get the posterior probabilities through a Bayesian approach. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of coherence quality in identification of moving entities. The proposed method is tested against clutter and occlusion in an uncontrolled environment with patterns collected from over 500 entities. It is shown to yield a satisfactory performance rate of 92% over the entire dataset with significant generalization capabilities without any restrictions on the application setting and with considerable occlusion and clutter.",

A vibrating sample magnetometer was used to determine the magnetic moment of the particles. Finite element method simulations were used to verify the magnetic behavior of the designed setup. The system was used to position the particles within 8.4\u00b5m of a setpoint, achieving speeds of up to 235\u00b5m s\u22121.

While so far researchers focused on abstracting kinematic relations, only little attention has been paid to force information. In this work we study imitation learning of human grasping skills from motion and force data. For this purpose a teleoperation system is realized that allows a human to control a simulated robotic hand and to grasp objects in a virtual environment. Haptic rendering algorithms are implemented to calculate interaction forces that occur when touching the virtual object. While learning of fingertip interaction forces is shown to result in physical inconsistency compared to the demonstrations, we show that learning of internal tensions leads to stable reproductions of the demonstrated grasping skill. Obtained results further indicate an enlarged generalisation capability of grasping skills learnt on the basis of motion and force data compared to grasping skills that encode kinematic relations only.",

        "abstract": "A large workspace and proper force capabilities of a robotic thumb can be obtained using a tensegrity structure for the actuation, similar to the human thumb base muscles. Using nonlinear stiffness elements and an antagonistic architecture, the joint stiffness can be adjusted by variation of the tendon pre-tension. However, the highly nonlinear actuation creates new control challenges and in particular the nonlinear tendon kinematics must be accounted for. Despite the challenges, the nonlinear structure is required to achieve the desired torques. In this paper, the dynamic equations of a tendon driven thumb are established. An efficient formulation is proposed to generate the pretension forces in order to preserve the torques and approximate the stiffness matrix. A cascaded structure is used for the controller. The equations for the inner tendon force control loop and the outer impedance control loop are presented. Because of the absence of link side position sensors, an iterative estimation algorithm is proposed and implemented in real-time. It is shown that, using the mechanical joint flexibility, the controller impedance gain can be adjusted to improve the steady-state effective impedance. The search algorithm robustness is evaluated through a set of simulations. Finally, experimental results and equivalent simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our controller.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an improved speaker localization method based on the generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method weighted by the phase transform (PHAT) for binaural robot audition. The problem with the conventional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based on the GCC-PHAT method is a multipath interference whereby a sound wave travels to microphones via the front-head path and the back-head path in binaural robot audition. This paper describes a new time delay factor for the GCC-PHAT method to compensate multipath interference on the assumption of spherical robot head. In addition, the restriction of the time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation by the sampling frequency is also solved by applying the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in frequency domain. Experiments conducted in the SIG-2 humanoid robot show that the proposed method reduces localization errors by 17.8 degrees on average and by over 35 degrees in side directions comparing to the conventional DOA estimation.",

        "abstract": "When an autonomous vehicle operates in an unknown environment, it must remember the locations of environmental objects and use those object to maintain an accurate location of itself. This vehicle is faced with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), a circularly defined robotics problem of map building with no prior knowledge. The SLAM problem is a difficult but critical component of autonomous vehicle exploration with applications to search and rescue missions. This paper presents the first SLAM solution combining stereo cameras, inertial measurements, and vehicle odometry into a Multiple Integrated Navigation Sensor (MINS) path. The FastSLAM algorithm, modified to make use of the MINS path, observes and maps the environment with a LIDAR unit. The MINS FastSLAM algorithm closes a 140 meter loop with a path error that remains within 1 meter of surveyed truth. This path reduces the error 79% from an odometry FastSLAM output and uses 30% of the particles.",

        "abstract": "Operational space control has a number of desirable characteristics but is sensitive to model accuracy. For heavy machines the dynamics are difficult to model due to their friction and dynamic coupling, thus making full compensation imprecise. This work presents an approach in which a simplified model gives partial compensation via an open-loop feedforward input, pre-calculated in forward simulation. In this way, effects that are difficult to compensate for can be partially corrected without causing instability. Since the reference trajectory is known a priori, dynamic model parameters are tuned in its neighbourhood, reducing the burden of global modelling. The feasibility and performance of this approach is shown experimentally via improved free motion tracking of an excavator arm. This framework further supports efforts for direct impedance control between bucket tip and soil.",

In this paper, we present an intensity-based approach to control both in-plane and out-of-plane motions of an ultrasound probe held by a robotic arm in order to reach and follow one organ cross section. Two methods are proposed to improve the accuracy of this intensity-based approach, by estimating on-line the 3D image gradient required in the control law and by considering a bi-plane sensor. Robotic experiments are performed with two different ultrasound sensors on a realistic abdominal phantom and validate this visual servoing approach.",

We propose this approach for vasculature modeling as part of a guidance system relying on augmented reality for assistance during aortic stent graft deploy. This guidance will facilitate the alignment of the holes on the stent graft walls with the renal and mesenteric arteries ramifications. First we studied the disturbances on the magnetic tracker measurements induced by IVUS emitter after assembling the two sensors together. Then we performed a scan with the hybrid probe inside a blood silicone model submerged into a water tank, captured and fused data from both sensors. The dispersion of samples increased less than 1mm in the evaluated locations while the IVUS was activated. This enabled the construction of a three-dimensional model in virtual reality of the blood vessel model relying on the sensor fusion.",

        "abstract": "Application of the compliance to increase the robustness of the bipedal walker locomotion is the main target of this paper. The control of bipedal robots with point feet is one of the most challenging problems in the domain of hybrid dynamical systems. In order to make an exponentially stable periodic walking for an Acrobot as a planar biped with only one degree of freedom, a controller is designed based on the hybrid zero dynamics analysis. Then, through appropriate alterations in robot structure, the controller complexities are reduced which result in fewer parameters for tuning. Improvement of the robot structure via compliance insertion not only compensates the lower degree of freedom of the control design process, but also expands the domain of stability of the closed-loop system. In this regard, a nonlinear damper is inserted between two legs of Acrobot to enable it to walk on a wider range of slopes. The main controller is designed for walking on a flat terrain and the compliance of the damper empowers it to make stable walking on slopes up to 17\u00b0. The simulation results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Using pre-recorded templates to estimate and suppress the ego noise of a robot is advantageous because this method is able to cope with the non-stationarity of this particular type of noise. However, standard template-based estimation requires human intervention in the offline training sessions, storage of large amounts of data and does not adapt to the dynamical changes in the environmental conditions. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of an incremental template learning system to tackle these drawbacks. Incremental learning enables the system to acquire new templates on the fly and update the older ones appropriately. Whilst allowing the system to continually increase its knowledge and enhancing its estimation performance, this learning scheme also reduces the size of the database. We evaluate the performance of the proposed noise estimation method in terms of its estimation accuracy, quality of speech signals enhanced by spectral subtraction method, and size of database. The experimental results show that our system compared to conventional single-channel noise estimation methods achieves better performance in attaining signal quality and improving word correct rates.",

A new PDF is then generated with an efficient update procedure that is guaranteed to reduce the uncertainty of the system. The application we have targeted for this work is the localization and automatic registration of a robotic surgical probe relative to preoperative images during image-guided surgery. We demonstrate the feasibility of our constrained filtering approach with data collected from an experiment involving a surgical robot navigating on the epicardial surface of a porcine heart.",

        "abstract": "A method for estimating the rotation center position (RCP) of a rigid body in the x-y plane using two offset accelerometers is presented. RCP estimation via inertial measurement is motivated by the related problems of detecting foot slippage of legged robots and detecting stair edges for treaded robots, for applications in which alternative methods such as discontinuity recognition, visual tracking, and/or tactile feedback are impractical. The RCP may be directly solved for as a function of the two offset tangential acceleration measurements, when the RCP is colinear with the two accelerometers, and when the common-mode tangential accelerations, due to linear acceleration and/or gravity, can be independently measured or estimated. Angular velocity estimates may be enhanced by combining calculated angular acceleration with gyroscope measurements, even when both the RCP and common-mode tangential accelerations cannot be independently measured. An input variance modulated variable cutoff low-pass filter is also proposed for RCP estimation in the absence of independent measurements, which is validated on a balance-beam inverted-pendulum apparatus.",

In particular, the spline trajectories obtained with the proposed generator are characterized from a frequency point of view. Their frequency content is completely determined by the degree p and by the time period T between the equally-spaced knots. It is therefore possible to select these parameters with the purpose of suppressing residual vibrations, that may be present because elastic phenomena affecting the robotic system. In this sense, the proposed approach is very similar to input shaping methods and allows to find a trade-off between two different problems: on one side the requirement of exactly interpolating a set of given points by means of a complex trajectory such as a spline, on the other hand the need of suppressing mechanical vibrations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by applying it to the generation of a 3D trajectory for a cartesian robot with elastic joints.",

Due to the limited control bandwidth of pneumatic muscles, stiffness characteristics and their effects on safety in the frequency domain should be taken into account. This paper introduces the concept of instantaneous stiffness and validates its model with the Stanford Safety Robot (S2\u03c1. The potential effects of instantaneous stiffness on safety is explored through experimental comparison of peak impact accelerations under various impact conditions. Instantaneous stiffness demonstrates different effects on the impact acceleration depending on impact velocity and controller gain. Finally, the paper discusses the stiffness characteristics as a guideline for design and control to improve the robot safety while maintaining the control performance.",

Most of the state-of-the-art methods of object detection and localization are category-dependent. These methods can achieve a significant performance. However, they are useless for detecting and localizing objects belonging to an unknown category when applying them to an unknown environment. In this paper, a method is proposed for detecting and localizing generic objects without specifying their categories. The proposed method combines diverse cues, including multi-scale saliency, superpixels straddling, intensity, depth and global information, into a uniform Bayesian framework to obtain accurate detection and localization. By comparison to state-of-the-art methods, our experiments show the promising performance of the proposed method based on the PASCAL VOC 08 dataset and our indoor scene dataset.",

Through a combination of appearance and structural cues derived from stereo omnidirectional color cameras, the algorithm is able to detect and track rough paths despite widely varying tread material, border vegetation, and illumination conditions. The approaching trail region is modeled as a circular arc segment of constant width. Using likelihood formulations which measure color, brightness, and/or height contrast between a hypothetical region and flanking areas, the tracker performs a robust randomized search for the most likely trail region and robot pose relative to it with no a priori appearance model. The addition of the structural information, which is derived from a semi-global dense stereo algorithm with ground-plane fitting, is shown to improve trail segmentation accuracy and provide an additional layer of safety beyond solely ladar-based obstacle avoidance. Our system's ability to follow a variety of trails is demonstrated through live runs as well as analysis of offline runs on several long sequences with diverse appearance and structural characteristics using ground-truth segmentations.",

        "abstract": "We have assessed robust tracking of humans based on intelligent Sound Source Localization (SSL) for a robot in a real environment. SSL is fundamental for robot audition, but has three issues in a real environment: robustness against noise with high power, lack of a general framework for selective listening to sound sources, and tracking of inactive and/or noisy sound sources. To address the first issue, we extended Multiple SIgnal Classification by incorporating Generalized EigenValue Decomposition (GEVD-MUSIC) so that it can deal with high power noise and can select target sound sources. To address the second issue, we proposed Sound Source Identification (SSI) based on hierarchical gaussian mixture models and integrated it with GEVD-MUSIC to realize a selective listening function. To address the third issue, we integrated audio-visual human tracking using particle filtering. Integration of these three techniques into an intelligent human tracking system showed: 1) GEVD-MUSIC improved the noise-robustness of SSL by a signal-to-noise ratio of 5-6 dB; 2) SSI performed more than 70% in F-measure even in a noisy environment; and 3) audio-visual integration improved the average tracking error by approximately 50%.",

        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of automobile accidents is related to driving impairment due to drowsiness. A large percentage of these accidents occur due to drivers' unawareness of the degree of impairment. An automatic detection of drowsiness levels could lead to lower accidents and hence lower fatalities. However, the significant fluctuations of the drowsiness state within a short time poses a major challenge in this problem. In response to such a challenge, we present the Uncorrelated Fuzzy Locality Preserving Analysis (UFLPA) feature projection method. The proposed UFLPA utilizes the changes in driver behavior, by means of the corresponding Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to extract a set of features that can highly discriminate between the different drowsiness levels. Unlike existing methods, the proposed UFLPA takes into consideration the fuzzy nature of the input measurements while preserving the local discriminant and manifold structures of the data. Additionally, UFLPA also utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to avoid the singularity problem and produce a set of uncorrelated features. Experiments were performed on datasets collected from thirty-one subjects participating in a simulation driving test with practical results indicating the significance of the results achieved by UFLPA of 94%-95% accuracy on average across all subjects.",

Scientific discourse about such architectures requires means to compare approaches and identify common directions. In this contribution we put forth the hypothesis that a meaningful comparison is possible only by translation to a common language. We present SYSTEMATICA 2D as such a common language, suitable for translation and comparison of architectures because it is both formal in its description and flexible in the range of systems which can be expressed. Main result of this contribution is the translation and comparison of three recent popular system architectures: the CogX George system[1], the ALIS3 system running on the Honda humanoid robot[2] and the iCub Cognitive Architecture[3]. Common patterns in all three systems become apparent from the two-dimensional ordering inherent in their SYSTEMATICA 2D translations and allow more founded discussions about architecture approaches and the exchange of concepts between real systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a visual-servoing method for compensating motion of soft tissue structures using 4D ultra-sound. The motion of soft tissue structures caused by physiological and external motion makes it difficult to investigate them for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The main goal is to track non-rigidly moving soft tissue structures and compensate the motion in order to keep a lesion on its target position during a treatment. We define a 3D non-rigid motion model by extending the Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) algorithm. The motion parameters are estimated with intensity-value changes of a points set in a tracking soft tissue structure. Finally, the global rigid motion is compensated with a 6-DOF robot according to the motion parameters of the tracking structure. Simulation experiments are performed with recorded 3D US images of in-vivo soft tissue structures and validate the effectiveness of the non-rigid motion tracking method. Robotic experiments demonstrated the success of our method with a deformable phantom.",

        "abstract": "Many multi-robot decision problems present autonomous agents with a dual challenge: the accurate egocentric estimation of the state and strategy of their adversaries, in the face of physical limitations and sensory uncertainty. Although these are clearly difficult constraints on the capabilities of an autonomous robot, this is also an opportunity for exploiting the corresponding limitations of the adversary. In this paper, we propose a decision making framework for physically constrained multi-robot games, using a combination of probabilistic and game-theoretic tools. We first present the Reachable Set Particle Filter, an adversary state estimation algorithm combining data-driven approximation with dynamical constraints. Then, we use game-theoretic notions to formulate a strategy estimation framework that progressively learns and exploits the adversary's behaviour. We evaluate our framework in a series of robotic soccer games between robots with varying sensing and strategic capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the combination of probabilistic modeling and strategic reasoning leads to significant improvements in performance robustness, while flexibly adapting to dynamic adversaries.",

In our approach, stochastic models of human search activity are used to estimate state for HRI. The robot updates a Probabilistic Distribution Function of the target object using the observations and the estimated state of human peers. By this means the robot can choose places to search to compensate the behavior of human peers. This paper also presents an implicit interface design for robot assisted tasks, which allows the robot to infer the intention of the user and to provide assistance autonomously. It reduces the cognitive workload of the user and therefore is useful for elder care applications. The effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed approaches are demonstrated in the experimental results.",

When the robotic hand is compliant, for instance with passive springs at the joints, and the number of controlled variables is low, as shown in recent works for underactuated hands, it is possible that the control of internal forces implies the motion of the manipulated object. This paper deals with this issue and studies the structural conditions for the control of internal forces which do not involve any motion of the grasped object. The analysis is constructive and a controller of internal forces is proposed. Note that guaranteeing zero motion of the object while controlling internal forces is paramount in robotic manipulation when the task requires large accuracy.",

Trajectories are segmented into basic segments and represented in segment level rather than point level. We index the trajectories by their segment sequences to recognize them. The computational cost is significantly decreased and the experimental results show that this method is effective and it can be used for real time motion recognition.

In a scaled in vitro experimental study, we record insertion forces for nonguided and magnetically guided insertion experiments and compare the results. Results indicate that magnetic guidance reduced insertion forces by approximately 50%.",

        "abstract": "We present a hybrid path planner that combines two common methods for robotic planning: a Dijkstra graph search for the minimum distance path through the configuration space and an optimization scheme to iteratively improve grid-based paths. Our formulation is novel because we first commit to the minimum distance path, then explicitly relax the path to maximize the clearance up to a user-specified bound. Notably, this formulation yields more predictable paths than potential field methods which try to trade increases in path length for greater clearance around obstacles. These potential field costs infer a trade off that can yield poor paths when the obstacle map is partially observable and has a finite history. Some approximations are used to ensure efficient planning, but only a small set of additional behaviors were required to ensure safe operation. Our method has been field tested extensively, as it is the main on-robot path planner for our large team of 14 medium-scale autonomous ground robots and entry to the 2010 Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge, MAGIC 2010.",

This model is used to design a two-stage control scheme to achieve a desired object motion and maintain desired normal contact forces applied to the object. Several secondary tasks are accomplished through a prioritized task sequencing management of the whole system redundancy. A simulation case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The primitives are pre-computed to meet two objective: to capture the mobility constraints of the robot as well as possible and to establish a state sampling policy that is conductive to efficient search. The first objective allows encoding mobility constraints into primitives, thereby enabling fast unconstrained search to produce feasible solutions. The second objective enables high quality (lattice) sampling of state space, further speeding up exploration during search. We further discuss several novel results enabled by using such motion primitives for kinodynamic planning, including incremental search, efficient bi-directional search and incremental sampling.",

Experiments were conducted on a person in sitting position with flexion/extension of the knee. Performances of the HOSMC are compared to those of a classical Proportional Integrator Derivative (PID) controller in terms of stability, tracking trajectory, convergence in a finite time and robustness against external perturbations.",

The LTL formulas are used to define the events and changes in state that must be communicated between robots and to augment the individual PN model of each robot so that it can handle the incoming communications. These augmented PNs are then used, in conjunction with the LTL formulas, to build PN realizations of local supervisors, based on discrete event system theory, that enforce the LTL specifications by construction. The methodology is illustrated through a simulated application example.",

This work is focused on automatic semantic label propagation in video of indoor environments acquired by a mobile robot. Using a small number of training examples, we propose a new approach to recognize and label dominant background regions of interest, such as floor, wall and doors, and separate them from the remaining of foreground/object image categories. Our approach performs the labeling at the level of image superpixels. A simple non-parametric model is initialized from a few hand labeled examples in the first frame, and then it is propagated and updated along the sequence. We demonstrate the promising results obtained with our proposal in five different indoor sequences from different environments. The obtained semantic labeling can be used both for autonomous navigation and to provide better context for subsequent object detection.",

A combination of the virtual vehicle and trajectory tracking approach is used to derive the formation architecture. A virtual vehicle is steered in such a way it stabilizes to a shifted reference position/heading defined by the leader, the velocity of the virtual vehicle is then provided for further use in designing control law for the follower independent from the measurement of leader's velocity. Position tracking control is then constructed for the follower to track the virtual vehicle using the backstepping and Lyapunov direct design technique. Furthermore and to ensure the safety of robots while moving in a dynamic environment, obstacle avoidance scheme based on sensing the relative distance between follower robots and obstacles is introduced using fuzzy logic. Simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "We present an method for generating high-quality plans for a robot arm with many degrees of freedom based on Learning Dimensional Descent (LDD), a recently-developed algorithm for planning in high-dimensional spaces based on machine learning and optimization techniques. Unlike other approaches used to solve this problem, our method optimizes a well-defined objective and can be shown to generate optimal plans, in theory and practice, for a well-defined class of problems\u2014those that possess low-dimensional cost structure. For the common case where such structure is only approximately present, LDD constitutes a powerful iterative optimization technique that makes non-homotopic path adjustments in each iteration, while still providing a guarantee of convergence to a local minimum of the objective. Experiments with a 7-DOF robot arm show that the method is able to find solutions in cluttered environments that are of a much higher quality than can be obtained with sampling-based planners and smoothing.",

        "abstract": "Playing table tennis is a difficult task for robots, especially due to their limitations of acceleration. A key bottleneck is the amount of time needed to reach the desired hitting position and velocity of the racket for returning the incoming ball. Here, it often does not suffice to simply extrapolate the ball's trajectory after the opponent returns it but more information is needed. Humans are able to predict the ball's trajectory based on the opponent's moves and, thus, have a considerable advantage. Hence, we propose to incorporate an anticipation system into robot table tennis players, which enables the robot to react earlier while the opponent is performing the striking movement. Based on visual observation of the opponent's racket movement, the robot can predict the aim of the opponent and adjust its movement generation accordingly. The policies for deciding how and when to react are obtained by reinforcement learning. We conduct experiments with an existing robot player to show that the learned reaction policy can significantly improve the performance of the overall system.",

        "abstract": "Many motor skills consist of many lower level elementary movements that need to be sequenced in order to achieve a task. In order to learn such a task, both the primitive movements as well as the higher-level strategy need to be acquired at the same time. In contrast, most learning approaches focus either on learning to combine a fixed set of options or to learn just single options. In this paper, we discuss a new approach that allows improving the performance of lower level actions while pursuing a higher level task. The presented approach is applicable to learning a wider range motor skills, but in this paper, we employ it for learning games where the player wants to improve his performance at the individual actions of the game while still performing well at the strategy level game. We propose to learn the lower level actions using Cost-regularized Kernel Regression and the higher level actions using a form of Policy Iteration. The two approaches are coupled by their transition probabilities. We evaluate the approach on a side-stall-style throwing game both in simulation and with a real BioRob.",

The teaching signals are derived from the kinematic model of carangiform swimming with trajectory approximation method. A novel coupling scheme for the CPG network, which are modeled as a chain of coupled Hopf oscillators is proposed to eliminate the influence of afferent signals on amplitude of the oscillator. The learning rules of intrinsic frequency, coupling weight and amplitude are formulated with phase space representation of the oscillators. The frequency, amplitudes and phase relations of the teaching signals can be encoded by the CPG network with the adaptation mechanisms. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed learning rules.",

        "abstract": "Developing robots capable of fine manipulation skills is of major importance in order to build truly assistive robots. These robots need to be compliant in their actuation and control in order to operate safely in human environments. Manipulation tasks imply complex contact interactions with the external world, and involve reasoning about the forces and torques to be applied. Planning under contact conditions is usually impractical due to computational complexity, and a lack of precise dynamics models of the environment. We present an approach to acquiring manipulation skills on compliant robots through reinforcement learning. The initial position control policy for manipulation is initialized through kinesthetic demonstration. We augment this policy with a force/torque profile to be controlled in combination with the position trajectories. We use the Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) algorithm to learn these force/torque profiles by optimizing a cost function that measures task success. We demonstrate our approach on the Barrett WAM robot arm equipped with a 6-DOF force/torque sensor on two different manipulation tasks: opening a door with a lever door handle, and picking up a pen off the table. We show that the learnt force control policies allow successful, robust execution of the tasks.",

Skillful force regulation is required in many cases to achieve the goal of a task and at the same time, not to cause undesired stress on the manipulator or the object under manipulation which could result in physical failure. For example, manipulation of compliant objects with varying physical properties or artistic tasks such as engraving require skillful force modulation. Humans gracefully manipulate objects by using their sense of touch and skillfully regulating exerted forces. To learn the demonstrated force for a task by demonstration, an interaction force control policy, in terms of a goal-directed dynamical system, is proposed which stems from the parallel force/position control. The control policy is parameterized and its parameters are learned by Locally Weighted Regression from human demonstrated data to learn a force trajectory. Scaling of learned force is possible by modifying the goal of the system. The proposed method is evaluated in virtual manipulation tasks using a two degrees-of-freedom haptic device.",

The difficulty lies in the non-uniqueness of the inverse kinematics function. Existing methods tackle non-uniqueness by segmenting the configuration space and building a global solution from local experts. The usage of local experts implies the definition of an oracle, which governs the global consistency of the local models; the definition of this oracle is difficult. We propose an algorithm suitable to learn the inverse kinematics function in a single global model despite its multivalued nature. Inverse kinematics is approximated from examples using structured output learning methods. Unlike most of the existing methods, which estimate inverse kinematics on velocity level, we address the learning of the direct function on position level. This problem is a significantly harder. To support the proposed method, we conducted real world experiments on a tracking control task and tested our algorithms on these models.",

        "abstract": "Applying model-free reinforcement learning to manipulation remains challenging for several reasons. First, manipulation involves physical contact, which causes discontinuous cost functions. Second, in manipulation, the end-point of the movement must be chosen carefully, as it represents a grasp which must be adapted to the pose and shape of the object. Finally, there is uncertainty in the object pose, and even the most carefully planned movement may fail if the object is not at the expected position. To address these challenges we 1) present a simplified, computationally more efficient version of our model-free reinforcement learning algorithm PI2; 2) extend PI2 so that it simultaneously learns shape parameters and goal parameters of motion primitives; 3) use shape and goal learning to acquire motion primitives that are robust to object pose uncertainty. We evaluate these contributions on a manipulation platform consisting of a 7-DOF arm with a 4-DOF hand.",

        "abstract": "Learning to grasp novel objects is an essential skill for robots operating in unstructured environments. We therefore propose a probabilistic approach for learning to grasp. In particular, we learn a function that predicts the success probability of grasps performed on surface points of a given object. Our approach is based on Markov Random Fields (MRF), and motivated by the fact that points that are geometrically close to each other tend to have similar grasp success probabilities. The MRF approach is successfully tested in simulation, and on a real robot using 3-D scans of various types of objects. The empirical results show a significant improvement over methods that do not utilize the smoothness assumption and classify each point separately from the others.",

The percepts we consider consist of the tactile imprints and the object-gripper configuration read before and until the robot's manipulator is fully closed around an object. Our robot is equipped with multiple tactile sensing arrays and it is able to track the pose of an object during the application of a grasp. We present a kernel-logistic-regression model of pose- and touch-conditional grasp success probability which we train on grasp data collected by letting the robot experience the effect on tactile and visual signals of grasps suggested by a teacher, and letting the robot verify which grasps can be used to rigidly control the object. We consider models defined on several subspaces of our input data - e.g., using tactile perceptions or pose information only. Our experiment demonstrates that joint tactile and pose-based perceptions carry valuable grasp-related information, as models trained on both hand poses and tactile parameters perform better than the models trained exclusively on one perceptual input.",

Here, data driven learning methods may present an interesting alternative approach. However, learning models for task-space tracking control from sampled data is an ill-posed problem. In particular, the same input data point can yield many different output values which can form a non-convex solution space. Because the problem is ill-posed, models cannot be learned from such data using common regression methods. While learning of task-space control mappings is globally ill-posed, it has been shown in recent work that it is locally a well-defined problem. In this paper, we use this insight to formulate a local kernel-based learning approach for online model learning for task-space tracking control. For evaluations, we show in simulation the ability of the method for online model learning for task-space tracking control of redundant robots.",

        "abstract": "A current trend in robotics is to define robot tasks using a combination of superimposed motion patterns. For maximum versatility of such motion patterns, they should be easily and efficiently adaptable for situations beyond those for which the motion was originally designed. In this work, we show how a challenging minigolf-like task can be efficiently learned by the robot using a basic hitting motion model and a task-specific adaptation of the hitting parameters: hitting speed and hitting angle. We propose an approach to learn the hitting parameters for a minigolf field using a set of provided examples. This is a nontrivial problem since the successful choice of hitting parameters generally represent a highly non-linear, multi-valued map from the situation-representation to the hitting parameters. We show that by limiting the problem to learning one combination of hitting parameters for each input, a high-performance model of the hitting parameters can be learned using only a small set of training data. We compare two statistical methods, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) in the context of inferring hitting parameters for the minigolf task. We validate our approach on the 7 degrees of freedom Barrett WAM robotic arm in both a simulated and real environment.",

Bearing estimates for each speaker are then made using a multi-track particle filter with a belief update function comprised of a Cross-correlation bearing estimate and an estimate of the speaker's fundamental frequency.

More precisely, we formulate a robust bearing estimator that leverages anisotropic but symmetric radiation profiles to identify \u00bf-periodic bearing estimates between pairs of communicating agents. Utilizing these ambiguous bearing estimates along with compass and odometric measurements, we present a Multi-hypothesis Extended Kalman Filter-based framework that exploits agent motion to resolve the resulting state ambiguity and achieve localization up to translation. Despite the combinatoric nature of our problem, for teams exhibiting certain topological properties, we show that only two initial hypotheses need consideration to recover state. Experimental results from a small team of differential drive robots are presented to demonstrate the utility of our approach. Simulation results are also presented that explore our framework's convergence properties for larger team sizes.",

In the following sections, we first present the proposed robot and its two working modes. Then, the locking strategy of the robot is formulated as an optimization problem. Also, a practical method for managing the limbs swinging movement is addressed. At last, the presented approach is applied on two concrete examples.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In everyday object manipulation tasks, like making a pancake, autonomous robots are required to decide on the appropriate action parametrizations in order to achieve desired (and to avoid undesired) outcomes. For determining the right parameters for actions like pouring a pancake mix onto a pancake maker, robots need capabilities to predict the physical consequences of their own manipulation actions. In this work, we integrate a simulation-based approach for making temporal projections for robot manipulation actions into the logic programming language PROLOG. The realized system enables robots to determine action parameters that bring about certain effects by utilizing simulation-based temporal projections within PROLOG's chronological backtracking mechanism. For a set of formal parameters and their respective ranges of values, the developed system translates the manipulation problems into physical simulations, monitors and logs the relevant data structures of the simulations, translates the logged data back into first-order time-interval-based representations, called timelines, and eventually evaluates the individual timelines with respect to specified performance criteria. Integrating the proposed approach into robot control programs allow robots to mentally simulate the consequences of different action parametrizations before committing to them and thereby to reduce the number of undesired outcomes.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important problems in robot localisation is the detection of previously visited places (loops). When a robot closes a loop, the association between observed features and present ones can be used to update its position. The computational cost involved in the association process makes exhaustive loop search intractable. Most of the current techniques use observations of the environment as their main features to produce loop hypotheses. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of producing loop candidates from features of the robot trajectory. We propose a new method for selecting loop-closure candidates based on an alignment likelihood function, which measures similarity between trajectory sequences. The algorithm is validated with data gathered in the city with our experimental platform. Positive results show that the trajectory has, indeed, features that can be extracted and applied to robot localisation. The resulting loop hypotheses may be regarded, for example, as a initialisation step to aid current methods.",

        "abstract": "Multirobot path planning is difficult because the full configuration space of the system grows exponentially with the number of robots. Planning in the joint configuration space of a set of robots is only necessary if they are strongly coupled, which is often not true if the robots are well separated in the workspace. Therefore, we initially plan for each robot separately, and only couple sets of robots after they have been found to interact, thus minimizing the dimensionality of the search space. We present a general strategy called subdimensional expansion, which dynamically generates low dimensional search spaces embedded in the full configuration space. We also present an implementation of subdimensional expansion for robot configuration spaces that can be represented as a graph, called M*, and show that M* is complete and finds minimal cost paths.",

In this paper we describe two different exploration strategies and their implementation using the MARE platform. First, we discuss the application of an efficient coverage algorithm, for the purpose of achieving systematic exploration of a known and bounded environment. Second, we present an exploration strategy driven by surprise, which steers the robot on a path that might lead to potentially surprising observations.",

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of localizing an aircraft using the magnetic field generated by a current carrying wire through state estimation and hardware development. By using an Extended Kalman Filter to track the real and imaginary components of the magnetic field signal, we overcome the problems posed by the field's phase-amplitude ambiguity and demonstrate the ability to track an aircraft flying at speeds up to 8 m/s at a distance of 4 meters from the wire. We conclude that the achieved performance is adequate for controlling a bird-scale UAV in a dynamic perching maneuver and that our system would generalize to real world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The development of service robots has gained more and more attention over the last years. Advanced robots have to cope with many different situations and contingencies while executing concurrent and interruptable complex tasks. In particular, mobile manipulation tasks increase the complexity. To manage the raising number of tasks and execution variants in complex environments there is a tremendous need for context and situation dependent composition and selection of reusable skills. This requires explicit descriptions of relevant properties and parameters of the robot, its resources and its capabilities. Different views on partial aspects of a robot system (mechanical, electrical and even software) can be provided by different models as is already common practice at design-time. However, these design-time models also need to be accessible at run-time to support run-time reasoning of the robot in order to adequately compose its skills and assign resources. That requires to extract useful information out of the design-time models and to transform it into representations which can be exploited at run-time. We present an approach to exploit information provided via design-time models (e.g. software components, simulation, planning) for run-time decision making. It allows for more informed decisions on how to compose action plots at run-time in order to manage the huge amount of different execution variants in service robotics.",

        "abstract": "Task completion time and cost are two significant criteria for the selection of manipulator system. For a given task, several Pareto solutions of manipulator systems should be derived based on the evaluation of these two criteria. However, this process requires a large calculation time. In this paper, we propose a method that can select appropriate systems by evaluating task completion time and cost within the desired calculation time. In the proposed method, multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is employed to search for appropriate manipulator systems from a set of candidate systems. Location optimization and motion coordination are integrated to derive the task completion time and the relative cost is used to evaluate the cost of a manipulator system. We employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) for location optimization and use nearest-neighborhood algorithm (NNA) for motion coordination, since PSO and NNA have a high speed of convergence to a good solution. The proposed method is applied to a set of tasks and is proved to be effective and practical.",

The mobile robot, which is a differential-driven wheel type, is equipped with one laser range finder to perform high-speed human tracking and obstacle avoidance. Initially, the waist part of the human body is found the best part of the human body for robust tracking by a laser range finder. Next an obstacle avoidance algorithm considering the relative velocity between the robot and obstacles is proposed. It is shown that the proposed human tracking algorithms based on the Kalman filter performs well even in the case of the target occlusions and temporary losses. These tracking algorithms have been applied to a marathoner following robot that carries the marathoner's personal belongings in many different outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "Tasks such as street mapping and security surveillance seek a route that traverses a given space to perform a function. These task functions may involve mapping the space for accurate modeling, sensing the space for unusual activity, or searching the space for an object. In many cases, the use of multiple robots can greatly improve the performance of these tasks. We assume a prior map is available, but it may be inaccurate due to factors such as occlusion, age, dynamic objects, and resolution limitations. In this work, we address the NP-hard problem of environmental coverage with incomplete prior map information using multiple robots. To utilize related algorithms in graph theory, we represent the environment as a graph and model the coverage problem as a k-Rural Postman Problem where k represents the number of robots. Using this representation, the problem can be solved using a branch-and-bound approach to find an optimal route, and a route division heuristic to separate the route into k pieces. Since the branch-and-bound technique is exponential time, we present an approach to decompose the search problem into subtasks that are distributed among the robots. Using ideas from market-based approaches, we allow the robots to auction particular sections of the problem space to other robots as a way to more evenly divide the work and focus the search. Finally, we evaluate these methods on test graphs in simulation.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the growth of the computational power available in the Central Processing Units (CPUs) of consumer computers has tapered significantly. At the same time, growth in the computational power available in the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has remained strong. Algorithms that can be implemented on GPUs today are not only limited to graphics processing, but include scientific computation and beyond. This paper is concerned with massively parallel implementations of incremental sampling-based robot motion planning algorithms, namely the widely-used Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and its asymptotically-optimal counterpart called RRT*. We demonstrate an example implementation of RRT and RRT* motion-planning algorithm for a high-dimensional robotic manipulator that takes advantage of an NVidia CUDA-enabled GPU. We focus on parallelizing the collision-checking procedure, which is generally recognized as the computationally expensive component of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Our experimental results indicate significant speedup when compared to CPU implementations, leading to practical algorithms for optimal motion planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces.",

Our goal is to produce a cost function for which a given policy, observed in experiment, is optimal. We proceed by enforcing a constraint on the relationship between input noise and input cost that produces a maximum entropy distribution over the space of all sample paths. We apply maximum likelihood estimation to approximate the parameters of this distribution (hence, of the cost function) given a finite set of sample paths. We iteratively improve our approximation by adding to this set the sample path that would be optimal given our current estimate of the cost function. Preliminary results in simulation provide empirical evidence that our algorithm converges.",

Doing so allows us to evaluate maneuverability performance in terms of the human teleoperator's interaction with the controlled system. This allowed us to effectively determine the suitability of different haptic cue algorithms in improving teleoperation maneuverability. Performance metrics based on the human teleoperator's frequency response function indicate that maneuverability performance is best supported by a haptic feedback algorithm which is based on an obstacle avoidance force.",

It is capable of attaching on a wide variety of trees with a wide range of gripping curvature. In addition, it is lightweight and simple in control. The gripper is simple in control as it is actuated by one actuator only. In addition, the omni-directional gripping ability also simplifies the use of the gripper as there is no extra actuator needed for orientation control. The special mechanism and optimized settings make the gripper able to attach on different sizes of tree tightly. The mechanism also allows zero energy consumption in static gripping. Numerous on-tree experiments of the proposed mechanism have been conducted and the results are satisfied.",

        "abstract": "When a needle is inserted into soft tissue, interaction forces are developed at the needle tip and along the needle shaft. The needle tip force is due to cutting of the tissue, and the force along the needle shaft is due to friction between needle and tissue. In this study, the friction force is determined for needles inserted into a gelatine phantom at insertion velocities of 10 mm/s and 20 mm/s. The friction force is found to be dependent on the insertion velocity. The needle tip force is calculated using the friction and insertion force, and is used as input for a mechanics-based model which predicts the amount of needle deflection. In the model, the needle is considered to be a cantilever beam supported by springs which have needle-tissue interaction stiffness (Ke). The value of the interaction stiffness is evaluated by comparing results from experiments and simulation. A mechanical needle insertion device is used to insert needles. Needle deflection during insertion is determined using a needle tip tracking algorithm. Results of this study provide insight into the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction, and can be used in studies for robotically steering needles into soft tissue.",

Over time, the amount of time required to process new observations increases with the size of the internal map, which may influence real-time processing. In this paper, we present a novel real-time loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term SLAM.

        "abstract": "We propose a method to increase propulsion of a micro-scale swimming robot powered by an artificial flagellum through the use of multiple helices while retaining the simple actuation method of a single rotation axis. Scaled up experiments with similar Reynolds number are carried out to compare the performance of five different propulsion designs with pairs of stiff or flexible flagella. The designs feature stiff helices, straight flexible rods, and flexible helices inspired by bacterial flagella. Results indicate that for a given rotation frequency, thrust is proportional to the number of helices, but that the torque required to drive a flagellum offset from the common rotation axis is increased. Furthermore, shape deformation of flexible helices due to bending forces can positively affect thrust under certain conditions. Therefore, given the ease of fabrication, the use of multiple offset flexible flagella is a potential method to achieve increased thrust force in artificial bacteria flagella.",

Using the proposed system, the technician can practice and improve his control by developing a gesture similar to that performed in reality. The human-machine user's interface also provides an efficient haptic-based guidance tool to minimize the risk of damaging membranes during the injection. The key challenge of deformable simulation is to satisfy the conflicting requirements of real-time interactivity and physical realism. The compromise between the realism of bio-mechanical models used, the accuracy and stability of computational algorithms for real-time haptic rendering are fullfilled with the use of a mechanical modeling based on a hyperelastic model (St-Venant-Kirchhoff) and the writing of a specific dynamic finite element code. Simulated responses are compared to experimental data to show the effectiveness of the proposed physically-based model.",

The robot fish is made of a ferromagnetic head and a flexible tail. It is actuated by transverse oscillating magnetic gradients. The swimming performances of the robot fish are studied for varying tail length as well as varying actuation frequency and amplitude. Through a dimensional analysis, the important parameters influencing the swimming gait are identified and the mechanism of actuation is better understood. Considering the scaling of forces, this dimensional analysis leads us to believe that in the future the height and width of the fish robot could be miniaturised to sub-millimetre scale.",

Each sensor is a beam that, when broken, provides the direction of the crossing (one bit) and nothing else. Using a simple network of beams, the individual paths are separated and reconstructed as well as possible, up to combinatorial information about the route taken. In this setup, simple filtering algorithms are introduced, and a low-cost hardware implementation that demonstrates the practicality of the approach is shown. The results may apply in settings such as verification of multirobot system execution, surveillance and security, and unobtrusive behavioral monitoring for wildlife and the elderly.",

The paper takes as a starting point recent results by the authors that describe necessary conditions on the trajectories, based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. These necessary conditions reduce the problem of finding an optimal trajectory between start and goal to a few one-dimensional search problems. This search is not formally guaranteed to find a near-optimal trajectory if the sampling of the search space is not fine enough, but comparison to existing analytical results for specific systems, and a complete numerical search over trajectories with only a few control switches, demonstrates effectiveness of the method.",

We explicitly model occlusions that cause failures in visual detectors by learning a generative appearance-occlusion model from a training set containing annotated 3D objects, images and point clouds. A Bayesian 3D object likelihood incorporates visual information from many views as well as geometric priors for object size and position. An iterative, sampling-based inference technique determines object locations based on the model. We also contribute a novel robot-collected data set with images and point clouds from multiple views of 60 scenes, with over 600 manually annotated 3D objects accounting for over ten thousand bounding boxes. This data has been released to the community. Our results show that our system is able to robustly recognize objects in realistic scenes, significantly improving recognition performance in clutter.",

The network lifetime problem was formulated as a nonlinear non-convex optimization problem and is solved distributedly by a series of convex approximations and a proposed novel algorithm. Computer simulations illustrated quick convergence to the solution, and the lifetime of the network was improved tremendously. By comparison, the proposed joint design method has an edge over other methods, which further justifies the use of mobility for energy efficiency in robotic sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "We present an algorithm for automatically unfolding a piece of clothing. A piece of laundry is pulled in different directions at various points of the cloth in order to flatten the laundry. The features of the cloth are extracted and calculated to determine a valid location and orientation in which to interact with it. The features include the peak region, corner locations, and continuity / discontinuity of the cloth. In this paper we present a two-stage algorithm, introducing a novel solution to the unfolding / flattening problem using interactive perception. Simulations using 3D simulation software, and experiments with robot hardware demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to flatten pieces of laundry using different starting configurations. These results show that, at most, the algorithm flattens out a piece of cloth from 11.1% to 95.6% of the canonical configuration.",

The velocity control methods presented are to be used with Computed-Torque Control (CTC). This controller utilizes a passive reference model walking down a gentle slope which provides the reference trajectory to follow. The controllers were tested on a rigid body simulator. The results show that the methods based on scaling the amplitude (step length) of the reference trajectory and changing the reference slope angle, provide an energy efficient and stable way to control the walking speed. Both of these methods also provide continuous trajectories to standing pose and running gait.",

The machining spindle was attached to the compensation mechanism and the robot held the workpiece. Due to the inherent resonant character of mechanical constructions of this type, and the nonlinear phenomena appearing in piezo actuators, control of the compensation mechanism is a challenging problem. This paper presents models of the construction, experimentally identified using subspace-based identification methods. A subsequent control scheme, based on the identified models, utilizing state feedback for controlling the position of the spindle is outlined. Results from experiments performed on a prototype of the compensation mechanism are also provided.",

Both the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control method is effective and feasible to improve the tracking performance of biorobotic fins by considering the hysteresis effect. Furthermore, the control methods should facilitate biomimetic investigation on propulsive modes and waveforms of fish swimming.",

This paper presents a model-based approach for active decoupling of the dynamics of a micro coaxial helicopter. This allows for easier and more accurate operation of the system. The nonlinear model covers all degrees of freedom for attitude and altitude. It accounts for hover and cruise flight situations and explicitly captures the off-axis dynamics and the dynamics of the stabilizer bar. A six-axis force/torque sensor and an RPM measurement system are used in a custom built test bench. It is applied for analysis of the forces and torques generated by the rotors in combination with the dynamics of the drive train and the swashplate. The parameter identification and the model validation is obtained with flight data recorded with a vision-based motion tracking system. The decoupling controller is implemented on the commercial robotic helicopter CoaX and its performance is shown via a motion experiment.",

The movement properties of MSP are theoretically analyzed and the corresponding dynamic mechanics model is established. Further the magnetic field distributions inside the combined coils are calculated and optimal control parameters of coils configuration are obtained. Preliminary motion control experiment is also conducted to prove the feasibility of proposed method. The result demonstrates that MSP cluster can be manipulated with average speed of 0.25 mm/s for a cluster of 12 MSPs and 0.116 mm/s for a cluster of 37 MSPs with the proposed coil system and used for improving interconnection of MSP dot patterns.",

        "abstract": "Among Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV), sailboat robots could be an efficient solution for long term missions and semi-persistent presence in the oceans since they rely on renewable energy like solar and wind energies. However, steering of such vehicles presents an inherent difficulty since the thrust force heavily rely on the wind (speed and direction) and sail angle as well as on the underlying complex dynamic properties of the ship, mainly due to the aero and hydrodynamic forces. This paper proposes a new reactive path planning method which takes into account the so called no-go zones and turns them into virtual obstacles. A potential field algorithm is then applied to drive the sailboat towards the goal while avoiding obstacles even when the goal is located directly downwind or upwind. Simulations, using a boat specific dynamic simulator, show that the proposed method can successfully drive an autonomous boat between a set of predefined waypoints under time varying wind conditions. This method is computationally efficient and is suitable for on-board real-time implementation.",

In this paper, we focus on role assignment in a heterogeneous team, where an agent's capability depends on its teammate and their mutual state, i.e., the agent's state and its teammate's state. The capabilities of an agent are represented by a mean and variance, to capture the uncertainty in the agent's actions and in the world. We present a formal framework for representing this problem, and illustrate our framework using a robot soccer example. We formally describe how to compute the value of a role assignment policy, as well as the computation of the optimal role assignment policy, using a notion of risk. Further, we show that finding the optimal role assignment can be difficult, and describe approximation algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. We provide an analysis of these algorithms in our model and empirically show that they perform well in general problems of this domain, compared to market-based techniques. Lastly, we describe an extension to our proposed model that captures mutual interactions between more than two agents.",

Two dynamic models for an SPI are presented and solved. An analytically tractable model presented in a previous work which assumes a submersible at constant velocity has been included as a reference point. A more complex model in a general planar reference frame is also presented and is solved numerically. These simulations show a benefit to using a fluttering tail relative to a dimensionally identical rigid tail. Results which show that the SPI can be turned by an appropriate choice of time-variable fluid velocity are also presented. Construction details of an experimental realization are provided. Preliminary measurements taken using that platform are also provided; these measurements qualitatively confirm the simulation's conclusion that a fluttering flexible tail is capable of higher speed than a dimensionally identical rigid tail.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a momentum-based reactive stepping controller for humanoid robot push recovery. By properly regulating combinations of linear and angular momenta, the controller can selectively encourage the robot to recover its balance with or without taking a step. A reference stepping location is computed by modeling the humanoid as a passive rimless wheel with two spokes such that stepping on the location leads to a complete stop of the wheel at the vertically upright position. In contrast to most reference points for stepping based on pendulum models such as the capture point, our reference point exists on both level and non-level grounds. Moreover, in contrast with continuously evolving step locations, our step location is stationary. The computation of the location of the reference point also generates the duration of step which can be used for designing a stepping trajectory. Momentum-based stepping for push recovery is implemented in simulations of a full size humanoid on 3D non-level ground.",

        "abstract": "GPS has become the de facto standard for obtaining a global position estimate during outdoor autonomous navigation. However, GPS can become degraded due to occlusion or interference, to the detriment of autonomous performance. In addition, GPS positions must be aligned with prior data, a tedious and continual process. This work presents a solution to these two problems based on learning generic observation models in the presence of GPS to use in its absence. The models are non-parametric and compared to traditional approaches require few assumptions about either the prior data available or a robot's onboard sensors. Along with allowing for localization to prior data under GPS-denied conditions, this learning approach can be coupled with an EM procedure to automatically register GPS and prior data positions. Experimental results are presented based on data from more than 15 km of autonomous navigation through challenging outdoor terrain.",

At each time step, a distance measurement and an observed texture from an omnidirectional camera are compared to the expected distance measurement and the expected texture according to each hypothesis of the robot's pose in an MCL framework. Compared to previous implementations of MCL, our proposed approach converges faster than distance-only MCL and localizes the robot more precisely than SIFT-based MCL.

        "abstract": "Whole-body gestures and verbal expressions should be bound according to given tasks and the current situation in intelligent human-robot interaction systems. Moreover, modification of expressions, such as emphasis of motions and change in verbal expressions, plays an important roll for successfully completing tasks according to user reaction. Slight differences in motions can be conveyed by binding an emphasized motions and an verbal expression. In robotics, however, even though the synthesis of gestures and speech has been discussed, how to bind synthesized emphatic motions and verbal expressions from an engineering point of view has not been adequately discussed. Synthesis of motion and speech requires recognition of user reaction, we therefor should integrate 1) recognizing reaction, 2) planning to complete tasks, 3) modification of motions and speech, and 4) maintaining a bi-directional interaction loop consisting of processes 1)\u20133). Thus, using a phase space, we propose a method for binding emphatic motions and adverbial expressions, and for evaluating and controlling these four required processes by using a sole scalar parameter. In the phase space, variety of motion patterns and verbal expressions can be expressed as static points. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method, we also propose a bi-directional motion coaching system using the method. We show the feasibility and effectiveness of robotic motion coaching systems through experiments of actual sport coaching tasks for beginners. From the results of participants' improvements in motion learning, we discuss and conclude the factors affecting such motion coaching systems that realizes binding and controlling emphatic motions and adverbial expressions using a sole scalar parameter in a phase space.",

The semi-mobile haptic interface consists of a haptic manipulator mounted on a large grounded Cartesian robot, the prepositioning unit. The prepositioning unit is controlled in such a way that the haptic manipulator is kept off its workspace limits. At the same time, the control algorithm allows the optimal utilization of the available space in the user environment and guarantees the safety of the user. The proposed control method is based on the position and velocity of the end-effector and also takes the position of the user into account. Moreover, it is robust against noisy measurements of the user position or outliers due, for example, to occlusions in the tracking system. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed control to provide haptic interaction in extended range telepresence.",

Because the motion capture system is expensive, and time-consuming process is needed to acquire motion data, technology that enables to reuse existing motion data efficiently is required. This paper proposes motion retrieval method with natural language word based on stochastic correlation between motion and language. We construct a space which has maximum correlation with motion pattern features and word features, and we use this space as search space for motion retrieval. Proto-symbol space, which represents the relationship of each symbolized motion patterns, is used as motion feature space. And as word feature, binary features are used which represent whether a word label is attached or not. Because the constructed search space has correlation between motion patterns and words, associative motion retrieval considering similarity of motion pattern or closeness of word meaning becomes possible. We validate proposed motion retrieval method by constructing motion database with captured human motion data.",

Trajectory hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used as the probabilistic models so that smooth trajectories can be generated from the HMMs. The method was evaluated in physical experiments in terms of motion generation. In the experiments, a robot learned motions from observation, and it generated motions under different object placement. Experimental results showed that appropriate motions were generated even when the object placement was changed.",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots have the potential to enable new minimally invasive surgical procedures by curving around anatomical obstacles to reach difficult-to-reach sites in body cavities. Planning motions for these devices is challenging in part due to their complex kinematics; concentric tube robots are composed of thin, pre-curved, telescoping tubes that can achieve a variety of shapes via extension and rotation of each of their constituent tubes. We introduce a new motion planner to maneuver these devices to clinical targets while minimizing the probability of colliding with anatomical obstacles. Unlike prior planners for these devices, we more accurately model device shape using mechanics-based models that consider torsional interaction between the tubes. We also account for the effects of uncertainty in actuation and predicted device shape. We integrate these models with a sampling-based approach based on the Rapidly-Exploring Roadmap to guarantee finding optimal plans as computation time is allowed to increase. We demonstrate our motion planner in simulation using a variety of evaluation scenarios including an anatomy-based neurosurgery case that requires maneuvering to a di#cult-to-reach brain tumor at the skull base.",

In this work, we show how the movement segmentation problem can be reduced to a sequential movement recognition problem. To this end, we reformulate the original Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) formulation as a linear dynamical system with control inputs. Based on this new formulation, we develop an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the duration and goal position of a partially observed trajectory. With the help of this algorithm and the assumption that a library of movement primitives is present, we present a movement segmentation framework. We illustrate the usefulness of the new DMP formulation on the two applications of online movement recognition and movement segmentation.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous decentralized control is a key concept for understanding the mechanism underlying the adaptive and versatile behavior of animals. Although the design methodology of decentralized control based on a dynamical system approach that can impart adaptability by using coupled oscillators has been proposed in previous studies, it cannot reproduce the versatility of animal behaviors comprehensively. Therefore, our objective is to understand behavioral versatility from the perspective of well-coordinated rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements. To this end, we focus on ophiuroids as simple \u201cbest\u201d model living organisms that exhibit spontaneous role assignment of rhythmic and non-rhythmic arm movements, and we model such arm movements by using an active rotator model that can describe both oscillatory and excitatory properties. Simulation results show that the spontaneous role assignment of arm movements is successfully realized by using the proposed model, and the simulated locomotion is qualitatively equivalent to the locomotion of real ophiuroids. This fact can potentially facilitate a better understanding of the control mechanism responsible for behavioral versatility in animals.",

Although, in most cases, the LPA* algorithm requires a relatively small number of updates, in some other cases the amount of work required by the LPA* to find the optimal path can be overwhelming. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an extension of the baseline LPA* algorithm, by making efficient use of a multiscale representation of the environment.",

        "abstract": "Small informal meetings of two to four participants are very common in work environments. For this reason, a convenient way for recording and archiving these meetings is of great interest. In order to efficiently archive such meetings, an important task to address is to keep trace of \u201cwho talked when\u201d during a meeting. This paper proposes a new multi-modal approach to tackle this speaker activity detection problem. One of the novelty of the proposed approach is that it uses a human tracker that relies on scanning laser range finders (LRFs) to localize the participants. This choice is especially relevant for robotic applications as robots are often equipped with LRFs for navigation purpose. In the proposed system, a table top microphone array in the center of the meeting room acquires the audio data while the LRF based human tracker monitors the movement of the participants. Then the speaker activity detection is performed using Gaussian mixture models that were trained before hand. An experiment reproducing a meeting configuration demonstrates the performance of the system for speaker activity detection. In particular, the proposed hands free system maintains an good level of performance compared to the use of close talking microphone while participants are simultaneously speaking.",

CPGs are modeled as autonomous differential equations, that generate the necessary limb movement to perform the required walking gait. In order to optimize the walking gait, four conflicting objectives are considered, simultaneously: minimize the body vibration, maximize the velocity, maximize the wide stability margin and maximize the behavioral diversity. The results of NSGA-II for this multi-objective problem are discussed. The effect of the inclusion of a behavioral diversity objective in the system is also studied in terms of the walking gait achieved. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this multi-objective approach. The several walking gait solutions obtained correspond to different trade-off between the objectives.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel coordination methodology for autonomous mobile robots in congested systems with bottlenecks. This methodology consists of two approaches. 1) A previous robot behavior control technique that utilizes external interaction force among robots is improved. This enables robots to reduce velocity not only for the jam preceding them, but also for the decelerating robot immediately in front. 2) An environmental rule in connection with the interaction force is designed and provided on congested lanes where robots move slowly. Thus, amplified interaction force affects the robots, and they move more slowly in the congested lanes. The improved interaction force and environmental rule are implemented in simulation experiments and compared to the previous robot behavior control technique and an adaptive cruise control (ACC) that has been proposed for autonomous vehicles. The interaction force and environmental rule can be implemented in the ACC; then, the resulting ACC improvement is discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the usage of the improved interaction force and environmental rule for multi-robot coordination in congested systems with bottlenecks is shown.",

The method is based on a null-space velocity control algorithm, which is essential for achieving good behavior of redundant robotic systems. Using the pseudo-inverse, the task and the null-space motions are decoupled. For the skiing robot, the primary task is stability, the secondary task is the direction and the third task is the pose of the robot. The dynamic stability index of the skiing robot is defined with the normalized zero moment point. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method both in simulation in the virtual reality environment as well as on the real robot.",

        "abstract": "In many camera-based robotics applications, stabilizing video images in real-time is often critical for successful performance. In particular vision-based navigation, localization and tracking tasks cannot be performed reliably when landmarks are blurry, poorly focused or disappear from the camera view due to strong vibrations. Thus a reliable video image stabilization system would be invaluable for these applications. This paper presents a real-time video image stabilization system (VISS) primarily developed for aerial robots. Its unique architecture combines four independent stabilization layers. Layer 1 detects vibrations via an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and performs external counter-movements with a motorized gimbal. Layer 2 damps vibrations by using mechanical devices. The internal optical image stabilization of the camera represents Layer 3, while Layer 4 filters remaining vibrations using software. VISS is low-cost and robust. It has been implemented on a \u201cPhotoship One\u201d gimbal, using GUMBOT hardware for processing Sparkfun-IMU data (Layer 1). Lord Mount vibration isolators damp vibrations (Layer 2). Video images of Panasonic's Lumix DMCTZ5 camera are optically stabilized with Panasonic's \u201cMega O.I.S.\u201d technique (Layer 3) and digitally stabilized with \u201cDeshaker\u201d software (Layer 4). VISS significantly improved the stability of shaky video images in a series of experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian framework for categorizing multimodal sensory signals such as audio, visual, and haptic information by robots. The robot uses its physical embodiment to grasp and observe an object from various viewpoints as well as listen to the sound during the observation. The multimodal information enables the robot to form human-like object categories that are bases of intelligence. The proposed method is an extension of Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), which is a kind of nonparametric Bayesian models, to multimodal HDP (MHDP). MHDP can estimate the number of categories, while the parametric model, e.g. LDA-based categorization, requires to specify the number in advance. As this is an unsupervised learning method, a human user does not need to give any correct labels to the robot and it can classify objects autonomously. At the same time the proposed method provides a probabilistic framework for inferring object properties from limited observations. Validity of the proposed method is shown through some experimental results.",

In this paper, we present our implementation of audio-visual saliency-based attention that we integrated in a system for knowledge-driven audio-visual scene analysis and object-based world modeling. For this purpose, we introduce a novel isophote-based method for proto-object segmentation of saliency maps, a surprise-based auditory saliency definition, and a parametric 3-D model for multimodal saliency fusion.

In the multi-target interception problem, a team of mobile sensors is tasked with intercepting a set of potential targets to reduce appropriately assigned damage cost. Our principal contribution is to express a stochastic version of the problem with a generalized cost as a mixed-integer linear program so that optimal sensor motion can be computed efficiently. Indeed, our optimization program for the stochastic problem has similar computational costs as the optimization program for the corresponding deterministic problem. Our solution presumes that the system can be approximated by linear dynamics and Gaussian noise, with Gaussian localization uncertainty.",

Rather than developing singular solutions to each mission, we seek a generalized formulation that enables us to express a wider range of missions. Here we propose a framework that allows for multiple objectives to be considered simultaneously and discuss corresponding planning algorithms that are capable of running in realtime on autonomous air vehicles. The algorithms create a set of initial hypotheses that are then optimized by a sub-gradient based trajectory algorithm that optimizes the multiple objectives, producing dynamically feasible trajectories. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach with changing cost functions based on newly discovered information. We report on results in simulation of a system that is tasked with navigating safely between obstacles while searching for an acceptable landing site.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sliding probe methods are designed for the in situ electrical property characterization of individual one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures by eliminating the contact resistance between the fixed-end support and the specimen. The key to achieve a high resolution is to keep a constant resistance between the other end of the specimen contacting to the sliding probe. To achieve this objective, we have developed several important techniques including multipoint continuous sliding, flexible probes, and specimen-shape adapting based on nanorobotic manipulation inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). With a copper-nanowire-tipped probe, we have shown that a flexible probe facilitates the contact force control. The adapting of the shape of a probe tip is significant for keeping a constant contact area between the probe and the specimen. This can be implemented by using a soft probe or a tip with a shape resembling the profile of the specimen. Here we show that by flowing copper from a nanotube probe against the specimen, it is possible to make a well adapted shape of the tip to the specimen after the copper cooled down. By avoiding stick-slip motion and controlling the contact force and area, it will be possible to keep a constant contact resistance between the sliding probe and the specimen, hence significantly improve the measurement resolution. Sliding probe methods are an in situ technique characterized by higher resolution and simplicity in setup as compared with conventional two- and four-terminal methods, respectively. Furthermore, it is superior for local property characterization, which is of particular interest for hetero-structured nanomaterials and defect detection.",

For this, the robot should make use of all available information and be robust against the failure of single sensors. In this paper a multisensor data fusion algorithm for the six-legged walking robot DLR Crawler is presented. The algorithm is based on an indirect feedback information filter that fuses measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with relative 3D leg odometry measurements and relative 3D visual odometry measurements from a stereo camera. Errors of the visual odometry are computed and considered in the filtering process in order to achieve accurate pose estimates which are robust against visual odometry failure. The algorithm was successfully tested and results are presented.",

Especially in the rehabilitation and sports science where each subject can easily have quite different anthropometry and muscle condition due to disease, age or training history, it would be important to identify those parameters to take benefits correctly from the recent advances in computational musculoskeletal modeling. In this paper, Mass Distribution Identification to improve the joint torque estimation and Muscle Strength Identification to improve the muscle force estimation were performed combined with previously proposed methods in muscle tension optimization. This first result highlights that the reliable muscle force estimation could be extracted after these identifications.

The solution of this problem is relevant for the design and implementation of any decentralized multi-robot algorithm/control. A novel algorithm for probabilistic multiple registration of these measurements is presented, where no global localization, distances, or identity are used. With respect to more conventional solutions that could be conceived on the basis of the current literature, our method is theoretically suitable for tasks requiring frequent, many-to-many encounters among agents (e.g., formation control, cooperative exploration, multiple-view environment sensing). An extensive experimental study validates our method and compares it with the full-informative case of bearing-plus-distance measurements. The results show that the proposed localization system exhibits an accuracy commensurate to our previous method [1] which uses bearing-plus-distance information.",

When an external unknown force is applied to the levitating seismic mass, this one acts as a transducer that converts this unknown input into a displacement that is the measured output signal. Because the little damped and long transient response of this kind of macroscopic transducer can not be neglected, it is then necessary to deconvolve the output to correctly estimate the unknown input force. The deconvolution approach proposed in this article is based on a Kalman filter that use an uncertain a priori model to represent the unknown nanoforce to be estimated. The main advantage of this approach is that the end-user can directly control the unavoidable trade-off that exists between the wished resolution on the estimatedforce and the response time of the estimation.",

        "abstract": "Virtual characters often need to plan visually convincing paths through a complicated environment. For example, a traveler may need to walk from an airport entrance to a staircase, descend the staircase, walk to a shuttle, ride the shuttle to a destination, ride an elevator back to the ground floor, and finally move on the ground floor again to reach the desired airplane. Most previous research only supports path planning in a single plane because the underlying data structures are two-dimensional. The goal of this paper is to permit visually convincing paths to be efficiently computed in a multi-layered environment such as an airport or a multi-storey building. We describe an algorithm to create a navigation mesh, and our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. A multi-layered environment is represented by a set of two dimensional layers and a set of connections. Each layer is a collection of two-dimensional polygons that all lie in a single plane, and each connection provides a means of moving between layers. We first compute the traditional medial axis of each two dimensional layer in the environment. The connections are then used to iteratively merge this collection of medial axes into a single data structure. By adding a linear number of line segments to this structure, we obtain a navigation mesh that mathematically describes the walkable areas in a multi layered environment. This mesh can easily be input into existing planners to generate visually convincing paths for thousands of virtual characters in real-time.",

The electrical domain is appealing because it enjoys proficient analysis and design tools and allows a one step higher abstraction element, the network. Thus, in order to analyze the system by means of network elements the mechanical system must be first modeled as an electric circuit. Only then power ports become apparent and networks can be defined. This kind of analysis has been previously performed in systems with well defined causalities, specially in the communication channel. Indeed, a communication channel exchanging flow-like and effort-like signals, as for instance velocity and computed force, has a well defined causality and can thus be directly mapped as a two-port electrical network. However, this is only one of the many possible system architectures. This paper investigates how other architectures, including those with ambiguous causalities, can be modeled by means of networks, even in the lack of flow or effort being transmitted, and how they can be made passive for any communication channel characteristic (delay, package-loss and jitter). The methods are exposed in the form of design guidelines sustained with an example and validated with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a decentralized platform for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with multiple robots is developed. A novel occupancy grid map fusion algorithm is proposed. Map fusion is achieved through a multi-step process that includes image pre-processing, map learning, relative transformation extraction and then verification of the results. The proposed map learning method is a process based on the Self Organizing Map (SOM). In the learning phase, the obstacles of the map are learned by clustering the occupied cells of the map. The clusters represent the spatial form of the map and make further analyses of the map easier and faster. Also, clusters can be interpreted as features extracted from the occupancy grid map so the map fusion problem becomes a task of matching features. Results of the experiments from tests performed on a real environment with multiple robots prove the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",

        "abstract": "To gain a synthetic understanding of how the body and nervous system co-create animal locomotion, we propose an investigation into a quadruped musculoskeletal robot with biologically realistic morphology and a nervous system. The muscle configuration and sensory feedback of our robot are compatible with the mono- and bi-articular muscles of a quadruped animal and with its muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The nervous system is designed with a biologically plausible model of the spinobulbar system with no pre-defined gait patterns such that mutual entrainment is dynamically created by exploiting the physics of the body. In computer simulations, we found that designing the body and the nervous system of the robot with the characteristics of biological systems increases information regularities in sensorimotor flows by generating complex and coordinated motor patterns. Furthermore, we found similar results in robot experiments with the generation of various coordinated locomotion patterns created in a self-organized manner. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical interaction between the physics of the body with the neural dynamics can shape behavioral patterns for adaptive locomotion in an autonomous fashion.",

Palpation results and biomechanics based mechanical property characterization are possible solutions that could enable the acquisition of objective and quantitative information on abnormal tissue localization during diagnosis and surgery. This paper presents an integrated approach for robotic palpation and mechanical property characterization. To validate the proposed methods, robotic palpation experiments on silicone soft-tissue phantoms with embedded hard inclusions were performed using a robotic palpation system, and the force responses of the phantoms were measured. Furthermore, we carried out a numerical analysis simulating the experiments and estimating the objective and quantitative properties of the tissues.",

        "abstract": "Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates the joint force/torque that is linear in relation to the dynamic parameters, and on the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters (IDIM-LS technique). The joint forces/torques are calculated as the product of the known control signal (the current reference) by the joint drive gains. Then it is essential to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification of inertial parameters. In this paper it is proposed a new method for the identification of the total joint drive gains in one step. A new inverse dynamic model calculates the current reference signal of each joint j that is linear in relation to the dynamic parameters of the robot, to the inertial parameters of a known mass fixed to the end-effector, and to the inverse of the joint j drive gain. This model is calculated with current reference and position sampled data while the robot is tracking one reference trajectory without load on the robot and one trajectory with the known mass fixed on the robot. Each joint j drive gain is calculated independently by the weighted LS solution of an over-determined linear systems obtained with the equations of the joint j. The method is experimentally validated on an industrial Sta\u00bfubli RX-90 robot.",

For sufficiently large environmental noise, there exists a transition between a translating state and a rotating state with stationary center of mass. Time delayed communication creates a bifurcation pattern dependent on the coupling amplitude between particles. Using a mean field model in the large number limit, we show how the complete bifurcation unfolds in the presence of communication delay and coupling amplitude. Relative to the center of mass, the patterns can then be described as transitions between translation, rotation about a stationary point, or a rotating swarm, where the center of mass undergoes a Hopf bifurcation from steady state to a limit cycle. Examples of some of the stochastic patterns will be given for large numbers of particles.",

The method uses two tri-axis accelerometers and one single axis rate gyro to calculate an estimate of angle relative to the gravitational vector independently from the rotational accelerations. This unbiased inclination estimate is blended with the angular velocity and acceleration measurements using a Kalman filter to obtain the final estimated orientation. Initially developed for implementation in a feedback control loop for control of sit-to-stand transitions in felines during direct electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve, the method can be directly applied to other limb angle measurement tasks such as human gait analysis. The algorithm and sensor is tested on a rotational linkage with a predefined trajectory and compared to an encoder measurement with good agreement.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes an asynchronous noninvasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI) -based navigation system for a humanoid robot, which can behave similarly to a human. In the experimental procedure, each subject is asked to undertake three different sessions: offline training, an online feedback test, and real-time control of a humanoid robot in an indoor maze. During the offline training session, amplitude features from the EEG are extracted using auto-regressive frequency analysis with a Laplacian filter. The optimal feature components are selected by using the Fisher ratio and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) distance metric. Two classifiers are hierarchically set to build the asynchronous BCI system. During the online test session, the trained BCI system translates a subject's ongoing EEG into four mental states: rest, left-hand imagery, right-hand imagery, and foot imagery. Event-by-event analysis is applied to evaluate the performance of the BCI system. If the test performance is consistently satisfactory, the subject executes the real-time control experiments. During the navigation experiments, the subject controls the robot in an indoor maze using the BCI system while surveying the environment through visual feedback. The results show that BCI control was comparable to manual control with a performance ratio of 81%. The evaluation of the results validates the feasibility and power of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Falls that occur during walking are a significant problem from the viewpoints of both medicine and robotics engineering. It is very important to predict falls in order to prevent the falls or minimize the ensuing damage from them. In this study, we investigate the structure of the escape-times from walking to falling of a passive dynamic biped walker on a slope in a 2D plane with irregularities. We find that the structure lies on a manifold with high nonlinearity in state space that cannot be analyzed by linear methods under the assumption of a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, we first apply an extension of the support vector machine (SVM) to characterize its nonlinear structure, which enables us to predict imminent falls. Next, we find a latent space which describes the essential dynamics of the passive walker in a lower-dimensional space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA).

It solves the singularity problems associated with previous models and introduces a novel approach for intuitively deriving exact, singularity-free MSFs, thus avoiding mode switching schemes and simplifying error models. The model is able to simulate spatial bending, pure elongation/contraction, and introduces inverse orientation kinematics for the first time to multisection continuum arms. Also, it carefully accounts for physical constraints in the joint space to provide enhanced insight into practical mechanics, and produces correct results for both forward and inverse kinematics. The model is validated through simulations, based on a prototype continuum robotic arm. Proposed approach is applicable to a broad spectrum of continuum robotic arm designs.",

We start by exploiting nonlinear observability concepts to analyze, using observability rank conditions, some types of relative AUV motions. Because rank conditions only provide binary information regarding observability, we then derive a specific observability index (metric) and study its dependence on the types of relative motions executed by the vehicles. In particular, it is shown that the degradation of observability depends on the range and angle between the relative velocity and position vectors. The problem addressed bears affinity with that of single beacon localization. For this reason, the results derived are validated experimentally in a equivalent, single beacon navigation scenario.",

Efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of robot trajectories has been shown to be highly scalable using sparse SLAM algorithms such as SqrtSAM, but unfortunately such approaches don't directly provide a rasterized grid map. We harness these existing SLAM methods to compute maximum likelihood (ML) robot trajectories and introduce a new efficient algorithm to rasterize a dynamic occupancy grid. We propose a spatially-aware data structure that enables the cost of a map update to be proportional to the impact of any loop closures, resulting in better average case performance than naive methods. Furthermore, we show how redundant sensor data can be exploited to improve map quality and speed up rasterization. We evaluate our method using several data sets collected using a team of 14 autonomous robots and show success in mixed indoor-outdoor urban environments as large as 220m \u00d7 170m, with 0.1m resolution.",

Our strategy is active because it moves the vehicles along paths that minimize the combined uncertainty about the target's position. We propose a gradient-based control approach that encompasses the three major optimum experimental-design criteria and relies on the Kalman filter for estimation fusion. We derive analytical lower and upper bounds on the target's position uncertainty by exploiting the monotonicity property of the Riccati differential equation arising from the Kalman-Bucy filter. These bounds allow us to study the impact of sensors' accuracy and target's dynamics on the steady-state performance of our coordination algorithm. Finally, in the case that the position of the vehicles is not perfectly known, we introduce a more challenging problem, termed Active Cooperative Localization and Multi-target Tracking (ACLMT). In this problem, the vehicles move in the 3-D space in order to maximize the accuracy of their own position estimate and that of multiple moving targets.",

One particularly novel component of the algorithm also detects the presence of, and estimates the orientation of, sand ripples. The overall algorithm is made extremely fast by employing a cascaded architecture and by exploiting integral-image representations. As a result, the method makes real-time detection of objects in streaming sonar data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) feasible. No training data is required because the proposed method is adaptively tailored to the environmental characteristics of the sensed data that is collected in situ. The flexible yet rigorous approach also addresses and overcomes five major limitations that plague the most popular detection algorithms that are in common use. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance across a variety of seabed types on a large, challenging data set of real sonar data collected at sea. Ways to exploit the findings and adapt AUV surveys for optimized detection performance are also suggested.",

Using a two-layer optimization process, a planning strategy for the trajectory tracking motion of a passive object including optimal end-effector contact point selection, is developed. The manipulation strategy is illustrated using a 3D scenario. A model-based controller adapted to the special characteristics of the system is presented and its response is discussed. The performance of the proposed manipulation system is shown to be promising, while it reduces excessive thruster fuel consumption.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of computing the sequence of motion plans necessary for a mobile manipulator to execute a given task. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that computational advantages can be obtained when solving this problem by using the notion of a task motion multigraph (TMM). TMMs represent the state spaces that correspond to various hardware components of the robot, and they convey this information to the motion planning level. In this paper, we present and evaluate an algorithm that further exploits TMMs and explores multiple state spaces simultaneously. Since tasks to be performed by mobile manipulators often allow solutions that use only a subset of the robot's hardware components, motion plans can be found in lower dimensional state spaces. The resulting solutions tend to be shorter, more natural and faster to compute. We show that when planning under geometric constraints only, information gained while exploring lower dimensional spaces can be reused to obtain solutions in higher dimensional spaces, if necessary. The reuse of information implicitly provides the ability to compute decoupled motion plans. If solutions are not found while planning in a decoupled fashion, the algorithm resorts to planning in the robot's full state space. Our experiments indicate speedups of 200% and solutions up to four times shorter when compared to an analogous approach that does not employ TMMs.",

        "abstract": "Braitenberg vehicles are well known models of animal behaviour prone to be used as a mobile robot controller. Due to the qualitative simplicity of their behaviour they are used for teaching robotics, whilst the lack of a quantitative theory makes its use for research purposes troublesome. This paper contributes to our formal understanding of Braitenberg vehicle 3a by presenting some convergence properties of its trajectories under parabolic shaped stimuli or potential functions. We show new features of the vehicle motion unreported in robotics like, their conditional stability, their oscillatory behaviour and the existence of a preferred convergence direction. Quantitatively identifying the behaviour of Braitenberg vehicles allows to use them in robotics on a sound basis, not just relying on incomplete qualitative understanding as done by earlier works.",

With a haptic interface, users can interact with a mechanical model during simulation to aid in the development of a surgical plan and then virtually implement the procedure to assess its efficacy. Sub-millimeter accuracy was achieved in a validation study, and the system was successfully used by a cardiac surgeon to repair three virtual pathological valves.",

The system owns the feature of on-line identifying the bio-impedance parameters of fingertip skin for individual tactile preference tuning and haptic rendering enhancement. The identification method relies on a discrete-time extended least squares (ELS) iterative approach with forgetting factor (FF), which serves as an adaptive law to on-line estimate parameters of the first-order bio-impedance model of fingertip skin when the stimulation current control is performing in z-domain. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the developed CVD electrotactile display, as well verify the effectiveness of the proposed on-line identification method. That is, it is capable of quickly estimating parameters of the fingertip skin bio-impedance model. The significance of our work is that it will greatly improve the tactile/haptic rendering performance of electrical stimulation (electrotactile) systems and benefits the development of electrotactile based haptic rendering devices and applications.",

        "abstract": "Rollover is the principal cause of serious accidents for All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV), especially for light vehicles (e.g. quad bikes). In order to reduce this risk, the development of active devices, contributes a promising solution. With this aim, this paper proposes an algorithm allowing to predict the rollover risk, by means of an on-line estimation of a stability criterion. Among several rollover indicators, the Lateral Load Transfer (LLT) has been chosen because its estimation needs only low cost sensing equipment compared to the price of a light ATV. An adapted backstepping observer associated to a bicycle model is first developed, allowing the estimation of the grip conditions. In addition, the lateral slope is estimated thanks to a classical Kalman filter relying on measured acceleration and roll rate. Then, an expression of the LLT is derived from a roll model taking into account the grip conditions and the slope. Finally, the LLT value is anticipated by means of a prediction algorithm. The capabilities of this system are investigated thanks to full scale experiments with a quad bike.",

An optimal stabilization system is an ideal online system that can calculate each optimal motion leading to a stable mechanical goal state depending on the current state. We propose a system that selects each semi-optimal motion according to the current state from a reverse-time tree. To create the reverse-time tree, we applied rapid semi-optimal motion planning method (RASMO) to a reverse-time search from a stable state. We also developed an online motion selection technique. To validate the proposed method, we simulated the stabilization of a double inverted pendulum. When we used an optimization criteria, time optimal, the system quickly stabilized the pendulum's posture and velocity. When we used higher resolution RASMO, the time approached the optimal time. The general framework proposed here is applicable to a variety of machines.",

In uncertain and highly dynamic environments such as human households, robots need to be able to instantly adapt their behavior to unforseen events. In this paper, we propose a general framework to achieve very contact-reactive motions for robotic grasping and manipulation. Associating stereotypical movements to particular tasks enables our system to use previous sensor experiences as a predictive model for subsequent task executions. We use dynamical systems, named Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), to learn goal-directed behaviors from demonstration. We exploit their dynamic properties by coupling them with the measured and predicted sensor traces. This feedback loop allows for online adaptation of the movement plan. Our system can create a rich set of possible motions that account for external perturbations and perception uncertainty to generate truly robust behaviors. As an example, we present an application to grasping with the WAM robot arm.",

        "abstract": "We propose an algorithm for the visual detection and localisation of the hand of a humanoid robot. This algorithm imposes low requirements on the type of supervision required to achieve good performance. In particular the system performs feature selection and adaptation using images that are only labelled as containing the hand or not, without any explicit segmentation. Our algorithm is an online variant of Multiple Instance Learning based on boosting. Experiments in real-world conditions on the iCub humanoid robot confirm that the algorithm can learn the visual appearance of the hand, reaching an accuracy comparable with its off-line version. This remains true when supervision is generated by the robot itself in a completely autonomous fashion. Algorithms with weak supervision requirements like the one we describe are useful for autonomous robots that learn and adapt online to a changing environment. The algorithm is not hand-specific and could be easily applied to wide range of problems involving visual recognition of generic objects.",

The method is robust to the robot's own moving shadow and other sources of error. Robustness derives from two techniques: prevention of feature selection on or near shadow edges and elimination of outliers based on inconsistent motion. In tests where the robot's shadow dominated the image, prevention of feature selection near shadow edges allowed accurate velocity estimation when outlier rejection alone failed. Performance was evaluated on two robot platforms and on multiple terrain types at speeds up to 2 m/s.",

When one or more phases reach the voltage or/and current limits, the controller optimally reshapes the stator currents of the remaining phases for continuing accurate torque production. This allow the motor to operate above the rated speed and torque that would be achieved without current reshaping. In the event that an open-circuit or short-circuit of a winding occurs, the torque controller can also isolate the faulty phase in order to generate torque as requested given the voltage and current constraints of the healthy phases. A closed-form solution for the optimal phase currents is obtained rendering the control algorithm suitable for real-time implementation. Experimental results illustrate the capability of the controller to achieve precise torque production during voltage/current saturation of the motor's drivers or a phase failure.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are compact and have high force-to-weight ratios, making them strong candidates to actuate robots, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. However, these actuators are thermomechanical in nature and slow cooling rates can limit their performance. To improve the convective cooling, SMA wires have been embedded in vascular networks allowing cold fluid to pass across the actuators to cool/extend them. The vascular network can also deliver hot fluid to heat and contract the wire. In addition to the fluidic network, an electrical network operating in parallel can resistively heat the SMA to produce contraction. To minimize the weight and size of the vascular and electrical networks, a scalable N[N architecture has been implemented that allows for 2N control devices (valves, transistors) to be shared amongst N2 actuators. This Network Array Architecture (NAA) allows each actuator to be controlled individually or in discrete subarrays. However, this architecture does not allow all combinations of actuators to be activated simultaneously; therefore in general a sequence of control commands will need to be executed in order to achieve the complete actuation. In order to find an optimal sequence of control commands, graph theory algorithms have been implemented. By treating each actuator's state as binary (fully contracted or extended), the collected states of an actuator array can be represented as nodes of the graph and the control commands as the graph edges. By properly weighting the costs of the graph edges, search algorithms can be used to find an optimal set of control commands for desired state changes. NAA results in a multi-graph that has 2NA\u2014N nodes and is highly interconnected. While initial work in this area established the basic validity of a graph search approach for NAA control, this article presents a scalable method of determining the optimal set of controls to minimize the operating cost (time and energy) and computational search c...

The new concept of iso-probability curves, used to represent the time-varying prediction of a lost person's probable location within the search area, is utilized to effectively distribute the search effort. The proposed method can be used for initial deployment, as well as subsequent on-line re-deployment to address the dynamic nature of the search for a moving lost person in a growing search area with varying terrain. The modularity of the proposed method allows the user to define and utilize different objective functions and weigh them according to the goal at hand. The two specific objective functions considered in this paper are (minimizing) search time and (maximizing) the probability of success. A simulated realistic wilderness search scenario demonstrates the integration of optimal deployment within the overall search methodology.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the effectiveness of maintenance in fault-tolerant multi-robot systems. Such a system is enabled to work as long as one robot works; namely, completely parallel. For this system, it is required to ensure fault tolerance and maintain high performance taking robot failures and maintenance, such as prevention and correction of robots, into account. Therefore, we propose an optimal maintenance strategy on the basis of reliability engineering. This strategy enables robots to undergo preventive maintenance at optimal intervals and corrective maintenance each time they fail. Through simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the optimal maintenance strategy is investigated. In addition, the influence of robots undergoing maintenance on system performance is mathematically and experimentally discussed on the basis of the number of robots and maintenance strategies.",

Each robot's motion in the environment is modeled as a weighted transition system. The mission is given as a Linear Temporal Logic formula. In addition, an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be satisfied. The goal is to minimize the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. Our method is guaranteed to compute an optimal set of robot paths. We utilize a timed automaton representation in order to capture the relative position of the robots in the environment. We then obtain a bisimulation of this timed automaton as a finite transition system that captures the joint behavior of the robots and apply our earlier algorithm for the single robot case to optimize the group motion. We present a simulation of a persistent monitoring task in a road network environment.",

        "abstract": "In practical robot motion planning, robots usually do not have full models of their surrounding, and hence no complete and correct plan exists for the robots to be executed fully. In most real-world problems a robot operates in just a partially-known environment, meaning that most of the environment is known to the robot at the time of planning, but there exists incomplete information about some \u2018hidden\u2019 variables which represent potential blockages (e.g. open/closed doors, or corridors congested with other robots or obstacles). For these hidden variables, the robot has a probability distribution estimation and a prioritized preference over their possible values. In this paper, to deal with the problem of choosing an optimal policy for planning in offline mode, a stochastic dynamic programming model is developed, which is converted to and solved by linear programming. Next, a heuristic method is proposed for conditional planning in the presence of numerous hidden variables which produces optimal plans.",

        "abstract": "The control of a robot's mechanical impedance is attracting increasing attention of the robotics community. Recent research in Robotics has recognized the importance of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) in safety and performance of robots. An important step in using VSA for safety has been to understand the optimality principles that regulate the synchronized variation of stiffness and velocity when moving in the shortest time while limiting possible impact forces (the safe brachistochrone problem). In this paper, we follow a similar program of understanding the use of VSA in performance enhancement, looking at very dynamic tasks where impacts are maximized. To this purpose we address a new optimization problem that consists in choosing the inputs for maximizing the velocity of a link at a given final position, such as, e.g., for maximizing the effect of a hammer impact. We first study the problem with fixed stiffness, and show that, under realistic modeling assumptions, there does exist an optimal linear spring for the given inertia and motor. We then study optimal control of VSA and show that varying the spring stiffness during the execution of the hammering task improves the final performance substantially. The optimal control law is obtained analytically, thus providing insight in the optimality principles underpinning general VSA control. Finally, we show the practicality of our theoretical results with experimental tests.",

The BBCG algorithm is also compared to another two exact algorithms [i.e., Binary integer Programming with Dynamic Programming (BPDP) and Exhaustive Search with Permutation and Combination (ESPC)] for the ASCS problem solving.

However, the environment provides a vast amount of visual information and concentrating on the information related to the task being undertaken is an important job. Active vision is an approach that provides such a filtering mechanism by using camera movements to bring relevant information into the focus of attention. However timing of gaze shifts (i.e. when to look where) is crucial for cognitive tasks to proceed simultaneously (multitasking). We developed a framework that learns task dependent management of gaze control. We adopted a systems approach where individual visual processes were formalised as modules such as a colour saliency module or object recognition module. Modules may generate motor commands for gaze shifts to acquire visual information relevant to their operation. The system learns how to use its modules (i.e. when to give motor control access to which module) for a task in a reward-based concept. The framework was used in a reaching-while-interacting scenario using the humanoid iCub in a simulation environment.",

Once the spatial and temporal alignment between the sensors is known, the fusion of measurements of these devices is straightforward. Determining the alignment, however, is a challenging problem. Especially the spatial translation estimation has turned out to be difficult, mainly due to limitations of camera dynamics and noisy accelerometer measurements. Up to now, filtering-based approaches for this calibration problem are largely prevalent. However, we are not convinced that calibration, as an offline step, is necessarily a filtering issue, and we explore the benefits of interpreting it as a batch-optimization problem. To this end, we show how to model the IMU-camera calibration problem in a nonlinear optimization framework by modeling the sensors' trajectory, and we present experiments comparing this approach to filtering and system identification techniques. The results are based both on simulated and real data, showing that our approach compares favorably to conventional methods.",

In this paper, we focus on evacuation guidance to prevent the damage from spreading. The personal navigation system cannot deal with evacuation guidance for the human crowd with large numbers of individuals because of time constraints and extraordinary communication error. An implicit guidance based on dynamical characteristic of swarm behavior is efficient and effective with a few guidance operators. We propose a modeling and control method of swarm based on vector field. The evacuee behavior model contains intention of evacuation, field of view, collision avoidance and evacuee group, which are represented by vector field. The guidance operator model contains indicating direction. By giving the desired vector field that indicates the safe route for evacuation, the position of guidance operators are optimally distributed. Moreover, the number of guidance operators is minimized based on the contribution index. The proposed modeling and control method is applied to the swarm robot and the effectiveness is evaluated by the experiments.",

        "abstract": "We present a scalable approach to optimizing robot control policies for a target collective behavior in a spatially inhomogeneous robotic swarm. The approach can incorporate robot feedback to maintain system performance in an unknown environmental flow field. We consider systems in which the robots follow both deterministic and random motion and transition stochastically between tasks. Our methodology is based on an abstraction of the swarm to a macroscopic continuous model, whose dimensionality is independent of the population size, that describes the expected time evolution of swarm subpopulations over a discretization of the environment. We incorporate this model into a stochastic optimization method and map the optimized model parameters onto the robot motion and task transition control policies to achieve a desired global objective. We illustrate our methodology with a scenario in which the behaviors of a swarm of robotic bees are optimized for both uniform and nonuniform pollination of a blueberry field, including in the presence of an unknown wind.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of determining the optimal robot trajectory for localizing a robot follower in a leader-follower formation using robot-to-robot distance or bearing measurements. In particular, maintaining a perfect formation has been shown to reduce the localization accuracy (as compared to moving randomly), or even leads to loss of observability when only distance or bearing measurements are available and the robots move on parallel straight lines. To address this limitation, we allow the follower to slightly deviate from its desired formation-imposed position and seek to find the next best location where it should move to in order to minimize the uncertainty about its relative, with respect to the leader, position and orientation estimates. We formulate and solve this non-convex optimization problem analytically and show, through extensive simulations, that the proposed optimized motion strategy leads to significant localization accuracy improvement as compared to competing approaches.",

Two- or three- dimensional localization accuracy of a randomly distributed array will vary widely with respect to the relative position of the sound source. Where a statically located array would be forced to work with its initial configuration, however, a reconfigurable robotic array does not have to remain in its starting position. Given a known region of interest, robots can autonomously optimize their relative configuration to improve localization accuracy where it matters the most. In this work, we propose 2 separate strategies for optimizing such a robotic array. Evaluations are completed first in simulation, and then deployed to a team of real robots.",

        "abstract": "Accurately determining the position and orientation of an observer (a vehicle or a human) in outdoor urban environments is an important and challenging problem. The standard approach is to use the Global Positioning System (GPS), but this system performs poorly near tall buildings where line of sight to a sufficient number of satellites cannot be obtained. Most previous vision-based approaches for localization register ground imagery to a previously generated ground-level model of the environment. Generating such a model can be difficult and time consuming, and is impractical in some environments. Instead, we propose to perform localization by registering a single omnidirectional ground image to a 2D urban terrain model that is easily generated from aerial imagery. We introduce a novel image descriptor that encodes the position and orientation of a camera relative to buildings in the environment. The descriptor is efficiently generated from edges and vanishing points in an omnidirectional image and is registered to descriptors previously generated for the terrain model. Rather than constructing a local CAD-like model of the environment, which is difficult in cluttered environments, our descriptor measures, at equally spaced intervals over the 360\u00b0 field of view, the orientation of visible building facades projected onto the ground plane (i.e., the building footprints). We evaluate our approach on an urban data set with significant clutter and demonstrate an accuracy of about 1 m, which is an order of magnitude better than commercial GPS operating in open environments.",

Significant demand for both accuracy and productivity highlights the need of developing an automatic arraying approach to moving and pairing a swarm of particles to a pre-defined array. This paper presents our latest effort to achieve this objective by using integrated robotics and holographic optical tweezers technologies, where holographic optical tweezers function as special robot end-effectors. A controller is proposed to drive pairs of particles to the assigned regions which are centered at array points. The potential field method is utilized to avoid collisions between particles.

Consider a robot whose task is to make pancakes, and part of the plan is to put down the bottle with pancake mix after pouring it on the pan. The put-down location of the bottle is heavily under-specified but has a critical influence on the overall performance of the plan. For instance, when it places it at a location where it occludes other objects, the robot cannot see and grasp the occluded objects anymore unless the bottle is removed again. Other important aspects include stability and reachability. Objects should not flip over or fall. A badly chosen put-down location can \u201cblock\u201d trajectories for grasping other objects that were valid before and can even prevent the robot from reaching these objects. In this paper, we show a lightweight and fast reasoning system that integrates qualitative and quantitative reasoning based on Prolog. We demonstrate how we implement predicates that make use of OpenGL, the Bullet physics engine and inverse kinematics calculation. Equipped with generative models yielding pose candidates, our system allows for the generation of action parameters such as put down locations under the constraints of the current and future actions in real time.",

In this paper, a motion capturing algorithm is proposed for upper body motion tracking. The proposed system tracks human motion based on monocular silhouette-matching, and it is built on the top of a hierarchical particle filter, within which a novel deterministic resampling strategy (DRS) is applied. The proposed system is evaluated quantitatively with the ground truth data measured by an inertial sensor system. In addition, we compare the DRS with the stratified resampling strategy (SRS). It is shown in experiments that DRS outperforms SRS with the same amount of particles. Moreover, a new 3D articulated human upper body model with the name 3D cardbox model is created and is proven to work successfully for motion tracking. Experiments show that the proposed system can robustly track upper body motion without self-occlusion. Motions towards the camera can also be well tracked.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an audio-visual beat-tracking method for ensemble robots with a human guitarist. Beat-tracking, or estimation of tempo and beat times of music, is critical to the high quality of musical ensemble performance. Since a human plays the guitar in out-beat in back beat and syncopation, the main problems of beat-tracking of a human's guitar playing are twofold: tempo changes and varying note lengths. Most conventional methods have not addressed human's guitar playing. Therefore, they lack the adaptation of either of the problems. To solve the problems simultaneously, our method uses not only audio but visual features. We extract audio features with Spectro-Temporal Pattern Matching (STPM) and visual features with optical flow, mean shift and Hough transform. Our beat-tracking estimates tempo and beat time using a particle filter; both acoustic feature of guitar sounds and visual features of arm motions are represented as particles. The particle is determined based on prior distribution of audio and visual features, respectively Experimental results confirm that our integrated audio-visual approach is robust against tempo changes and varying note lengths. In addition, they also show that estimation convergence rate depends only a little on the number of particles.

By using the mathematical model, we numerically show that stable passive gaits can be generated on a gentle slope, and that the walking speed is dramatically improved by adjusting the phase difference between the fore and rear legs. We then discuss the inherent speeding-up mechanism from the potential barrier point of view. Furthermore, the validity of the derived results is evaluated by using an experimental machine.",

A dynamic model is used to demonstrate how body undulations can result from only varying the phase difference in the stance change between adjacent segments - even with passive intersegmental connections - and how these gaits affect locomotion. Different gaits are demonstrated experimentally in a 20-leg, 2.2 gram millirobot, and the resulting motion is compared to that predicted by the simulation. Both simulation and experiments show that undulatory gaits can increase the average speed of straight-line locomotion as compared to non-undulatory gaits for the same stepping frequency. The model and the millirobot can be used concurrently with biological studies to understand aspects of myriapod locomotion. This robot is also a useful tool to gain insight into how flexibility can be introduced into robots at this scale to enhance locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Planetary exploration rovers are required to (semi-) autonomously navigate itself on rough terrain. In such scenario, a feasible path to be followed must be accurately planned, allowing the rover to safely traverse without any mobility hazards. In this paper, a path planning and evaluation strategy that explicitly considers dynamic mobility of the rover is presented. The proposed strategy consists of the following three steps. First, various paths on a given terrain map are generated with varying weighting factors for path planning algorithm. Each path is then examined through complete dynamic simulations of the rover in which the rover travels along with the path. The simulation result provides a metric for robotic mobility. The metric, termed a dynamic mobility index, consists of stability of the rover, wheel slippage, elapsed time, and energy consumption. All of the paths generated are quantitatively evaluated based on the dynamic mobility index, and then, the most feasible path between them is obtained. Demonstrations for the path planning and evaluation are presented in this paper that confirms the validity of the proposed strategy.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel control strategy for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), named as path tracking, which combines the conventional path following and trajectory tracking control in order to achieve smooth spatial convergence and tight temporal performance as well. This idea is inspired by the previous work of Hindman [1] and Encarnacao [2], however, the path tracking design herein goes from path following to trajectory tracking, which indeed is an inverse way from the previous solutions so that the complex projection algorithm resulting in a local stability is avoided. A kinematics controller is first derived by using Lyapunov direct method where a virtual path parameter is introduced to bring an extra control degree of freedom, and then it is extended to the dynamics of AUVs based on backstepping technique. The resulting nonlinear control design is formally shown and it yields global asymptotic convergence of the AUV to the path. Finally, simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the path tracking control design for AUVs.",

In this paper, we present a novel people detection approach for RGB-D data. We take inspiration from the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) detector to design a robust method to detect people in dense depth data, called Histogram of Oriented Depths (HOD). HOD locally encodes the direction of depth changes and relies on an depth-informed scale-space search that leads to a 3-fold acceleration of the detection process. We then propose Combo-HOD, a RGB-D detector that probabilistically combines HOD and HOG. The experiments include a comprehensive comparison with several alternative detection approaches including visual HOG, several variants of HOD, a geometric person detector for 3D point clouds, and an Haar-based AdaBoost detector. With an equal error rate of 85% in a range up to 8m, the results demonstrate the robustness of HOD and Combo-HOD on a real-world data set collected with a Kinect sensor in a populated indoor environment.",

In this paper, we present a 3D people detection and tracking approach using RGB-D data. We combine a novel multi-cue person detector for RGB-D data with an on-line detector that learns individual target models. The two detectors are integrated into a decisional framework with a multi-hypothesis tracker that controls on-line learning through a track interpretation feedback. For on-line learning, we take a boosting approach using three types of RGB-D features and a confidence maximization search in 3D space. The approach is general in that it neither relies on background learning nor a ground plane assumption. For the evaluation, we collect data in a populated indoor environment using a setup of three Microsoft Kinect sensors with a joint field of view. The results demonstrate reliable 3D tracking of people in RGB-D data and show how the framework is able to avoid drift of the on-line detector and increase the overall tracking performance.",

Here we consider the task of mapping their course and the vegetation along the shores with the specific intent of determining river width and canopy height. A complication in such riverine environments is that only intermittent GPS may be available depending on the thickness of the surrounding canopy. We present a multimodal perception system to be used for the active exploration and mapping of a river from a small rotorcraft flying a few meters above the water. We describe three key components that use computer vision, laser scanning, and inertial sensing to follow the river without the use of a prior map, estimate motion of the rotorcraft, ensure collision-free operation, and create a three dimensional representation of the riverine environment. While the ability to fly simplifies the navigation problem, it also introduces an additional set of constraints in terms of size, weight and power. Hence, our solutions are cognizant of the need to perform multi-kilometer missions with a small payload. We present experimental results along a 2km loop of river using a surrogate system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper an omnidirectional mobile robot that possesses high mobility in rough terrain is presented. The omnidirectional robot has four active split offset caster (ASOC) modules, enabling the robot to move in any planar direction. It also possesses passive suspension articulation, allowing the robot to conform to uneven terrain. The agility of the robot is experimentally evaluated in various configurations. In addition, an odometry method that mitigates position estimation error due to wheel slippage is proposed. A key aspect of the proposed method is to utilize sensory data of wheel velocity, and turning rate around each ASOC pivot shaft, along with kinematic constraints of the robot configuration. Experimental odometry tests with different maneuvers in rough terrain are presented that confirm the utility of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "While underactuated mechanisms have become popular in robot-hand designs because of their passive adaptability, existing systems utilize only one actuator to produce motion in the multiple degrees of freedom in the serial chain of each finger. In this paper, we explore how the performance of an underactuated serial link chain changes as more actuators are added. The fundamental question of what extra capability an additional actuator provides to an underactuated system and how best to implement it has not yet been quantified in the literature. Using a simple linear underactuated mechanism, we show that the performance of a single-actuator system (measured as the average number of contacts made with the environment) quickly plateaus as the number of degrees of freedom of the mechanism is increased. Also, we show that as the number of actuators is increased, the system's passive adaptability improves as the mechanism implementation spreads the actuators across the joints.",

        "abstract": "Although the problem of dynamic locomotion in very rough terrain is critical to the advancement of various areas in robotics and health devices, little progress has been made on generalizing gait behavior with arbitrary paths. Here, we report that perturbation theory, a set of approximation schemes that has roots in celestial mechanics and non-linear dynamical systems, can be adapted to predict the behavior of non-integrable state-space trajectories of a robot's center of mass, given its arbitrary contact state and center of mass (CoM) kinematic path. Given an arbitrary kinematic path of the CoM and known step locations, we use perturbation theory to determine phase curves of CoM behavior. We determine step transitions as the points of intersection between adjacent phase curves. To discover intersection points, we fit polynomials to the phase curves of neighboring steps and solve their differential roots. The resulting multi-step phase diagram is the locomotion plan suited to drive the behavior of a robot or device maneuvering in the rough terrain. We provide two main contributions to legged locomotion: (1) predicting CoM state-space behavior for arbitrary paths by means of perturbation theory, and (2) finding step transitions by locating common intersection points between neighboring phase curves. Because these points are continuous in phase they correspond to the desired contact switching policy. We validate our results on a human-size avatar navigating in a very rough environment and compare its behavior to a human subject maneuvering through the same terrain.",

        "abstract": "The control of tendon-driven robots using techniques from traditional robotics remains a very challenging task that has been so far only successfully achieved for small-scale setups comprising exclusively revolute joints [1, 2]. Hence, we propose a fundamentally different approach. Instead of deriving an analytical robot model using either the Newton-Euler or Lagrangian formulation we suggest to employ physics-based simulation engines to simulate the peculiar dynamics of this emerging class of robots and to use the simulated robot model as an internal model for robot control [3]. In this paper, we present the reverse-engineered derivation of a detailed physics-based model of an anthropomimetic robot implemented on CALIPER [4], a simulation framework developed within the EU-funded project ECCEROBOT [5]. The model comprises an accurate model of the skeleton derived from laser scan data, as well as of artificial ligaments and muscles. The individual sub-models are validated separately against measurements and the successful integration of all sub-models is demonstrated by executing a limb movement which requires the parallel control of multiple muscles.",

Connecting a shunt resistor in series with a piezoelectric element allows it to be used simultaneously as an actuator and a sensor by measuring the current generated by the piezoelectric element. This allows the displacement and force to be measured without extra sensors or the loss of actuation capability. Applying an inverse model of the nested structure allows the force and displacement at the tip of the tweezers to be determined. The accuracy of this method is then examined by experiment for the case of free displacement.",

In this paper, we explain the static model of the proposed system and how to control the pitch and roll angles of an underwater robot.

The wide range of applications of place recognition includes localization (determine the initial pose), SLAM (detect loop closures), and change detection in dynamic environments. In the past, only relatively little work has been carried out to attack this problem using 3D range data and the majority of approaches focuses on detecting similar structures without estimating relative poses. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on 3D range data that is able to reliably detect previously seen parts of the environment and at the same time calculates an accurate transformation between the corresponding scan-pairs. Our system uses the estimated transformation to evaluate a candidate and in this way to more robustly reject false positives for place recognition. We present an extensive set of experiments using publicly available datasets in which we compare our system to other state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "In the aerial supply delivery problem, an unmanned aircraft needs to deliver supplies as close as possible to the desired location. This involves choosing, flying to, sensing, and landing at a safe landing site that is most accessible from the goal. The problem is often complicated by the fact that the availability of these landing sites may be unknown before the mission begins. Therefore, the aircraft needs to compute a sequence of actions that will minimize the expected value of the objective function. The problem of computing this sequence corresponds to planning under uncertainty in the environment. In this paper, we show how it can be solved efficiently via a recently developed probabilistic planning framework, called Probabilistic Planning with Clear Preferences (PPCP). We show that the problem satisfies the Clear Preferences assumption required by PPCP, and therefore all the theoretical guarantees continue to hold. The experimental results in simulation demonstrate that our approach can solve large-scale problems in realtime while experiments on our custom quad-rotor helicopter provide a proof of concept for the planner.",

        "abstract": "With the continued improvements in portable computing power and sensing systems it is becoming more common for groups of robots to cooperate to achieve a goal. When the robots are operating in an initially unknown environment, the most natural form of cooperation is multi-robot exploration. For many years frontier based approaches have been commonly used to assign target points for each of the robots in the group based on expected information gain and distance to travel. In this paper we present an expansion to these approaches allowing for the incorporation of multiple objective utility functions that allow adjustment of the exploration priorities both for the individual robots and the group as a whole. In addition, we discuss real world results of our algorithm including our first place finish at the Old Ram Shed Challenge and second place at the MAGIC2010 main competition.",

        "abstract": "Many supporting activities that future service robots might perform in people's homes depend on the capability to grasp and manipulate arbitrary objects. Easily accomplished by humans, but very difficult to achieve for robots, grasping involves dealing with a high-dimensional space of parameters which include hand kinematics, object geometry, material properties and forces. We believe that the way a robot grasps an object should be motivated by the object's geometry and that the search space for stable grasps can be dramatically reduced if the underlying object representation reflects symmetry properties of the object that contain valuable information for grasp planning. In this paper, we introduce the grid of medial spheres, a volumetric object representation based on the medial axis transform. The grid of medial spheres represents arbitrarily shaped objects with arbitrary levels of detail and contains symmetry information that can be easily exploited by a grasp planning algorithm. We present the data structure as well as a grasp planning algorithm that exploits it and provide experimental results on various object models using two robot hands in simulation.",

The proposed method is based on a space of blendable example motions collected by motion capture. This space is explored by a sampling-based planner that is able to produce motions around obstacles while keeping solutions similar to the original examples. The results therefore largely maintain the humanlike characteristics observed in the example motions. The method is applied to generic upper-body actions and is complemented by a locomotion planner that searches for suitable body placements for executing upper-body actions successfully. As a result, our overall multi-modal planning method is able to automatically coordinate whole-body motions for action execution among obstacles, and the produced motions remain similar to example motions given as input to the system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of human-aware coverage planning. We first present an approach to learn and model human activity events in a probabilistic spatio-temporal map using spatial Poisson processes. We then propose a coverage planner for paths that minimize the interference probability with people. To this end, we pose the coverage problem as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time-dependent costs (ATDTSP) derived from the information in the map. The approach enables a noisy robotic vacuum in a home scenario, for instance, to learn to avoid busy places at certain times of the day such as the kitchen at lunch time. We evaluate the planner using a simulator of people in a home environment to generate typical weekday activity patterns. In the experiments with a regular TSP planner and two modified TSP heuristics, the proposed coverage planner significantly reduces interference with people in terms of number of disturbed persons and overall disturbance time.",

The third solution integrates elements into a remarkably simple equation of plenoptic flow which is directly solved to estimate the camera's motion. The proposed methods avoid feature extraction, operating instead on all measured pixels, and are therefore robust to noise. The solutions are closed-form, computationally efficient, and operate in constant time regardless of scene complexity, making them suitable for real-time robotics applications. Results are shown for a simulated underwater survey scenario, and real-world results demonstrate good performance for a three-camera array, outperforming a state-of-the-art stereo feature-tracking approach.",

The current paper presents a new approach to dimensionality reduction and object classification of three-dimensional rigid objects. The approach is based upon recent developments in tensor decompositions and a newly defined algebra of circulants. In particular, it is shown that under the right tensor multiplication operator, a third order tensor can be written as a product of third order tensors in which the left and right tensors are tensor-orthogonal and the inner-tensor is a diagonal tensor of singular-tuples. This new development allows for a proper tensor singular value decomposition (SVD) to be defined and has natural extension to tensor principal component analysis (PCA). Comparisons are made with traditional PCA and it is shown that the current approach is capable of recovering significantly more information from an image sequence using a much smaller subspace dimension. Further, it is shown that for most objects, accurate pose estimation can be performed from a single subspace dimension.",

This is achieved inherently in the way the robot adheres to and crawls over the surface of the heart. This mode of operation does not require physiological motion compensation to provide this stable environment; however, modeling of physiological motion is advantageous in providing more accurate position estimation as well as synchronization of motion to the physiological cycles. The work presented uses an Extended Kalman Filter framework to estimate parameters of non-stationary Fourier series models of the motion of the heart due to the respiratory and cardiac cycles as well as the position of the robot as it moves over the surface of the heart. The proposed method is demonstrated in the laboratory with HeartLander operating on a physiological motion simulator. Improved performance is demonstrated in comparison to the filtering methods previously used with HeartLander. The use of detected physiological cycle phases to synchronize locomotion of HeartLander is also described.",

In this paper, we describe the height-length-density (HLD) terrain classifier that generalizes some prior methods and provides a unified mechanism for detecting both positive and negative obstacles. The classifier utilizes three novel features that inherently deal with partial observability. The structure of the classifier allows the system designer to encode the capabilities of the vehicle as well as a notion of risk, making our approach applicable to virtually any vehicle. We evaluate our method in an indoor/outdoor environment, which includes several perceptually difficult real-world cases, and show that our approach out-performs current methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate how power consumption affects mobility-based coordination algorithms for multi-robot systems by explicitly coupling the control laws to the available power levels. In particular, we will consider a sensor network comprising of mobile sensors which use omni directional RF or radar based antennas for communication, with a disk-shaped communications footprint. As power decrease with time, the footprint shrinks as well, and in this paper we propose a controller that solves the rendezvous problem for such systems, thus providing a novel coupling between mobility algorithms and the available power levels.",

        "abstract": "Effective robotic interaction with household objects requires the ability to recognize both object instances and object categories. The former are often characterized by locally discriminative texture cues (e.g., instances with prominent brand names and logos), and the latter by salient global shape properties (plates, bowls, pots). We describe experiments with both types of cues, combining a template-and-deformable-parts detector to capture overall shape properties with a local feature Naive-Bayes nearest neighbor model to capture local texture properties. We base our implementation on the recently introduced Kinect sensor, which provides reliable depth estimates of indoor scenes. Depth cues provide segmentation and size constraints to our method. Depth affinity is used to modify the appearance term in a segmentation-based proposal step, and size priors are imposed on object classes to prune false positives. We address the complexity of scanning window HOG search using multi-class pruning schemes, first applying a generic object detection scheme to prune unlikely windows, and then focusing only on the most likely class per remaining window. Our method is able to handle relatively cluttered scenes involving multiple objects with varying levels of surface texture, and can efficiently employ multi-class scanning window search.",

        "abstract": "Bipedal walking in human environments is made difficult by the unevenness of the terrain and by external disturbances. Most approaches to bipedal walking in such environments either rely upon a precise model of the surface or special hardware designed for uneven terrain. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to stabilize the walking of an inexpensive, commercially-available, position-controlled humanoid robot in difficult environments. We use electrically compliant swing foot dynamics and onboard sensors to estimate the inclination of the local surface, and use a online learning algorithm to learn an adaptive surface model. Perturbations due to external disturbances or model errors are rejected by a hierarchical push recovery controller, which modulates three biomechanically motivated push recovery controllers according to the current estimated state. We use a physically realistic simulation with an articulated robot model and reinforcement learning algorithm to train the push recovery controller, and implement the learned controller on a commercial DARwIn-OP small humanoid robot. Experimental results show that this combined approach enables the robot to walk over unknown, uneven surfaces without falling down.",

        "abstract": "The design of a robotic manipulator, including the type of joints, actuators, and other geometric parameters significantly affects its precision (or positioning uncertainty) at the end-effector. Furthermore, sensor and actuator resolution and choice of control scheme will also contribute to the manipulator's precision. Modeling and simulation of these uncertainties can provide useful insight and serve as design guidelines for precision manipulators used in micro and nanomanufacturing. Of particular interest are assembly scenarios where the tolerance budgets are stringent and precision requirements are high, but there is little space for extensive sensor feedback due to a small work volume. In this paper, we investigate the effect of parametric uncertainties in a serial robot chain composed of prismatic or rotary \u201cmodules\u201d on the overall positioning uncertainty at the end-effector. Two types of errors are considered: static errors due to misalignment and link parameter uncertainties, and dynamic errors due to inaccurate motion of individual links. Using common uncertainty metrics, we compare the precision of six different robot kinematic chain configurations and select the best suited ones for a generic Peg-in-Hole microassembly task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents the use of context-based predictions for the selection and on-line modification of the compliance of a robot manipulator. The work is partially inspired on current neuroscience hypotheses about the control of the human arm and the computational processes used by the brain. A first experiment uses inspiration from the classical neuroscience experiment of the Waiter Task. In the original experiment, the non-dominant human arm is holding a weight of 1 Kg. When this weight is unloaded by a self-generated action (with the dominant arm), it is observed that the non-dominant arm does not suffer perceptible postural changes. The reason arguably stems from the prediction of the forces occurring at the unloading, since the inherently delayed sensory feedback present in biological systems would not suffice to react in such a short notice as observed. The experiment is reproduced in a robotic platform by means of forward models and compliance adaption via stiffness control as speculated in neuroscience hypotheses. A second experiment uses context-based predictions to modify on-line the compliance of the robot manipulator. For this task, a Bayesian predictor in the form of a Relevance Vector Machine combines the use of prior knowledge and expected sensory feedback to correct for an erroneous compliance in the case of a falsely-predicted context. The results are combined in an architecture called Predictive Context-Based Adaptive Compliance (PCAC).",

This enables a user to affect their shape in order to meet the demands of the targeted application. The introduced method utilizes frictionless contact constraints and is able to efficiently approximate the space of disturbances resistible by all grasps comprising contacts within the independent regions.",

It aims at estimating the geometry of roads without assuming any particular infrastructure such as lane marks. It provides also the vehicle location with respect to the edges of the road. This system employs a radar sensor in view of its robustness to weather conditions such as fog, dust, rain and snow. The proposed approach is robust to noisy measurements since the radar target locations are modelled as Gaussian distributions. These observations are integrated into a Kalman Particle filter to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters that best describe the geometry of the road. Experimental results using data acquired on a highway road are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a qualitative analysis of the results.",

The approach offers a method to calculate the probability that a feedback control policy designed for the drift component of the dynamics, will succeed in allowing the robot to avoid collisions and converge to its navigation goal in the presence of stochastic (white) noise. The problem is formulated as an exit problem and known techniques in the field of stochastic processes are brought to bear to determine the probabilities that the stochastic process describing the motion of the robot will \u00bfexit\u00bf the workspace through a particular part of the boundary.

We will restore clarity by adopting a \u201cprobably approximately correct\u201d measure of performance that captures the probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5 of covering a fraction 1 \u2212 \u03b4 of the free space. The problem of coverage for a robot with uncertainty is then to plan a feedback policy that achieves a given value of \u03b5 and \u03b4. Just as solutions to the classical problem are judged by the resulting path length, solutions to our problem are judged by the required execution time. We will show the practical utility of our performance measure by applying it to several examples in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Self-reconfiguring modular robotic systems offer a potential route to achieving programmable matter, i.e. a substance the shape and properties of which can be tuned as required to achieve a variety of tasks. However, most modular robotic system designs rely on deterministic module motions which place significant power, control, and actuation requirements on the individual modules. This leads to relatively large modules and low target structure resolution. Here we experimentally demonstrate an alternative approach based on stochastic assembly, in which modules assemble into target structures in a fluidic tank. This system employs ambient fluid motion for module transportation. Assembly is directed by controlling the fluid flow through an active assembly substrate with an array of valves. Different valving programs are used with feedback from pressure sensors to achieve the completely automated hierarchical assembly of non-planar 3D structures.",

The spectrum of required assistive functionalities and services that have been specified by the different end-user target groups of such a robot companion (the elderly, relatives, caregivers) is manifold. It reaches from situation-specific, intelligent reminding (e.g. taking medication or drinking) and cognitive stimulation, via mobile videophony with relatives or caregivers, up to the autonomous detection of dangerous situations, like falls, and their evaluation by authorized persons via mobile telepresence. From the beginning, our approach has been focused on long-term and everyday suitability and low-cost producibility as important prerequisites for the marketability of the robot companion. Against this background, the paper presents the main system requirements derived from user studies, the consequences for the hardware design and functionality of the robot companion, its system architecture, a key technology for HRI in home environments - the autonomous user tracking and searching, up to the results of already conducted and ongoing functionality tests and upcoming user studies.",

The planner (1) selects a placement for the target object and (2) constructs a sequence of manipulation actions that create space for the object. When no continuous space is large enough for direct placement, the planner leverages means-end analysis and dynamic simulation to find a sequence of linear pushes that clears the necessary space. Our heuristic for determining candidate placement poses for the target object is used to guide the manipulation search. We show successful results for our algorithm in simulation.",

An algorithm is developed to generate an open loop trajectory guiding the vehicle to a predicted impact point - the prediction is done by integrating forward the current position and velocity estimates from a Kalman filter. By examining the ball and vehicle trajectories before and after impact, the system estimates the ball's drag coefficient, the racket's coefficient of restitution and an aiming bias. These estimates are then fed back into the system's aiming algorithm to improve future performance. The algorithms are implemented for three different experiments: a single quadrocopter returning balls thrown by a human; two quadrocopters co-operatively juggling a ball back-and-forth; and a single quadrocopter attempting to juggle a ball on its own. Performance is demonstrated in the Flying Machine Arena at the ETH Zurich.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a motion planning algorithm connecting a starting and ending goal positions of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with a passive variable camber (PVC) on a fully 3D uneven terrain without slipping. The overall planning framework is along the lines of the RRT (Rapidly Exploring Random Tree). The curve connecting the adjacent nodes of the RRT is a quasi-static path which is generated using the forward motion problem based on the Peshkin's minimum energy principle which combines the force and kinematic relationships of the WMR into a nonlinear optimization problem. The output of this optimization routine is a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representing the non-holonomic constraints and wheel ground contact conditions of the robot along with a set of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) representing the geometric/holonomic constraints of the robot. In general a complete simulation of a WMR on a fully 3D terrain has been a difficult problem to solve. Previous methods for continuous evolution of the WMR have only incorporated the wheel ground contact constraints within the DAE framework. This work goes beyond the previous methods by incorporating the quasi-static and friction cone constraints within the DAE framework. This evolution is now extended to a motion planning algorithm which guarantees that the vehicle traverses along quasi-static stable paths.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present our RS-SLAM algorithm for monocular camera where the proposal distribution is derived from the 5-point RANSAC algorithm and image feature measurement uncertainties instead of using the easily violated constant velocity model. We propose to do another RANSAC sampling within all the inliers that have the best RANSAC score to check for inlier misclassifications in the original correspondences and use all the hypotheses generated from these consensus sets in the proposal distribution. This is to mitigate data association errors (inlier misclassifications) caused by the observation that the consensus set from RANSAC that yields the highest score might not, in practice, contain all the true inliers due to noise on the feature measurements. Hypotheses which are less probable will eventually be eliminated in the particle filter resampling process. We also show in this paper that our monocular approach can be easily extended for stereo camera. Experimental results validate the potential of our approach.",

        "abstract": "We investigate mobile ad-hoc indoor networks consisting of simple inexpensive robots, LANdroids, with limited wireless communication range and without any range or location sensors. We focus on the problem of using the mobile LANdroids to take responsibility for maintaining connectivity between a static Gateway and mobile Targets that move beyond the communication range of an established network. We refer to such a tracking task as Target Tethering. This type of network commonly uses IEEE 802.11 wireless protocols for communication, with Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a measure of radio signal strength. RSSI data is noisy and poorly relates to distance in indoor environments, leading to a challenging Target Tethering task. Some algorithms use the trace of single-source RSSI data to infer distance between two nodes and use it to compute a Target Tethering policy. However, such distance estimates are poor. We instead aim at inferring physical network layout from RSSI data among multiple nodes. We introduce a novel approach based on Cluster Geometries, classes of network nodes corresponding to rotation-invariant physical layouts of LANdroids and a mobile Target, with the conjecture that multi-robot RSSI data can distinguish the Cluster Geometries and therefore the physical layouts. We proceed with extensive experiments and support our conjecture by showing successful classification of the designed Cluster Geometries given the multi-robot RSSI-based data. We then combine the estimated Geometries with motion patterns of the moving Targets to show that suitable multi-robot Target Tethering policies for unknown indoor environments can be learned using multi-agent reinforcement-learning. Specifically, we use an interesting variation of Q-learning where we first learn offline base policies in general open environments and later specialize the policies seamlessly during online execution to account for obstacles in the indoor environment.

We show that MTKM makes it particularly easy to solve non-trivial multi-sensor calibration problems while remaining generic enough to handle a very different class of problems, namely SLAM, as well: After an introductory example on single camera calibration we apply MTKM to calibration of stereo vision and IMU w.r.t. the kinematic chain of a service robot, RGB-D and accelerometer calibration of a Microsoft Kinect, stereo calibration on a Nao soccer robot, and several SLAM benchmark data sets illustrating MTKM's versatility.

The algorithm detects potential collisions within a cylindrical Safety Volume projected ahead of the UAV. This is done in a 3D occupancy map representation of the environment. An expanding elliptical search is performed to find an Escape Point; a waypoint which offers a collision free route past obstacles and towards a goal waypoint. An efficient occupied voxel checking technique is employed which approximates the Safety Volume by a series of spheres, and uses an approximate nearest neighbour search in a Bkd-tree representation of the occupied voxels. Tests show the algorithm can typically find an Escape Point in under 100 ms using onboard UAV processing for a cluttered environment with 20 000 occupied voxels. Successful collision avoidance results are presented from simulation experiments and from flights with an autonomous helicopter equipped with stereo and laser range sensors.",

This new technique is called B\u00e9zier Trajectory Deformation (BTD). The trajectory deformation is computed with a constrained optimization method (Lagrange Multipliers Theorem). A linear system is solved to achieve the result. As a consequence, the deformed trajectory is computed in a few milliseconds. In addition, the linear system can be solved offline if the B\u00e9zier curve order is maintained constant during the movement of the robot, which is the common case. This technique can be combined with any collision avoidance algorithm that produces a field of vectors. In particular, it has been developed for artificial potential field methods. BTD is combined with a recently proposed PF method, the Potential Field Projection method (PFP). The resulting technique is tested in dynamic environment showing its real-time performance and its efficacy for obstacle avoidance.",

We introduce three important novelties to the bag-of-words plus geometrical checking approach. We use FAST keypoints and BRIEF descriptors, which are binary and very fast to compute (less that 20\u00b5s per point). To perform image comparisons, we make use of a bag of words that discretises the binary descriptor space and an inverse index. We also introduce the use of a direct index to take advantage of the bag of words to obtain correspondence points between two images efficiently, avoiding a matching of complexity \u0398(n2). To detect loop closure candidates, we propose managing matches in groups to increase the reliability of the candidates returned by the bag of words. We present results in three real and public datasets, with 0.7\u20131.7 Km long trajectories. We obtain high precision and recall rates, spending 16 ms on average per image for the feature computation and the whole loop detection process in sequences with 19000 images, one order of magnitude less than other similar techniques.",

We improve the computational performance of the visual odometry by using the IMU readings to establish a 1-point RANSAC instead of using the standard 3-point RANSAC to estimate the relative motion between consecutive frames. We use local bundle adjustment to refine the pose estimates. At the same time, the MAV builds a 3D occupancy grid from range data, and transmits this grid together with images and pose estimates over a wireless network to a ground station. We propose a view-dependent projective texture mapping method that is used by the ground station to incrementally build a 3D textured occupancy grid over time. This map is both geometrically accurate and photo-realistic; the map provides real-time visual updates on the ground to a remote operator, and is used for path planning as well.",

The overhanging footstep is advantageous in terms of relaxation of restrictions on gait planning. However, in a man-made environment without geometry information, the overhanging footstep requires the estimation of the exact step-edge position in real-time. In this paper we propose a real-time method for estimating step edge positions using stereo images. We find a straight edge line, which divides a view area into two regions representing the upper and lower step-able planes at the target edge. The edge line is obtained by minimizing a cost function composed of pixel-value-difference images, which are computed from the two stereo images and the geometry parameters of the planes, estimated by an efficient direct method in high precision. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through online experiments using stereo cameras mounted on the body of a biped robot traversing real stairs.",

        "abstract": "We present a real-time self collision detection algorithm applicable for industrial and humanoid robots. The algorithm is based on computing the swept volumes of all bodies and checking them pairwise for collisions. The algorithm operates on joint angle intervals. Such, it does not only test a single or N intermediate configurations but assures safety of a whole movement. Key idea of the new swept volume computation is representing volumes as convex hulls extended by a buffer radius, so called sphere swept convex hulls (SSCH). This leads to tight and compact bounding volumes. The operation set available to model the different joints is strictly conservative and allows for a trade-off between accuracy and computation time. During a configurable timespan the algorithm updates a table of pairwise distances and thus can guarantee hard real-time. It is applied on DLR's humanoid Justin in a sports robotic scenario, where also accuracy and computational performance is evaluated (0.4ms, INTEL T2500@2GHz).",

The demonstration is run amidst live and running hydrocarbon processes and involves autonomous valve manipulation and thermal inspection operations. The valve manipulation operation involves sensor-based movements which implies that the robot trajectories have not been programmed a priori (off-line). In particular, an approach will be presented to sense and avoid over-tightening/loosening of the valve. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype is the first system that performs sensor-based close-contact operations in a real operational environment.",

Three wearable motion sensors are attached to the right thigh, the waist, and the right hand of a person, while an optical motion capture system is used to obtain his/her location information. A three-level dynamic Bayesian network is implemented to model the intra-temporal and inter-temporal constraints among the location, body activity and hand gesture. The body activity and hand gesture are estimated using a Bayesian filter and the short-time Viterbi algorithm, which reduces the storage memory and the computational complexity. We conducted experiments in a mock apartment environment and the obtained results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a nonlinear signal-processing scheme is developed for robotic systems that exploits a joint state-parameter formulation for simultaneous recursive estimation of the states (e.g. joint angles and rates) and uncertain parameters (e.g. inertial and friction parameters), out of noisy measurements (e.g. joint angles). Unscented Kalman filtering was employed to overcome restrictions such as linearity in the parameters and the need for availability of joint velocities and accelerations (present in linear recursive least square methods), and the linearization problems associated with extended Kalman filtering. Owing to the unscented transform concept which requires only input-output evaluations of the dynamic model, a more general and modular implementation is realizable. This allows for the utilization of computational modeling tools without the requirement of symbolically manipulating or deriving the equations of motion. Also, the recursive nature of the scheme allows for both offline processing and online implementation. The practical performance of the proposed scheme was verified through an experiment involving a five-bar linkage based haptic device configured to render a virtual box. The torque pair commands generated by the haptic controller to render the virtual box and the encoder angular measurements acquired through the experiment were processed twice in two different input-output directions: once, for state-parameter estimation of the robot; and, another time for identification of supposedly unknown environmental parameters. Results demonstrate successfulness of the scheme for recursive state-parameter estimation of the robot and the environment, as well as promising applicability in online settings.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Visual motion is a simple yet powerful cue widely used by biological systems to improve their perception and adaptation to the environment. Examples of tasks that greatly benefit from the ability to detect movement are object segmentation, 3D scene reconstruction and control of attention. In computer vision several algorithms for computing visual motion and optic flow exist. However their application in robotics is not straightforward as in these platforms visual motion is often dominated by (self) motion produced by the movement of the robot (egomotion) making it difficult to disambiguate between motion induced by the scene dynamics or by the own actions of the robot. Independent motion detection is an active field in computer vision and robotics, however approaches in this area typically require that some models of both the environment and the robot visual system are available and are hardly suitable for real-time control. In this paper we describe the motionCUT, a derivation of the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm that allows detecting moving objects, irrespectively of the egomotion produced by the robot. Our method is purely visual and does not require information other than the images coming from the cameras. As such it can be easily adapted to any robotic platform. The system was tested on a stereo tracking task on the iCub humanoid robot, demonstrating that the algorithm performs well and can easily execute in real-time.",

Such a force measurement system requires high accuracy and robustness considering the uncertainty in the construction machinery field, but it inevitably includes measurement errors owing to difficult-to-reduce modeling errors. Our framework thus adopts a relative accuracy improvement strategy without correcting the models for the practicality. It comprises (i) quantifying the internal error range (IER) by using the sum of the maximal measurement errors of static and dynamic friction forces, which change in postural and kinematic conditions, (ii) calculating the error force vector by using IER to select cylinders (sensors) that have less error, and (iii) outputting the front load vector using the cylinders whose error force vector is minimum. Experiments were conducted using an instrumented hydraulic arm. The results indicate that our framework can enhance the relative accuracy of external force measurement independently of various postural and kinematic conditions.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of provably safe navigation for a mobile robot with a limited field-of-view placed in a unknown dynamic environment. In such a situation, absolute motion safety (in the sense that no collision will ever take place whatever happens in the environment) is impossible to guarantee in general. It is therefore settled for a weaker level of motion safety dubbed passive motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision is inevitable, the robot will be at rest. The primary contribution of this paper is a relaxation of the Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS. A Braking ICS is a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the robot is, it is impossible to stop before a collision takes place. Braking ICS are designed with a passive motion safety perspective for robots with a limited field-of-view in unknown dynamic environments. Braking ICS are formally defined and a number of important properties are established. These properties are then used to design a Braking ICS checker, i.e. an algorithm that checks whether a given state is a Braking ICS or not. In a companion paper, it is shown how the Braking ICS checker can be integrated into a reactive navigation scheme whose passive motion safety is provably guaranteed.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the remote handling of microscale objects, between two sites approximately 630 km distant. To manipulate objects less than 10 \u00bfm, specific equipments such as AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) cantilevers integrated into a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) are generally required. Enabling remote access to such a system would benefit any micro/nanoresearcher. However, vision feedback and sensor data of a micromanipulation system are generally limited, hence the implementation of a teleoperation scenario is not straightforward. Specific tools are proposed here for an intuitive manipulation in a wide range of applications. To ensure ease of manipulation, both a 3D virtual representation of the scene and haptic feedback are provided. Force sensor feedback is limited since only two measures are available. In order to extend this information, vision algorithms are developed to estimate the respective positions of the tool and objects, which are then used to calculate the haptic feedback. The stability of the overall scheme is very sensitive to time delays. This requirement is taken into account in vision algorithms and the communication module which transfers the data between the two remote sites. In addition, the proposed robotic control architecture is modular so that the platform can be used for a wide range of applications. First results are obtained on a teleoperation between Paris, France, and Oldenburg, Germany.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of repairing previously computed plans for searching for an object. The object is sought with a 7 degrees of freedom mobile manipulator robot with an \u00bfeye-in-hand\u00bf sensor. The sensor is limited in both range and field of view. Our method computes a set of sensing configurations, which collectively cover the environment with the 3-D visibility region of the limited sensor. An order for visiting sensing configurations, which diminishes the expected value of the time for finding the object is generated. The search plan corresponds mainly to the set of sensing configurations to be visited and the order for visiting those configurations. In this paper, we show that whenever the environment changes locally our plan can also be repaired locally. We base our approach on a 3-D convex regions decomposition dividing the environment. The plan is repaired by generating a new sub-set of sensing configurations and a new order for visiting those configurations, only considering the convex regions related to the change in the map of the 3-D environment. We have implemented all our algorithms, and we present simulation results in realistic environments.",

        "abstract": "We propose a framework for the sensor-based estimation of manipulation-relevant object properties and the abstraction of known actions in a learning setup from the observation of humans. The descriptors consists of an object-centric representation of manipulation constraints and a scene-specific action graph. The graph spans between the typical places, where objects are placed. This framework allows to abstract the strongly varying actions of a human operator and to monitor unexpected new actions, that require a modification of the knowledge stored in the system. The usage of an abstract, object-centric structure enables not only the application of knowledge in the same situation, but also the transfer to similar environments. Furthermore, the information can be derived from different sensing modalities. The proposed system builds up the representation of manipulation-relevant properties and actions. The properties, which are directly related to the object, are stored in the Object Container. The Functionality Map links the actions with the typical action areas in the environment. We present experimental results on real human actions, showing the quality of the results, that can be obtained with our system.",

        "abstract": "Most of today's robotic task descriptions are designed for a single software and hardware platform and thus can not be reused without modifications. This work follows the meta-model approach of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) to introduce the concepts of Domain Specific Languages (DSL) and of Model Transformations to the domain of hybrid force-velocity controlled robot tasks, as expressed in (i) the Task Frame formalism (TFF), and (ii) a Statechart model representing the discrete coordination between TFF tasks. The result is a representation in MDE's M0, M1, M2 and M3 form, with increasingly robot and software independent representations, that do remain instantaneously executable, except obviously for the M3 metametamodel. The Platform Specific Model information can be added in three steps: (i) the type of the hybrid force-velocity controlled task, (ii) the hardware properties of the robot, tool and sensor, and (iii) the software properties of the applied execution framework. We demonstrate the presented approach by means of an alignment task executed on a Willow Garage PR2 and a KUKA Light Weight Robot (LWR) arm.",

        "abstract": "The success of swarm behaviors often depends on the range at which robots can communicate and the speed at which they change their behavior. Challenges arise when the communication range is too small with respect to the dynamics of the robot, preventing interactions from lasting long enough to achieve coherent swarming. To alleviate this dependency, most swarm experiments done in laboratory environments rely on communication hardware that is relatively long range and wheeled robotic platforms that have omnidirectional motion. Instead, we focus on deploying a swarm of small fixed-wing flying robots. Such platforms have limited payload, resulting in the use of short-range communication hardware. Furthermore, they are required to maintain forward motion to avoid stalling and typically adopt low turn rates because of physical or energy constraints. The tradeoff between communication range and flight dynamics is exhaustively studied in simulation in the scope of Reynolds flocking and demonstrated with up to 10 robots in outdoor experiments.",

A variety of beat tracking systems have been previously developed, but for the most part they are optimized for direct audio input (no acoustic channel and no noise). The presence of an acoustic channel and noise typically degrades performance substantially. A robot's motors, in particular, create nonstationary noise that can be difficult for a beat detection system to accommodate, Using an algorithm previously developed by the authors, we explore techniques for reducing the effects of the acoustic channel and noise on the system, enabling a humanoid to robustly follow music under realistic conditions.",

        "abstract": "The present paper integrates a computational model of human hand trajectory generation in the virtual curing into a robotic rehabilitation system for upper limbs to assist and teach smooth movements depending on task conditions. In training, a trainee manipulates the handle of an impedance-controlled robot to move a virtual stone to the center of a circular target on the ice while predicting transient behaviors of the released stone. A reference hand motion is clarified through a set of preliminary experiments with well-trained subjects for different task conditions and computationally expressed in the framework of a minimum jerk model with task-related constraints. Training experiments with novice healthy volunteers demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach that presents the reference motion produced by the computational model to a trainee in assisting and training the smoothness of hand movements.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to increase the amount of visual stimuli in sensor measurements using saliency maps. A saliency map is a combination of normalized feature maps in different channels (i.e. color, intensity) to represent the relative strength of visual stimuli in an image. The total saliency is higher when the camera is looking at a scene with more interesting things in the field of view and vise versa. We employ methods of extremum seeking control to find a camera position that corresponds to local maximum saliency value. We combine the global properties of simplex optimization methods with the local search properties and dynamic response of extremum seeking control to create a novel algorithm that is more likely to find a global maximum than conventional extremum seeking control. Simulations and experiments are presented to show the strength of this approach.",

It combines binocular visual and inertial cues in a tightly-coupled fashion and operates in real time on an embedded platform. An extended Kalman filter fuses measurements and makes motion estimation rely more on inertial data if visual feature constellation is degenerate. Errors in roll and pitch are bounded implicitly by the gravity vector. Inertial sensors are used for efficient outlier detection and enable operation in poorly and repetitively textured environments. We demonstrate robustness and accuracy in an industrial scenario as well as in general indoor environments. The former is accompanied by a detailed performance evaluation supported with ground truth measurements from an external tracking system.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating on line the nonlinear stiffness of flexible transmissions in robot joints, with special reference to actuation devices with adjustable stiffness in serial configuration. These joints are characterized by a principal motor for controlling the link motion and secondary motor for adjusting the stiffness. In this actuation configuration, the flexible transmission undergoes relatively small deformations and the stiffness estimation problem is more challenging due to poor excitation conditions. We improve our previous general approach, combining a residual-based flexibility torque estimator that uses also a kinematic Kalman filter to handle discretization and quantization errors with an enhanced recursive least squares algorithm that does not suffer from lack of persistent excitation. As a result, stiffness is estimated in a more robust way using only position measurements on the motor sides and motor dynamic parameters. The performance of the proposed estimation method is illustrated through simulations and experiments on the AwAS joint developed at IIT.",

        "abstract": "Affine-invariant feature matching plays an important role in many robot vision applications, such as robot visual navigation, object detection, visual tracking and visual SLAM, etc. In the early stages, invariant keypoints are used to detect the affine transformation. But the accuracy is very low. In recent years, some people introduce SIFT method into robot vision field, which greatly enhances the accuracy. But it is too time-consuming to meet the requirements of real-time robot vision applications. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based feature matching approach to address the problem. First, it uses a fast algorithm to extract keypoints. Then, our method identifies keypoints that belong to different objects or background by color and texture representation. The keypoints are clustered into corresponding groups. At last, a two-stage multilayer ferns classifier is trained to recognize the local patches and get the estimate of viewpoint. We test our approach on public datasets and apply it in a visual SLAM application. The result demonstrates that our method can provide robust and powerful matching ability. Even on some difficult matching cases, it also performs remarkably well. Further more, because there is no need to compute descriptors for the image, our method is very fast at run-time.",

Visual information is one of the fundamental components for reliable grasping and manipulation by a multi-fingered hand-arm system. However, in case that visual information such as position and attitude of an object comes to be unavailable due to the occlusion or if the object goes out-of-sight temporarily, unstable and unfavorable behavior is often induced. The proposed method, which utilizes the stable grasping control and the concept of virtual frame, enables to grasp and manipulate an object stably even if the visual information becomes suddenly and temporarily unavailable during manipulation. Firstly, a dynamical model of object grasping using a multi-fingered hand-arm system is formulated. Next, a new control scheme for robust object grasping and manipulation using the virtual frame is proposed. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the usefulness of the proposed method.",

To improve the obstacle clearance capability, a method dealing with the contact stability optimization is developed. A specific stability criterion taking the friction into account is proposed. The optimization algorithm uses both the kinematic redundancy in order to modify the position of the Center of Mass (CoM), modifying the resulting distribution of contact forces, and the actuation redundancy to improve the stability of frictional contacts by adapting the internal forces. We show that the choice of this particular criterion allows us to maximize the robustness of contacts stability relatively to the modeling errors affecting force control (friction in mechanical transmission). Performances of this algorithm are evaluated in simulation and the necessity for a CoM trajectory planning is highlighted by an analysis of obstacle crossing using this criterion.",

        "abstract": "To enable the creation of manual interaction databases, aiding the replication of dexterous capabilities with anthropomorphic robot hands by utilizing information about how humans perform complex manipulation tasks, requires the capability to record and analyze large amounts of manual interaction sequences. For this goal we have studied and compared three mappings from captured human hand motion data to a simulated model, which allow for robust and accurate real-time hand posture tracking. We evaluate the effectiveness of these mappings and discuss their pros and cons in various real-world scenarios. The first method is based on data glove data and aims for direct gaging of hand joints. The other two methods utilize a VICON motion tracking system which monitors markers placed on all finger segments. Here we compare two approaches: a direct computation of hand postures from angles between adjacent markers and an iterative inverse kinematics approach to optimally reproduce fingertip positions. For a quantitative evaluation, we employ a \u201ccalibration objects\u201d technique to obtain a reliable ground truth of task-relevant hand posture data.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces new strategies for fluid-based manipulation of micro-scale objects using rotating magnetic micro-robots at low Reynolds numbers. By rapidly spinning the micro-robots, rotational fluid flow is induced which acts to move the micro-objects by fluidic drag. Acting in parallel, teams of these micro-robots are shown to work together to rapidly move micro-objects along planned \u201cvirtual channel\u201ds to goal positions. As the micro-robots are themselves highly mobile, the manipulation trajectories are controlled to achieve accurate, fast manipulation of multiple micro-objects in 2-D environments. Experiments are performed in a viscous oil (50 cSt) to simulate the physics of micro-robots which are small enough to fit through small micro-fluidic channels or blood capillaries. The micro-robot and micro-object motions are characterized to support the proposed strategies. Spherical micro-robots 380\u00b5m in diameter are used to manipulate 200\u00b5m diameter particles with controllable speeds of up to 3.5 mm/s.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the online calibration of an asynchronous microphone array for robots. Conventional microphone array technologies require a lot of measurements of transfer functions to calibrate microphone locations, and a multi-channel A/D converter for inter-microphone synchronization. We solve these two problems using a framework combining Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and beamforming in an online manner. To do this, we assume that estimations of microphone locations, a sound source location, and microphone clock difference correspond to mapping, self-localization, observation errors in SLAM, respectively. In our framework, the SLAM process calibrates locations and clock differences of microphones every time a microphone array observes a sound like a human's clapping, and a beamforming process works as a cost function to decide the convergence of calibration by localizing the sound with the estimated locations and clock differences. After calibration, beamforming is used for sound source localization. We implemented a prototype system using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based SLAM and Delay-and-Sum Beamforming (DS-BF). The experimental results showed that microphone locations and clock differences were estimated properly with 10\u201315 sound events (handclaps), and the error of sound source localization with the estimated information was less than the grid size of beamforming, that is, the lowest error was theoretically attained.",

Namely, it is impossible to move toward omni-direction due to the constraints by wheel's mechanical structure. Omni-directional movement means the mobility can move toward any direction at anytime. This paper adapted link-driven spherical wheel as an omnidirectional wheel and solved singularity problem caused by mechanical structure of it. We developed omni-directional mobilities( SO(2) and SO(3)) installing link-driven spherical wheels and experimented omni-directional movement with designed controllers.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a motion planning algorithm for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The proposed algorithm not only addresses Hazard Avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the \u201cstand-on\u201d vessel to maneuver. The three primary COLREGS rules were considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obey COLREGS. Note also that if other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV will still apply its HA algorithms to avoid a collision. The proposed approach is based on Velocity Obstacles, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because Velocity Obstacles also specify which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space very naturally. The algorithm is demonstrated via both simulation and on-water tests.",

Experiments demonstrate that our planner finds a fast initial path and decreases the cost of this path iteratively. We identify and address the limitations of RRT* in high-dimensional configuration spaces. We introduce a sampling bias to facilitate and accelerate cost decrease in these spaces and a simple node-rejection criteria to increase efficiency. Finally, we incorporate an existing bi-directional approach to search which decreases the time to find an initial path. We analyze our planner on a simple 2D navigation problem in detail to show its properties and test it on a difficult 7D manipulation problem to show its effectiveness. Our results consistently demonstrate improved performance over RRT*.",

The first mechanism uses ankles with roll and yaw flexures and a compliant structure behind the adhesive material to achieve approximately uniform pressures under nominal loading conditions on flat and curved surfaces. The second design uses a tendon-supported structure to achieve uniform loading and prevent premature peeling failures despite significant misalignment with a flat wall surface. The two designs are demonstrated on Stickybot III, an approximately 1 kg climbing robot, and can be scaled to larger areas and loads by tiling the basic structure.",

Inspired by biological systems, we seek to achieve this through large compliances in the joints which enable natural dynamics, allow temporary energy storage, and improve the passive adaptability. A sophisticated chain and cable pulley design minimizes the segment masses, places the overall CoG close to the hip joint, and maximizes the range of motion. Nonlinearities in the damping and an appropriate low-level controller allow for precise torque control during stance and for fast task space position control during swing. This paved the road for the combined application of a virtual model controller for ground contact and a modified Raibert style controller for flight phase which was successfully tested in planar running.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of searching for an unknown number of static targets inside an assigned area. The search problem is tackled using Probabilisitic Quadtrees (PQ), a data structure we recently introduced. Probabilistic quadtrees allow for a variable resolution representation and naturally induce a search problem where the searcher needs to choose not only where to sense, but also the sensing resolution. Through a Bayesian approach accommodating faulty sensors returning both false positives and missed detections, a posterior distribution about the location of the targets is propagated during the search effort. In this paper we extend our previous findings by considering the problem of searching for an unknown number of targets. Moreover, we substitute our formerly used heuristic with an approach based on information gain and expected costs. Finally, we provide some convergence results showing that in the worst case our model provides the same results as uniform grids, thus guaranteeing that the representation we propose gracefully degrades towards a known model. Extensive simulation results substantiate the properties of the method we propose, and we also show that our variable resolution method outperforms traditional methods based on uniform resolution grids.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to self calibrate the extrinsic parameters of a camera mounted on a mobile robot in the context of fusion with the odometry sensor. Calibrating precisely such a system can be difficult if the camera is mounted on a vehicle where the frame is difficult to localize precisely (like on a car for example). However, the knowledge of the camera pose in the robot frame is essential in order to make a consistent fusion of the sensor measurements. Our approach is based on a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework: the estimation of the parameters is made when the robot moves in an unknown environment which is only viewed by the camera. First, a study of the observability properties of the system is made in order to characterize conditions that its inputs have to satisfy to make the calibration process possible. Then, we show on a real experiment with an omnidirectional camera the validity of the conditions and the quality of the estimation of the 3D pose of the camera with respect to the odometry frame.",

        "abstract": "We present an algorithm that, given any target tree, synthesizes reversible self-assembly rules that provide a maximum yield in the sense of stochastic stability. If the reversibility constraint is relaxed then the same algorithm can be trivially modified so that it converges to a maximum yield almost surely. The proof of correctness in both cases relies on the notion of a completing rule. We examine the conservatism of this technique by considering its implications for the internal states of the system. We show by example that any algorithm that guarantees the existence of a completing rule for all target trees will, for some cases, (1) produce complete assemblies with non-unique internal states, or (2) produce internal states that cannot be recovered from the unlabeled graph.",

In contrast to self-assembly at the nano and micro scales where abundant building blocks are available, modular robotic systems need to self-assemble from a limited number of modules. In particular, when self-assembly is used for reconfiguration, it is desirable that the new conformation includes all of the available modules. We propose a suite of algorithms that (1) generate a reversible graph grammar, i.e., generates rules for a desired structure that allow the structure not only to assemble, but also to disassemble, and (2) have a set of structures that are growing in parallel converge to a single structure using broadcast communication. We show that by omitting a reversal rule for the last attached module, self-assembly eventually completes, and that communication can drastically speed up this process.",

The author clarified that the former is unstable and the latter is marginally stable, and that the state error norm tends to increase during the stance phases and decreases during the collision phases. The convergence property is, however, complicated and the overall self-stabilization mechanism is still unclear. This paper then investigates it from the mechanical energy point of view. First, we introduce the linearized mechanical energy that leads to the linearized dynamic equation of the compass-like biped robot, and numerically show that its error norm almost monotonically converges to zero. Second, we numerically show that the monotonic convergence comes from the fact that the error of the angular positions is one digit smaller than that of the angular velocities by using approximate difference functions that varies depending on the slope.",

The kinematic parameters are estimated in real-time using two cascaded estimators in order to tune a cooperative controller to achieve accurate motion tracking with minimum-norm actuation force. Hence, no force measurement is required to deal with kinematic uncertainties of interconnected robotic system. The stability of the entire real-time estimator/controller system is systematically investigated. The results show that the convergence and stability of the adaptive control process can be ensured if the direction of angular velocity of the object does not remain constant over time. Experimental results demonstrate that even small error in relative position/orientation of two cooperative manipulators can give rise to tracking errors of a conventional inverse dynamic controller while the self-tuning cooperative controller is capable of significantly reducing the tracking errors.",

In this paper, we study the control problem of a semi-autonomous teleoperation system, where the redundant slave robot can autonomously satisfy several constraints while tracking the position of the master robot in the task space. Considering heterogeneous master and slave robots, we first develop a control algorithm to ensure task space position and velocity tracking between the master and slave robots in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and communication delays. The redundancy of the slave robot is then utilized for achieving sub-task control, such as singularity avoidance, joint limits, and collision avoidance. The control algorithms for the proposed semi-autonomous teleoperation system are validated using numerical simulations on a non-redundant master and a redundant slave robot.",

Because of the difficulty of using conventional surgical tools, such exploration is needed in minimally-invasive treatments of \u00bfparticle diseases,\u00bf which commonly result from material wear in total hip replacements. Since a geometric model of the osteolytic cavity is not always available, the planner relies only on a robot model that can detect collisions. As such, the planner can work in conjunction with real systems. The planner effectively combines global and local exploration. The global layer determines which regions to explore, while local exploration uses information gain to move the robot tip to positions in the region that increase exploration. Simulation experiments are conducted using a snake-like cannula robot on surgically-relevant osteolytic cavities. As desired in minimally-invasive treatment of osteolysis, performance is measured as the volume explored by the robot tip. The proposed method achieves 83-92% performance rate when compared to methods that require 3D models of osteolytic cavities. Comparisons to sensor-based related work (i.e., no 3D models) show significant improvements in performance.",

Typically, dance relies on the capability that human beings have to synchronize their movements rhythmically to music. In this work, we propose a music-driven approach to enable mobile robots to dance to a given music. We focus on the automatic generation of paths such that robots jointly performs a choreography guided by a song. Although dancing ability of a real person is complex and hard to accomplish, in this paper we aim to associate the robot motion to music and to emulate this typical human activity. We propose a variability function for evaluating the relevance of a block (set of notes) in a particular song, and based on those results, similar blocks are clustered. Finally, we generate customized paths for robots considering the current sound (note) being played and the importance of the block to which this note belongs. We have tested this approach with real robots (e-puck) using different kinds of songs. Results from those experiments indicate that robots can achieve good choreographic performance even if dance steps are automatically generated without previous knowledge of the song style.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the problems are discussed for shape design and position arrangement for Water Strider Robot's supporting legs are discussed. A supporting leg is approached as Euler-Bernoulli elastic curved beam and a method for designing its optimal shape is proposed by analysing elastic deformation and stress-strain. The objective of the proposed optimal method is to attain the maximum lift force in leg operation. The effectiveness and validity of design results are verified through simulations and lab experiments. A method for properly locating supporting legs on the robot body is proposed by analysing the influence of leg location to lift force and the relationship of supporting legs' with robot's roll-resistant capability. A layout scheme for the Water Dancer II-a prototype with ten supporting legs is presented with its operation successful designed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a filtering method for estimating the shape and end effector pose of a highly articulated surgical snake robot. Our algorithm introduces new kinematic models that are used in the prediction step of an extended Kalman filter whose update step incorporates measurements from a 5-DOF electromagnetic tracking sensor situated at the distal end of the robot. A single tracking sensor is sufficient for estimating the shape of the system because the robot is inherently a follow-the-leader mechanism with well defined motion characteristics. We therefore show that, with appropriate steering motion, the state of the filter is fully observable. The goal of our shape estimation algorithm is to create a more accurate and representative 3D rendered visualization for image-guided surgery.We demonstrate the feasibility of our method with results from an animal experiment in which our shape and pose estimate was used as feedback in a control scheme that semi-autonomously drove the robot along the epicardial surface of a porcine heart.",

        "abstract": "Object recognition and especially object class recognition is and will be a key capability in home robotics when robots have to tackle manipulation tasks and grasp new objects or just have to search for objects. The goal is to have a robot classify 'never before seen objects' at first occurrence in a single view in a fast and robust manner. The classification task can be seen as a matching problem, finding the most appropriate 3D model and view with respect to a given depth image. We introduce a single-view shape model based classification approach using RGB-D sensors and a novel matching procedure for depth image to 3D model matching leading inherently to object classification. Utilizing the inter-view similarity of the 3D models for enhanced matching, the average precision of our descriptors is increased of up to 15% resulting in high classification accuracy. The presented adaptation of 3D shape descriptors to 2.5D data enables us to calculate the features in real time, directly from the 3D points of the sensor, without any calculation of normals or generating a mesh from it which is typical of state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-automatic, user-centric approach to utilize the Internet for acquiring the required training data in the form of 3D models which significantly reduces the time for teaching new categories.",

The robot hand is constructed as a planar hook so that the contact point about which the robot swings is a passive hinge. We identify the 10 most relevant degrees of freedom for this underactuated mechanical system and formulate a tractable search: (a) introduce a family of coordination patterns to be enforced on the dynamics with respect to a path coordinate; (b) formulate geometric equality constraints that are necessary for periodic locomotion; (c) generate trajectories from integrable reduced dynamics associated with the passive hinge; (d) evaluate the energetic cost of transport. Moreover, we observe that a linear approximation of the reduced dynamics can be used for trajectory generation which allows us to incorporate the gradient of the cost function into the search algorithm.",

Experimental results shows that the proposed shooting manipulation system has excellent basic performances such as high motion straightness of a reaching path, quickness in a turning motion, and high reaching accuracy in spite of its simplicity. Furthermore, we show that, by making full use of the basic performances of the proposed system, it is possible to realize a quick capturing of a falling object 0.7[m] away with a high success rate of 92 percents.",

A human walking experiment is analyzed and mathematical functions on the kinematics of the collected data are found which capture some of the fundamental behaviors associated with human walking. One model is considered in which these behaviors are fully tracked using feedback linearization; the intent of this is to simulate healthy human walking. Then, a second model is considered: this model is assumed to be a human with a transfemoral prosthesis; PD control is used on the prosthesis. All models considered demonstrate locally exponentially stable periodic orbits when simulated for four separate test subjects, or, in other words, the models exhibit stable walking even with a prosthetic lower extremity.

To track the location of the subject in motion, a method for monitoring the velocity of a reference root point on the subject is proposed. Velocity from lower limb kinematics and the integration of accelerations are fused through Kalman Filters to achieve smooth, accurate and drift free estimation results. Using this velocity estimation and lower limb kinematics, the spatial location of the subject can be calculated. Based on some preliminary experimental results of walking motion, the RMS error within 0.48% of the velocity is achieved with respect to the commercial optical motion capture system, Motion Analysis. The localization results from the proposed method also tally well with the references. Motions like walking, jumping, running and one leg jumping are properly captured with this self-contained system. Compared with the lab-based systems, since this system does not depend on external devices and has little constraint to the human movements, it can show advantage in everyday practice and sport training in large area or home environments.",

Often these parameters are subject to variations that depend either on environmental changes or on the wear of the devices. In this paper, we propose an approach to simultaneously estimate a map of the environment, the position of the on-board sensors of the robot, and its kinematic parameters. Our method requires no prior knowledge about the environment and relies only on a rough initial guess of the platform parameters. The proposed approach performs on-line estimation of the parameters and it is able to adapt to non-stationary changes of the configuration. We tested our approach in simulated environments and on a wide range of real world data using different types of robotic platforms.",

Low level features such as image corners suffer from occlusion boundaries, ambiguous data association, imaging artifacts, and viewpoint dependance. Artificial landmarks are an unsatisfactory alternative because they must be placed in the environment solely for the robot's benefit. Human environments contain many objects which can serve as suitable landmarks for robot navigation such as signs, objects, and furniture. Maps based on high level features which are identified by a learned classifier could better inform tasks such as semantic mapping and mobile manipulation. In this paper we present a technique for recognizing door signs using a learned classifier as one example of this approach, and demonstrate their use in a graphical SLAM framework with data association provided by reasoning about the semantic meaning of the sign.",

These manipulators are geometrically characterized by the fact that the moving triangle is the image of the base triangle by an indirect isometry. We introduce a specific coordinate system adapted to this geometric feature and which is also well adapted to the splitting of the DKP. This allows us to obtain easily precise descriptions of the singularities and of the cusp edges. These latter second order singularities are important for nonsingular assembly mode changing. We show how to sort assembly modes and use this sorting for motion planning in the joint space.",

This problem arises with the adoption of tactile systems with a large number of sensors, and it is particularly critical in those cases in which the system is made of flexible material that is deployed on a curved surface. In this scenario the location of each taxel is partially unknown and difficult to determine manually. Placing the device is in fact an inaccurate procedure that is affected by displacements in both position and orientation. Our approach is based on the idea that it is possible to automatically infer the position of the taxels by measuring the interaction forces exchanged between the sensorized part and the environment. The location of the contact is estimated through force/torque (F/T) measures gathered by a sensor mounted on the kinematic chain of the robot. Our method requires few hypotheses and can be effectively implemented on a real platform, as demonstrated by the experiments with the iCub humanoid robot.",

However, only seven of these discrete operating modes are considered both functional and unique. Accordingly, we use a seven-mode sliding controller that minimizes the position error using modes that have both the necessary and sufficient amounts of drive energy and, thus, involve reduced switching activity. An analysis of the closed-loop system stability is carried out. The performance of the proposed control design is experimentally verified on a single pneumatic actuator comprising of two chambers driven by four on/off solenoid valves.",

We verify the capability of smart manipulation of multiple bacteria-driven microobjects based on bacterial autonomous movement by using micro/nano pipettes instead of a guiderobot. For the fabrication of the guiderobot and the cargo driven by the bacteria, the fabrication of the arbitrarily-shaped microobjects using photo lithography technique is demonstrated. Additionally, we demonstrate the remote control using optical tweezers and driving using flagellated bacteria of the fabricated arbitrarily-shaped microobjects.",

This paper proposes a snake-like active wheel robot named \u201cACM-R4.1\u201d with torque sensor and torque limiter on each of the joints. Introduced torque sensor is composed of 2 thin ring plates holding steel balls in the oval cavities in between and a rubber ring producing compressing force of the thin ring plates in the narrow gap of a joint. Applied torque of the joint produces small sliding motion of the ball inside oval cavities and thus measurement of the small displacement of these plates enable to detect the applied torque. Overload-protection to the joint actuator is made by the sliding motion of the rubber which acts after the ball motion in the cavities and they hit the end of cavities. We made theoretical consideration of design of the torque sensor and did torque measurement experiments by using constructed snake-like active wheel robot ACM-R4.1. We also demonstrated the terrain adaptive motion of ACM-R4.1 by using the torque sensors.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a curvature sensor composed of a thin, transparent elastomer film (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) embedded with a microchannel of conductive liquid (eutectic Gallium Indium, eGaIn) and a sensing element. Bending the sensor exerts pressure on the embedded microchannel via the sensing element. Deformation of the cross-section of the microchannel leads to a change in electrical resistance. We demonstrate the functionality of the sensor through testing on a finger joint. The film is wrapped around a finger with the sensing element positioned on top of the knuckle. Finger bending both stretches the elastomer and exerts pressure on the sensing element, leading to an enhanced change in the electrical resistance. Because the sensor is soft (elastic modulus E ~ 1 MPa) and stretchable (>350%), it conforms to the host bending without interfering with the natural mechanics of motion. This sensor represents the first use of liquid-embedded elastomer electronics to monitor human or robotic motion.",

This valve is then used to build actuators for a soft robot. The developed EPM valves require only a brief (5 ms) pulse of current to turn flow on or off for an indefinite period of time. EPMvalves are characterized and demonstrated to be well suited for the control of elastomer fluidic actuators. The valves drive the pressurization and depressurization of fluidic channels within soft actuators. Furthermore, the forward locomotion of a soft, multi-actuator rolling robot is driven by EPM valves. The small size and energy-efficiency of EPM valves may make them valuable in soft mobile robot applications.",

We construct a graph such that the vertices correspond to feasible beamlets and the edges between beamlets capture not only distance information but directionality as well. The A* algorithm incorporated with new heuristic and cost function is implemented such that the curvature of the computed path can be constrained a priori.

In this paper, a new spectral weighting GCC-PHAT method is proposed to deal with noise. Furthermore, the time difference feature of sound source and its spatial distribution are analyzed. Based on prosperities of the distribution, a space grid matching (SGM) algorithm is proposed for localization step, which handles those problems that geometric positioning method faces effectively. Decision tree and valid feature detection algorithm are also proposed to reduce computational complexity and improve performance. Experiments are achieved in real environments on a mobile robot platform, in which 2016 sets of speech data are tested using four microphones in 3D space. More than 95% azimuth localization rate with error less than 5 degrees and approximate 90% horizontal distance localization rate are obtained.",

Space-filling trees are analogous to space-filling curves, but have a branching, tree-like structure, and are defined by an incremental process that results in a tree for which every point in the space has a finite-length path that converges to it. In contrast to space-filling curves, individual paths in the tree are short, allowing any part of the space to be quickly reached from the root. We compare some basic constructions of space-filling trees to Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), which underlie a number of popular algorithms used for sampling-based motion planning. We characterize several key tree properties related to path quality and the overall efficiency of exploration and conclude with a number of open mathematical questions.",

        "abstract": "Background: Upper limb weakness is the primary concern of tetraplegic individuals who have sustained incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), to an extent that it is considered more important than standing abilities. Recent evidence of the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord that can be enhanced by repeated practice- such as that available with robotic devices- suggest that robotic training of upper limbs can be beneficial to persons with SCI. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate an innovative rehabilitation technique using the RiceWrist, a newly developed robotic device, for a person with tetraplegia. A 24-year-old male with incomplete SCI at the C4 level, 6.5 months post-injury participated in 10 sessions of robotic training over 2 weeks. Variability of movement trajectory (spatial) and the time to complete (temporal) simple point-to-point wrist and forearm movements were collected before and after training completion to determine skill acquisition. The participant successfully completed 10 sessions of robotic training. While there were minimal changes in variability of movement trajectory, great improvements were observed for the average movement time for the majority of wrist and forearm movements. Overall, results suggest that the RiceWrist robotic device could be used for upper-limb rehabilitation and can potentially serve as an assessment tool for the SCI population.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of navigating a heavyweight robot autonomously across unstructured environments. The data of a 3D laser range finder are partitioned in real time into equidistant grid cells to locate obstacles and to classify the negotiability of the surface terrain. In addition to the distinction between obstacles or free space, ground measurements are examined to determine the local terrain roughness for each cell. We present a novel path planning algorithm operating on these classified grid cells. The algorithm is able to avoid positive and negative obstacles (cells without ground measurements), as well as regarding the roughness of the terrain. By applying a cost function, the robot is able to prefer routes across smooth terrain, like streets or trails, over routes across rough and muddy areas. We can determine the necessarily free terrain cells for each spline in the forefront because the splines and the dimensions of the robot are set. In this way we can access the resulting spline templates during runtime and connect them very fast for the path planning. The key feature of this approach is the low computation cost compared to existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "In the case of some physically weak persons such as elderly persons, the environment perception ability is sometimes deteriorated also. To assist the daily living motion of those people, power-assist robots with the perception-assist have been proposed. The power-assist robot with the perception-assist assists not only the user's motion but also the user's interaction with an environment, by applying the modification force to the user's motion if it is necessary. In the case of lower-limb motion, the walking is the very important motion for a person to achieve daily activities. Some elderly persons might stumble on the bump and fall down in the stairs because they might not be able to lift own lower-limb well and/or recognize stairs correctly. In this paper, specifically, the stairs-ascending/descending assist for a lower-limb power-assist robot is proposed to prevent the user from falling down in stairs. ZMP of the user is taken into account in the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated by the performing experiments.",

        "abstract": "Active compensation of physiological tremor for handheld micromanipulators depends on fast control and actuation responses. Because of real-world latencies, real-time compensation is usually not completely effective at eliminating unwanted hand motion. By modeling tremor, more effective cancellation is possible by anticipating future hand motion. We propose a feedforward control strategy that utilizes tremor velocity from a state-estimating Kalman filter. We demonstrate that estimating hand motion in a feedforward controller overcomes real-world latencies in micromanipulator actuation. In hold-still tasks with a fully handheld micromanipulator, the proposed feedforward approach improves tremor rejection by over 50%.",

        "abstract": "We present a comparison of methods to estimate the shape and orientation of a locomoting snake robot by fusing the robot's redundant internal proprioceptive sensors using and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). All of the estimators used in this work represent the shape of the snake with gait parameters to reduce the complexity of the robot configuration space. The compared approaches for representing shape and pose of the snake robot differ primarily in the use of a body frame fixed to the pose of a single module versus one that is aligned with the virtual chassis. Additionally, we evaluate a state representation that explicitly tracks joint angles for improved estimates. For one particular gait, rolling, we present experimental data where motion capture data of the snake robot is used as ground truth to compare the accuracy of the state estimates from these techniques. We show that using the virtual chassis body frame, rather than a fixed body frame, results in improved accuracy of the snake robot's estimated pitch and roll. We also show that, in general, representing the robot's shape with gait parameters is sufficient to accurately estimated shape and pose, though it can be improved upon in specific cases by explicitly modeling joint angles.",

In modeling the McKibben pneumatic actuator, we concentrated on its dynamic characteristics.We applied the actuator model to a simple robot model and analyzed the stability of the motions generated by the actuators. From the stability analysis results, we found that the stability of the constant posture is satisfied by the static and dynamic characteristics of the McKibben pneumatic actuator.",

The calibration is done in an iterative three-step process, based on static robot poses. In the first step the kinematics and stiffnesses of the flexible components are calibrated. Second the models of the integrated torque sensors are identified in a linear least square solution. In the third step the masses, the centers of gravity and the torque sensor offsets are estimated using linear regression. The calibration steps are repeated stepwise to account for their dependencies. The calibration procedure is simulated and experimentally performed with the medical lightweight robot MIRO of the German Aerospace Center. Through the iterative procedure the pose accuracy improves from about 5mm translational error and 2.5 \u00b0 rotational error to 1mm and 0.3 \u00b0 regarding the entire workspace.",

To enable a robot to navigate solely using visual cues it receives from a stereo camera, the depth information needs to be extracted from the image pairs and combined into a common representation. The initially determined raw depthmaps are fused into a two level heightmap representation which contains a floor and a ceiling height level. To reduce the noise in the height maps we employ a total variation regularized energy functional. With this 2.5D representation of the scene the computational complexity of the energy optimization is reduced by one dimension in contrast to other fusion techniques that work on the full 3D space such as volumetric fusion. While we show only results for indoor environments the approach can be extended to generate heightmaps for outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a solution and experimental results for real-time control of manipulation tasks considering the alignment of a robots end effector relative to some reference. The developed controller is applicable to industrial manipulators and is based on the pseudoinverse redundancy resolution method. The application considered is the employment of two industrial robots in an offshore remote inspection and maintenance system. A leader robot is controlled freely from onshore, and a follower robot uses an attached camera to provide the onshore operator with live video feed of the ongoing operation. Robot manipulators constitute flexible camera platforms, compared to e.g. simple pan/tilt units, for monitoring offshore operations. We develop a controller for the follower robot such that automatic camera tracking is achieved using pseudoinverse redundancy resolution control. A minimal task space parametrization relying on stereographic projection is constructed which achieves relative end effector alignment tracking without introducing representational or algorithmic singularities. It is shown that singular configurations will only in special cases affect the closed loop behavior. The controller is applicable to tasks such as spray painting or polishing on curved surfaces. The control approach is experimentally validated on two Kuka KR-16 industrial robot manipulators.",

        "abstract": "In ankle-foot prostheses a serial spring can assist the motor to reduce peak power (PP) and energy requirements (ER) during locomotion. Similar benefits can be expected for an active knee prosthesis. We compare the situation of a direct drive with a series elastic actuator optimized for minimal ER or for minimal PP. The simulations indicate that at the knee joint a serial spring can highly reduce ER and PP in running and fast walking. Around preferred walking speed (1.3m/s) only a reduction in ER is found. The optimal stiffness changes with speed and gait. Still it is possible to use one constant stiffness for a huge range of walking and running speeds with only moderate increases of ER and PP in comparison to speed and gait optimized values.",

S. marcescens type bacteria attach in small numbers to the surfaces of spherical microbeads. Given a small number of attached bacteria, generally 8-41, collective-behavior stochastic models become not applicable, hence a model based on individual bacterium behavior and motion is developed. This stochastic simulation is used to study the flexibility of the flagellar hook by comparing simulated and experimental results. The effect of bead diameter and the number of attached bacteria is investigated in this manner, with the results favoring a stiffer flagellar hook. The theoretical framework is intended to be used as a simulation and design tool for bacteria propelled micro-robots employed in future medical applications.",

Within this context, recent findings in human motor control have shown that active compliance modulation is fundamental when planning movements in presence of unpredictability and uncertainties. Along this line of research, this paper investigates the link between active impedance control and unpredictability, with special focus on robotic applications. Different types of actuators are considered and confronted to extreme situations such as moving in an unstable force field and controlling a system with significant delays in the feedback loop. We use tools from stochastic optimal control to illustrate the possibility of optimally planning the intrinsic system stiffness when performing movements in such situations. In the extreme case of total feedback absence, different actuators model are considered and their performance in dealing with unpredictability compared. Finally, an application of the proposed theories on planning reaching movements with the iCub humanoid platform is proposed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated stochastic approach to tracking multiple live cells that interact with the surrounding gel matrix. Cells migrate in a stochastic manner, forming a functional structure. Tracking the trajectory of each migrating cell and its interactions with the gel and other cells provide useful insights into how a vascular structure is formed as a collection of migratory cells. In micro-fluidic 3-D angiogenic sprouting experiments, two types of images are obtained at discrete time steps using confocal microscopy: a) three-dimensional fluorescent images of stained cell nuclei and b) two dimensional visible light images of the gel matrix. These two sources of images provide supplementary information as the outline of the conduit or lumen formed in the matrix by the migrating cells can be seen in the images of the gel. A Bayesian filtering framework is developed which augments both the cell and conduit parameters to the same state vector, allowing mathematically consistent simultaneous observation updates from both channels. Issues encountered include the high dimensional state vector and non-Gaussian cell state updates. Results demonstrate that our method based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering treats these issues effectively.",

Recently, the ROS software platform from Willow Garage has gained significant traction due to its adoption of sound design principles and significant software library contributions from Willow Garage itself. This paper describes a binding from the Haskell programming language to basic ROS interfaces. The novelty of these bindings is that they allow for, and encourage, a higher level of abstraction in writing programs for robots that treat streams of values as first-class citizens. This approach makes the fusing, transforming, and filtering of streams fully generic and compositional while maintaining full compatibility with the existing ROS ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Programmable materials based on robotic origami have been demonstrated with the capability to fold into 3D shapes starting from a nominally 2D sheet. This concept requires high torque density actuators, flexible electronics and an integrated substrate. We report on two types of stretchable circuitry that are directly applicable to robotic origami: meshed copper traces and liquid-metal-filled channels in an elastomer substrate. Both methods maintain conductivity even at large strains (during stretching) and curvatures (during folding). Both circuit designs are integrated with a tiled origami module actuated by a shape memory alloy actuator. We also integrate a soft curvature sensor into the robotic origami module that measures the full range of motion of the module in real-time.",

        "abstract": "A four degrees of freedom (DoF) waist and trunk mechanism, as well as human-like foot, enable the humanoid robot WABIAN-2R to perform human-like walk with stretched knees, and heel-contact and toe-off gait phases. The inverse kinematics (IK) method, used in the present system, requires specification of not only task space reference trajectories, but also reference trajectories for all redundant DoFs. In this paper, we propose a novel, unified inverse kinematics method significantly simplifying the pattern generation. The method enables generation of the above described gait by specifying only the task space trajectories. We divide the forward locomotion task into subtasks with different priorities and combine them in the single IK equation. We also perform experiments in simulation environment as well as on WABIAN-2R, which prove that the method can be used to calculate IK for human-like gait. The equation evaluated in this paper is applied to the forward locomotion task, however it can be easily modified to perform other tasks on humanoid robots with different kinematic structures.",

        "abstract": "Therapist assisted body weight supported gait rehabilitation was introduced about 20 years ago. Subsequently, several robotic systems have been introduced for assisted body weight supported gait rehabilitation. However, pelvic assistance is not commonly found in those robotic systems. Lacking of pelvic assistance has several disadvantages. The most obvious disadvantage is the inability to promote body weight shifting during the gait rehabilitation. This work presents a pelvic assistance mechanism design to provide pelvic motion assistance during gait rehabilitation. The mechanism is a module found on NaTUre-gaits, a robotic system that provides gait rehabilitation in the context of over ground walking. The methodology of processing the pelvic motion for playback on the proposed pelvic assistance mechanism is discussed. The pelvic assistance mechanism is tested on human and ground reaction force was recorded for analysis of body weight shifting with/without pelvic motion assistance. It is found that the ground reaction force during robotic assisted walking is significantly affected due to the intervention of the robotic system. Future work is suggested for further study on other potential factors, which could have contributed to the change of the ground reaction force.",

Although walking outdoors is recommended for patients to maintain physical strength, patients always have to carry a portable oxygen supplier which is not sufficiently light weight for this purpose. Our ultimate goal is to develop a mobile robot to carry an oxygen tank and follow a patient in an urban outdoor environment. We have proposed a mobile robot with a tether interface to detect the relative position of the foregoing patient. In this paper, we improve mobile platform mechanisms and active wheels to maximize the step height which can be negotiated, and to allocate sufficient space in the main body to carry an actual oxygen tank. The following control algorithm is also improved and its effectiveness is demonstrated in an outdoor experiment.",

        "abstract": "Aiming at the seamless integration of artificial limbs into the human body, sensory feedback plays an important role. There are two main methods of providing sensory feedback: invasive and non-invasive. One of the challenges of non-invasive methods is to identify the appropriate body location to transmit information through. In prosthetic applications it makes sense to target locations with low sensory loads. However, this presents new challenges to overcome due to the low mechanoreceptor density of these areas. In this study we aim to understand the limitations of using electrical stimulation for transmitting information to the body by targeting the lower back. We investigate the effects of (1) stimulation frequency and (2) electrode size on the stimulation parameters for sensation. Our results show an increased influence of stimulation frequency over the stimulation parameters with smaller electrodes. Larger electrodes reduced inter-individual differences, however the stimulation range, that is the difference between the lower sensation threshold and the pain threshold, was considerably reduced. Our experiments show that the current required to achieve nerve depolarization was low (2mA to 10 mA).",

        "abstract": "The Time Domain Passivity Control Approach (TDPA) is a powerful tool to guarantee passive interaction between a robot and its environment. Rather than establishing fixed control parameters to keep the system stable in any possible environment, the TDPA observes the energy flow due to the interaction and applies a dissipative term in the case the interaction becomes active. In a robot manipulator the rationale behind the Passivity Controller requires a criterion on how to distribute the energy to be dissipated among the multiple joints and must be adjusted according to the general control goal of the application. This paper presents a method for distributing the dissipation between decoupled subspaces of a redundant manipulator, prioritizing dissipation in the null-space. The method allows to preserve passivity while avoiding disturbance of the general control goal defined in the task-space. Thus the general control goal can, to some extent, be as well decoupled from passivity considerations and thus a less conservative controller can be achieved. The approach is sustained with a numerical simulation.",

This robotic assistant needs the tracking of the surgeon's surgical gestures in order to recognize the current maneuver and to execute the automated tasks of the robot. The surgical tools pose estimation is carried out by a Multiple Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF), where the movement models of the surgical tools depend on the maneuver which is being developed. This information is obtained by a maneuvers recognition system which is a part of the multimodal human machine interface (HMI) of the robot. The method proposed for reducing shadows has been applied to three in-vitro maneuvers which appear in the majority of the surgical protocols. The experiments show the behavior of this method for different time intervals of the occlusions.",

        "abstract": "A versatile unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) should be able to traverse rough terrain while retaining a small form factor for navigating confined spaces. Such a (patent pending) vehicle, dubbed Switchblade, is developed in the present work via an effective combination of a novel transforming mechanical design, capable onboard electronics, and advanced feedback control algorithms. A single chassis holds the actuators, sensors, electronics, and battery. Shafts protruding from either side of this chassis connect to tread assemblies. Rotation of this shaft causes the treads to advance for translational movement; rotation about this shaft causes the entire tread assembly to rotate with respect to the chassis. Vehicle orientation is estimated via onboard filtering of optical encoders and MEMS accelerometers and gyros. In its horizontal configuration, Switchblade operates as a differential-drive treaded platform. In its various upright configurations, Switchblade operates as a mobile inverted pendulum, capable of surmounting obstacles, including stairs, that would otherwise be impassable by a vehicle of its size. Design-for-manufacturing (DFM) and design-for-assembly (DFA) techniques are employed to reduce cost, part count, complexity, and assembly time without sacrificing system capabilities. Results from a working prototype are discussed. The resulting platform is well suited for a variety of socially-relevant applications, including reconnaissance, mine exploration, and search & rescue.",

In our approach, we adopt multiple Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers to cope with nonlinear dynamics. Switching criteria for the modular architecture is provided by Bellman's optimality.

Motivated by the analysis on human grasping using data reduction techniques, we applied this concept to the DLR Hand II. Therefore, we analyzed the grasp database that was grown over the past years to find suitable robotic \u201csynergy coordinates\u201d. 74% of these grasps can be represented by two coordinates that were originally defined by 12 joint variables. As a second step, a synergy impedance controller was derived and implemented extending the work on passivity based hand control at DLR. This controller for torque-controlled robot hands allows to imitate the behavior of a synergistic, respectively underactuated, hand. Such a controller provides furthermore a simplified interface for higher level grasping strategies and allows furthermore to manually teach new grasps easily. The controller was evaluated on the DLR Hand II by commanding steps that demonstrate the desired transient behavior. Finally, two objects were successfully grasped validating our approach.",

The spring is pulled by a cable wound around a non-circular spool, which is rigidly attached to the joint. The non-circular shape of the spool induces a nonlinear relationship between its angular position and the torque created by the tension of the cable. Depending on the shape of the spool, various torque profiles can be realized. We show that for a given nonlinear torque profile, there is a closed-form solution of the shape of the spool which synthesizes this function. In a first part, we present the geometry of the problem. In a second part, we derive the methodology to calculate the shape of the spool to synthesize a prescribed torque profile. In the last part, we verify the design methodology by experiments with three different spools realizing a constant force spring, an exponential softening spring and a cubic polynomial spring. We discuss the possible sources of errors between the theoretical and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of developing feedback controllers for a group of robots with second-order dynamics in an obstacle-filled, D-dimensional environment. Our control algorithm takes into account communication constraints, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, by synthesizing a piecewise smooth vector field for safe navigation. First, the feasible free joint configuration space is tessellated into polytopes that account for the desired constraints. We search the graph of these polytopes to find a discrete path to the goal polytope. We then use a novel navigation function-based feedback controller that drives the system from one polytope to the next and eventually to the goal. The controller exploits the fact that two adjoining polytopes in the planned discrete path together form a star-shaped object that is obstacle free; this enables the design of navigation function-based controller for kinematic and dynamic fully actuated robots without spurious minima. We sequentially compose these controllers to drive the state to the goal. For a polygonal space, the algorithm we propose is complete. We present successful simulation results of the algorithm on a group of ground vehicles and quadrotors performing a cooperative navigation task in constrained environments.",

        "abstract": "Multirobot domains are a challenge for learning algorithms because they require robots to learn to cooperate to achieve a common goal. The challenge only becomes greater when robots must perform heterogeneous tasks to reach that goal. Multiagent HyperNEAT is a neuroevolutionary method (i.e. a method that evolves neural networks) that has proven successful in several cooperative multiagent domains by exploiting the concept of policy geometry, which means the policies of team members are learned as a function of how they relate to each other based on canonical starting positions. This paper extends the multiagent HyperNEAT algorithm by introducing situational policy geometry, which allows each agent to encode multiple policies that can be switched depending on the agent's state. This concept is demonstrated both in simulation and in real Khepera III robots in a patrol and return task, where robots must cooperate to cover an area and return home when called. Robot teams that are trained with situational policy geometry are compared to teams that are not and shown to find solutions more consistently that are also able to transfer to the real world.",

Based on the recently developed kinematics, velocity Jacobian and full dynamic model, a simple nonlinear task-space controller, established for rigid-link robots, is adapted and extended for continuum manipulators for the regulation of its tip or any location along its backbone in the task-space. This approach is applicable to all continuum robots with extension/contraction and bending capabilities.

Using tactile instructions appears thus to be a very appealing modality for developing humanoid robot motions as well. Spontaneous interpretation of tactile instructions given by users reveals itself to be a complex task for artificial systems. This paper describes a proof of concept system for robot motion creation based on tactile interaction. The system is interesting for two reasons. Firstly, it shows the feasibility of using tactile instructions for motion development. Secondly, it can be used as a tool for studying the way humans intuitively use touch to communicate. This, in turn, will allow the development of better algorithms for predicting the meaning of tactile instructions. Results of a pilot experiment are discussed, and a first set of features of tactile communication, yielded by the analysis of the data collected, is identified.",

We developed a novel temperature measurement method using temperature dependence of the quantum dot. The cell investigation tool encapsulates the quantum dot and adheres to the cell membrane. These tools can be manipulated in a solution by optical tweezers. We proposed image processing of the tools using the color information for temperature measurement. We calibrated the temperature using the tool impregnated with quantum dot by several color spaces such as HSV and YCrCb (H: hue, S: saturation, V: values (brightness). Y: brightness, Cr: color difference of red, Cb: color difference of blue). Y and Cr represent the monotone decrease according to the temperature increase, while H and Cb do not represent monotone variation. Measurement value by Cr is stable rather than the values by Y and V information because the color difference is robust against brightness fluctuation. From these results, we confirmed temperature measurement using Cr information suitable for cell analysis. Sensitivity is \u22121.3 %/K and accuracy is 0.3 K.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robotic systems move in environments that are constantly changing due to the presence of dynamic obstacles. In this work we consider one such environment in which the dynamic nature comes from doors that can open or close during the robot's mission. We derive a solution to the automatic deployment of a robot from a temporal logic specification assuming three different levels of knowledge and sensing capabilities of the robot. Under each one of these settings, the motion of the robot is modeled either as a Markov decision process (MDP) or mixed observability MDP. The objective is to find a control strategy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a specification given in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). We describe an optimal solution in one setting and sub-optimal, reactive solutions in the other two. We illustrate our methods with simulation results.",

The key aspect in its development is to provide a tool that allows the reproduction of well-defined experiments in real-life scenarios in every laboratory and, hence, benchmarks that pave the way for objective comparison and competition in the field of grasping. In order to achieve this, experiments are performed on a sound open-source software platform with an extendable structure in order to be able to include a wider range of benchmarks defined by robotics researchers. The environment is integrated into the OpenGRASP toolkit that is built upon the OpenRAVE project and includes grasp-specific extensions and a tool for the creation/integration of new robot models. Currently, benchmarks for grasp and motion planningare included as case studies, as well as a library of domestic everyday objects models, and a real-life scenario that features a humanoid robot acting in a kitchen.",

AGs allow to generalize among never performed actions and compress all possible consequences of the action state space. AGs also provide a way of estimating the world state after several interactions of the agent with objects. We validate the notion of AGs using benchmarks designed for mobile robotics that we solve using E-puck robot simulations: learn the affordances of several objects, push an object along a predefined trajectory and place an object in at a target position and orientation. We are interested in the neurophysiological basis of affordances and how they can be inserted in a sensorimotor loop with memory structures like the one proposed by the DAC architecture. We show that AGs provide a generalization of the perception-action couplets stored in memory and learned by they adaptive layer of DAC.",

        "abstract": "As the field of biology becomes a more quantitative and predictive natural science, an increasing need for investigation and quantification of the mechanics of growth at individual cellular levels arises. This paper describes a microrobotic force-feedback based system and its application to the mechanical characterization of living, growing plant cells. The Cellular Force Microscope (CFM) is capable of performing the automated mechanical characterization of living plant cells in situ as these cells proliferate and grow. The microrobotic measurement system employs a single-axis capacitive MEMS microforce sensor capable of resolving forces down to 20 nN (1\u00bf, at 10Hz). A multi-axis positioning system with 5 nm resolution position feedback is integrated into a complete system with a high-resolution optical microscope and a custom user interface for guiding an automated force-based measurement process. The CFM has been applied to characterize the mechanical properties of 20\u00bfm wide Lilium pollen tubes while they grow at a rate of about 10 \u00bfm/min in growth medium. For the mechanical characterization of pollen tubes, loads up to 400 nN are applied that cause indentations up to 300 nm. The force-deformation data acquired show an increase in the observed stiffness from the tip to the apex demonstrating that CFM is a promising tool for better understanding the changing mechanics of living plant cell growth.",

Despite that complexity, the main design goal for it is to create a flexible architecture that enables high-performance feedback control with cycles beyond 1kHz. Flexibility is achieved through a hierarchical net of computing nodes that goes from commercial-of-the-shelf hosts down to the physical interfaces of sensors and actuators. The concept of a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a convenient high-level interface to the entire robotic hardware. First experiments with prototypical control applications, featuring 100 kHz and 3 kHz control loops, demonstrate the performance of the architecture.",

        "abstract": "Swing leg retraction reduces touchdown energy losses of running by decreasing foot speed at the moment of ground contact, but does the additional acceleration of the swing leg cost more energy than is saved? To determine whether swing leg retraction can increase the overall energy efficiency of running robots, we find the optimally efficient gaits of a McGeer-like runner over a range of retraction rates. Results show that overall energy usage, including that used to swing the legs, scales with energy loss at touchdown, which is minimized at the retraction rate that zeros foot tangential speed at ground contact. Other benefits of swing leg retraction, such as reduced foot slippage and damaging touchdown forces, are realized simultaneously with optimal energy efficiency.",

However, current pitch extraction methods are not robust enough in real noisy environments. In the present work, we propose pitch extraction methods by combining microphone array and auditory scene analysis technologies, and evaluate pitch extraction of multiple speakers in real noisy environments. Evaluation results show that the proposed ML-PSACF (maximum likelihood adaptive beamformer with peak-pruned summary autocorrelation function) contributes to reduce the effects of interference and noise, leading to improvements of 23%\u00b15% on pitch estimation rates, in comparison to the baseline of not using array processing.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A Care-Receiving Robot (CRR) receives care from the people around it. The concept of CRR was first proposed in 2009 [1], [2] by the second author of this paper. This is a novel concept developed in response to the need for continuing to involve human teachers and adult care-givers in raising and nurturing children even as we move on to the next step in technological development and gradually begin to incorporate robots in our daily lives and most importantly in our educational environment. In the past decade, the interest in the development of educational agents has gradually grown to include robots [3]. Educational robots so far have been seen in the teaching role [4], [5], [6]. In contrast, this concept explores the learner role for the robot even though its goal is to teach. The idea behind CRR is inspired by the concept of learning by teaching developed formally in the 1980s [7] and further tested in other works [8]. We have conducted a series of experiments to test the concept of CRR. We have formally launched an investigation into the feasibility, benefits, and requirements for implementing CRR in real classrooms [9]. In this paper, we will report our early findings about the environmental and circumstantial setup for successfully implementing CRR and its impact on students in terms of learning reinforcement. We have set CRR's competence level to two opposite values in the set of experiments we describe in this paper. We present here the comparison data from our analysis of the interaction rate during the two conditions. Our most prominent finding is that children are quite happy to play \u2018teacher\u2019 to a weaker student (CRR). The benefit of this opportunity is that it not only boosts the child's self-confidence about the topic, but also reinforces the existing knowledge of the child.",

The two key roles of the controller are: a) displaying a preferred road width to the user with respect to various road types, and b) constraining the maximum linear and angular velocity of the robot for safer maneuver as well. Second, we define a perception to behavior stability and perform a stability analysis. Finally, we present simulation results showing that a novice user can teleoperate the mobile robot successfully along sidewalks by our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and control of the sigma.7 haptic device and the new surgical console of the MiroSurge robotic system. The console and the haptic devices are designed with respect to requirements in minimally invasive robotic surgery. Dedicated left and right handed devices are integrated in an operator console in an ergonomic configuration. The height of the whole console is adjustable, allowing the surgeon seated and standed operation. Each of the devices is fully actuated in seven degrees of freedom (DoF). A parallel mechanism with 3 DoF actuates the translational motion and an attached wrist with 3 intersecting axis drives the rotations of the grasping unit. This advantageous design leads to inherently decoupled kinematics and dynamics. Cartesian forces are 20 N within the translational workspace, which is a sphere of about 120 mm diameter for each device. The rotational wrist of the device covers the whole workspace of the human hand and provides maximum torques of about 0.4 Nm. The grasping unit can display forces up to 8 N. An integrated force/torque sensor is used to increase the transparency of the devices by reducing inertia and friction. It is theoretically shown that the non-linear closed loop system behaves like a passive system and experimental results validate the approach. The sigma.7 haptic devices are designed by Force Dimension in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR). DLR designed the surgical console and integrated the haptic devices in the MiroSurge system.",

Principles of lagrangian dynamics are used to derive the expressions for the generalized forces in the system. Simulation results using the model are compared with the physical measurements of a continuum arm prototype built using McKibben actuators. A brief discussion on how this relatively simple model can be more realizable when compared to other techniques of modeling continuum arms is also presented in the paper.",

        "abstract": "Classical prioritized inverse kinematics (PIK) allows to generate admissible trajectories for redundant robotic systems according to a prioritized finite set of kinematic tasks to simultaneously handle multiple posture constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel regulation scheme that permits to define terminal attractors (TA) at each priority level for satisfying an additional constraint which is the final time. TA were first introduced in the context of movement neuroscience for studying the targeting problem in reaching movements. Based on the underlying properties of TA, we extend PIK methods for achieving desired time convergence of each task while guaranteeing smooth transitions between active and inactive tasks during execution. The proposed scheme is illustrated in simulation with branched robotic manipulators and verified with a real redundant robotic arm.",

The paper describes an analysis of the different delays in the sensor-robot system and a model is presented based on the overall delay. Further the stability of the modeled system is analyzed in respect to a specific control case.

        "abstract": "The work presented here focuses on humanoid gait generation. More precisely we deliberately separate the motion generation in two distinct parts: the coordination and the stability. The goal is to highlight the human coordination, and then reduce its complexity to a minimal set of relations (twelve gait descriptors with respect to an unique gait parameter). Polynomial approximations of these relations are done and implemented into a kinematic simulation of an anthropomorphic humanoid model coming from a real humanoid robot. This simulation allows the leg coordination through the contact with the environment. After the validation of the coordination relations, they are injected into an actual humanoid robot NAO. We choose the small humanoid NAO from Aldebaran society because its size and set up permit to keep the gait coordination (in three dimensions) part primarily in gait generation by comparison with the stability part (in the frontal plane). The results are promising and authorize to plan an application of this work on a more complex humanoid, plus the study of other gaits, and more important on the gait transition.",

        "abstract": "Complementary filtering (CF) is a well known method that can effectively fuse a gyroscope and accelerometer measurement in order to robustly estimate the attitude of a rigid body in a planar single degree of freedom (DOF) setting. The attitude can be estimated individually by either integrating the gyroscope measurement or by calculating the inverse tangent of the components of a 2-axis accelerometer. The gyroscope can adequately estimate the angle in the higher frequency region, but suffers from drift issues at low frequency, whereas the accelerometer can accurately measure the acceleration and thus direction of gravity, but loses this accuracy when faced with motion accelerations. CF traditionally uses linear time invariant filters, however, this paper presents an extension to the CF method by proposing time-varying parameters. A fuzzy logic method is developed to adjust the parameters. Stability analysis as well as experimental results are presented to verify the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are commonly used to support oceanographic science by providing water-column mapping, seafloor bathymetric and photographic survey, and deep-sea exploration capabilities. In practice, the mapping activities carried out by AUVs consist of flying either pre-programmed tracklines (most propeller-driven AUVs), or else reporting data to human operators at regular intervals that permit retasking (typical for month-long underwater glider deployments). AUVs equipped with the ability to reason about scientific objectives in real time could significantly increase the value of individual deployments by enabling sampling efforts to be focused on targets or areas identified autonomously or semi-autonomously as scientifically interesting [1]. In this paper, we focus on AUV autonomy as it pertains to water-column sensing and argue that the classification of water-column sensor data represents an important enabling capability. We demonstrate practical, semi-supervised classification of water-column sensor data using a particular Bayesian, non-parametric clustering method, the Variational Dirichlet Process, combined with operator-supplied semantic labeling. The method is applied to the detection of a deep subsea hydrocarbon plume using data collected by the Woods Hole Oceanographic's Sentry AUV during an expedition to the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon blowout disaster.",

Prior work has considered the use of computer-vision-feedback to close a control loop for improved performance, but computer-vision-feedback is not a viable option for many end users. In this paper, we discuss how open-loop models of the micro/nano-manipulator can be used to achieve desired end-effector movements, and we explain the process of obtaining open-loop models. We propose a rate-control teleoperation method that utilizes the obtained model, and we experimentally quantify the effectiveness of the method using a common commercial manipulator (the Kleindiek MM3A).",

        "abstract": "Long range and high endurance Autonomous Underwater Vehicles such as gliders enable sustained oceanographic sampling at larger time-scales and much lower operational costs compared to traditional ship-based sampling methods. While most path-planning methods for AUVs optimize paths with respect to efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and control they do not explicitly address the issue of finding the safest possible path when considering risks such as shipping traffic and bathymetry. In coastal regions with high shipping traffic, reducing collision risk at the path planning stage, at the expense of efficiency, is a worthwhile trade-off. We propose a method of building risk maps using historical data from the Automated Information System. These are used to plan minimum risk paths between a specified start and goal location, while avoiding obstacles, using an algorithm based on A* search. Our planner incorporates the uncertainty in dead-reckoning without explicitly considering the effect of ocean currents. We compare the relative risk of paths produced by our method when compared to a shortest-path planner which does not take risk into account, and show that our methods performs significantly better, while producing competitive paths lengths.",

        "abstract": "Sheet hinges, thin flexures that are rigid in the plane but which can bend freely, are common in stamped and lithographically manufactured devices. The behavior of these machine elements as joints in a robot is difficult to model because they are two-dimensional continuum elastic bodies that admit three-dimensional motion and twisting. This paper presents a parametric modeling technique that can be used to accurately predict elastic behavior of sheet hinges in three dimensions. Parameterized backbone curves can be used to represent ruled surface bending in a fashion that implicitly accounts for some of the complex boundary conditions imposed on typical sheet hinges. Approximate methods of integrating the non-commutative equations defining the sheet hinge backbone curves will be discussed, demonstrating acceptable trade-offs between accuracy and representational simplicity in overall model performance.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "If robots are to cooperate with humans in an increasingly human-like manner, then significant progress must be made in their abilities to observe and learn to perform novel goal directed actions in a flexible and adaptive manner. The current research addresses this challenge. In CHRIS.I [1], we developed a platform-independent perceptual system that learns from observation to recognize human actions in a way which abstracted from the specifics of the robotic platform, learning actions including \u201cput X on Y\u201d and \u201ctake X\u201d. In the current research, we extend this system from action perception to execution, consistent with current developmental research in human understanding of goal directed action and teleological reasoning. We demonstrate the platform independence with experiments on three different robots. In Experiments 1 and 2 we complete our previous study of perception of actions \u201cput\u201d and \u201ctake\u201d demonstrating how the system learns to execute these same actions, along with new related actions \u201ccover\u201d and \u201cuncover\u201d based on the composition of action primitives \u201cgrasp X\u201d and \u201crelease X at Y\u201d. Significantly, these compositional action execution specifications learned on one iCub robot are then executed on another, based on the abstraction layer of motor primitives. Experiment 3 further validates the platform-independence of the system, as a new action that is learned on the iCub in Lyon is then executed on the Jido robot in Toulouse. In Experiment 4 we extended the definition of action perception to include the notion of agency, again inspired by developmental studies of agency attribution, exploiting the Kinect motion capture system for tracking human motion. Finally in Experiment 5 we demonstrate how the combined representation of action in terms of perception and execution provides the basis for imitation. This provides the basis for an open ended cooperation capability where new actions can be learned and integrated into shared plans for cooperation. Part of th... Show More",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study two dancers' coupled body dynamics when dancing a waltz. A linear inverted pendulum (LIPM) model for biped locomotion is utilized as each dancer's dynamic model, and a balance controller for each dynamic model is introduced. A pair of dancers are then modeled as two spring-damper-connected LIPMs with their respective controllers. Assuming a perfect rhythmic and synchronized motion, we analyze the stability of the physical interaction. Stable interaction with minimal interaction force is used as the criterion for optimal interaction, which is transformed into a quadratic programming problem and solved by gradient descent. Simulations and experiments show the proposed approach for analysis of the coupled dynamics is reasonable.",

        "abstract": "The management of finite resources is central to many robot behaviors. Some robotic systems must maintain invariants regarding the disposition of feet for balancing, others have grippers for manipulating their environments, while yet others must respect strict rules governing the usage of objects in the environment. Yet the specifics of such resource management responsibilities are almost universally locked behind opaque controllers whose lack of type information greatly impedes rigorous static analysis. We present an application of dependent type theory and linear logic for the static analysis of robot behavior programs that manage both robot and environment state, with a worked assembly task example. This approach offers static, formal guarantees with respect to safety requirements attached to primitive actions, as well as introspection of expected state at each step of a scripted sequence of actions allowing for the automatic generation of dynamic, sensor-based, runtime verification of successful execution.",

These systems have allowed scientists to collect data over temporal and spatial scales that would be logistically impossible or prohibitively expensive using traditional ship-based measurement techniques. Increased dependence of scientists on such robots has permeated scientific data gathering with future field campaigns involving these platforms as well as on entire infrastructure of people, processes and software, on shore and at sea. Recent field experiments carried out with a number of surface and underwater platforms give clues to how these technologies are coalescing and need to work together. We highlight one such confluence and describe a future trajectory of needs and desires for field experiments with autonomous marine robotic platforms. Our 2010 inter-disciplinary experiment in the Monterey Bay involved multiple platforms and collaborators with diverse science goals. One important goal was to enable situational awareness, planning and collaboration before, during and after this large-scale collaborative exercise. We present the overall view of the experiment and describe an important shore-side component, the Oceanographic Decision Support System (ODSS), its impact and future directions leveraging such technologies for field experiments.",

An advanced functionality of a safety controller might be to detect the presence of humans entering the robotic cell and to estimate their intention, in order to enforce an effective safety reaction. This paper proposes advanced algorithms for cognitive vision, empowered by a dynamic model of human walking, for detection and tracking of humans. Intention estimation is then addressed as the problem of predicting online the trajectory of the human, given a set of trajectories of walking people learnt offline using an unsupervised classification algorithm. Results of the application of the presented approach to a large number of experiments on volunteers are also reported.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to safety and transparency in physical human-robot collaboration by using conventional projector and camera equipment. Our system is able to establish an arbitrarily shaped light barrier around the workspace of a robot. The barrier can be made dynamic, i.e. it can adapt to the actual movement of the robot. This is a highly desirable property in scenarios requiring human robot collaboration. We will discuss a method for visually detecting violations of the safety barrier including compensation of ambient light. Furthermore, we argue that this method complies with several requirements regarding reliability in safety critical systems.",

        "abstract": "Monocular SLAM systems have been mainly focused on producing geometric maps just composed of points or edges; but without any associated meaning or semantic content. In this paper, we propose a semantic SLAM algorithm that merges in the estimated map traditional meaningless points with known objects. The non-annotated map is built using only the information extracted from a monocular image sequence. The known object models are automatically computed from a sparse set of images gathered by cameras that may be different from the SLAM camera. The models include both visual appearance and tridimensional information. The semantic or annotated part of the map -the objects- are estimated using the information in the image sequence and the precomputed object models.",

        "abstract": "Robotic surgery is increasingly popular for a wide range of complex minimally invasive surgery procedures. To improve robotic surgery training, a skills trainer simulator called dV-Trainer has recently been introduced, and a da Vinci Skills Simulator is in advanced evaluation. These platforms report a range of time and motion based task metrics and literature has investigated the validity of these metrics in training studies. However, the lack of a cross-platform data collection system has so far prevented a cross-platform investigation. Using a new architecture for collecting cross-platform motion data, we present the first study investigating whether metrics previously validated in simulation environments also hold in training exercises with a real robotic system. Preliminary experiments for an anastomosis needle throwing task in both simulated and real robotic environments are presented, and corresponding performance metrics for both proficient and trainee users are reported.",

This renders difficult the selection of the appropriate combination for a given application. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art, modular, and efficient implementation of an ICP library. We took advantage of the recent availability of fast depth cameras to demonstrate one application example: a 3D pose tracker running at 30 Hz. For this application, we show the modularity of our ICP library by optimizing the use of lean and simple descriptors in order to ease the matching of 3D point clouds. This tracker is then evaluated using datasets recorded along a ground truth of millimeter accuracy. We provide both source code and datasets to the community in order to accelerate further comparisons in this field.",

Due to the scanning principle of the SEMs, objects in motion may not be represented in the SEM images the same way as they really are. Movement leads to movement artifacts. This effect strongly limits the possibilities for the use of image based methods for tracking and recognition and it also limits the possible speeds achievable for automated procedures. In this work, a tracking algorithm is proposed which is robust to artifacts and distortions generated by object motion. The algorithm is tested and validated in experiments.",

Current redundancy of spherical actuator is analyzed in detail, and optimization algorithm of current input is developed to improve the power efficiency and the fault tolerance capability of system. Simulation is then carried out to validate the proposed method and algorithm in this study. The simulation results indicate that by using the trajectory planning, the given torque values and the torque model, optimal current could be obtained to drive the rotor to achieve desired motions.",

The algorithm combines A* based heuristic search and locally bounded optimal planning under motion uncertainty using a variation of the minimax game-tree search. This allows the algorithm to compute trajectories that explicitly consider the possibility of the vehicle safely deviating from its original course due to the ocean waves within a specified look-ahead region. The algorithm can adapt its search based on the user-specified risk thresholds. Moreover, the algorithm produces a contingency plan as a part of the computed trajectory. We demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm using simulations.",

        "abstract": "An analytic flying model that can well represent the physical behavior is derived, where the ball's self-rotational velocity changes along with the flying velocity. Based on the least square method, a rebound model that represents the relation between the velocities before and after rebound is established. The initial trajectory is fitted to three second order polynomials of the flying time with the measured positions of the ball. The initial velocities of the ball in the analytic flying model, including the flying velocity and the self-rotational velocity, are computed from the polynomials. The ball's landing position and velocity is predicted with the model. The velocities after rebound are determined with the rebound model. By taking the velocities after rebound as new initial ones, the flying trajectory after rebound is described with the model again. In other words, the ball's trajectory is predicted. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "We measured the dynamic damping of a pair of flapping cicada wings mounted on a robotic insect thorax mechanism capable of high frequency flapping. The damping coefficients were derived based on the measurements of the wing-thorax mechanism translating along its body principal axes. The robotic mechanism has a 10cm wingtip-to-wingtip span, flaps up to 65Hz, and weigh 2.86 gram including the motor and wings. To measure the flapping induced damping during translation, we developed a pendulum system mounted with encoder, and attached the flapper at the end and in different orientations such that its motion is along its principle axes. The damping of the flapper is then calculated from the decaying rate of the magnitude of the oscillating pendulum. The damping coefficients calculated from the experiments are very close to those estimated based on our mathematic models using Blade-Element Theory (BET) and quasi-steady aerodynamic models. As expected, the damping linearly increases with the flapping frequency and is most prominent along forward/backward direction.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the successful navigation of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) towards regions located inside a solid tumor using a computer controlled set of magnetic coils. MTB uses two flagella bundles connected to rotary molecular motors as a propulsion system enabling them to reach swimming velocities of 300\u00b5m\u00b7s\u22121 without external source of power. Acting like autonomous microrobots, they can be remotely controlled by an appropriate magnetic guidance system as their swimming direction is predominantly determined by the direction of the ambient magnetic field. In order to cope with the harsh environment of the solid tumor and to bypass the lack of knowledge of the internal vessels architecture forming the route to the tumor, fundamental MTB motion properties are taken into account in addition to their ability to swim along the magnetic field. The studies revealed the presence of these bacteria in the necrotic zone of a solid tumor. Preliminary results suggest that not only the magnetic guidance can help enhancing the uniform distribution of MTB inside the tumor for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, but the experimental data showed that they could perform accurately and efficiently under computer control, many of the tasks previously envisioned for future synthetic microrobots of only 1 to 2 micrometers in diameter and designed to operate in the human microvascular network.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Multi-robot manipulation, where two or more robots cooperatively grasp and move objects, is extremely challenging due to the necessity of tightly coupled temporal coordination between the robots. Unfortunately, introducing a human operator does not necessarily ameliorate performance due to the complexity of teleoperating mobile robots with high degrees of freedom. The human operator's attention is divided not only among multiple robots but also between controlling a robot arm and its mobile base. This complexity substantially increases the potential neglect time, since the operator's inability to effectively attend to each robot during a critical phase of the task leads to a significant degradation in task performance. In this paper, we propose an approach for semi-autonomously performing multi-robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate how our user interface reduces both task completion time and the number of dropped items over a fully teleoperated robotic system. Propagating the user's commands from the actively-controlled robot to the neglected robot allows the neglected robot to leverage this control information and position itself effectively without direct human supervision.",

While the development of ad-hoc relative positioning platforms embedding cheap off-the-shelf components is a practical choice, it leads not only to differences between the platforms themselves, but also to a high sensitivity to external factors. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight online calibration method composed of two phases, capable of running on miniature robots with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore, by exploiting a Gaussian process regression in its second phase, the proposed calibration approach is able to capture deviations from an assumed underlying physical model. We compare the performance of our approach with the theoretical Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound and test its efficiency on real robots equipped with range and bearing modules.",

In this paper we show that features extracted from the ultrasound section of the human wrist can be used to fully reconstruct the hand movements, including flexion of all fingers and the rotation of the thumb. Surprisingly, it turns out that there is a clear linear relationship between image features and finger positions. The related matrix can be estimated on a rather small subset of samples, and the reconstruction is quite robust across single- and multi-finger movements. This technique can be used to control advanced mechatronic hands, and it finds its paradigmatic application in the case of hand amputees.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "To plan a robotic task involving intermittent contact, such as an assembly task, it is helpful to be able to simulate the task accurately and efficiently. In the past ten years, the prox formulation of the equations of motion has arisen as a competitive alternative to the well-known linear and nonlinear complementarity problem (LCP and NCP) formulations. In this paper, we compare these two formulations, showing through a set-based argument that the formulations are equivalent. Second, we provide simple examples to compare the most common approaches for solving these formulations. The prox formulation is solved by fixed-point iteration while the complementarity formulation is solved by a pivoting scheme, known as Lemke's algorithm. The well-known paradox of PAINLEVE\u00bf is used in a case where two solutions exist to illustrate that the fixed-point scheme can fail while the pivoting scheme will succeed.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to perform underwater Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using a Mechanically Scanned Imaging Sonar (MSIS). This approach starts by processing the MSIS data in order to obtain range scans while taking into account the robot motion. Then, the relative motions between consecutively gathered scans are stored in the state vector. Thus, the whole sequence of robot motions between gathered scans is used to perform SLAM using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). One of the novelties is that this sequence is not represented with respect to a world-fixed coordinate frame, but with respect to a coordinate frame locked to the robot. Thanks to this, EKF linearization errors are reduced. The experimental results in underwater environments validate the proposal comparing the new robocentric approach to the world-centric trajectory method.",

In this work we present the application of a wearable haptic interface in virtual realities and evaluate its usability. The wearable haptic interface can be carried like a backpack, is embedded in a multimodal virtual reality framework and enables its user to touch and manipulate virtual objects with his right arm. We evaluate whether the deflection of forces on the user's torso degrades the sense of presence and assess the usability and user acceptance of the wearable haptic interface in a virtual reality scenario. We conducted a presence questionnaire with 18 test persons in order to acquire subjective measures. As an objective measure a task performance experiment was carried out.",

However, humans performing collaborative tasks can switch between or share the leader-follower roles effortlessly even in the absence of audio-visual cues. This is because humans are capable of developing a mutual understanding while performing the collaborative task. This paper proposes a framework to endow robots with a similar capability. Behavior of the robot is controlled by two types of controllers such as reactive and proactive controllers each giving the robot follower and leader characteristics respectively. Proactive actions are based on human motion prediction. We propose that the role of the robot can be governed by the confidence of prediction. Hence, the robot can determine its role during the task autonomously and dynamically. The framework is demonstrated and evaluated through a table-lifting task. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves the overall task performance.",

        "abstract": "This work considers the problem of decentralized coordination between multiple non-holonomic vehicles, each navigating to a specified goal. By augmenting the Generalized Roundabout Policy (GRP), which guarantees collision avoidance, this paper improves the performance and liveness characteristics for such problems. These gains are achieved by integrating a second hybrid policy with GRP that updates the desired direction for each vehicle based on a dynamic priority scheme. In this scheme, minimalistic communication between vehicles is employed, such that information is periodically exchanged when changes in the high-level operating mode or prioritization occur. This information exchange is taking place only locally and data are exchanged only between neighboring vehicles. Additionally, each agent selects a control using only this local information and rules established by the two underlying hybrid automata. The proposed technique scales well due to its decentralized nature and as the computational complexity depends on the maximum number of vehicles in communication range for a vehicle. This paper presents simulations which show that the proposed approach can solve problems faster than using GRP alone, as well as solve instances in which GRP fails to find a solution, with minimal communication and computational overhead.",

One such category of problems involves physical robotic systems, which often require significant time, effort, and monetary expenditure in order to run tests. To assist in the selection of the next experiment, there has been a focus on the idea of response surfaces in recent years. These surfaces interpolate the existing data and provide a measure of confidence in their error, serving as a low-fidelity surrogate function that can be used to more intelligently choose the next experiment. In this paper, we robustly implement a previous algorithm based on the response surface methodology with an expected improvement criteria. We apply this technique to optimize open-loop gait parameters for snake robots, and demonstrate improved locomotive capabilities.",

We validate the technical feasibility and efficacy of our system in guiding, motivating, and administering an upper extremity rehabilitation task. The robot, which consists of a humanoid torso on a mobile base, monitors user performance on a wire puzzle task through a wearable inertial measurement unit and signals from the puzzle. Smoothness of stroke-affected limb movement is used as the evaluation metric. Five adults of mild to moderate functional ability in the chronic phase of stroke recovery interacted with our SAR system over three separate days. The inertial data from the five participants were analyzed using frequency domain techniques. Subsequently, the amount of power in frequency bands corresponding to voluntary (0.1 to 2Hz) and involuntary motion/jerk (4 to 8Hz) was evaluated. We found that, in adults of mild severity (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores greater than 40), the motion becomes smoother (the amount of jerk is reduced) over 3 days of task practice. In adults of moderate motor severity (scores below 40), the motion became less smooth. This may indicate that the combination of our task and SAR system is better suited for individuals with higher functional ability, and needs augmentation in order to aid those of lower functional ability levels.",

This paper discusses the work done towards creating a system capable of sensing and measuring terrain using vehicle performance measurements; which will ultimately help to create a more terrain capable vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Multirotor aircraft have become a popular platform for indoor flight. To navigate these vehicles indoors through an unknown environment requires the use of a SLAM algorithm, which can be processing intensive. However, their size, weight, and power capacity limit the processing capabilities available onboard. In this paper, we describe an approach to state estimation that helps to alleviate this problem. By using an improved dynamic model we show how to more accurately estimate the aircraft states than can be done with the traditional approach of integrating IMU measurements. The estimation is done with relatively infrequent corrections from accelerometers (40Hz) and even less frequent updates from a vision-based SLAM algorithm (2\u20135 Hz). This benefit of requiring less frequent updates from processing intensive sources comes without significant increase in the estimator's complexity.",

        "abstract": "A new bio-inspired speech analysis system that extracts acoustical speech events is proposed and used in the design of a variable frame rate (VFR) speech recognizer. The same speech recognizer (Hidden Markov Model -HMM- and Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients -MFCC-) has been used with the proposed VFR analysis and conventional fixed frame rate (FFR) approach. In comparison with other VFR recognizers, the hierarchical features in the proposed system have the potential to serve as classification parameters of a complete bio-inspired speech recognition system. Also, no voice activity detection is required and there are no hard decisions to be taken by the system. Events are used to label and identify the moments at which the acoustical properties of speech are stable or changing. These events are markers on which an analysis window can be positioned to perform the recognition. Inspired by our knowledge of the auditory and visual systems, hierarchical complex features like transients and energy orientation are used. Training has been done on clean speech and recognition on noisy (from 20dB to \u221210dB Signal to Noise Ratios -SNR) or reverberated speech by using the TI 46-word database corrupted with 4 noises taken from the Aurora 2 data. In comparison with a FFR recognizer, our VFR system yields more than 50% increase in recognition rates for a speaker independent isolated word recognition task when SNRs are between 0 and 20 dB.",

However, several performance drawbacks prevent the widespread use of PAMs. Although many approaches have been proposed to overcome the low control bandwidth of PAMs, some limitations of PAMs such as restricted workspace and torque capacity remain to be addressed. This paper analyzes the limitations of conventional circular pulley joints and subsequently proposes a design methodology to synthesize a pair of variable radius pulleys to improve joint torque capacity over a large workspace. Experimental results show that newly synthesized variable radius pulleys significantly improve position tracking performance in the enlarged workspace.",

The adjustment is accomplished by varying the preloads of springs, which affect the grasp stability and stiffness for large and small objects. Preload adjustment can be accomplished with low power, non-backdrivable actuators in the fingers. The analysis is presented first for a planar, two-fingered hand to illustrate the trends and tradeoffs associated with variations in preload. The results are then applied numerically to a three fingered hand with three phalanges per finger. This design is a prototype for a hand to be used in an underwater oil drilling platform under conditions of low friction and uncertain object locations.",

        "abstract": "We present a new method of defining a body coordinate frame for locomoting snake robots. Representing the motion of snake robots from the perspective of the robot is difficult because the internal shape changes that the robot uses to locomote interact with world in a complex way. Therefore, rather than representing the system in a body frame that is static to some fixed point on a link, we instead define a body frame that is consistent with the overall shape of the robot in all configurations. We are able to define such a body frame by continuously aligning it with the principal moments of inertia taken at the center of mass of the robot. In some cases we are able to further exploit symmetry in the shape of the robot's cyclic motion (gait), and use non-linear optimization to more precisely align the body frame with the true axis of symmetry of the robot's shape. These shape stable body frames serve as virtual chassis that effectively separate the internal motion of a gait from the external motion due to that gait's interaction with the world. Furthermore, these body frames allow the motion of the robot to be described in a way that is well-aligned with one's intuitive notions of position and orientation that arise when considering the system as a whole.",

This system consists in a fisheye camera, which allows to cover a large field of view (FOV), and a laser circle projector mounted on a fixed baseline. The approach, close to structured light systems, uses the geometrical information obtained by the projection of the laser circle onto the ground plane and perceived by the camera. We present a theoretical study of the system in which the camera is modelled as a sphere and show that the estimation of a conic on this sphere allows to obtain the attitude and the altitude of the robot. We propose some experiments based on simulated data and real sequences. The estimated attitude and altitude from our method are comparable with commercial sensors in terms of its accuracy and correctness. The results also prove its suitability for autonomous take-off and landing as well as for the case of low altitude manoeuvre in dark environments. It also provides room for additional payload to be used for different applications due to use of light weight micro-camera and laser system.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of determining the speed and the attitude of a vehicle equipped with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. The vehicle moves in a 3D unknown environment. It is shown that, by collecting the visual and inertial measurements during a very short time interval, it is possible to determine the following physical quantities: the vehicle speed and attitude, the absolute distance of the point features observed by the camera during the considered time interval and the bias affecting the inertial measurements. In particular, this determination, is based on a closed form solution which analytically expresses the previous physical quantities in terms of the sensor measurements. This closed form determination allows performing the overall estimation in a very short time interval and without the need of any initialization or prior knowledge. This is a key advantage since allows eliminating the drift on the absolute scale and on the vehicle orientation. In addition, the paper provides the minimum number of distinct camera images which are needed to perform this determination. Specifically, if the magnitude of the gravity is unknown, at least four camera images are necessary while if it is a priori known, three camera images are necessary. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by using real data.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based mobile robot's simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and navigation has been the source of countless research contributions because of rich sensory output and cost effectiveness of vision sensors. However, existing methods of vision-based SLAM and navigation are not effective for robots to be used in crowded environments such as train stations and shopping malls, because when we extract feature points from an image in crowded environments, many feature points are extracted from not only static objects but also dynamic objects such as humans. By recognizing all such feature points as landmarks, the algorithm collapses and errors occur in map building and self-localization. In this paper, we propose a SLAM and navigation method that is effective even in crowded environments by extracting robust 3D feature points from sequential vision images and odometry. By using the proposed method, we can eliminate unstable feature points extracted from dynamic objects and perform SLAM and navigation stably. We present experiments showing the utility of our approach in crowded environments, including map building and navigation.",

Illumination at different wavelengths and angles are projected by a robot, thus acquiring additional information about the scene and exploiting it for successful novel objects segmentation. By analyzing shades and reflections of a scene's objects, we were able to form and identify true edges and visually separate items of interest. In order to recognize the physical characteristics of segmented objects, we introduce a novel material classification technique which utilizes static electricity charge sensing. Our proposed methods do not require predefined models of target objects and assume no previously assigned targets' pose. Using extracted object visual and physical aspects, an autonomous robot manipulator successfully performed a trash separation task.",

Visual anomaly detection is important and widely applicable not only to the news-gathering robot but also to the security systems. However, visual anomaly detection from the mobile robot is highly challenging, because the appearances of images captured by the moving robot are dynamically changing. In consequence, the number of observed images at the same location becomes small, and the sampling interval of those images is not constant. To tackle this problem, we developed a new method to incorporate many samples observed at different locations as previous knowledge, which implicitly represent semantically similar to the intended location. Also, we developed a new statistical model, which explicitly considers sampling interval of input images, whereas conventional methods ignore correlation among samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional methods, and our mobile robot system including the proposed method finds, investigates, and publishes news of a local community of the real world.",

Our method pre-processes the raw 3D LIDAR and camera data to produce a sparse map that can scale to city-size environments. From the original LIDAR and camera data we extract visual features and identify those that are most robust to varying viewpoint. This allows us to include only the visual features that are most useful for localization in the map. Additionally, we quantize the visual features using a vocabulary tree to further reduce the map's file size. We then use vision-based localization to track the vehicle's motion through the map. We present results on urban data collected with Ford Motor Company's autonomous vehicle testbed. In our experiments the map is built using urban data from winter 2009, and localization is performed using data collected in fall 2010 and winter 2011. This demonstrates our algorithm's robustness to temporal changes in the environment.",

Assuming that the periodic machinery operations to be monitored are perfectly regular, the surveillance algorithm can encode the phase of a periodic operation just by inspecting temporal changes in the brightnesses at several significan pixels in an input image; abnormal behavior in the periodic operation can be detected by comparing the input image with a reference image synchronized with its encoded phase without the heavy computation needed to search all the reference images. This algorithm was software-implemented on a high-speed vision platform, IDP express, which can record input images of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels and process the results at 1000 fps. An experiment was performed using a sewing machine with periodic operation at a frequency of 12 Hz, and a vidio of the abnormal behavior was automatically recorded at 1000 fps to verify the effectiveness of HFR-video-based machinery surveillance.",

Previous related methods are constrained to image data labeled with exact position information acquired in the training phase.

The processes are used as a probabilistic map to predict recording positions of newly acquired images by a fusion of the uncertain training data. In contrast to many feature-based approaches, our framework does not rely on any explicit correspondences over images as well as over positions and only imposes very weak assumptions on the type and quality of the image representations.",

The approach was originally designed in [1], but major improvements and real outdoor experiments are added here. Visual navigation consists of following a path, represented as an ordered set of key images, that have been acquired in a preliminary teaching phase. While following such path, the robot is able to avoid new obstacles which were not present during teaching, and which are sensed by a range scanner. We guarantee that collision avoidance and navigation are achieved simultaneously by actuating the camera pan angle, in the presence of obstacles, to maintain scene visibility as the robot circumnavigates the obstacle. The circumnavigation verse and the collision risk are estimated using a potential vector field derived from an occupancy grid. The framework can also deal with unavoidable obstacles, which make the robot decelerate and eventually stop.",

A map with labels such as kitchen, lab, copy room etc provides a basic amount of semantic information that can enable a robot to perform a number of tasks specified in human-centric terms rather than just map coordinates. In this work, we propose a method to label areas in a pre-built map using information from camera images. In contrast to most existing approaches, our method labels the area that is viewed in the camera image rather than just the current robot location. Place labels are generated from the image input using the PLISS system [14]. The label information on the viewed areas is integrated in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that also considers higher level semantics such as adjacency and place boundaries. We demonstrate our technique on maps built using from laser and visual SLAM systems. We obtain the correct place categorization of a very high percentage of the map areas even when the place categorization system is trained using images only from the internet.",

In addition to camera parameters, the feature positions in 3D space are also assumed unknown. Based on the fact that the unknown parameters appears linearly in the closed-loop dynamics of the system if the depth-independent interaction matrix is adopted to map the image errors onto the joint space of the manipulator, we developed a new adaptive algorithm to estimated the unknown parameters on-line. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot manipulator, we employ the Lyapunov method to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors.

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to introduce a direct visual tracking method based on an image similarity measure called the sum of conditional variance (SCV). The SCV was originally proposed in the medical imaging domain for registering multi-modal images. In the context of visual tracking, the SCV is invariant to non-linear illumination variations, multi-modal and computationally inexpensive. Compared to information theoretic tracking methods, it requires less iterations to converge and has a significantly larger convergence radius. The novelty in this paper is a generalization of the efficient second-order minimization formulation for tracking using the SCV, allowing us to combine the efficient second-order approximation of the Hessian with a similarity metric invariant to non-linear illumination variations. The result is a visual tracking method that copes with non-linear illumination variations without requiring the estimation of photometric correction parameters at every iteration. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method through comparative studies and tracking experiments under challenging illumination conditions and rapid motions.",

This robot singer is an important and attractive humanoid robot application for the entertainment scene; moreover, it promotes state-of-the-art integration of robot engineering, music processing, and image processing. To overcome the difficulties of generating natural facial expressions that are precisely synchronized with singing voices, VocaWatcher imitates a human singer by analyzing a video clip of a human singing, recorded by a single video camera. VocaWatcher can control mouth, eye, and neck motions by imitating the corresponding human movements, which are estimated without using any markers in the video. It can also synthesize singing voices by imitating the pitch and dynamics of the human singing in the same video.",

        "abstract": "The generation of accurate, watertight, three-dimensional models of environments are often crucial for the purposes of scientific study and infrastructure management. Most commonly, such models are acquired by using range sensors producing point clouds, and further processing steps are required for the construction of a surface model. We used a mobile lidar to map several kilometers of a natural cave system in order to obtain 3D volumetric models for use in scientific research studying the local palaeo-climatic record. For unstructured and GPS-denied environments, such as cave systems, the process of acquiring a complete map is difficult and further complicated by limited mobility within the cave. During the mapping process, many unwanted measurements occur due to occlusions from moving objects such as other people present in the cave. Most common point cloud surface reconstruction techniques are not designed to deal these occlusions; i.e., they require manual cleanup of the data set or are not capable of generating watertight surfaces. The large scale of the environments introduces the additional challenge of dealing with memory limitations. We propose a new volume-based approach to reconstruct a watertight surface from range measurements of enclosed environments without limitation on the scale of the collected data. Our approach carves all unoccupied voxels from the sensor to a triangulated and rasterized surface between successive scans, which is intended to fill in the missing data between the scan rays. The surface is then constructed from the isosurface between unoccupied and unknown cells. By decomposing the space, we are able to handle large-scale data without exceeding the memory limitation of a standard PC, at the cost of some additional computation time. The algorithm has been evaluated across several datasets within a variety of environments and observed to build more complete volumetric models than a simple space carving approach.

Sensing a slip condition at a fingertip plays an important role to estimate the weight and friction properties of an object. This fact suggests that controlling the contact condition could yield weight and friction illusions. Based on this idea, a prototype device was developed that controls the contact surface between a fingertip and a rigid plate based on a camera-based eccentricity control. The desired eccentricity profile was given from the mathematical relationship between the eccentricity and the surface deformation, which is obtained by known material parameters, vertical/lateral forces applied on the contact area, and static friction coefficient. The performance of the developed device was evaluated through human experiments. The experimental results show the statistically significant difference between presented weight and friction conditions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, optimization, and experimental analysis of a biologically inspired wet shape memory alloy (SMA) actuated heart for robotic systems. Just as the human heart provides energy to the muscles in the body, the robotic SMA heart distributes thermofluidic energy to arrays of SMA actuators that function as robotic muscles. Furthermore, the robotic heart draws from its own fluidic output to assist in the actuation of its own internal SMA actuators, just as a portion of the blood pumped by the human heart supplies energy to its own muscles. Dynamic modeling and simulation of the SMA actuators and pumping system are used to assist in optimizing the output of the heart. The effects of changing various parameters such as actuator length and actuation timing were explored via simulation and experiment. The current prototype of the SMA heart is capable of pumping 2.1 times more fluid than is required to sustain its own actuation. This is the first successful implementation of such a robotic heart, such that it has a net positive thermofluidic output to provide to other actuators while sustaining its own actuation via thermofluidic feedback. Furthermore, the SMA heart is capable of pumping a net output of 66 mL/min, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the output of other SMA \u201cmicro\u201d pumps.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach is proposed for the modeling of rigid-wheel and soft-soil interaction using infinitesimal plasticity theory. Our motivation is the need to have a model compatible with dynamic models of multibody systems. The idea is to use a prescribed velocity field in the vicinity of the contact area based on the physics of the problem, and find the changes in the stress field by resorting to plasticity theory and an appropriate constitutive relation for soil. In this paper the Drucker-Prager constitutive relation with cap hardening is employed. The proposed approach leads to results that tally with those obtained using well-established semi-empirical models. The calibration of the semi-empirical model parameters is done by performing simulation runs using detailed FEM models with the Abaqus/Explicit software package.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new shared-control approach for assistive mobile robots, using Brain Computer Interface (BCI) as the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). A P300-based paradigm that allows the selection of brain-actuated commands to steer a Robotic Wheelchair (RW), is proposed. At least one specific motor skill, such as the control of arms, legs, head or voice, is required to operate a conventional HMI. Due to this reason, they are not suited for people suffering from severe motor disorders. BCI may open a new communication channel to these users, since it does not require any muscular activity. The number of decoded symbols per minute (SPM) in a BCI is still very low, which means that users can only provide sparse, and discrete commands. The RW must rely on the navigation system to validate user commands effectively. A two-layer shared-control approach is proposed. The first, a virtual-constraint layer, is responsible for enabling/disabling the user commands, based on certain context restrictions. The second layer is an user-intent matching responsible for determining the suitable steering command, that better fits the user command, taking the user competence on steering the wheelchair into account. Experimental results using Robchair, the RW platform developed at ISR-UC [1], [2] are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.",

        "abstract": "In aging societies, there is a strong demand for robotics to tackle problems resulting from the aging population. We have developed a prototype nursing-care assistant robot, RIBA, which was designed to come in direct contact with patients and conduct physically challenging tasks. RIBA interacts with its object, typically a human, through multiple and distributed contact regions on its arms and body. To obtain information on such whole-body contact, RIBA has tactile sensors on a wide area of its arms. The regions where hard contact with the manipulated person may occur have almost flat surfaces, leading to surface contact involving a finite area, in order to reduce contact pressure and not to cause the person's pain. When controlling the position and orientation of the person, the relative positions and orientations of the distributed contacting surfaces should be preserved as far as possible to maintain stable contact and not to graze the person's skin. Preserving the force and the pressure pattern of each contact region using tactile feedback is also important to provide stable and comfortable human-robot physical interaction. In this paper, we propose a whole-body contact manipulation method using tactile information to meet these requirements.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a two stage actuator system that consists of a coarse actuator driven by a ball screw with an AC motor (the first stage) and a fine actuator driven by a voice coil motor (the second stage). The proposed actuators are applied to make a wide-bandwidth bilateral control system. The first stage has a wide moving range with a narrow control bandwidth, and the second stage has a narrow moving range with a wide control bandwidth. In the proposed method, by consolidate these two inexpensive actuators based on a control design to separate bandwidth, a wide bandwidth bilateral control system can be constructed. Simulation results show that a higher transparency, i.e., better force and position responses between a master and slave, is achieved by using the proposed system compared with a narrow-bandwidth case using a single ball screw system. Furthermore, a prototype of the two stage actuator has been developed and basic performance was evaluated by experiment. Experimental results showed that a light mechanical impedance with a mass of 10 g and damping of 1.6 N/(m/s) that is an important factor to establish good haptic devices was successfully implemented.",

Fine grained knowledge of crop yields can allow viticulturists to better manage their vineyards. The current industry practice for yield prediction is destructive, expensive and spatially sparse - during the growing season sparse samples are taken and extrapolated to determine overall yield. We present an automated method that uses computer vision to detect and count grape berries. The method could potentially be deployed across large vineyards taking measurements at every vine in a non-destructive manner. Our berry detection uses both shape and visual texture and we can demonstrate detection of green berries against a green leaf background. Berry detections are counted and the eventual harvest yield is predicted. Results are presented for 224 vines (over 450 meters) of two different grape varieties and compared against the actual harvest yield as groundtruth.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a balance-control algorithm which uses the Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) in order to maximize the dynamic stability of leg-wheel hybrid structures on hard, flat surfaces. The algorithm constrains the control input to satisfy the condition in which the ZMP stays at the geometric center of the contact area. This restriction of the control input changes the original fully actuated system into an under-actuated system and generates a problem with the internal dynamics. To solve this issue, we found output variables which reduce and stabilize the internal dynamics by means of an Input/Output Linearization (IOL) process. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing three cases in a simulation - no balance control, ZMP feedback balance control, and ZMP feedforward balance control.",

        "abstract": "To achieve versatile locomotion in complex amphibious environments, a robot should be capable of performing different gaits. In this paper we present such a versatile amphibious robot based on a novel eccentric paddle mechanism (ePaddle). We first illustrate the concept of the ePaddle with five major possible gaits and conceptual gait sequences. We then summarize five types of configurations from these gaits. Based on these configurations, two motion behaviors are found and modeled by using kinematic equations for the future gait planning tasks. To verify the proposed ideas, we develop an ePaddle prototype module. Several simulations on these gaits are performed to verify the conceptual locomotion gait and the developed kinematic models. Experiments on five possible configurations demonstrate the valid of the ePaddle concept and the prototype design.",

        "abstract": "Recent work in the domain of classification of point clouds has shown that topic models can be suitable tools for inferring class groupings in an unsupervised manner. However, point clouds are frequently subject to non-negligible amounts of sensor noise. In this paper, we analyze the effect on classification accuracy of noise added to both an artificial data set and data collected from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner, and show that topic models are less robust to \u2018misspelled\u2019 words than the more n\u00e4ive k-means classifier. Furthermore, standard spin images prove to be a more robust feature under noise than their derivative, \u2018angular\u2019 spin images. We additionally show that only a small subset of local features are required in order to give comparable classification accuracy to a full feature set.",
