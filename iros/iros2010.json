        "abstract": "A spherical mobile robot has been developed with a 1-DOF mechanism that can generate two motions, translational and rotational, using only one motor. The basic concept is to attach vinyl strips to the sphere at regular intervals and to change the driving modes of the motor to produce the desired motion. For example, placing the motor in vibration mode causes the trajectory of the contact point between the sphere and ground to follow a specified closed path, such as an elliptical path, which makes the sphere rotate against the ground. Testing of this concept using a self-developed simulator confirmed that rotational motion is generated by the interactions between the surface attachments and the ground. On the basis of these results, a prototype spherical mobile robot was developed, and testing confirmed that switching the motor driving mode generated two different motions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we show that for an observer moving in the plane with no other information than the measurement of relative bearing to three known landmarks, it is possible to completely reconstruct its position and velocity. In particular this applies to the case where no model of the vehicle, nor odometry or acceleration measurements are available. Furthermore, in the same hypotheses, the position of any further landmark can be reconstructed from its bearing only. These results are more general than what is currently known on nonlinear observability of the SLAM problem, which relies on known observer velocities. Our results are also more general than the 2D version of known structure-from-motion observability results, which assume unknown but constant velocities. The proposed method is used to build a nonlinear observer directly applicable to a range of problems from computer vision to autonomous visual navigation.",

The dynamics of the 3-D inverted pendulum is modeled as 2-D autonomous system by applying the Passive Dynamic Autonomous Control (PDAC) that is based on the assumption of point-contact of the robot foot and the virtual holonomic constraint as to robot joints. We analyze the stability of the 2-D autonomous system by use of Poincar\u00e9e map, and derive the stable range over rough terrain. By applying the virtual compliance control to an actual robot \u201cGorilla Robot III\u201d, the angle of the pendulum is modified. Finally, the 3-D biped walking over rough terrain is realized by use of the Gorilla Robot III.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a fully teleoperated 3D micro assembly task with haptic feedback is presented. Microspheres (diameter: 4-6\u03bcm) are manipulated by pick-and-place. The setup is composed of a dual-tip gripper controlled through a haptic interface. To grasp the spheres, the tips must be correctly positioned with respect to the objects. The approach proposed to align the gripper is based on a user-driven exploration of the to-be-manipulated object. During this step, the haptic feedback is based on amplitude measurements from cantilevers in dynamic mode. Hence, the operator perceives the contact while freely exploring the manipulation area. A virtual guide is generated to pull the user to the optimum contact point, allowing correct positioning of dual tips. For the pick-and-place operation, the haptic feedback provides the user with information about the microscale interactions occurring during the operation. As experimental validation, a two-layer pyramid composed of four nylon microspheres is built in ambient conditions.",

The proposed method calculates camera poses using visual odometry, and updates the poses by reducing the accumulated errors using landmark recognition. Landmark recognition is done based on robust and scalable image-retrieval using image edge-points with SIFT descriptors and a vocabulary tree. A randomized-ICP algorithm is employed to accurately estimate the 6-DOF camera pose from a landmark image and an edge-point based 3D map. Experiments show our edge-point based approach outperforms approaches using corners and Laplacian points.",

        "abstract": "Environmental change is a growing international concern, calling for the regular monitoring, studying and preserving of detailed information about the evolution of underwater ecosystems. For example, fragile coral reefs are exposed to various sources of hazards and potential destruction, and need close observation. Computer vision offers promising technologies to build 3D models of an environment from two-dimensional images. The state of the art techniques have enabled high-quality digital reconstruction of large-scale structures, e.g., buildings and urban environments, but only sparse representations or dense reconstruction of small objects have been obtained from underwater video and still imagery. The application of standard 3D reconstruction methods to challenging underwater environments typically produces unsatisfactory results. Accurate, full camera trajectories are needed to serve as the basis for dense 3D reconstruction. A highly accurate sparse 3D reconstruction is the ideal foundation on which to base subsequent dense reconstruction algorithms. In our application the models are constructed from synchronized high definition videos collected using a wide baseline stereo rig. The rig can be hand-held, attached to a boat, or even to an autonomous underwater vehicle. We solve this problem by employing a smoothing and mapping toolkit developed in our lab specifically for this type of application. The result of our technique is a highly accurate sparse 3D reconstruction of underwater structures such as corals.",

        "abstract": "Traditional indoor 3D structural environment modeling algorithms employ schemes such as clustering of dense point clouds for parameterization and identification of the 3D surfaces. RANSAC based plane fitting is one common approach in this regard. Alternatively, extensions to feature based stereo have also been used, mainly focusing on 3D line descriptions, along with techniques such as half-plane detection, real-plane or facade reconstruction, plane sweeping etc. Noise in the range data, especially in low texture regions, accidental line/plane grouping under lack of cues for visibility tests, presence of depth edges or discontinuities that are not visible in the 2D image and difficulties in adaptively estimating metrics for clustering can hamper efficiency of practical systems. In order to counter these issues, we propose a novel framework fusing 2D local and global features such as edges, texture and regions, with geometry information obtained from range data for reliable 3D indoor scene representation. The strength of the approach is derived from the novel depth diffusion and segmentation algorithms resulting in superior surface characterization as opposed to traditional feature based stereo or RANSAC based plane fitting approaches.

The informationally structured space realizes the quick update and access of valuable and useful information for both people and robots on real and virtual environments. In this paper, we use distance information and color information measured by 3D distance image sensor and CMOS camera for 3D topological reconstruction. First, we propose an extraction method of objects from the background image based on Hough transform as preprocessing. Next, we propose a method of 3D topological reconstruction based on growing neural gas to construct informationally structured space. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed method and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

A mobile mapping system (MMS) measures outdoor 3D point clouds easily and precisely. The complete 6D state of a mobile robot is estimated by combining dead reckoning and the 3D voxel map. The 2D position and orientation are extended to 3D by using the 3D voxel map and by assuming that the mobile robot remains in continuous contact with the road surface. Our approach applies a particle filter to correct position errors in the laser measurement model for a 3D point cloud space. Field experiments were performed to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method. Our results confirmed that it is possible to achieve a localization precision of 0.2 m (RMS) using our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Despite its appeal, a systematic design of an autonomous decentralized control system is yet to be realized. To bridge this gap, we have so far employed a \u201cback-to-basics\u201d approach inspired by true slime mold, a primitive living creature whose behavior is purely controlled by coupled biochemical oscillators similar to central pattern generators (CPGs). Based on this natural phenomenon, we have successfully developed a design scheme for local sensory feedback control leading to system-wide adaptive behavior. This design scheme is based on a \u201cdiscrepancy function\u201d that extracts the discrepancies among the mechanical system (i:e:, body), control system (i:e:, brain-nervous system) and the environment. The aim of this study is to intensively investigate the validity of this design scheme by applying it to the control of a quadruped locomotion. Simulation results show that the quadruped robot exhibits remarkably adaptive behavior in response to environmental changes and changes in body properties. Our results shed a new light on design methodologies for CPG-based decentralized control of various types of locomotion.",

There exist numerous researches that address the problem of localization of UAVs using aerial images. However, after a disaster such as a tornado or an earthquake many features in aerial images like monuments and unique buildings may change, and the image-based localization would become hard or even impossible. Consequently it is important to find features that remain unchanged or with fairly small changes, and can be detected both before and after a disaster. We have used a recent method for street detection from aerial images and shown that road networks and segments are disaster invariant and could be utilized for localization and mapping. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on satellite images from Google, with nearly equivalent resolution to aerial images. The successful result of detecting this DIF on Port-au-Prince, in Haiti, images before and after the recent earthquake is presented.",

Our approach is to provides students with a simple FPGA based framework for hardware access, and hardware I/O development, which is independent of computer platform and programming language, and enable the students to add to, or change I/O hardware in accordance with their skills. We have tested the framework in an embedded systems course and various student projects, and have found that it greatly enhance the students abilities to control hardware from software, and dramatically reduce the time spent on software \u2194 hardware interfacing. As the framework is also scalable, it can support projects from controlling a single LED, to complex modular and aggregated robots with demands for high bandwidths and low jitter in the control loop.",

The percentage of successful ball-throwing for target within three meters was found to be approximately 99%.",

Emphasis has been given to the bio-plausibility of the computation, in the sense that the control laws could be in principle implemented on the neural substrate of simple insects. We show that stabilizing laws can be realized by bilinear/quadratic operations on the visual input. This particular computational structure has several numerically favorable characteristics (sparse, local, and parallel), and thus permits an efficient engineering implementation. We show results of the control law tested on an indoor helicopter platform.",

One important aspect of this better performance is the human movement generation. In this paper, we study trajectory generation for table tennis from a biomimetic point of view. Our focus lies on generating efficient stroke movements capable of mastering variations in the environmental conditions, such as changing ball speed, spin and position. We study table tennis from a human motor control point of view. To make headway towards this goal, we construct a trajectory generator for a single stroke using the discrete movement stages hypothesis and the virtual hitting point hypothesis to create a model that produces a human-like stroke movement. We verify the functionality of the trajectory generator for a single forehand stroke both in a simulation and using a real Barrett WAM\u2122.",

Thus complex algorithms can be carried out on high performance systems circumventing the restrictions considering space and power consumption that a mobile platform imposes. As high resolution cameras provide a huge amount of image data and the bandwidth of a wireless network connection is strongly limited, we are using intelligent camera systems on the mobile robot platform to execute parts of the image processing functions directly on the robot. This way only preprocessed image information will be transmitted instead of raw image data. We are using a flexible modular software framework that allows us to split image processing tasks into a pipeline of modular functions that can run on different systems. We show how our approach can be used to enable a service robot system to speed up high resolution SIFT-based object detection.",

Tests in static and dynamic cases were carried out, and showed that the performance of estimated Jacobian by using the properties of the epipolar geometry is such as good and robust against noise as the analytic Jacobian. This fact is considered as an advantage because the estimated Jacobian does not need laborious previous work prior to control task in contrast to the analytic Jacobian does.",

Although a satellite network is not available for localization around any near-term exploration targets, topographic maps derived from satellite imagery are available. This has spurred the development of several algorithms that perform global localization by matching data collected from onboard sensors to a global digital elevation map (DEM). This paper reviews two of these algorithms-Multiple-frame Odometry-compensated Global Alignment (MOGA) and VIsual Position Estimation for Rovers (VIPER)-and compares their performance on a common dataset, collected in a planetary analog environment. The comparison demonstrates the common factors limiting the performance of these algorithms, but also highlights the benefits and drawbacks of each method. Overall, the MOGA algorithm performed significantly better; however, running both algorithms is seen to be the best option as the computational cost of VIPER is low and it may succeed in some situations wherein MOGA will fail.",

        "abstract": "While a robot control framework generally focuses on real-time performance and efficient data exchange between cooperating tasks or processes, an application such as robot-assisted surgery often demands information from, and integration with, a number of other devices. Thus, the software framework for the integrated system may have different requirements and priorities than a framework for real-time robot control. This paper reports on a component-based architecture that seamlessly bridges the gap between real-time robot control and a distributed, integrated system. The starting point is the cisst library, which provides a component-based framework for lock-free and efficient data exchange between multiple threads within a single process, which is suitable for real-time robot control. This paper describes the extension of the cisst library to support distributed systems, while keeping the same programming model as the single-process, multi-threaded scenario. Thus, application software does not need to know whether the component providing services is within the same process, in a different process, or on a different computer. In comparison, most standard middleware packages support components that fall within the last two categories (different processes on the same computer or different computers). This does not allow them to take advantage of the higher performance that can be achieved using standard lock-free data structures that do not rely on the operating system or on middleware services. Thus, the novelty of this approach is that the same component-based architecture and associated programming model extends from a multi-threaded scenario (which provides the best real-time performance) to a standard multi-process distributed system.",

        "abstract": "A cooperation approach with consideration of communication limit is proposed for multi-robot area exploration, in which all the robots select local destinations satisfying the constraints on communication range and reach their destinations at the same time to communicate and fuse their map information. Firstly, the robots compute the frontier between the explored region and the unexplored one. The robots choose the optimal frontier points, which maximize information gain, minimize navigation cost and satisfy communication limit as their local destinations. Then the problem of global exploration in unknown environment is converted into that of multi-stage trajectory planning in local known environment. Collision-free, synchronous and separate trajectories are planned for all the robots to realize the limited communication at their destinations. In such a way, efficient and distributed exploration can be achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.",

While regular polyhedrons provide the bases of many promising 3D lattice elements, few modular robots have shapes with more than six regular faces. The conceptual design and prototypes of cuboctahedron elements are presented in this paper. To account for the various connecting configurations between robotic modules, we propose a directed graph with three parameters to represent the morphology of such a modular robotic system.",

In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for a multi-robot system with some static sensors. The system concept is that static sensors sense intrusions and act as a cueing sensor to an ensemble of robots. These robots in turn engage the potential intruder, performing surveillance and/or neutralization of the intrusion. To minimize the intruder missing rate and average response time, a STAGS (Shame-level Task Allocation and Gap-based Self-deployment) method is proposed, which is a decentralized method without a central control unit. To further improve the system adaptability under dynamic environments, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) method is proposed to adjust the system parameters of STAGS. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in a dynamic intruder detection task.",

In this framework, a team of robots is supposed to move in an indoor office-like environment. Each robot, after building a local map by using infrared range-finders, achieves a topological representation of the environment by extracting the most significant features via the Hough transform and comparing them with a set of predefined environmental patterns. The local view of each robot which is significantly constrained by its limited sensing capabilities is then strengthened by a collaborative aggregation schema based on the Transferable Belief Model (TBM). In this way, a better representation of the environment is achieved by each robot with a minimal exchange of information. A preliminary experimental validation carried out by exploiting data collected from a self-made team of robots is proposed.",

Less interest has been devoted to investigate a parallel or distributed organization of such algorithms in the perspective of multi-robot exploration. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for map estimation based on Gauss-Seidel relaxation. The complete map is shared among independent tasks running on each robot, which integrate the independent robot measurements in local submaps, and a server, which stores contour nodes separating the submaps. Each task updates its local submap and periodically checks for inter-robot data associations. Gauss-Seidel relaxation is performed independently on each robot and afterwards on the contour nodes set on the server. Results illustrate the potential and flexibility of the new approach.",

We have adapted a Voronoi diagram based approach for the analysis of local clearance and environment structure. We also propose to treat human differently from other obstacles for which the robot constructs different sets of regions around human and iteratively converges to a set of points (milestones), using social conventions, human proximity guidelines and clearance constraints to generate and modify its path smoothly. Once equipped with such capabilities, robot is able to do higher-level reasoning for dynamic and selective adaptation of social convention depending upon the environment segment. It also leads the robot to be aware about its own motion behavior.",

The trajectory data is transmitted wirelessly via an RF module to a computer. The received trajectories are then classified to one of six control commands for navigating a car-robot. The classifier adopts the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to classify hand trajectories. Simulation results show that the classifier could achieve 92.2% correct rate.",

Their extraordinary mobility, agility, and adaptability are features sought after when developing competent, useful mobile walkers. Externally witnessed behaviors have been successfully implemented in walking robots for decades with great success. More recent years of biological study have solved some of the mysteries surrounding the actual neurobiological methods for mobilizing these legged wonders. This paper describes the first implementation of these neurobiological mechanisms in a physical hexapod robot that is capable of generating adaptive stepping actions with the same underlying control method as an insect.",

Our approach is hierarchical. At the top level, we check whether the specification, which is a regular expression over the requests, is distributable among the robots given their service and cooperation capabilities; if the answer is positive, we generate individual specifications in the form of finite state automata, and interaction rules in the form of synchronizations on shared requests. At the bottom level, we check whether the local specifications and the synchronizations can be implemented given the motion and communication constraints of the robots; if the answer is positive, we generate robot motion and service plans, which are then mapped to control and communication strategies. We illustrate the method with experimental and simulation results.",

The relation computation over convex hull points is used to compare the similarity between the scenes. It relies on the relative ordering of the feature strength, not directly on the feature vectors. We first deal with multiple convex hulls over the detected features and then compile statistics for coding on the hull points through a vector magnitude comparison. Finally, the hull points are formed by binary codes. The codes are suitable for scene change detection and visual place recognition by statistical analysis. The experimental results show the coding method is robust under the varying environment.",

This is accomplished by extending the Fast Marching level-set method of propagating interfaces in 3D lattices with an analytical kyno-dynamic metric which embodies robot stability in the given terrain. This is particularly relevant for reconfigurable platforms which significantly modify their mass distribution through posture adaptation, such as robots equipped with manipulator arms or varying traction arrangements. Results obtained from applying the proposed strategy in a mobile rescue robot operating on simulated and real terrain data illustrate the validity of the proposed strategy.",

The structure is simple, and this sensor consists of two layers, an elastic layer and a substrate layer. The elastic layer is made of an elastic material and has a cylindrical permanent magnet. The substrate layer is a glass epoxy board and has four GMR(giant magneto resistance) elements and four chip inductors. Each element outputs voltages as to a magnetic flux density when the elastic layer deforms by a contact. A force vector and a slip detection are calculated from these outputs. Laboratory experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this tactile sensor.",

By understanding the spatial effects in human-lived environments, the robot not only predicts pedestrian intentions and trajectories but also behaves socially acceptable motions. Moreover, the concept of pedestrian ego-graph (PEG) is proposed to efficiently query pedestrian-like paths for trajectory prediction.

        "abstract": "Estimating a user's intention is central to close human-robot cooperation. In this paper, the problem of performing intention recognition with tree-structured Dynamic Bayesian Networks for large environments with many features is addressed. The proposed approach reduces the computational complexity of inference O(bs) for tree-structured measurement models with an average branching factor b and tree height s to O(b\u0303s), where b\u0303 \u226a b. The key idea is to switch between a finite set of reduced system and measurement models in order to restrict inference to the most important features. A model predictive approach to online switching between the reduced models is proposed that exploits an upper bound of the distances of the reduced models to the full model. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated in the intention recognition for a humanoid robot using a telepresent household scenario.",

Moments based image features are extracted from three orthogonal ultrasound images to servo in-plane and out-of-plane motions of the system. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves upon techniques based on a single 2D US image in term of probe positioning. The second contribution of this paper is to use this method to perform a multimodal registration task by formulating it as a virtual visual servoing problem. Multimodal registration experiments performed with an ultrasound phantom containing an egg-shaped object provide a first experimental validation of the proposed method.",

The hybrid localization method of straight line matching, corner matching and odometry is proposed. The hardware and software configuration is introduced. Robot detects environment using a 2D laser range finder. Line feature extraction process including area divided, iterative end point fit (IEPF) and a least square technique is introduced. Based on line feature, straight lines and corners as geometry features are obtained. The odometry localization algorithm, straight line localization algorithm and corner localization algorithm are discussed. Artificial Potential Field (APF) based path planning algorithms is implemented. As a result stable localization is achieved with position and orientation resolution as 50mm, 5 degree. A good performance for the method is also achieved with cycle time as 120ms. Experiment shows the effectiveness of the hybrid localization method.",

It is extended by an active foveal vision system. Adding the active vision component is easily integrated within the architecture and improves the recognition rate on previous experiments on the COIL-100 database and for scenes where segmentation of objects is not trivial. Furthermore the active component allows to substantially increase the spatial area where objects can be tracked. When objects move faster than visual servoing can track, catch-up saccades are autonomously generated.",

Incremental structure from motion with sparse bundle adjustment using a stereo camera provides real-time highly accurate pose estimates of the sensor which are combined with six degree-of-freedom inertial measurements in an Extended Kalman Filter. The filter is structured to neatly handle the incremental and local nature of the visual odometry measurements and to handle uncertainties in the system in a principled manner. We present accurate results from data acquired in rural and urban scenes on a tractor and a passenger car travelling distances of several kilometers.",

The simulations show that: integrating some clamping devices and some lockable passive joints, six actuators are enough to build a legged manipulator which can not only perform 6-axis machining but can also walk on a curved supporting media. Using the \u201cmodified condition number\u201d index, the two mechanisms are compared. They have similar workspaces and static wrench performances during the machining phase. During walking processes, however, their behaviors are different, and each of them shows interesting features depending on application requirement.",

They have been used in many areas such as industrial robots, rehabilitation tools, haptic devices, and medical/welfare robots. Pneumatic actuators are generally used in multi-DOF pneumatic system and have complicated systems that include a compressor, air tubes, and pneumatic valves with electrical wires. This research proposes a new control method for a multiplex pneumatic transmission constructed with special resonant valves and driven independently with air vibration in air supply tube without electrical wires. The control method simplifies the driving system and is effective for pneumatic systems having many degrees of freedom. In this paper, the development of a prototype model of the resonant valve is described. In addition, two control methods, which are a superimposing method and a time-sharing method for multi-valve control, are proposed and evaluated.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new mechanical structure for adjustable stiffness devices with lightweight and small size. The proposed structure utilize a ball screw mechanism to adjust a relationship between infinitesimal displacements of joint rotation and a linear spring. Then, stiffness around the joint is adjusted. Unlike many of other adjustable stiffness structures, available elastic energy of the elastic element is maximum when the stiffness of the proposed structure is maximum. Therefore, the elastic element of this structure can be smaller and more lightweight than the other structures. Another advantage of the proposed structure is to require fewer and smaller mechanical parts, because the proposed mechanism mostly requires the ball screw mechanism and the linear spring. We developed an actual hardware to test the proposed structure.",

We present a new sonar feature structure suitable for a cluttered environment and the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based SLAM scheme. The key concept is to extract circle feature clouds on salient convex objects by sonar data association. The centroid of each circle cloud, called a sonar salient feature, is used as a natural landmark for EKF-based SLAM. After completing initial exploration in an unknown environment, SLAM-able areas with sonar salient features can be defined, and cylindrical objects are placed conveniently at weak SLAM-able areas as a supplemental environmental saliency to enhance SLAM performance. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed sonar salient feature structure for EKF-based SLAM.",

The basic structure of the robot is described, and the omnidirectional mobility of the robot is analyzed. Further, an admittance based human-machine interaction controller is introduced for power assistance. Experiments are implemented, and the experimental results show that the pushing force can be reduced and well controlled arbitrarily as designed.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It will be shown that the global cost of the task allocations obtained with fast greedy algorithms can be improved upon by using a class of auction methods called Stochastic Clustering Auctions (SCAs). SCAs use stochastic transfers or swaps between the task clusters assigned to each team member, allow both uphill and downhill cost movements, and rely on simulated annealing. The choice of a key annealing parameter and turning the uphill movements on and off enables the converged solution of a SCA to slide in the region between the global optimal performance and the performance associated with a random allocation. The first SCA, called GSSCA, was based on a Gibbs Sampler, which constrained the stochastic cluster reallocations to simple single transfers or swaps. This paper presents a new and more efficient SCA, called SWSCA, based on the generalized Swendsen-Wang method that enables more complex and efficient movements between clusters by connecting tasks that appear to be synergistic and then stochastically reassigning these connected tasks. For centralized auctioning, extensive numerical experiments are used to compare the performance of SWSCA with GSSCA in terms of costs and computational and communication requirements. Distributed SWSCA is then compared with centralized SWSCA using communication links between robots that were motivated by a generic topology called a \u201cscale free network\u201d.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and development of a new actuator with adjustable stiffness (AwAS) which can be used in robots which are necessary to work close to or physically interact with humans, e.g. humanoids and exoskeletons. The actuator presented in this work can independently control equilibrium position and stiffness by two motors. The first motor controls the equilibrium position while the second motor regulates the compliance. The novelty of the proposed design with respect to the existing systems is on the principle used to regulate the compliance. This is done not through the tuning of the pretension of the elastic element as in the majority of existing system but by controlling the fixation of the elastic elements (springs) using a linear drive. An important consequence of this approach is that the displacement needed to change the stiffness is perpendicular to the forces generated by the springs, thus this helps to minimize the energy/power required to change the stiffness. This permits the use of a small motor for the stiffness adjustment resulting in a lighter setup. Experimental results are presented to show the ability of AwAS to control position and regulate the stiffness independently.",

This is a difficult problem because of the constraints imposed by the available time and the computational cost of robust object extraction algorithms. This report describes a new method that benefits from state of the art background/foreground classification combined with the strong theoretical foundations of clustering. The pixels on the scene background are modeled as Mixtures of Gaussians and the output of the classification process are continuous values representing the likelihood that each pixel belongs to the foreground. The clustering is based on a Self Organizing Network (SON) which has a robust initialization schema and is able to find the number of objects in an image or grid. The algorithm's complexity is linear with respect to the number of pixels or cells.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Numerous rehabilitation robots have been developed to deliver therapy for hemiplegic patients with a unilateral-disabled limb or for aged persons with motor-function degenerated limbs. Recently, much attention has been paid to the development of robots that support bilateral arm training in various patterns. It has been proved that the coordination of two limbs can reduce hypertonia and abnormal synergies compared to unilateral limb training. However, traditional robots realized different modes with the robot providing a corresponding force for the impaired limb. This paper proposes a novel bimanual training system. A subject controls master and slave terminal handles with his/her two limbs. The less impaired limb provides a corresponding force for the more impaired limb to achieve different training patterns. No matter in which mode, the two limbs accomplish symmetric movement. An experimental prototype was built. Frequency response test and training tests on 9 healthy subjects in active-resisted and active-assisted modes were performed. Experimental results confirm that the system can correctly respond a subject's commands if velocity was changed within the frequency range of 30 Hz. For each training mode, the average position error, and RMS (root mean square) values of position errors and velocity errors that between the reference values and actual values of a motion tracking task were reduced after practice. This proves the effectiveness of the system for self-assisted rehabilitation training.",

        "abstract": "Knowing the time at which sensors acquired data is critical to the proper processing and interpretation of that data, particularly for mobile robots attempting to project sensor data into a consistent coordinate frame. Unfortunately, many popular commercial sensors provide no support for synchronization, rendering conventional synchronization algorithms useless. In this paper, we describe a passive synchronization algorithm that can significantly reduce timing error versus naively time-stamping sensor data when it arrives at the host. It is passive in the sense that the algorithm requires no special cooperation from the sensor. Our method estimates the timing jitter induced by hosts, and thus does not require a real-time operating system. We rigorously derive and characterize the method, proving that it can only improve upon the synchronization accuracy of the standard approach.",

Moreover, the agent can perform multiple tasks and each task can be achieved by applying different plans, therefore the decision about which strategy is the most convenient, given the current situation of the world, is important for assessing an intelligent overall behavior of the agent. This paper tackles the problem of on-line execution monitoring in a novel way with respect to previous work, since: (1) it considers uncertainty in the duration of actions with a probabilistic model of action duration; (2) it evaluates the cost of each possible plan at run-time in terms of probability of successful termination within a desired expected time. The approach has been evaluated both in a robotic soccer and a surveillance scenario.",

The aim of the present work is to provide a humanoid robot with cognitive, perceptual and motor skills fundamental for the acquisition of a rudimentary form of language. We present a novel probabilistic model, inspired by the findings in cognitive sciences, able to associate spoken words with their perceptually grounded meanings. The main focus is set on acquiring the meaning of various perceptual categories (e.g. red, blue, circle, above, etc.), rather than specific world entities (e.g. an apple, a toy, etc.). Our probabilistic model is based on a variant of multi-instance learning technique, and it enables a robotic platform to learn grounded meanings of adjective/noun terms. The systems could be used to understand and generate appropriate natural language descriptions of real objects in a scene, and it has been successfully tested on the NAO humanoid robotic platform.",

        "abstract": "The ability to recognize objects and to localize them precisely is essential in all service robotic applications. One of the main challenges for service robots during operation lies in the handling of unavoidable uncertainties which originate from model and sensor inaccuracies and are characteristic for realistic application scenarios. Robustness under real world conditions can only be achieved when the dominant uncertainties are explicitly represented and purposefully managed by the robot's control system. We therefore adopt a probabilistic approach in which environment perception over time is regarded as a sequential estimation process and follow a Bayesian filtering methodology. Under these assumptions probabilistic models of the robot's perception systems play a decisive role. In this paper we describe our object localization system which is based on local features and uses 3D models that are created in an off-line modeling process. A probabilistic model of the errors, which occur in the 6D localization based on local features, is directly derived from the pose reconstruction procedure. Experimental results from an household scenario illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a topological SLAM system using a purely vision-based approach. This robot utilizes a GPU-based omnidirectional catadioptric stereovision system to perceive and plan its path in the environment. Subsequently, the omnidirectional images generated are used to incrementally build a database of image signatures based on the standard 2D Haar Wavelet decomposition. In order to maintain a globally consistent topological map, a relaxation algorithm, which requires local metric information between nodes, is employed each time the appearance-based localization system revisits an existing node in the topological map. The relative transformation of the current position of the robot with respect to the actual position of the matched node is recovered by using a least squares estimation of the transformation parameters of two 3D point patterns generated by the stereovision system. In addition, local metric information is obtained by using the proposed visual odometry system which combines distance measurements calculated by using optical flow techniques which estimates the movement of a web camera relative to the ground being observed and bearing estimates from the omnidirectional catadioptric vision system. Experiments were conducted in a variety of environments ranging from indoor to outdoor environments which demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.",

        "abstract": "We present an efficient path planner for smart wheelchairs based on harmonic potential fields. While the use of harmonic fields can always guarantee finding an existing path, they are extremely computational intensive and a sufficiently detailed map of the environment may lead to an unfeasible solution for the path. Also, since our target application is for the navigation of a smart wheelchair, for people with severe disabilities, the path provided by the harmonic field is frequently too sharp and needs to be smoothened. In order to address the first problem, we propose a parallel algorithm implemented using Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform. And for the second problem, we developed a rubber band model that provides extra forces to be added to the attracting forces of the harmonic fields. This model assumes that the path is an elastic line, a rubber band, connecting the source and destination points. This rubber band simulates the internal tension forces trying to tighten the line. As the result section demonstrates, both the original path from the harmonic field alone and the path smoothened by the rubber band model have approximate the same length, but the first path contains many bumps, sharp angles, and zig-zags, while the second one provides a much more comfortable ride for the passenger of the wheelchair. Either one is executed in real-time, allowing the proposed method to be used for real navigation of smart wheelchairs.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework for visual navigation with simultaneous obstacle avoidance. The obstacles are modeled by using a vortex potential field, derived from an occupancy grid. Kinematic redundancy guarantees that obstacle avoidance and navigation are achieved concurrently, and the whole scheme is merely sensor-based. The problem is solved both in an obstacle-free and in a dangerous context, and the control law is smoothened in the intermediate situations. In a series of simulations, we show that with our framework, a robot can replay a taught visual path while avoiding collisions, even in the presence of visual occlusions.",

        "abstract": "Future normally-unmanned oil platforms offer potentially significantly lower commissioning and operation costs than their current manned counterparts. The ability to initiate and perform remote inspection and maintenance (I&M) operations is crucial for maintaining such platforms. This paper presents a system solution, including key components such as a 3D robot vision system, a robot tool and a control architecture for remote I&M operations on processes similar to those on topside oil platforms. In particular, a case study on how to automatically replace a battery in a wireless process sensor is investigated. A novel robot tool for removing and re-attaching the sensor lid has been designed. Moreover, a robot control architecture for remote control of industrial-type robot manipulators is presented. A 3D robot vision system for localizing the sensor lid and the battery has been developed. The system utilizes structured light, using an off-the-shelf projector and a standard machine vision camera. A novel, robust and fast vision algorithm called 3D-MaMa has been adapted to work for object localization and pose estimation in complex scenes, in our case the process equipment in our lab facility. Experimental results from our lab facility are presented which describe a series of battery replacement operations for various unknown positions of the wireless sensor, and we report on accuracies and success ratios. The experiments demonstrate that the described vision system is able to recover the full pose and orientation of an object, and that the results are directly applicable for controlling advanced robot contact operations. Moreover, the custom-built lid operation tool demonstrates successful results.",

Drawing from prior work in handwriting recognition, sketches are modeled as a variable duration hidden Markov model, where the distributions on the states and transitions are learned from training data. A forward search algorithm on the gesture, stroke, and stroke transition observations is used to find the most likely sketch, which is displayed to the user for confirmation. In cases where the most likely sketch is incorrect, the user can reject it, prompting the next most likely sketch to be displayed. Upon confirmation from the user, the robot executes the desired behaviors. A prototype sketch interface was implemented using a pen tablet; two sets of search-and-identify experiments were conducted using a single robot in an indoor environment to test the usability of the proposed framework. Even novice users were able to successfully complete the missions, including those on whom the algorithm was not trained. User surveys indicate that operators generally found the interface to be natural and easy to use.",

Previous work by the authors proposed so-called logical consensus approach, by which a network of agents, that can exchange binary values representing their local estimates of the events, is able to reach a unique and consistent decision. The approach therein proposed is based on the construction of an iterative map, whose computation is centralized and guaranteed under suitable conditions on the input visibility and graph connectivity. Under the same conditions, we extend the approach in this work by allowing the construction of a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable in a fully distributed way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is showed through the real implementation of a wireless sensor network as a framework for the surveillance of an urban area.",

Robust and computationally inexpensive localization is implemented on the sensor platform using a particle filter on a 2D grid map generated by projecting 3D points on to the ground. The system uses small and low-cost sensors, and can be applied to a variety of mobile robots in human-scale environments.

It is usually solved using various nonlinear-based control methods, which are often not easy to implement or tune. Similar to other work focused on backing a single axle trailer with a car like vehicle, we propose a two-tier controller that is simple and intuitive. However, ours is based upon curvature as opposed to hitch angle, which allows the control input to be more directly related to path specification and to handle path curvature discontinuity better. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the capability of this new algorithm applied to a full scale autonomous vehicle and trailer system in a real field environment using minimal sensing capability. Results demonstrate good performance on sloped grounds with various grades.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a model of the kinematics and dynamics of a planar, wheelless snake robot aimed at control design and stability analysis purposes. The proposed model is significantly less complex than existing models of planar snake robot locomotion. The paper presents an analysis of an existing complex snake robot model which reveals a set of essential properties that characterize the overall motion of a planar snake robot. The proposed model is developed to capture only these essential properties of snake locomotion, thereby significantly reducing the complexity compared to the original model used in the analysis. The paper presents simulation results that indicate that the qualitative behaviour of the proposed model and the original complex model are similar, and that a quantitative similarity is achieved with a proper choice of numerical values of the friction coefficients in the two models.",

        "abstract": "Animals exhibit astoundingly adaptive and supple locomotion under real world constraints. In order to endow robots with similar capabilities, we must implement many degrees of freedom, equivalent to animals, into the robots' bodies. For taming many degrees of freedom, the concept of autonomous decentralized control plays a pivotal role. However, a systematic way of designing such autonomous decentralized control system is still missing. Aiming at understanding the principles that underlie animals' locomotion, in our early studies, we focused on plasmodium of true slime mold, a primitive living organism, and extracted a design scheme for autonomous decentralized control system. In order to demonstrate the relevance of this design scheme, this paper presents a soft-bodied fluid-driven amoeboid robot inspired by plasmodium of true slime mold. The significant features of this robot are twofold: (1) the robot has fluidic circuit (i.e., cylinders and nylon tubes filled with fluid) and truly soft and deformable body stemming from real-time tunable springs, the former serves as protoplasm and the latter is used for elastic actuators; and (2) a fully decentralized control using coupled oscillators with completely local sensory feedback mechanism is realized by exploiting the long-distance physical interaction between the body parts stemming from the law of conservation of protoplasmic mass. The experimental results show that this robot exhibits truly supple locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure. The results obtained are expected to shed new light on design scheme for autonomous decentralized control system.",

The system consists of a 7-DOF redundant manipulator, a 2-DOF docking mechanism, a set of stereo vision and general subsystems of a spacecraft platform. This system can serve most existing GEO satellites, not requiring specially designed objects for grappling and measuring on the target. The serving tasks include: (a) visual inspecting; (b) target tracking, approaching and docking; (c) ORUs (Orbital Replacement Units) replacement; (d) un-deployed mechanism deploying; (e) extending satellites lifespan by replacing its own controller. As an example, the servicing mission of a malfunctioned GEO satellite with three severe mechanical failures is presented and simulated. The results show the validity and flexibility of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a generic method for vision-based navigation in real urban environments. The proposed approach relies on a representation of the scene based on spherical images augmented with depth information and a spherical saliency map, both constructed in a learning phase. Saliency maps are built by analyzing useful information of points which best condition spherical projections constraints in the image. During navigation, an image-based registration technique combined with robust outlier rejection is used to precisely locate the vehicle. The main objective of this work is to improve computational time by better representing and selecting information from the reference sphere and current image without degrading matching. It will be shown that by using this pre-learned global spherical memory no error is accumulated along the trajectory and the vehicle can be precisely located without drift.",

Tracking is implemented within the particle filter framework, and the high dimensionality problem is solved through partitioned sampling. Taking advantage of the stereo setup, we propose a depth cue which resolves the problem of missing depth information in monocular tracking. Three other cues, the edge cue, the color cue and the distance cue, are also integrated into the system to enhance the tracking performance. The system is tested using the publicly available CMU MOCAP database which also includes ground truth data, and this enables us to analyze the results quantitatively and compare the relative usefulness of different cues. The system is shown to be capable of tracking challenging videos accurately and robustly in near real-time.",

However, the foot structure is different from a human's. In this paper, we describe a new foot mechanism capable of mimicking the human's foot arch structure to figure out the function of the arch structure. Especially, the developed foot mimics the elastic properties of the arch of the human's foot and the change of the arch height during walking. The foot mechanism consists of a passive joint in the internal toe, a passive joint in the external toe, and a joint in the foot arch. We conducted several walking experiments by using WABIAN-2R, and the function of the arch structure is clarified quantitatively. As a result, we confirmed that the arch elasticity could absorb a foot-landing force at the plantar contact phase and the change of the arch height contributed to a strong thrust at the push-off phase.",

Of the three spherical coordinates (azimuth, elevation, distance) only the azimuth direction is extracted in most robot audition systems. So far rarely investigated is the issue of estimating the distance between robot and sound source. In this article we describe a study on distance estimation using a binaural robot system in an indoor environment for sounds ranging in distance from 0.5 to 6m. We investigated several proposed audio cues like interaural differences (IID and ITD), sound amplitude, and spectral characteristics. All cues are computed within the framework of audio proto objects. In an extensive experimental setup with more than 10000 sounds we found that both mean signal amplitude and binaural cues can, under certain circumstances, provide a very reliable distance estimation. There was no observable effect of frequency dependent attenuation so that the spectral amplitude cue was only slightly above chance level. We also investigated the loss of precision of azimuth estimation with distance. In contrast to what could be expected, the performance does not severely deteriorate when the system is calibrated for different distances.",

The dynamical role division in which each subject plays a specialized role without conscious understanding is a key issue that brings the efficiency to the performance of the crank-cooperation work. By investigating kinetics and muscle activities, we found out interesting results about the correlation between the muscle activities and the hand motion, thus, suggesting a method to design control of robots which involve in the crank-cooperation task and presumably in other cooperative interaction with humans.",

However, manipulation of forceps throughout the surgery continues to be a burden to surgeons. Our previous research focused on designing a model that could carry forceps and a camera through the abdominal cavity. The first prototype, a wire-tube driven micro robot, relied on the action of two suction cups for movement along the peritoneum (abdominal wall). However, the actions required to carry out the turning motions of the first prototype were strongly influenced by the rigidity of the tube. In order to solve this problem, in this study, we proposed a wire-wire driving mechanism for the robot, then developed a simulation model for investigating design and control issues. Based on the investigation, a new prototype was designed to determine the feasibility of the robot. Our results showed the robot's potential as a NOTES support device.",

This tactile sensing is useful when a multi-jointed multi-fingered robotic hand manipulates a tool which has a joint. This estimation requires sensing of the location of a contact point and the direction of an edge of the tool as contact information measured by a robotic fingertip. A conventional hard fingertip with a force sensor can measure only the location of a contact point. In contrast, we have already developed a robotic fingertip with a force sensor and a soft skin, and it can measure not only the location of a contact point but also the direction of an edge of an object. The estimation of a joint-axis of a linked object is demonstrated by using the soft fingertip.",

This paper shows an improved version, which has been integrated on the hand of the humanoid robot iCub. The fingertip is 14.5 mm long and 13 mm wide. The capacitive pressure sensor system has 12 sensitive zones and includes the electronics to send the 12 measurements over a serial bus with only 4 wires. Each synthetic fingertip is shaped approximately like a human fingertip. Furthermore, an integral part of the capacitive sensor is soft silicone foam, and therefore the fingertip is compliant. We describe the structure of the fingertip, their integration on the humanoid robot iCub and present test results to show the characteristics of the sensor.",

We present a novel motion planning algorithm which uses a group of heterogeneous robots to search for the path to the target. The algorithm assigns the robots in pairs, each two robots within a pair have the same velocity, and are cooperating to search for the path to the target. The algorithm artificially bounds each pair's search to an ellipse whose focal points are the start and the target points. Each robot pair has a different velocity, thus each pair is assigned to an ellipse with an area corresponding to the search time according to its velocity. The algorithm's performance is analyzed using time competitiveness definitions, and its upper bound is proved to be quadratic in the optimal off-line solution. The algorithm is complete and robust.",

        "abstract": "A multi-robotic exploration with the requirement of communication link to a fixed base station is presented in this paper. The robots organize themselves into roles of maintainers of communication (hinged robots or robot nodes) or explorers of the environment ensuring that every robot is in contact with the base station directly or through the hinged robots. A two phased strategy for the same is presented. The first phase is characterized by a recursive growth of trees that starts from the root node or the base station and then repeated from other nodes of the hitherto grown tree in a depth first fashion. The second phase constitutes the recursive tree growth invoked repeatedly from the frontier nodes. While the first phase rapidly explores areas around the base station in a concentric fashion, the second phase extends the depth of the explored area to increase the limits of coverage. The strategy is consistent in that none of the robots loose contact with the base station. Extensive simulations confirm the efficacy of the method and comparisons portray performance gain in terms of exploration time and absence of deadlocks vis-a-vis the few methods previously reported in the literature.",

This paper presents a unified approach to control a rather general class of robotic systems with closed loops under a set of linear equality and inequality constraints using the notion of projection operator. The controller does not require the kinematic constraints to be independent, i.e., systems with time-varying topology can be dealt with, while demanding minimum-norm actuation force or torque in the case that the system becomes redundant. The orthogonal decomposition of the generalized force yields the tangential (potent) and normal (impotent) components leads. The tangential component is obtained using projected inverse dynamics control law, while the optimal normal component is found through solving a quadratic programming problem, in which the equality and inequality constraints are derived to be equivalent to the originally specified ones. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate how the control technique can be applied to multi-arms manipulation of an object.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A vision based exploration algorithm that invokes semantic cues for constructing a hybrid map of images - a combination of semantic and topological maps is presented in this paper. At the top level the map is a graph of semantic constructs. Each node in the graph is a semantic construct or label such as a room or a corridor, the edge represented by a transition region such as a doorway that links the two semantic constructs. Each semantic node embeds within it a topological graph that constitutes the map at the middle level. The topological graph is a set of nodes, each node representing an image of the higher semantic construct. At the low level the topological graph embeds metric values and relations, where each node embeds the pose of the robot from which the image was taken and any two nodes in the graph are related by a transformation consisting of a rotation and translation. The exploration algorithm explores a semantic construct completely before moving or branching onto a new construct. Within each semantic construct it uses a local feature based exploration algorithm that uses a combination of local and global decisions to decide the next best place to move. During the process of exploring a semantic construct it identifies transition regions that serve as gateways to move from that construct to another. The exploration is deemed complete when all transition regions are marked visited. Loop detection happens at transition regions and graph relaxation techniques are used to close loops when detected to obtain a consistent metric embedding of the robot poses. Semantic constructs are labeled using a visual bag of words(VBOW) representation with a probabilistic SVM classifier.",

        "abstract": "We present a new method to generate biped walking patterns for biped robots on uneven terrains. Our formulation uses a universal stability criterion that checks whether the resultant of the gravity wrench and the inertia wrench of a robot lies in the convex cone of the wrenches resulting from contacts between the robot and the environment. We present an algorithm to compute the feasible acceleration of the robot's CoM (center of mass) and use that algorithm to generate biped walking patterns. Our approach is more general and applicable to uneven terrains as compared with prior methods based on the ZMP (zero-moment point) criterion. We highlight its applications on some benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Extended range telepresence aims at enabling a user to experience virtual or remote environments, taking his own body movements as an input to define walking speed and viewing direction. Therefore, localization and tracking of the user's pose (position and orientation) is necessary to perform a body-centered scene rendering. Visual and acoustic feedback is provided to the user by a head mounted display (HMD). To allow for free movement within the user environment, the tracking system is supposed to be user-wearable and entirely wireless. Consequently, a lightweight design is presented featuring small dimensions to fit into a conventional 13\u2033 laptop backpack, which satisfies the above stated demands for highly immersive extended range telepresence scenarios. Tracking is performed by measuring the time-of-flight (TOF) of coded acoustic signals between a set of fixed loudspeakers and a user-worn microphone array. Dedicated embedded hardware combined with off-the-shelf components is employed to form a robust, low-cost telepresence system that can be easily installed in any living room.",

Dynamic and extended kinematic models that take into account the effects of wheel skidding are presented. Based on the extended kinematic model, an adaptive and predictive controller for path tracking is derived. This control law is combined to a stabilization algorithm of yaw motion, based on the dynamic model and the modulation of driven wheel forces. The overall control architecture is experimentally evaluated on a slipping terrain. Results demonstrate enhanced performances as the robot succeed in following the path at high speed, accurately and without loss of control.",

        "abstract": "Automated electric vehicles for public use constitute a promising very efficient and environment-friendly \u201curban transportation system\u201d. An additional functionality that could enhance this transportation service is vehicle platooning. In order to avoid inter-distance oscillations within the platoon, a global control strategy, supported by inter-vehicle communications, is investigated. Vehicle localization in an absolute frame is needed and is derived here from monocular vision. The vision data is however expressed in a virtual world, slightly distorted with respect to the actual metric one. It is shown that such a distortion can accurately be corrected by designing a nonlinear observer that relies on odometric data. A global decentralized control strategy, relying on nonlinear control techniques, can then be designed to achieve accurate vehicle platooning. Simulations and full-scale experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",

The membrane is filled with translucent red colored water. The algorithm for calculation of the contact region is based on the curvature radius of the elastic membrane and considerations of the conditions for balance between the tensional forces of the membrane and the inner pressure. The location of the object is calculated from the relations between the translational displacement of the object and the displacement of the contacting dots. The rotation angles of the object are estimated from the rotation matrix of the three basis vectors by accumulating changes of the rotation angles of the rotation matrix for applying to the object rolling on the sensor. This paper also provides some experimental results that demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. Proposed method can be applied in many robot tasks that require dexterity of the robot hands.",

In this work, we consider an essential problem in NRS, namely how to perform task planning given the limitations both in on-board sensing as well as in the environment's sensors. Partially observable Markov decisions processes (POMDPs) form an attractive framework to address planning in the uncertain environments that typify NRS. We show how to model a typical cooperative perception task in a NRS, namely tracking and classifying people, and we present experiments that show how the proposed approach results in an effective interplay between robot and environment sensors.",

However, accurate and efficient estimation of these object parameters may be challenging due to complex, highly nonlinear underlying physical processes. To improve on the quality of otherwise hand-crafted solutions, automatic generation of control strategies can be helpful. We present a framework that uses active learning to help with sequential gathering of data samples,using information-theoretic ciriteria to find the optimal actions to perform at each time step. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a robotic hand-arm setup, where the task involves shaking bottles of different liquids in order to determine the liquid's viscosity from only tactile feedback. We optimize the shaking frequency and the rotation angle of shaking in an online manner in order to speed up convergence of estimates.",

        "abstract": "In an object manipulation dialogue, a robot may misunderstand an ambiguous command from a user, such as \u201cPlace the cup down (on the table),\u201d potentially resulting in an accident. Although making confirmation questions before all motion will decrease the risk of this failure, the user will find it more convenient if confirmation questions are not made under trivial situations. This paper proposes a method for estimating ambiguity in the commands by introducing an active learning framework with Bayesian logistic regression to human-robot spoken dialogue. We conducted physical experiments in which a user and a manipulator-based robot communicated in spoken language to manipulate toys.",

        "abstract": "For the control of unmanned helicopters in full flight envelope, an active model based control scheme is developed in this paper. An adaptive set-membership filter (ASMF) is used to online estimate both the model error due to flight mode change and its boundary, taking advantage of ASMF, so that the model error can be assumed unknown but bounded (UBB). The proposed approach is practical because the model error depends on both helicopter dynamics and flight states, and may not be assumed as white noise. An active modeling based stationary increment predictive control (AMSIPC) is also proposed based on the estimated model error and its boundary to optimally compensate the model error, as well as the aerodynamics time delay. The proposed method has been implemented on the ServoHeli-20 unmanned helicopter platform and experimentally tested, and the results have demonstrated its effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to probabilistic active perception planning for scene modeling in cluttered and realistic environments. When dealing with complex, multi-object scenes with arbitrary object positions, the estimation of 6D poses including their expected uncertainties is essential. The scene model keeps track of the probabilistic object hypotheses over several sequencing sensing actions to represent the real object constellation. To improve detection results and to tackle occlusion problems a method for active planning is proposed which reasons about model and state transition uncertainties in continuous and high-dimensional domains. Information theoretic quality criteria are used for sequential decision making to evaluate probability distributions. The probabilistic planner is realized as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The active perception system for autonomous service robots is evaluated in experiments in a kitchen environment. In 80 test runs the efficiency and satisfactory behavior of the proposed methodology is shown in comparison to a random and a step-aside action selection strategy. The objects are selected from a large database consisting of 100 different household items.",

This paper describes a method for mapping with a mobile robot the position of a set of nodes using radio signal measurements. The method employs Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) for undelayed initialization of the position of the wireless nodes within a Kalman filter. Moreover, the paper extends the method to consider active sensing strategies in order to map the nodes. Entropy variation is used as a measurement of information gain, and allows to prioritize control actions of the robot. However, as there is no analytical expression for the entropy of a GMM, upper bounds of the entropy, for which close form computation is possible, are used instead. The paper describes simulations that show the feasibility of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the pseudopod mobility mechanism found in amoebas, we propose a toroidal robot which can fold in on itself to generate the same overall motion of the amoeba. One of the advantages of such a robot is its ability to squeeze under obstacles and through holes smaller than its nominal diameter. These abilities make it particularly well suited for unstructured and highly constrained environments such as medical and search and rescue applications. We present several actuation mechanisms which are being investigated towards the development of an everting toroidal robot. For smaller scale applications, we present contracting ring actuators made up of shape memory alloy rings or electroactive polymer rings that create a differential stress and drive the motion. For larger scale applications, we present a tape spring mechanism which uses a membrane composed of treads arranged in a circular pattern. Another large scale mechanism uses a snake-like robot that can be formed into a torus which can ascend and descend cylindrical structures. We also present a chemical actuation method which utilizes chemically induced swelling in crosslinked polymers to produce forward motion. Finally, we describe a novel torus shaped actuator being developed which uses shape memory alloy rings to generate an everting motion.",

Due to the 50 mm translation and 60 degree rotation motion ranges of the desktop-sized device, the transformation between the vector of coil currents and the actuation forces and torques generated on the levitated body varies significantly throughout its motion range. To improve the dynamic performance of the device, the current to force and torque transformation can be recalculated at each control update as the levitated body moves about its workspace, rather than using a constant transformation calculated from the unrotated and centered position of the levitated body. The design of the device is presented and the new methods used to calculate coil current to force and torque transformations for levitation are described. Long-range trajectory following feedback control motion results are shown.",

For the control system of the two-wheeled differential drive mobile robot being in nonhonolomic system and the complex relations among the control parameters, it is difficult to solve the problem based on traditional mathematics model. A new control scheme combined with the fuzzy PD (Proportional and Differential) control and the separate integral control is proposed in this paper. The control scheme can not only make full use of the advantage of the fuzzy control, but also have the good steady state tracking ability of the integral control. However, this control scheme introduces so many parameters which are difficult to optimize. In order to realize the online adaptive learning of the control parameters, the modified VFSA (Very Fast Simulated Annealing) is used. The simulation results show that the method is feasible, and can quickly approach the conference trajectory in a short time, and the trajectory tracking error is very small.",

        "abstract": "The performance of a soccer robot is highly dependent on its motion ability. The kicking motion is one of the most important motions in a soccer game. However, automatic, full body motion generation for humanoid robots presents a formidable computational challenge. At the current state the most common approaches of implementing this motion are based on key frame technique. Such solutions are inflexible, i.e., in order to adjust the aimed direction of the kick the robot has to walk around the ball. The adjustment costs a lot of time especially if some precise adjustments have to be done, e.g., for a penalty kick. In this paper we present an approach for adaptive control of the motions. We implemented our approach in order to solve the task of kicking the ball on a humanoid robot Nao. The approach was tested both in simulation and on a real robot.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive multi-dimensional compliance model reference controller was implemented in real-time on a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) of the humanoid Bristol-Elumotion-Robotic-Torso II (BERT II) arm in Cartesian space. The robot manipulator has been controlled in such a way as to follow the compliant passive behaviour of a reference mass-spring-damper system model subject to externally sensed forces/torques in all DOF. The relevant reference model converts all measured torques into their equivalent forces at the end-effector and reacts accordingly. The suggested control scheme takes in particular account of the multi-variable aspect and the problem of body own torques when measuring external torques. The redundant DOF were used to control the robot motion in a human-like pattern via effort minimization. Associated actuator saturation issues were addressed by incorporating a novel anti-windup (AW) compensator.",

The core of our method is a novel observation model and the way it is automatically adapted to a changing object and background appearance over time. The model is integrated into the well known Condensation algorithm (SIR filter) for statistical inference, and it consists of a boosted ensemble of simple threshold classifiers built upon center-surround Haar-like features, which the filter continuously updates based on the images perceived. We present optimizations and reasonable approximations to limit the computational costs. Thus, the final algorithms are capable of processing video input at real-time. To experimentally investigate the gain of adapting the observation model we compare two different approaches with a non-adapting version of our observation model: maintaining a single observation model for all particles, and maintaining individual observation models for each particle. In addition, experiments were conducted to compare system performances between the proposed algorithms and two other state of the art Condensation based tracking approaches.",

        "abstract": "Replanning is a powerful tool for high dimensional mobile agents in changing environments. However, most works employ replanning periodically. In order to fully exert the merits of this powerful tool, we should concentrate on the time interval employed for each replanning (that is \u201cwhen to replan\u201d) and carry out replanning adaptively. In this paper, an adaptive strategy is proposed to govern replanning in hard changing environments. The key point of this adaptive replanning strategy is to perform local environment accumulation by using grids method, which is a derivative of degenerated potential field. Since the accumulation is only performed locally in the regions between subgoals and only computed towards the changes of obstacles, it increases little computational complexity to parent anytime planners. Our adaptive replanning strategy works as a plug-in to state-of-the-art algorithms and can generate heuristics by using information from projected spaces to overcome high dimensionality. Experiments on different mobile agents in various hard changing environments (environments with crowded and unforseen obstacles) with IDRM-gRRT and IRRT-gRRT showed that the adaptive strategy can improve the performance and robustness of parent anytime planners significantly.",

Yet, such undercarriages are imposed to the risk of actuator fighting and suffer from singular regions within their configuration space. To address these problems we expand a previously developed potential field (PF) based approach by expanding it with a predictive horizon. The proposed method is based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach, incorporating a gradient descent optimization step via the Pontryagin minimum principle. To enforce adherence to the constraints during optimization, we modify the Lagrange-multipliers within the backpropagation of the costates. The proposed approach is evaluated simulatively w.r.t. the undercarriage of the Care-O-bot\u00ae 3 mobile robot and is compared to the potential field based and a model predictive control approach.",

A common example is computing the global mean of a sensor measurement from each agent. We present a practical agreement algorithm, input-based consensus (IBC), that produces bounded error and recovery in the face of significant communications failures in a stochastic distributed system. We compare our algorithm to linear average consensus (LAC), which produces an exact result under ideal conditions, but is not robust to message loss. For both algorithms, we measure performance with respect to a varying percentage of dropped messages. The algorithms are examined analytically, simulated using the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, and demonstrated experimentally on a testbed of 20 robots. In all cases, the IBC algorithm produced reasonable values, even when tested with up to 90% message loss.",

The inverse dynamics model is obtained by the Lagrangian formulation under screw theory, when the Jacobian manipulator depends on the respective twist and joint angles; on the other hand, the POE formula drives a very natural and explicit description of the Jacobian manipulator without the drawbacks of local representation. The forward dynamics were solved by propagation method from an end-effector to the center of gravity (COG) always on the SE(3). Many tests for reference dynamic walking patterns have been carried out, which are represented in simulation and experimental results. The results will be discussed in order to validate the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present results of a feasibility study of airport snow shoveling with multiple formations of autonomous snowplow robots. The main idea of the approach is to form temporary coalitions of vehicles, whose size depends on the width of the roads to be cleaned. We propose to divide the problem of snow shoveling into the subproblems of task allocation and motion coordination. For the task allocation we designed a multi-agent method applicable in the dynamic environment of airports. The motion coordination part focuses on generating trajectories for the vehicle formations based on the output of the task allocation module. Furthermore, we have developed a novel approach of formation stabilization into variable shapes depending on the width of runways. The method using a receding horizon control provides optimal trajectories and inputs for robots' actuators during splitting and coupling of formations. The algorithm can be utilized in arbitrary static and dynamic airport assemblage. All components as well as the complete system have been verified in various simulations and hardware experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, which are presented in the submitted video.",

        "abstract": "Rodents are optimal real-world foragers that can smoothly regulate behaviors like homing and exploration combined with more elaborate abilities as food source localization. Here we investigate a robot based model that implements the self-regulatory processes that underly optimal foraging of rodents in unknown environments and is also able to combine it with goal directed behaviors. Behavior is decomposed into minimal homeostatic subsystems that regulate themselves through the local perception/detection of a gradient. On a higher level, the allostatic control orchestrates the interaction of the different homeostatic modules allowing it to dynamically manage the interactions between the desired values of each subsystem to achieve stability on a meta behavioral level. In this case, we show that overall behavioral stability can be achieved. We validate our model by comparing the behavior of both simulated and real robots with that of rodents. Our next step is then to justify gradients as a valid biological assumption by giving a biologically plausible process for generating them from a cognitive map, in this case, a set of approximated hippocampal place cells. We finally formulate path planning (used for goal reaching, e.g. food source localization) in the same context of a gradient map generation that can be then inserted as an additional subsystem of the higher meta level allostatic control.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the major costs and inhibitors to practical robotics research is the time required for the creation of the embedded systems that implement the discrete event control in experimental robot systems. Using a standardized system architecture can reduce this time, but is often not feasible due to the rapidly varying requirements present in robotics research, and the considerable cost associated with implementing a full-blown standard. This often results in short-term ad-hoc solutions with low reusability and therefore high long-term cost to robotics labs. By utilizing the flexibility offered by reconfigurable electronics, in the form of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), we have arrived at an architecture for low-level control, which is flexible enough to bridge the traditional gaps between size, performance, topology, reusability, high-level integration, and ease of use. Several iterations, have led us to our current implementations: TosNet, which is optimized toward rapid prototyping in experimental modular robotics, and \u03bcTosNet, which has been optimized for simpler experiments and teaching. In this paper we present the overall concept and its background, as well as the two TosNet frameworks, examples of applications, and thoughts on dissemination and future work.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For classical robotic applications, robotic systems consist of servo motors, high-ratio reduction and rigid links; mechanical designers prefer to designing robotic applications as stiff as possible to make robots manipulate with remarkable speed and precise position movements. However, these robotic applications can hardly interact with people and environments under safety constraints. It poses the very fundamental problem of ensuring safety to humans and protecting the robot. This paper presents an active-passive variable stiffness elastic actuator (APVSEA) which is designed for safety robot systems. The APVSEA consists of two DC-motors: one is used to control the position of the joint and the other is used to adjust the stiffness of the system. The stiffness is generated by two antagonistically nonlinear springs. By changing the preload length of the two antagonistically nonlinear springs, APVSEA has the ability to minimize large impact forces due to shocks, to safely interact with the user and/or become as stiff as possible to make precise position movements or trajectory tracking control easier. Experiment results are presented to show that APVSEA is capable of providing precise position movements while offering safe human-robot interaction.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive partition based Random Forests classifier for outdoor terrain classification is presented in this paper. The classifier is a combination of two underlying classifiers. One of which is a random forest learnt over bootstrapped or offline dataset, the second is another random forest that adapts to changes on the fly. Posterior probabilities of both the static and changing/online classifiers are fused to assign the eventual label for the online image data. The online classifier learns at frequent intervals of time through a sparse and stable set of tracked patches, which makes it lightweight and real-time friendly. The learning which is actuated at frequent intervals during the sojourn significantly improves the performance of the classifier vis-a-vis a scheme that only uses the classifier learnt offline or at bootstrap. The method is well suited and finds immediate applications for outdoor autonomous driving where the classifier needs to be updated frequently based on what shows up recently on the terrain and without largely deviating from those learnt at bootstrapping. The role of the partition based classifier to enhance the performance of a regular multi class classifier such as random forests and multi class SVMs is also summarized in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Imitation learning has been recognized as a promising technique to teach robots advanced skills. It is based on the idea that robots could learn new behaviors by observing and imitating the behaviors of other skilled actors. We propose an adaptive probabilistic graphical model which copes with three core issues of any imitative behavior: observation, representation and reproduction of skills. Our model, Growing Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (GHDBN), is hierarchical (i.e. able to characterize structured behaviors at different levels of abstraction), and growing (i.e. skills are learned or updated incrementally - and at each level of abstraction - every time a new observation sequence is available). A GHDBN, once trained, is able to recognize skills being observed and to reproduce them by exploiting the generative power of the model. The system has been successfully tested in simulation, and initial tests have been conducted on a NAO humanoid robot platform.",

The human vision system integrates various monocular and binocular depth estimation mechanisms in order to achieve robust and reliable depth perception. Such an integrated approach can be applied to humanoid depth perception. Integration requires a knowledge of the characteristics of the methods being combined. Three different methods incorporating active vision (stereo disparity, vergence and familiar size) were statistically examined and combinations of these methods based on this statistical examination were investigated. We found evidence that active vision provides better depth estimations than the standard static-parallel stereo methods examined within interaction range and therefore is better suited for tasks like reaching, grasping and manipulation. We also demonstrate that a combination of methods have the potential to increase the accuracy of estimations.",

A parametric solution for all possible geometric poses is generated for a desired end-effector pose (position and orientation). The set of possible geometric poses are completely defined by three circles in the Cartesian space. A method of computing the joint-variables for any geometric pose is presented. An analytical method of identifying a set of feasible poses for some joint-angle constraints is also addressed.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous exploration under uncertain robot position requires the robot to plan a suitable motion policy in order to visit unknown areas while minimizing the uncertainty on its pose. The corresponding problem, namely active SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and exploration has received a large attention from the robotic community for its relevance in mobile robotics applications. In this work we tackle the problem of active SLAM and exploration with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters. We propose an application of Kullback-Leibler divergence for the purpose of evaluating the particle-based SLAM posterior approximation. This metric is then applied in the definition of the expected gain from a policy, which allows the robot to autonomously decide between exploration and place revisiting actions (i.e., loop closing). The technique is shown to enhance robot awareness in detecting loop closing occasions, which are often missed when using other state-of-the-art approaches. Results of extensive tests are reported to support our claims.",

        "abstract": "Often, electronics and packages must be prevented from damages resulting from awkward falls. The goal of this paper is to explore how actuators and control can be used to reorient bodies during free fall. It is well known that motion of a free-falling body or a set of interconnected bodies is characterized by the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The governing angular momentum equations are nonholonomic, i.e., are non-integrable rate equations. In this paper, we assume that the falling system consists of twin bodies interconnected by a hinge joint. One of the twin bodies is designated as the primary body which needs to be reoriented during fall. The secondary body is connected to the primary body by a hinge joint, similar to a protective cover on a cell phone. The relative angle between the twin bodies is actively controlled. In addition, two rotors are mounted on the primary body with axes orthogonal to the axis of the hinge between the twin bodies. The goal of this study is to use the framework of differential flatness to compute trajectories for the hinge joint and the two rotors so that the twin bodies achieve prespecified orientations at the end of the free fall.",

In this paper, we resolve the difficulties by mapping the kinematics of a human arm to that of the manipulator so that we can avoid going through the ill-postured configurations while searching for the desired solutions, and then reach the desired rehabilitation motion as precisely as possible. In addition, this study combines electromyography (EMG) and force sensor to detect the patient's motion on his/her volition, so that the rehab-robot can support the human's upper limb appropriately to fulfill the intended motion.

In human support robotics or medical robotics, the detail comprehension of physical human body is important to develop safe and high performed robots to work cooperatively with a human and to replace human dexterous tasks. It is known that a human arm generates variable stiffness depending on tasks by coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles. Previous related researches have been presented impedance characteristics of a human upper limb in static posture and dynamic motion. These characteristics are represented by ellipsoids. However, the above analyses are based on a simple muscle model and conventional kinematic and dynamics of an articulated body system. In this paper, perturbation-excited method is carried out for estimating the stiffness of a human hand. The experimental results demonstrate nonlinear property of the stiffness of a human hand. To illustrate the observed stiffness characteristic, this paper proposes nonlinear stiffness model of the human hand.",

Once the human motion is recorded, this one is modified to be adapted to the robot morphology. The proposed method could be used for human-like robots of different sizes and masses. The generated gaits are closed to the human's ones while respecting the robot balance and the floor contacts. First the human joint angles are computed from the markers coordinates and applied directly to the robot kinematics model. Then, from this non-corrected motion, the trajectories of both feet and of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) are generated respecting the constraints of floor contact and balance control. From this data, an inverse kinematic algorithm is used to compute the joint angles of the robot according to the feet and ZMP trajectories. The results with the robot HRP-2 (AIST, Kawada Industries, Inc) and the small-sized humanoid HOAP-3 (Fujitsu Automation Ltd) are compared with the human motion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an easily-configurable robot audition system using the Histogram-based Recursive Level Estimation (HRLE) method. In order to achieve natural human-robot interaction, a robot should recognize human speeches even if there are some noises and reverberations. Since the precision of automatic speech recognizers (ASR) have been degraded by such interference, many systems applying speech enhancement processes have been reported. However, performance of most reported systems suffer from acoustical environmental changes. For example, an enhancement process optimized for steady-state noise, such as fan noise, yields low performance when the process is used for non-steady-state noises, such as background music. The primary reason is mismatches of parameters because the appropriate parameters change according to the acoustical environments. To solve this problem, we propose a robot audition system that optimizes parameters adaptively and automatically. Our system applies and non-linear enhancement sub-processes. For the linear sub-process, we used Geometric Source Separation with the Adaptive Step-size method (GSS-AS). This adjusts the parameters adaptively and does not have any manual parameters. For the non-linear sub-process, we applied a spectral subtraction-based enhancement method with the HRLE method that is newly introduced in this paper. Since HRLE controls the threshold level parameter implicitly based on the statistical characteristics of noise and speech levels, our system has high robustness against acoustical environmental changes. For robot audition systems, all processes should be performed in real-time. We also propose implementation techniques to make HRLE run in real-time and show the effectiveness. We evaluate performance of our system and compare it to conventional systems based on the Minima Controlled Recursive Average (MCRA) method and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) method. The experimental results show that our system achieves bett... Show More",

Here, a cooperative approach is presented that addresses the particular challenges of the severe constraints on communication bandwidth in the underwater domain. Concretely, a special update strategy for a cooperatively maintained pose graph as basis for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is introduced. The strategy tries to transmit the most relevant information within the limits of the communication bandwidth to maximize the quality of the cooperative map. It is shown in experiments with simulations based on real world data that the strategy leads to near optimal results while obeying the severe bandwidth constraints of realistic underwater communication.",

The velocity error between desired and actual remote vehicle velocities is reflected in term of force in order to maintain desired velocities by the operator both during the normal driving in obstacle-free environments and when colliding with a high impedance wall. A rate-mode energy-bounding algorithm is devised for these teleoperation scenarios in order to sensitively feel the velocity difference while keeping interaction stability. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by some experimental results in the simulated constant time-delayed environments for vehicles not only in free space but also in contact motions.",

As most controllers require the measurement of the joint positions as well as joint velocities, the latter need to be estimated.

The resulting performances obtained in Real-time experiments by each observer have been detailed and compared.",

In this paper we support the idea that to produce significant advancements in the field of robotics it is important to compare different approaches not only at the theoretical level but also at the implementation level. For this reason we test our software on the iCub platform and compare its performance against other available solutions.",

        "abstract": "Friction is the result of complex interactions between contacting surfaces in a nanoscale perspective. Depending on the application, the different models available are more or less suitable. Available static friction models are typically considered to be dependent only on relative speed of interacting surfaces. However, it is known that friction can be affected by other factors than speed. In this paper, static friction in robot joints is studied with respect to changes in joint angle, load torque and temperature. The effects of these variables are analyzed by means of experiments on a standard industrial robot. Justified by their significance, load torque and temperature are included in an extended static friction model. The proposed model is validated in a wide operating range, reducing the average error a factor of 6 when compared to a standard static friction model.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for extracting planar features from noisy range data. The method encodes the local geometric information (surface normals) and global spatial information (coordinates) of 3D data points into an Enhanced Range Image (ERI) which is then clustered into a number of homogeneous groups, called Super Pixels (SPs). The Normalized Cuts (NC) method is employed to the graph built on the SPs and groups the SPs into planar segments. The ERI coding enhances object surfaces and edges while its sensitivity to surface normals is suppressed by the NC measure that takes into account the spatial information of SPs in computing the edge weights of the graph. A binary matrix is constructed to represent the spatial and similarity relationships among the planar segments. We then employ a search algorithm on this matrix to merge homogenous planar segments. The proposed approach is compared with a representative plane segmentation method in various indoor environments and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. In this paper, rang data are captured from a 3D imaging sensor-the Swissranger SR-3000.",

As a speech signal separated from a mixture of speech signals includes the leakage from other speech signals, recognition performance of the separated speech degrades. An important problem is estimating the leakage in time-frequency components. Once the leakage is estimated, we can generate missing feature masks (MFM) automatically by using our method. A new weighted sigmoid function is introduced for our MFM generation method. An experiment shows that a word correct rate improves from 66 % to 74 % by using our MFM generation method tuned by a search base approach in the parameter space.",

The proposed PF model consists of a system dynamical model and an observation model. The information about our tracking object is described by a state vector and the system state is assumed to evolve according to the system dynamical model. The parallel region-based level set method with displacement correction (PR-LSM-DC) proposed in our previous work now works as the measurements for the PF model. The tracking is achieved by estimating the state of a moving object from the observations. Experiments show that with motion prediction using the PF model, we increase the robustness of tracking and extend the duration of single paramecium tracking. The 2 [ms] computational time indicates that we developed an algorithm and a computer aided system which achieves nonrigid single micro-organisms tracking in real-time as they deform, move and collide with others under optical microscope.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the design of a robotic arm inspired to the anatomy and morphology of an octopus arm. The octopus is a boneless animal and its amazing dexterity is due to its muscular structure where longitudinal (axial), transverse (radial) and oblique muscles seamlessly interact while preserving hydrostaticity i.e. volume conservation (\u201cmuscular hydrostat\u201d). Mimicking some features of the octopus is instrumental to design a dexterous and compliant system. After analysing the relevant anatomical and morphological characteristics of the octopus arm, the key biomechanical features of interest to the design of a robotic arm have been identified. A design methodology has been developed based on the analysis of the muscular hydrostat properties. A prototype arm has been built using bespoke contracting pneumatic muscles and expanding elements. In the current stage of development the system has 15 actuated degrees of motion (DOM) and 8 degrees of freedom (DOF), all independently controllable through valves and a dedicated electronics and software interface. Pros and cons of the current design as well as practical prototyping trade-offs are thoroughly described.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an online algorithm for robustly tracking surgical tools in dynamic environments that can assist a surgeon during in-vivo robotic surgery procedures. The next generation of in-vivo robotic surgical devices includes integrated imaging and effector platforms that need to be controlled through real-time visual feedback. Our tracking algorithm learns the appearance of the tool online to account for appearance and perspective changes. In addition, the tracker uses multiple features working together to model the object and discover new areas of the tool as it moves quickly, exits and re-enters the scene, or becomes occluded and requires recovery. The algorithm can persist through changes in lighting and pose by using a memory database, which is built online, using a series of features working together to exploit different aspects of the object being tracked. We present results using real in-vivo imaging data from a human partial nephrectomy.",

This paper especially focuses on the extraction of points lying on a plane (such as the ground and buildings walls) in sequences acquired by a central omnidirectional camera. Our approach is based on the epipolar constraint for planar scenes (i.e. homography) on a pair of omnidirectional images to detect some interest points belonging to a plane. Our main contribution is the introduction of a new method, called \u201c2-point algorithm for homography\u201d, that imposes some constraints on the homography using vanishing point (VP) information. Compared to the widely used DLT (4-point) algorithm, experiments on real data demonstrated that the proposed \u201c2-point algorithm for homography\u201d is more robust to noise and false matching, even when the plane to extract is not dominant in the image. Finally, we show that our system provides key clues for ground segmentation by GrabCut.",

Our design is motivated from the observation that human hand motions often follow a linear trajectory when manipulating everyday objects. We present the mechanical design for a light-weight, energy-efficient robot named PRISM that emphasizes translational motion. By simulating the dynamics equations and comparing the structure of commonly used anthropomorphic arms and our proposed arm, we verify that translational motion is more energy efficient with PRISM, and the robot can maneuver itself in narrower places. Through simulation experiments using state of the art manipulation planning algorithms, we analyze the success rates of PRISM and an anthropomorphic robot arm in performing basic tasks. The simulation experiments center on pick-and-place tasks in cluttered kitchen scenes. We show a real-world prototype of PRISM and perform several manipulation experiments with it.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a collision anticipation method that shows when and where collisions will occur in configuration time space by considering the future behavior of agents. Previous solutions to collision anticipation have mainly focused on generating immediate reactive solutions to time-varying environments because of the high inaccuracy of sensors and a heavy computation burden. However, the recent rapid growth in sensor and estimation technology has led to a need for new systems that consider agents' future behavior explicitly. Based on this need, we formalized a mathematical approach to collision anticipation and proposed a tool, the 3-D triangular collision object(TCO), that informs a robot where and when collisions will occur over all possible heading angles. This formulation greatly reduced computation loads. Considering that this result is especially advantageous to fast moving robots, a full-speed collision-free (FSCF) motion planner is proposed based on the TCO. In real experiments, analytic solutions from the planner were modified to compensate for sensor error, and finally yielded safe motions for fast moving robots.",

        "abstract": "The current research effort in the design of lightweight and safe robots is resulting in increased interest for the development of variable stiffness actuators. Antagonistic pneumatic muscle actuators (pMAs) have been proposed for this purpose, due to their inherent nonlinear spring behavior resulting from both air compressibility and their nonlinear force-length relation. This paper addresses the simultaneous torque and stiffness control of an antagonistically actuated joint with pneumatic muscles driven by compact, fast-switching solenoid valves. This strategy allows compensation of unmodeled joint dynamics while adjusting the joint stiffness depending on the task requirements. The proposed controller is based on a sliding mode force control applied to an average model of the valve-pneumatic muscle system. This was necessary to cope with both the well known model uncertainties of the pMA and the discontinuous on-off behavior of the solenoid valves. Preliminary experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed implementation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate adaptive sound localization algorithms for robotic heads. To this end we built a 3 degree-of-freedom head with two microphones encased in artificial pinnae (outer ears). The geometry of the head and pinnae induce temporal differences in the sound recorded at each microphone. These differences change with the frequency of the sound, location of the sound, and orientation of the robot in a complex manner. To learn the relationship between these auditory differences and the location of a sound source, we applied machine learning methods to a database of different audio source locations and robot head orientations. Our approach achieves a mean error of 2.5 degrees for azimuth and 11 degrees for elevation for estimating the position of an audio source. The impressive results highlight the benefits of a two-stage regression model to make use of the properties of the artificial pinnae for elevation estimation. In this work, the algorithms were trained using ground truth data provided by a motion capture system. We are currently generalizing the approach so that the training signal is provided online based on a real-time face detection and speech detection system.",

        "abstract": "Online optimal planning of robotic arm movement is addressed. Optimality is inspired by computational models, where a \u201ccost function\u201d is used to describe limb motions according to different criteria. A method is proposed to implement optimal planning in Cartesian space, minimizing some cost function, by means of numerical approximation to a generalized nonlinear model predictive control problem. The Extended RItz Method is applied as a functional approximation technique. Differently from other approaches, the proposed technique can be applied on platforms with strict control temporal constraints and limited processing capability, since the computational burden is completely concentrated in an off-line phase. The trajectory generation on-line is therefore computationally efficient. Task to joint space conversion is implemented on-line by a closed loop inverse kinematics algorithm, taking into account the robot's physical limits. Experimental results, where a 4DOF arm moves according to a particular nonlinear cost, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and suggest interesting future developments.",

        "abstract": "The human hand is one of the most complex structures in the body, being involved in dexterous manipulation and fine sensing. Traditional engineering approaches have mostly attempted to match such complexity in robotics without sufficiently stressing on the underlying mechanisms that its morphology encodes. In this work, we propose an artificial skin able to encode, through its morphology, the tactile sense of a robotic hand, characteristic to slippage events. The underlying layout consists of ridges and allows slippage detection and the quantification of slippage speed. Such encoding of slippage signal becomes suitable for relaying tactile feedback to users in prosthetic applications. This approach emphasizes the importance of exploiting morphology and mechanics in structures for the design of prosthetic interfaces.",

Specifically, two information-transfer schemes, which differ based on their communication bandwidth requirements per link, are discussed. Even under asynchronous communication constraints, these schemes enable robots to compute pose estimates identical to those generated using the centralized CL framework, albeit delayed. For each of these schemes, necessary and sufficient conditions for the communication-graph connectivity, that enable each robot to generate the centralized estimates, are developed. Moreover, detailed description of these schemes, along with their communication-complexity analysis and analytical results for the expected time delay in obtaining these estimates, are presented. Lastly, simulation results are used to validate the performance (the trade-off between communication link bandwidth and accuracy/delay) of these information-transfer schemes.",

        "abstract": "Force feedback systems have been developed to improve the user-friendliness of robotic surgery systems. In teleoperative surgery, one of the major problems is the delay of the transmission of the information from the operation site to the surgery site. The transmission delays of the control signal and force information are less than the that of the image signal. In many cases, the visual information is synchronized with the force information in order to avoid a time gap between them. In this paper, we propose that force information be presented earlier than the visual information. This approach reduces the damage to the organs in surgical operations even though there is a time gap between the delay of force information and visual information. In addition, we propose a method to present predicted force information to avoid damage to the organs due to time delays in teleoperative surgery. The liver can be treated with a contact force of less than 0.8 N and a grasping force of less than 1.1 N by applying the proposed method. The method can realize a teleoperative surgery without damaging the patient's organs.",

        "abstract": "With advances in wearable computing, wearable virtual reality and wearable robotics have become popular areas of research. In the present study, we consider the case in which an expert in first aid treatment at a remote critical care center receives an image from an assistant/cooperator who is with a patient, i.e., the sharing of visual information between an expert and an assistant. A head-mounted camera worn by the assistant is used to capture visual information related to the patient and his/her surroundings. The expert directs the assistant to provide the desired visual information. Information of the status of the patient, the surrounding environment, and the situation can be obtained from the shared visual information. The assistant should make observations according to the directions of the expert. However, these persons are not required to be tightly linked/synchronized at all times, but only when necessary. There are primarily two behaviors in visual information sharing, namely, searching and staring behaviors. The proposed asynchronous visual information sharing system with image stabilization can separate these two behaviors and can reduce the stress of both the expert and the assistant in visual information sharing. This system consists of three components: image stabilization, virtual viewing direction operation, and relative orientation display. We experimentally evaluate the performance of virtual viewing direction operation, image stabilization, and asynchronous visual information sharing of the proposed system.",

Robust attitude estimation is achieved by fusion of low-cost MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope signals with a Kalman filter.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address a method for improving the accuracy of the feature map from the extended Kalman filter based SLAM (EKF SLAM) by estimating the systematic parameters of the robot. Most error of the robot while traveling is divided into two categories: systematic and non systematic error. The systematic error contributes much more to odometry errors than non systematic one on most smooth indoor surfaces. So, we appended the systematic parameters of the robot to the state vector of EKF SLAM as its elements and estimated the systematic parameters while performing the prediction and update state of EKF SLAM. Because the additional elements to be estimated are appended to the state vector of the EKF SLAM, this is called an augmented EKF SLAM (AEKF SLAM). Experimental result is presented to validate that our AEKF SLAM is able to generate a more accurate feature map than conventional EKF SLAM by decreasing odometric error of the robot.",

Robotic assistants have solved the drawbacks of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) and provide additional skills to the surgeons. However, some authors argue that these systems could lengthen the operating time. The solution is the automation of certain maneuvers that help the surgeon during a surgical maneuver. This work proposes control architecture for a surgical robot capable of performing autonomous movements. In this way, a trajectory planner based on a behavior concept computes the required velocity vector of the surgical instrument hold by the robot. This planner has been implemented and tested on the control architecture of the surgical assistant CISOBOT, designed and developed at the University of Malaga.",

A key problem to be solved beforehand is the development and realization of proper preparation, handling and manipulation methods with respect to an industrial usage. To enable such a usage, the methods have to be automatable, robust to environmental changes as well as feasible in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). According to these points, the target of the presented efforts is to develop these methods for a future design of nanoelectronic parts and to solve packaging problems at the nanoscale. As a consequence, the paper presents a novel concept for the usage of biomaterials, such as DNA and wood fibers/fibrils, for the packaging at the nanoscale. Novel methods for the DNA-handling with an atomic force microscope (AFM) at dry conditions, which can also be used in the vacuum chamber of a SEM will be presented as well as wood fibers/fibrils manipulation methods in the SEM.",

        "abstract": "A grade crossing is a crossing of a railway line and a motor road. In 2009 alone there were 248 deaths and 682 injuries at grade crossings in the United States. Factors like the elevation profile of a crossing or the environment and foliage around the crossing can render it unsafe. Often, vehicles with low ground clearance bottom out on a crossing with a humped elevation profile. Excessive foliage around the crossing can obstruct the visibility of an approaching train, reducing the time a driver has to stop. Hence ensuring safety requires regular monitoring and timely maintenance of grade crossings across the country. In this paper, we describe our method for automatically inspecting grade crossings. Our work employs principled machine learning methods to detect grade crossings from sensor data and then reconstructs the profile of that rail-road intersection. We then show how traffic simulation on the reconstructed profile can be used to determine whether the crossing is unsafe.",

A 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced fluorescence based intra-operative tumor diagnosis technique has been incorporated into the robotic laser ablation system. The system enables an intra-operative identification of the position of a tumor with fluorescence illuminated by a laser excitation. The AF and robotic scanning mechanism assists in tracking the surface of the malignant brain tumors, and provides position information for both laser scanning in 5-ALA fluorescence identification and laser ablation in tumor resection. Experimental results showed the automatic focus device had a precision of 0.5 mm and the mechanism could track the brain surface with a movement caused by pulsation and respiration.",

        "abstract": "Modular robots offer the possibility to quickly design robots with a high diversity of shapes and functionalities. This nice feature also brings an important challenge: namely how to design efficient locomotion gaits for arbitrary robot structures with many degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a framework that allows one to explore and identify highly different gaits for a given arbitrary-shaped modular robot. We use simulated robots made of several Roombots modules that have three degrees of freedom each. These modules have the interesting feature that they can produce both oscillatory movements (i.e. periodic movements around a rest position) and rotational movements (i.e. with continuously increasing angle), leading to rich locomotion patterns. Here we ask ourselves which types of movements \u2014 purely oscillatory, purely rotational, or a combination of both\u2014 lead to the fastest gaits. To address this question we designed a control architecture based on a distributed system of coupled phase oscillators that can produce synchronized rotations and oscillations in many degrees of freedom. We also designed a specific optimization algorithm that can automatically design hybrid controllers, i.e. controllers that use oscillations in some joints and rotations in others. The proposed framework is verified by multiple simulations for several robot morphologies. The results show that (i) the question whether it is better to oscillate or to rotate depends on the morphology of the robot, and that in general it is best to do both, (ii) the optimization framework can successfully generate hybrid controllers that outperform purely oscillatory and purely rotational ones, and (iii) the resulting gaits are fast, innovative, and would have been hard to design by hand.",

        "abstract": "Laser range finders are a non-invasive tool which can be used for anonymously tracking the motion of people and robots in real-world environments with high accuracy. Based on a commercial system we have developed, this paper addresses two practical issues of using networks of portable laser range finders in field environments. We first describe a technique for automated calibration of sensor positions and orientations, by using velocity-based matching of observed human trajectories to define constraints between the sensors. We then propose a mechanism for detecting when a sensor has been moved out of alignment, which can be used to alert an operator of the condition and automatically exclude erroneous data from tracking calculations. After describing our techniques for solving these problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our calibration and error detection systems in live trials with our real-time system, as well as offline tests based on scan data recorded from field trials.",

        "abstract": "A collective of robots can together complete a task that is beyond the capabilities of any of its individual robots. One property of a robotic collective that allows it to complete such a task is the shape of the collective. One method to form that shape is to form it at a size proportional to the number of robots in that collective, i.e. scalably. In our previous work, scalably forming the shape of the collective required that each robot know the total number of robots in the collective. In this work we present a method called S-DASH, which now allows a collective to scalably form a shape without knowing how many robots are in the collective. Furthermore, S-DASH will change the size of the shape to reflect the addition or removal of robots from the collective. This paper also provides demonstrations of S-DASH running on a simulated collective of robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In wildlife radio tagging, small radio transmitters attached to animals are located by human operators using directional antennas and analog receivers which provide audio output. The location of the transmitter is determined by listening to the signal and scanning the area while closing in. This procedure can be very tedious, especially in rough terrain. Searching radio tags with autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers a number of advantages, including better line-of-sight signal reception, terrain-independence and faster localization. In this paper we continue upon previous work by presenting a received-signal-strength (RSS) sensor implementation based on a modified commercial wildlife tracking receiver that is designed to operate on an autonomous fixed-wing UAV. Furthermore, an extension of the search and tracking framework for multiple targets that are undistinguishable from the sensors' point of view is proposed. After a brief system overview and a summary of the particle filter based approach, the signal processing theory and realization of the RSS sensor are outlined, including strategies for frequency tracking and receiver gain control. The paper also presents experimental results.",

Especially, in the robot navigation, the sensor fusion algorithm is needed. In addition, it is hard to get the position information at the area surrounded the high buildings such as the downtown because GPS signals is so feeble. Therefore, this paper illustrates an efficient method for the outdoor localization incorporating DGPS, Encoder, and IMU sensor based on EKF. To show the localization performances of the proposed fusion algorithm, we have implemented the proposed algorithm and applied the advertising robot platform which is operating well during 80 days in the real semi-outdoor structured environment. The proposed sensor fusion algorithm and the experimental results showed the feasibility of our novel sensor fusion algorithm.",

The task is nontrivial due to the discrete-continuous nature of the corresponding dynamics. This paper proposes to add an elastic element to the manipulator so the ball can be controlled in a continuous-time phase instead of an intermittent contact. Optimal catching and pushing trajectories are planned for the underactuated system based on the virtual holonomic constraints approach. First experimental studies are presented to evaluate the approach.",

It is based on four arithmetical operations of time-series torque data of several motions preliminarily obtained by the iterative learning control. The remarkable advantage of BMC is to generate desired feedforward torque without prior information of dynamics parameters. However, the class of torque generated by the BMC has been restricted. The paper presents an enhanced BMC which permits generation of motions with different motion-velocity profiles among joints of a multi-joint robot. The algorithm is presented and the validity of algorithm is confirmed through numerical simulations in the case of a two-joint robot arm under the influence of gravity. Furthermore, a class of applicable systems of BMC approach is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Robots that know what they are doing can solve their tasks more reliably, flexibly, and efficiently. They can even explain what they were doing, how and why. In this paper we describe a system that not only is capable of executing flexible and reliable plans on a robotic platform but can also explain control decisions and the reason for specific actions, diagnose the cause of failures and answer queries about the robot's beliefs. For instance, when queried why it opened the cupboard door, the robot might answer that it did so because it believed Michael's cup to be in there. This type of reasoning is not only helpful for debugging but also provides the mechanisms for complex monitoring and failure handling that is not based on local failures and exception handling but on the expressive formulation of error patterns in first order logics. Our system is based on semantic annotations of plans, a fast logging mechanism and the computation of predicates in a first-order representation based on the execution trace.",

        "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of evaluating AGVs with different degrees of autonomy by defining benchmark tools to grade the performance of each approach. Based on the proposed benchmark, different experiments have been performed from manual driving to autonomous navigation, at different velocities and a scenario containing wide and narrow corridors, small and large isles, rooms, slalom-like parts requiring zig-zag maneuvering and static objects. However, this benchmark is also applicable to dynamic environments, including moving objects and other vehicles. In particular, experiments have been used for evaluating the performance of AGVs, in terms of robustness, efficiency, safety and comfortability. The underlying objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of manual-assisted driving as well as autonomous navigation against standard manual driving. To obtain valid and significant results, more than 180 experiments have been carried out on each approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a number of concepts related to benchmarking and evaluation of grasping and manipulation. A set of \u201cObjects of Daily Living\u201d based on a review of common domestic objects for manipulation as identified from sources in the literature is put forward, along with the physical properties of sample objects in those categories. Next, an experimental evaluation of the coefficient of static friction between these objects and a number of common household surfaces is performed. A key failure mode in unstructured object grasping occurs when the manipulator applies large contact forces that move the object out of grasp range. These results therefore give insight into the likelihood of a target object remaining in place to be successfully grasped in the presence of contact forces from the robot arm. This paper also presents a new classification of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), putting forth a standard categorization for the application of robotics in human environments. These topics and results have a number of uses related to benchmarking and performance evaluation in robotic manipulation, assistive technology, and prosthetics.",

        "abstract": "Snakes are very unique animals that have distinguished motor function adaptable to the most diverse environments in terrestrial animals regardless of their simple cord-shaped body. Revealing the mechanism underlying this distinct locomotion pattern, which is fundamentally different from walking, is significant not only in biological field but also for applications in engineering field. However, it has been difficult to clarify this adaptive function, emerging from dynamic interaction between body, brain and environment, by previous scientific methodologies based on reductionism, where understanding of the total system is approached by analyzing specific individual elements. In this research, we aim at revealing the mechanisms underlying this adaptability by the use of the constructive methodology, in which biological system models reflecting biological knowledge is used as a tool for analysis of the total system. In this report, we present development of system models, i.e. a dynamics simulator and a robot, constructed based on biological data obtained from dissection, CT-imaging, kinematics measurements and EMG measurements. By constructing mechanical models based on anatomical studies and applying control input designed according to EMG and kinematics measurements into the models, locomotion similar to living snakes was achieved and remaining problems in the models were clarified.",

        "abstract": "Despite the benefits of miniaturized devices, handling of tiny amount of molecules became a great challenge. Direct transport, similar to the one in intracellular transport, is a way to cope with the problem of transporting tiny amount of materials. Using motor proteins, i.e. kinesin, and the corresponding rail structures, i.e. microtubules, provides powerful building blocks for a nanotransport system. However, it is extremely difficult to construct a complex transport network to allow arbitrary design. Here, we have developed a MEMS-based molecular handling system for the pick-and-place assembly of individual microtubules. The technology enabled us to build a bio/MEMS hybrid system composed of multidirectional microtubule networks along which kinesin molecules move. Using MEMS tweezers to manipulate a single microtubule enables precise positioning and full control in functional orientation and stacking order. As a result, kinesin-coated beads can be transported along the route specifically assembled for them to follow. Direct transport of target molecules can be achieved by loading the beads with the molecules to carry. \u201cBottom-up\u201d functionalities of biomaterials are incorporated with micro fluidic devices by the handling capabilities of the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach.",

        "abstract": "A novel framework of biped walking stabilization control is introduced. The target robot is a 42 DOF humanoid robot HRP-4C which has a body dimensions close to the average Japanese female. We develop a body posture controller and foot force controllers on the joint position servo of the robot. By applying this posture/force control, we can regard the robot system as a simple linear inverted pendulum with ZMP delay. After a preliminary experiment to confirm the linear dynamics, we design a tracking controller for walking stabilization. It is evaluated in the experiments of HRP-4C walking and turning on a lab floor. The robot can also perform an outdoor walk on an uneven pavement.",

        "abstract": "Fully autonomous vehicles are technologically feasible with the current generation of hardware, as demonstrated by recent robot car competitions. Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control protocol called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed that with autonomous vehicles it is possible to make intersection control much more efficient than the traditional control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. The protocol, however, has only been tested in simulation and has not been evaluated with real autonomous vehicles. To realistically test the protocol, we implemented a mixed reality platform on which an autonomous vehicle can interact with multiple virtual vehicles in a simulation at a real intersection in real time. From this platform we validated realistic parameters for our autonomous vehicle to safely traverse an intersection in AIM. We present several techniques to improve efficiency and show that the AIM protocol can still outperform traffic signals and stop signs even if the cars are not as precisely controllable as has been assumed in previous studies.",

Consequently, its efficiency is an essential requirement in hierarchical localization frameworks. This paper presents a topological map generation method with a localization scheme. Good compromise of performance measures - accuracy, memory and processing time - indicates the method's efficiency. The suggested implementations rely on information-theoretic selection of local features for node distinctive representation, and a visual codebook for compression. Testing the proposed approach on the COLD database, a recent specific benchmarking database for robotic topological mapping and localization, reveals its customization according to the vision sensor and environment characteristics. The approach guarantees over 90% localization accuracy with more than 50% overhead reduction, and is suitable for application in highly unstructured cluttered environments that are influenced by dynamics and illumination variations.",

        "abstract": "An autonomous robotic vehicle can drive through and park in a lot more reliably if it is guided by a parking lot map. This specialized map creates structure, including the centerlines of drivable regions and intersection locations in an often unstructured and unmarked environment and enables the vehicle to focus its attention on regions that require detailed analysis. Existing methods of building such maps require manu- ally driving vehicles for collecting sensor measurements. Instead of pursuing a labor-intensive approach, we analyze an aerial image of a parking lot to build a topological map. In particular, our algorithm produces a lane-graph of a parking lot's drivable regions by executing several image processing steps. First it estimates drivable regions by superimposing detection of a parking spots onto the parking lot boundary segmentation. Second, a distance transform is applied to drivable regions to reveal its skeleton. Lastly our algorithm searches the distance map to identify a set of the peak points and connects them to generate a lane-graph that concisely represents drivable regions. Experiments show promising results of real-world parking lot aerial-imagery analysis.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, biologically inspired control approaches for robotic systems that involve the use of central pattern generators (CPGs) have been attracting considerable attention owing to the fact that most humans or animals move and walk easily without explicitly controlling their movements. Furthermore, they exhibit natural adaptive motions against unexpected disturbances or environmental changes without considering their kinematic configurations. Inspired by such novel phenomena, this paper endeavors to achieve self-adapting robotic arm motion. For this, biologically inspired CPG based control is proposed. In particular, this approach deals with crucial problems such as motion generation and repeatability of the joints emerged remarkably in most of redundant DOF systems. These problems can be overcome by employing a control based on artificial neural oscillators, virtual force and virtual muscle damping instead of trajectories planning and inverse kinematics. Biologically inspired motions can be attained if the joints of a robotic arm are coupled to neural oscillators and virtual muscles. We experimentally demonstrate self-adaptation motions that that enables a 7-DOF robotic arm to make adaptive changes from the given motion to a compliant motion. In addition, it is verified with real a real robotic arm that human-like movements and motion repeatability are satisfied under kinematic redundancy of joints.",

CRAM equips autonomous robots with lightweight reasoning mechanisms that can infer control decisions rather than requiring the decisions to be preprogrammed. This way CRAM-programmed autonomous robots are much more flexible, reliable, and general than control programs that lack such cognitive capabilities. CRAM does not require the whole domain to be stated explicitly in an abstract knowledge base. Rather, it grounds symbolic expressions in the knowledge representation into the perception and actuation routines and into the essential data structures of the control programs. In the accompanying video, we show complex mobile manipulation tasks performed by our household robot that were realized using the CRAM infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "The use of edge-related applications is important in the field of computer vision. These applications help robots with understanding their surrounding environments; the lane or wall detection system is one of the most popular applications. Numerous studies have recently been conducted for enhancing the capabilities of robotic vision, but they typically lacked the applications that were related to coping with the environmental changes of the scenes. In this paper, we propose a method that integrates a particle filter into the process of tracking the camera's parameters (the exposure and the focus) to find the captured frame with the high edge quality. The relationship between the current sequence of frames and the previous sequence was given no consideration when all the possible parameters were scanned. Our work attempts to find that relationship and to increase the speed of the camera system. The edge results are evaluated with using a line detection algorithm - that is known as the Standard Hough Transform. A test method is applied to analyze the correctness of the line detection results. Furthermore, we propose the entropy of the Sobel gradient method for measuring the image sharpness and its contrast when the exposure and focus of a digital camera are changed. Our experimental results show that our method can be applied in real-time systems because of its low computational requirements.",

        "abstract": "Robust and reliable obstacle detection is an important capability for mobile robots. In our previous works we have presented an approach for visual obstacle detection based on feature based monocular scene-reconstruction. Most existing feature-based approaches for visual SLAM and scene reconstruction select their features uniformly over the whole image based on visual saliency only. In this paper we present a novel attention-driven approach that guides the feature selection to image areas that provide the most information for mapping and obstacle detection. Therefore, we present an information theoretic derivation of the expected information gain that results from the selection of new image features. Additionally, we present a method for building a volumetric representation of the robots environment in terms of an occpancy voxel map. The voxel map provides top-down information that is needed for computing the expected information gain. We show that our approach for guided feature selection improves the quality of the created voxel maps and improves the obstacle detection by reducing the risk of missing obstacles.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a visual servoing scheme for humanoid walking. Though most of the existing approaches follow a perception-decision-action scheme, we close the loop so that the control is robust to model error. Our approach is based on a new reactive pattern generator which modifies, at the control level, the footsteps, the center of mass and the center of pressure trajectories for the center of mass to track a reference velocity. And, in this paper, the reference velocity is directly given by a visual servoing control law. Since, the HRP-2 walk induces a sway motion that disturbs the regulation of the visual control law, we introduce a control law allowing convergence in the image space and taking into account this sway motion.",

        "abstract": "The ability to detect perceptions which were never experienced before, i.e. novelty detection, is an important component of autonomous robots working in real environments. It is achieved by comparing current data provided by its sensors with a previously known map of the environment. This often constitutes an extremely challenging task due to the large amounts of data that must be compared in real-time. With respect to previously proposed approaches, this paper detects changes in 3D environment based on probabilistic models, the Gaussian Mixture Model, and a fast and robust combined constraint matching algorithm. The matching allows to represent the scene view as a graph which emerges from the comparison between Mixtures of Gaussians. Finding the largest set of mutually consistent matches is equivalent to find the maximum clique on a graph. The proposed approach has been tested for mobile robotics purposes in real environments and compared to other matching algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposal.",

In a preliminary study, involving 4 post-stroke subjects, more than 2 years following the stroke, we have been able to show that 8 weeks of robot-assisted training leads to changes in patterns of arm and finger muscle activation. The patterns were quantified in terms of synchronous muscle synergies which allowed for comparison with muscle activation patterns of healthy age-matched subjects. We found that the muscle synergies of the post-stroke subjects became more similar to those of the healthy subject group following training.",

However achieving performances compatible with the work in the microworld requires the use of bulky and expensive systems for measurement, signal processing and real time control. In this paper, we present the characterization and the control of a bistable module that can be used to build microrobots. This bistable module is fabricated monolithically using microfabrication technology. It offers two stable and blocked positions. High resolutions can be reached using this approach. Static and dynamic characteristics of the bistable module are studied and an open-loop control strategy is proposed in order to switch smoothly from one position to the other. The presented bistable module is the basic module for building digital microrobots.",

Since the LRF is a sensor which can measure distance to surfaces of objects by radiating laser beams from itself and receiving the reflected ones, data obtained from the LRF are nothing more than the contours of objects. For this reason, we adopted cylindrical shaped objects since the contour, a circular arc, is invariant against rotation. Therefore, this research aims to fit circles to the arc-shaped contours of the cylindrical objects and estimate their accurate center positions by applying the least square method and maximum likelihood estimation. If we know the radius of the cylindrical object in advance, the aforementioned two methods become non-linear problems. For this reason, we applied the Newton-Raphson method to solve these non-linear equations. We improve the angular resolution of the LRF by using a pan unit, and reveal that the maximum likelihood estimation can give us the most accurate center position. Additionally, we implemented proposed position measurement system in an actual construction field.",

The shape models, defined as a collection of oriented primitive shapes centered at fixed 3D positions, can be learned from a few labeled images for each class. The 3D class model can then be used to estimate the 3D shape of a detected object, including occluded parts, from a single image. The estimated 3D shape is used as to select one of the target grasps for the object.

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on developing a consistent methodology for deriving a closed-form inverse kinematic joint solution of a general humanoid robot. Most humanoid-robot researchers resort to iterative methods for inverse kinematics using the Jacobian matrix to avoid the difficulty of finding a closed-form joint solution. Since a closed-form joint solution, if available, has many advantages over iterative methods, we have developed a novel reverse decoupling mechanism method by viewing the kinematic chain of a limb of a humanoid robot in reverse order and then decoupling it into the positioning and orientation mechanisms, and finally utilizing the inverse transform technique in deriving a consistent joint solution for the humanoid robot. The proposed method presents a simple and efficient procedure for finding the joint solution for most of the existing humanoid robots. Extensive computer simulations of the proposed approach on a Hubo KHR-4 humanoid robot show that it can be applied easily to most humanoid robots with slight modifications.",

Specifically, we describe coupled perception and control algorithms that enable the vehicle to engage and place loaded pallets relative to locations on the ground or truck beds. Having little prior knowledge of the objects with which the vehicle is to interact, we present an estimation framework that utilizes a series of classifiers to infer the objects' structure and pose from individual LIDAR scans. The classifiers share a low-level shape estimation algorithm that uses linear programming to robustly segment input data into sets of weak candidate features. We present and analyze the performance of the segmentation method, and subsequently describe its role in our estimation algorithm. We then evaluate the performance of a motion controller that, given an estimate of a pallet's pose, is employed to safely engage each pallet. We conclude with a validation of our algorithms for a set of real-world pallet and truck interactions.",

Although the BCF propulsion is favorable for the cases requiring greater thrust and accelerations, its maneuverability can be compensated by effective turning control. In our method, the turning maneuver is divided into three phases: the bending, holding, and unbending phases. After much consideration on turning details, the functions of each phase and the basic control laws are further identified. Results of experiments on in-situ direction tracking and direction maintaining verify the effectiveness of the proposed turning control.",

        "abstract": "A new reactive collision avoidance approach for mobile robots moving in cluttered and complex environments was developed and implemented. The novelty of this approach lies in the creation of a new method for analyzing openings in front of the robot that highly reduces their number when compared with the Nearness-Diagram Navigation (ND) technique, particularly in complex scenarios. Moreover, the angular width of the chosen (selected) gap with respect to the robot vision is taken into consideration. Consequently, oscillations are alleviated, the computational complexity is reduced and a smoother behavior will be achieved. Our technique adjusts the motion law proposed in the Smooth Nearness-Diagram Navigation (SND) method to generate safer paths for the robot by considering the ratio of threats on its sides and applying stricter deviation against an obstacle as it gets closer to the robot. Hence, the problem of deadlock occurring in narrow corridors, with high threats on one side and low threats on the other, is solved without affecting the smoothness behavior. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed approach.",

We introduce the concept of dynamic bagof-words, which is a novel form of query expansion based on finding cliques in the landmark co-visibility graph. The proposed approach avoids the - often arbitrary - discretisation of space from the robot's trajectory that is common to most image-based loop closure algorithms. Instead we show that reasoning on sets of co-visible landmarks leads to a simple model that out-performs pose-based or view-based approaches. Using real and simulated imagery, we demonstrate that dynamic bag-of-words query expansion can improve precision and recall for appearance-based localisation.",

Difficulty in visual recognition of clothing largely depends on the observed shape of the clothing. Therefore, strategy of actively making clothing into the shape easier to recognize should be effective. First, after clothing is observed by a trinocular stereo vision system, it is checked whether the observation gives enough information to recognize the clothing shape robustly or not. If not, proper \u201crecognition-aid\u201d actions, such as rotating and/or spreading the clothing, are automatically planned based on the visual analysis of the current shape. After executing the planned action, the clothing is observed again to recognize. The effect of the action of spreading clothes was demonstrated through experimental results using an actual humanoid.",

Furthermore, they are able to communicate one with each other. The goal is to maximize the area monitored by the team, by identifying the best configuration of the team members. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, an analytical solution can not be obtained. The proposed method is based on a new cognitive-based, adaptive optimization algorithm (CAO). This method allows getting coordinated and scalable controls to accomplish the task, even when the obstacles are unknown and the team is heterogeneous, i.e. each robot is equipped with a different type of visual sensor.

        "abstract": "In the case of disasters such as earthquakes or Nuclear/Biological/Chemical(NBC) terrorist attacks, mobile robots, called \u201crescue robots,\u201d that can work in dangerous environments instead of rescue crews in rescue missions, can be of great help. However, realizing such robot systems requires many types of technologies. In particular, path planning is an important technology that provides a mobile robot with autonomous navigation to a target destination with collision avoidance. To avoid evacuees, the robot should consider the motion of people in the near future. In this research, we propose a collision avoidance method that estimates the motions and personal spaces of the evacuees. The method consists of three steps: \u201cestimation,\u201d \u201cconversion,\u201d and \u201cplanning.\u201d In the estimation step, the future positions of evacuees are estimated by considering their planned motions and personal spaces. Then, in the conversion step, a time axis is added to construct a 3D time-space coordinate system. Finally, in the planning step, a distance-time transform is applied to plan a safe 3D path from the robot's current position to the desired goal. The proposed method has been implemented on our rescue robot simulator, and some simulation experiments were conducted to verify its usefulness.",

We fuse information from color images with depth from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera to improve recognition performance under scale and viewpoint changes. Firstly, we use depth and local surface orientation extracted from the ToF image to normalize color and depth image features with regard to scale and viewpoint. Secondly, we incorporate local 3D shape features into the classifier. The use of a Random Forest classifier facilitates the seamless combination of depth and texture features. It also provides image segmentation through pixel-wise classification. We demonstrate our approach on a labeled dataset of seven object categories in table-top scenes and compare it with a vision-only approach.",

Using K-COPMAN, the robot can solve inference tasks such as identifying items that are likely to be missing on a breakfast table. To the programmer K-COPMAN, is presented as a logic programming system that can be queried just like a symbolic knowledge base. Internally, K-COPMAN is realized through a data structure framework together with a library of state-of-the-art perception mechanisms for mobile manipulation in human environments. Key features of K-COPMAN are that it can make a robot environment-aware and that it supports goal-directed as well as passive perceptual processing. K-COPMAN is fully integrated into an autonomous mobile manipulation robot and is realized within the open-source robot library ROS.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new framework to recover balance against external forces by combining disturbance suppression and reactive stepping. In the view point of the feedback control, a reactive step can help to diminish the disturbance caused by an external force that should be compensated to maintain balance. In other words, if the adequate step is performed, the feedback controller does not have to compensate all of the external force by itself. Under this concept, we propose an original solution to distribute the compensation between a feedback controller and a reactive step, according to the period of support phase and a disturbance characteristic. We first clearly distinguish between the role of the disturbance suppression and the reactive stepping. Then, based on this distinction, the small disturbance of external force or happening late during the single-support phase, is mainly suppressed by state feedback. The large disturbance which is out of capability by feedback controller and at the beginning of the single-support phase, is absorbed by modifying reactively the next steps. The proposed method is validated through experimental results with the HRP-2 humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "We propose a compact self-contained navigation system with Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) inertial sensor and optical navigation sensor for 3-D pipeline mapping. Self-contained navigation system have advantages of robust against severe environmental conditions and also wide applications without external assist such as Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation or localization system based on a map. The goal of this study is to overcome the performance limitations of small, low-grade sensors by combining various sensors with complementary functions and, therefore, to achieve robust tracking performance against severe environmental conditions. The multi-rate EKF solves the frequent outage problem of the optical navigation sensors and the bias drift problem of the MEMS accelerometers. The vector matching algorithm with the gravity field vector solves the bias drift problem of the MEMS gyro except for the yaw in the reference axis. The geometry compensation algorithm minimizes position errors by combining the forward and backward estimation results geometrically. Experiments to verify performance are conducted by driving Radio-Controlled (RC) car equipped with the proposed navigation system on 3-D asphalt pavement. Experimental results show that the proposed navigation system has good performance and estimated position errors are less than one percent, in the range of 855 m. The proposed navigation system can contribute a compact size and robustness not only to 3-D pipeline mapping but also to small mobile robots.",

The ISO9283 position repeatability index is estimated but also other performance criteria built upon the stochastic ellipsoid geometrical characteristics. The choice of the best comparison criterion is investigated and different solutions are proposed, associated with the task specificity. For each criterion, maps are built to determine the set of workspace points where the serial robot is better than the parallel robot. The ratio of the workspace surface where one robot is better than the other is computed and the results are analysed. Contrary to the common opinion that parallel robots are more accurate than serial robots, we prove here that the repeatability performance depends mainly on the chosen performance criterion. Another result found is that the considered R\u0332RRRR\u0332 parallel robot keeps the same repeatability in all its workspace.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Designing a robot controller that can optimally manage limited resources in a deterministic, real-time manner can be challenging. Behavior-based architectures, which split autonomy into levels, are very popular but neither have real-time features that enforce timing constraints nor support determinism. Even though real-time features are not included, it seems like a natural fit to make each level in the behavior-based architecture its own task or process. The only that thing that it lacks are the timing features. This has already been implemented using Suns Java Real-Time System. It has also been shown that timing constraints effect performance. This brings us to the question; why not use the more traditional language of C or C++ to implement this behavior-based real-time architecture? Are we not taught that Java is useful but slow compared to C and C++? If so why not use C++ and the features of Open Robot Control Software (OROCOS) to implement the architecture. This paper answers the question of does it really matter what language is used in a behavior-based real-time architecture. We implemented the architecture using OROCOS/C++ running on UBUNTU. Then compared our implementation to two other implementations of the architecture: Java/Player on Fedora; and Suns Java Real-Time System (RTS) on Solaris. Results, from experiments on a robot, show that our OROCOS/C++ implementation performed similarly to the Java RTS implementation. Both the OROCOS and Java RTS implementations performed better than the Player/Java implementation. This suggests that Java is in fact feasible for a behavior-based real-time robot architecture but it needs to be run using Java RTS not the regular version.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, 3-PPR planar parallel manipulators with D- or U-shape base are compared with respect to their workspace size and kinematic sensitivity to joint clearances. First, the singularities and workspace of a general 3-PPR planar parallel manipulator are analyzed. Then, an error prediction model applicable to both serial and parallel manipulators is developed. As a result, two nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs are formulated in order to find the maximum reference-point position error and the maximum orientation error of the moving-platform for given joint clearances. Finally, the contributions of the paper are highlighted by means of a comparative study of two manipulators.",

The proposed method starts by locating a set of static guards on the map of the target area and then builds a graph called Reduced-CDT, a new environment representation method based on the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Multi-Prim's is used to decompose the graph into a forest of partial spanning trees (PSTs). Each PST is then modified through a mechanism called Constrained Spanning Tour (CST) to build a cycle which is then assigned to an individual robot. Subsequently, robots start navigating the cycles and consequently cover the whole area. We show that the proposed approach is complete and robust with respect to robot failure.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Most of the current state of the art motion planning software libraries are not easily interchangeable, because core concepts are represented with different data structures, application programming interfaces (API) are not compatible, or algorithms are encapsulated in modules organized in mutually exclusive abstraction hierarchies. These problems limit the possibility to reuse different libraries in the same application interchangeably and to compare their quality attributes (performance, completeness, etc.). An approach to overcome these shortcomings is refactoring, a technique that aims to restructure a set of existing software libraries without affecting their external behavior in order to harmonize their architecture, data structures, and APIs. This paper presents a component-based refactoring approach that has allowed the transition from motion planning libraries, taking the object-oriented framework CoPP as basis, to a component-based system. In particular we describe a four-step application of well-known architecture refactoring patterns that redistributes the responsibilities among the classes, harmonizes the common data structures and reduces the coupling degree. The obtained system represents a composition of reusable components that are easy to customize and offer different algorithms to resolve the same problem. In this way the user could quickly compile a new motion planning application by simply choosing which algorithm to use for each functionality.",

The resulting trajectories are smooth and free of local minima. In this paper, we proceed with our comprehensive study on possible forms for the core equation of the planner. The main goal is to allow the planner to deal with inhomogeneous environments. The navigational potential is calculated independently in different patches of the environment. Each patch has its own bias for potential concavity (or convexity), then creating regions with higher or lower traveling preferences. By using simulated experiments we compare the performance of the new BVP with some recent proposals.",

        "abstract": "Neurological injuries caused by stroke, spinal cord injury or other illnesses and accidents often lead to walking disabilities. If not properly treated, gait disorders can lead to impaired physical and mental health, reduced physical activity, falls, fear of falling, loss of independence and the need for continuous medical care. After an accident or the start of an illness it is important to start the patient's gait rehabilitation process as soon as mental and physical conditions allow. Robotized rehabilitation systems have a number of potential benefits over traditional manual rehabilitation. These benefits include an increase in the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process, reduced costs of rehabilitation and reduced need for trained medical personnel. This paper presents details of the development of the concept of a mobile gait rehabilitation system consisting of a mobile base and powered exoskeleton. In particular, modeling and simulation of its mechanical system are considered. The presented simulation results demonstrate the need for including actuated translational degrees of freedom between the support platform and the exoskeleton to allow displacement of patient's pelvis and practice of dynamically balanced walking.",

Design parameters of the prosthesis have been determined according to the energy absorption intervals of the human gait. Simulation results shows that the power flow of the system is comparable with human data. Finally, an initial prototype is presented as proof of concept.",

With a skill manifold that is learnt from data, we show that constraints can be naturally handled within an iterative process of minimizing the total geodesic path length and curvature over the manifold. We demonstrate the utility of this process with two examples. Firstly, a three-link arm whose joint space and corresponding skill manifold can be explicitly visualized. Then, we demonstrate how this procedure can be used to generate constrained walking motions in a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Resolved acceleration control is a well-known strategy used in tracking control of robotic systems where the desired motion is specified in task-space. Typically, such controllers are developed for systems which exhibit redundancy with respect to execution of operational tasks. While redundancy fundamentally adds new capabilities (self-motion and subtask performance capability), the degree to which secondary objectives can be faithfully executed cannot be determined in advance unless the motion is planned and the environment is known. Therefore, execution of secondary objectives cannot be guaranteed. In fact, a robot which exhibits redundancy with respect to operational tasks may have insufficient degrees of freedom to fulfill more critical objectives such as enforcing constraints. In this paper, we present a generalized constrained resolved acceleration control framework to handle execution of operational tasks and constraints for redundant and non-redundant task (and constraint) specifications. The approach is particularly well suited for online control of complex robot structures such as humanoid robots. The current formulation considers joint limit and collision constraints. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulated experiments of task level upper-body human motion replication on the Honda humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Most of the literature reactive control laws have much difficulties to handle properly constraints such as joint limits, obstacles and saturations, including them as equalities in the Inverse Velocity Kinematics (IVK) problem. Actually, it seems relevant to handle them through inequalities, as the constraints are more numerous than the number of DOFs. However, the intuitive constraints expression can lead to incompatibilities between constraints, which necessarily induces constraints violations. This paper brings two distinct contributions. First, the usual constraints inequalities are modified to make them compatible permanently. Second, an intuitive and efficient constraint compliant control law is proposed.",

        "abstract": "We have created a brain-machine hybrid system (BMHS) which is able to solve the chemical plume tracking (CPT) problem using the brain of the male silkworm moth. The purpose of the system is to investigate adaptability which results from interactions between brain, body, and environment. In this paper, we describe a BMHS architecture and experiments to verify that the behavior of the BMHS is similar to that of a silkworm moth. The BMHS is a kind of cyborg system in which the body of a living being is replaced by a mobile robot and the organism's brain is used to control the robot. The artificial body is controlled by motor commands for the original body that are extracted from a signal recorded from the brain. For that purpose, a small measurement system to record signals was created and a method to reconstruct the motor commands from the signals was established. We demonstrate that the BMHS can behave like a silkworm moth. We compared the trajectories of moths with the trajectories of the BMHS incorporating the same individual moths. Through the experiments we confirmed that the system can solve the CPT problem. Our system has the potential to reveal principles of adaptability in silkworm moth behavior.",

In this paper, a range image sensor for detecting small obstacles on a plane is constructed using a multi-slit laser projector. The sensor consists of a commercially available laser projector and a CCD camera. It measures a relative disparity map (RDMap) whose measurement errors are not affected by the distance. From the obtained RDMap, a plane is estimated using RANSAC and regions out of the plane are detected as obstacles. Experiments show that planes can be obtained with small errors in RDMaps with the constructed sensor, and that a humanoid with the constructed sensor can detect small obstacles such as a moving ping-pong ball and a LAN cable on a plane by the proposed methods while walking.",

In this work, we propose a simple but robust approach to grasp selection for unknown objects, and a reactive adjustment approach to deal with uncertainty in object location and shape. The grasp selection method uses 3D sensor data directly to determine a ranked set of grasps for objects in a scene, using heuristics based on both the overall shape of the object and its local features. The reactive grasping approach uses tactile feedback from fingertip sensors to execute a compliant robust grasp. We present experimental results to validate our approach by grasping a wide range of unknown objects. Our results show that reactive grasping can correct for a fair amount of uncertainty in the measured position or shape of the objects, and that our grasp selection approach is successful in grasping objects with a variety of shapes.",

This planner addresses the particular problem of collision avoidance for autonomous road vehicles which are required to safely interact with other vehicles with unknown intentions. The presented path planner utilizes an efficient spline based trajectory representation and fast but accurate collision probability approximations to enable the simultaneous optimization of multiple contingency paths.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is a great challenge to perform a sound source localization system for mobile robots, because noise and reverberation in room pose a severe threat for continuous localization. This paper presents a novel approach named guided spectro-temporal (ST) position localization for mobile robots. Firstly, since generalized cross-correlation (GCC) function based on time delay of arrival (TDOA) can not get accurate peak, a new weighting function of GCC named PHAT-\u03c1\u03b3 is proposed to weaken the effect of noise while avoiding intense computational complexity. Secondly, a rough location of sound source is obtained by PHAT-\u03c1\u03b3 method and room reverberation is estimated using such location as priori knowledge. Thirdly, ST position weighting functions are used for each cell in voice segment and all correlation functions from all cells are integrated to obtain a more optimistical location of sound source. Also, this paper presents a fast, continuous localization method for mobile robots to determine the locations of a number of sources in real-time. Experiments are performed with four microphones on a mobile robot. 2736 sets of data are collected for testing and more than 2500 sets of data are used to obtain accurate results of localization. Even if the noise and reverberation are serious. The proportion data is 92% with angle error less than 15 degrees. What's more, it takes less than 0.4 seconds to locate the position of sound source for each data.",

        "abstract": "With the growth of elderly population in our society, technology will play an important role in providing functional mobility to humans. In this paper, we propose a robot walking helper with both passive and active control modes of guidance. From the perspective of human safety, the passive mode adopts the braking control law on the wheels to differentially steer the vehicle. The active mode can guide the user efficiently when the passive control with user-applied force is not adequate for guidance. The theory of differential flatness is used to plan the trajectory of control gains within the proposed scheme of the controller. Since the user input force is not known a-priori, the theory of model predictive control is used to periodically compute the trajectory of these control gains. The simulation results show that the walking assist robot, along with the structure of this proposed control scheme, can guide the user to a goal effectively.",

A core challenge to the application of RL to robotic systems is to learn despite the existence of control delay - the delay between measuring a system's state and acting upon it. Control delay is always present in real systems. In this work, we present two novel temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms for problems with control delay. These algorithms improve learning performance by taking the control delay into account. We test our algorithms in a gridworld, where the delay is an integer multiple of the time step, as well as in the simulation of a robotic system, where the delay can have any value. In both tests, our proposed algorithms outperform classical TD learning algorithms, while maintaining low computational complexity.",

Before compensation of the non-linear hysteretic restoring force, to describe the micro operator with a mathematic model is very important. In the paper, the authors build the micro operator's model with Bouc-Wen model. Then with a genetic algorithm the parameters in the mathematic model were identified.

        "abstract": "Flapping wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) hold great potential for matching the agility of flies, their source of inspiration. At small scales, however, it becomes difficult to balance design mechanical complexity and the weight/lift ratio. Considering control in the initial stages of vehicle design can help define system feasibility and the consequences of making design simplifications. Here, four design alternatives based on a piezoelectric driven passive pitch reversal wing are modeled and compared based on their performance under an ideal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control scheme. State error over straight line, circular, and cube trajectories are used as a means of comparison. Wing lift and reasonable control input bounds are defined for each design variation. While not nearly as maneuverable as flies, these designs show promise as feasible controllable vehicles.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for mapping captured human motion with stepping to a humanoid model, considering the current state and the controller behavior. The mapping algorithm modifies the joint angle, trunk and center of mass (COM) trajectories so that the motion can be tracked and desired contact states can be achieved. The mapping is performed in two steps. The first step modifies the joint angle and trunk trajectories to adapt to the robot kinematics and actual contact foot positions. The second step uses a predicted center of pressure (COP) to determine if the balance controller can successfully maintain the robot's balance, and if not, modifies the COM trajectory. Unlike most humanoid control work that handles motion synthesis and control separately, our COM trajectory modification is performed based on the behavior of the robot controller. We verify the approach in simulation using a captured Tai-chi motion that involves unstructured contact state changes.",

The constraints of tangling can be linearized at every frame of motion synthesis, and can be used together with constraints such as defined by the Zero Moment Point, Center of Mass, inverse kinematics and angular momentum for computing the postures by a linear programming procedure. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using the simulator for the Nao humanoid robot. We show that this approach enables us to synthesize complex motion, such as tangling, very efficiently.",

This newly developed method nullifies the need for the computation of pseudo-inverse of Jacobian while the formulation and optimization of any artificial performance index is not necessary. The time-varying properties of the muscle stiffness and damping as well as the low-pass filter characteristics of human muscles have been modeled by the proposed control law. The newly developed control law uses a time-varying damping shaping matrix and a bijective joint muscle mapping function to describe the human-motion characteristics for reaching motion like quasi-straight line trajectory of the end-effector and symmetric bell shaped velocity profile. The aspect of self-motion and repeatability, which are inherent in human-motion, are also analyzed and successfully modeled using the proposed method. Simulation results show the efficacy of the newly developed algorithm in describing the human-motion characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Because bin-picking effectively mirrors great challenges in robotics, it has been a relevant robotic showpiece application for several decades. In this paper we describe the computer vision algorithms in combination with the sophisticated control schemes of the robot and demonstrate a reliable and robust solution to the chosen problem. This paper approaches the bin-picking issue by applying the latest state-of-the-art hardware components, namely an impedance controlled lightweight robot and a Time-of-Flight camera. Lightweight robots have gained new capabilities in both sensing and actuation without suffering a decrease in speed and payload. Time-of- Flight cameras are superior to common proximity sensors in the sense that they provide depth and intensity images in video frame rate independent of textures. The bin-picking solution presented in this paper aims at extending the classical bin-picking problem by incorporating an environment model and allowing for the physical human-robot interaction during the entire process. Existing imprecisions in Time-of-Flight camera measurements and environment uncertainties are compensated by the compliant behavior of the robot. The overall process is implemented in a generic state machine that also monitors the entire bin-picking process.",

The searching and map building tasks are accomplished by using mobile robots equipped with smart transducers for gas sensing. Robots perform the search autonomously by using their own data and the information (position information and sensor readings) obtained from the other robots. Moreover, simultaneously the robots send their sensor readings of the chemical concentration and their position data to a remote computer (a base station), where the data is combined, interpolated, and filtered to form an real-time map of the chemical gas concentration in the environment. To achieve this task as a high-level path planning algorithm we use a decentralized and asynchronous version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm which also allows for time-varying neighborhood.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of cooperative navigation of autonomous marine vehicles using range-only acoustic measurements. We consider the use of a single maneuvering autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) to aid the navigation of one or more submerged autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), using acoustic range measurements combined with position measurements for the ASV when data packets are transmitted. The AUV combines the data from the surface vehicle with its proprioceptive sensor measurements to compute its trajectory. In previous work, we presented an experimental demonstration of this approach, using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation. In the present paper, we analyze the observability properties of the cooperative ASV/AUV localization problem and present experimental results comparing several different state estimators. Using the weak observability theorem for nonlinear systems, we demonstrate that this cooperative localization problem is best attacked using nonlinear least squares (NLS) optimization. We present experimental results for this new approach and compare it to alternative state estimators, demonstrating superior performance.",

The unmanned mobile ground robot is equipped with an infrared (IR) sensor, the aircraft and the stationary ground sensors use optical cameras and radio frequency (RF) detectors, respectively. The primary responsibility of the mobile ground robot is to verify the identity of a target based on its IR signature. In addition, the mobile ground robot also assists with the sensor network's overall target localization estimation efforts by sharing its IR sensor-based target location measurements with members of the sensor network.

However, there are relatively few approaches to coordinate teams of robots that are able to deploy and retrieve other robots. Efficiently coordinating the exploration with such marsupial robots requires advanced planning mechanisms that are able to consider symbolic deployment and retrieval actions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for coordinating the exploration with marsupial robot teams. Our method integrates a temporal symbolic planner that explicitly considers deployment and retrieval actions with a traditional cost-based assignment procedure. Our approach has been implemented and evaluated in several simulated environments and with varying team sizes. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to coordinate marsupial teams of robots to efficiently explore unknown environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for navigating a multi-robot system through an environment while additionally maintaining a predefined set of constraints. Possible constraints are the requirement to keep up the direct line-of-sight between robots or to ensure that robots stay within a certain distance. Our approach is based on graph structures that model movements and constraints separately, in order to cover different robots and a large class of possible constraints. Additionally, the partition of movement and constraint graph allows us to use known graph algorithms like Steiner trees to solve the problem of finding a target configuration for the robots. We construct so called separated distance graphs from the Steiner tree and the underlying roadmap graph, which allow assembling valid navigation plans fast.",

We present DDF-SAM, a novel method for efficiently and robustly distributing map information across a team of robots, to achieve scalability in computational cost and in communication bandwidth and robustness to node failure and to changes in network topology. DDF-SAM consists of three modules: (1) a local optimization module to execute single-robot SAM and condense the local graph; (2) a communication module to collect and propagate condensed local graphs to other robots, and (3) a neighborhood graph optimizer module to combine local graphs into maps describing the neighborhood of a robot. We demonstrate scalability and robustness through a simulated example, in which inference is consistently faster than a comparable naive approach.",

For prevention of the situation above, the authors propose daily support system for elderly people using an interaction monitoring robot. Daily support system use the robot to implement both exercise support function and fall down sensing function. Exercise support function includes an interaction module which is for encouraging person exercise by action and utterance. Fall down sensing function use a monitoring module to detect human motion and tell user who fells down. This interaction monitoring robot has both interaction module and monitoring module. The authors develop both synchronous action function and instruction action function for the interaction module, and human motion recognition function for the monitoring module. The authors evaluated user's stress of experiment of exercise support function.",

        "abstract": "Robust water detection is a critical perception requirement for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous navigation. This is particularly true in wide open areas where water can collect in naturally occurring terrain depressions during periods of heavy precipitation and form large water bodies (such as ponds). At far range, reflections of the sky provide a strong cue for water. But at close range, the color coming out of a water body dominates sky reflections and the water cue from sky reflections is of marginal use. We model this behavior by using water body intensity data from multiple frames of RGB imagery to estimate the total reflection coefficient contribution from surface reflections and the combination of all other factors. We then describe an algorithm that uses one of the color cameras in a forward-looking, UGV-mounted stereo-vision perception system to detect water bodies in wide open areas. This detector exploits the knowledge that the change in saturation-to-brightness ratio across a water body from the leading to trailing edge is uniform and distinct from other terrain types. In test sequences approaching a pond under clear, overcast, and cloudy sky conditions, the true positive and false negative water detection rates were (95.76%, 96.71%, 98.77%) and (0.45%, 0.60%, 0.62%), respectively. This software has been integrated on an experimental unmanned vehicle and field tested at Ft. Indiantown Gap, PA, USA.",

However, a systematic design of an autonomous decentralized control system has not been well established, because previous studies mainly focused on the control of phase relationship among body parts, i.e., phasic control, but not on the control of the spatio-temporal dynamics of muscle tonus, i.e., tonic control. In this paper, we propose a decentralized control scheme that enables to reconcile phasic control and tonic control, by taking serpentine locomotion as a practical example. Through modeling and simulations, we show that well-balanced coupling between the phasic and tonic control is crucial for the generation of adaptive and efficient locomotion.",

In practice, communication connections for information exchange between all robots are not always guaranteed, which adds difficulty to state estimation. This paper examines the decentralized cooperative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem under a sparsely-communicating and dynamic network. We mathematically prove how the centralized-equivalent estimate can be obtained by all robots in the network in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, a robot only needs to consider its own knowledge of the network topology to detect when the centralized-equivalent estimate is obtainable. Our approach is validated through more than 250 minutes of experiments using a team of real robots, with accurate groundtruth data of all robots and landmark features.",

We introduce two distributed prioritized planning algorithms: an efficient, complete method which is shown to converge to the centralized prioritized planner solution, and a sparse method in which robots discover collisions probabilistically. Planning is divided into a number of iterations, during which every robot simultaneously and independently computes a planning solution based on other robots' path information from the previous iteration. Paths are exchanged in ways that exploit the cooperative nature of the team and a statistical phenomenon known as the \u201cbirthday paradox\u201d. Performance is measured in simulated 2D environments with teams of up to 240 robots. We find that in moderately constrained environments, these methods generate solutions of similar quality to a centralized prioritized planner, but display interesting communication and planning time characteristics.",

        "abstract": "A differential geometry based modeling of a belt object to represent its deformation path is proposed. Adequate deformation path of a belt object such as film circuit boards or flexible circuit boards must be generated for automatic manipulation and assembly. First, deformation of a belt object is described using the curvature of its central axis, torsion around the central axis and the curvature in the transverse direction. Second, a method to derive an adequate transition of the object shape from the initial state to the final state is proposed. It can be derived by minimizing the maximum of the local potential energy in the belt object during its manipulation. This is because locally excessive potential energy often leads to the excessive stress that makes fractures in the belt object. Finally, the validity of our proposed deformation path is verified by estimating the maximum local potential energy in a belt object.",

        "abstract": "A three-dimensional cardiomyocyte gel was reconstructed using an extracellular matrix gel formed from Matrigel and collagen I. The autonomous beating of the cardiomyocyte gel was synchronized with contraction of cardiomyocytes in the gel. The gel beating frequency was increased by increasing the concentration of adrenaline in the cardiomyocyte culturing medium. Drug stimulation to modulate the beating frequency could be used for control of a pumping application. A micropump driven by the cardiomyocyte gel was demonstrated. The micropump consisted of two check valves and the cardiomyocyte gel actuator. The volume changes of the channel in the micropump, synchronized with the autonomous gel beating, were seen.",

        "abstract": "In a robotic cell, an assembly robot has to grasp various parts robustly even under some uncertainties in their initial poses. For this purpose, it is necessary to design robust grasping strategies for robotic hands. In this paper, we propose a method to derive an optimal robust grasping strategy from a given initial pose error region of a target object. Based on the pushing operation analysis, it is possible to simulate multi-fingered hand grasping and derive a permissible initial pose error region of a target object from which planned grasping is successful. Adopting an active search algorithm proposed by the authors, we can find the optimal grasping strategy efficiently. As an example, we derive the optimal grasping strategy for grasping a circular object by a three-fingered hand.",

        "abstract": "Concurrency is an integral part of many robotics applications, due to the need for handling inherently parallel tasks such as motion control and sensor monitoring. Writing programs for this complex domain can be hard, in particular because of the difficulties of retaining a robust modular design. We propose to use SCOOP, an object-oriented programming model for concurrency which by construction is free of data races, therefore excluding a major class of concurrent programming errors. Synchronization requirements are expressed by waiting on routine preconditions, which turns out to provide a natural framework for implementing coordination requirements in robotics applications. As demonstration application, we describe a control program for hexapod locomotion, whose implementation closely follows the corresponding behavioral specification given by the biological model. We compare the architecture with solutions expressed in more traditional approaches to robotic control applications.",

At the core of our algorithm are vision modules that exploit texture energy, optical flow, and scene geometry (lines) in order to robustly detect descending stairwells during both far- and near-approaches. As the robot navigates down the stairs, it estimates its three-degrees-of-freedom (d.o.f.) attitude by fusing rotational velocity measurements from an on-board tri-axial gyroscope with line observations of the stair edges detected by its camera. We employ a centering controller, derived based on a linearized dynamical model of our system, in order to steer the robot along safe trajectories. A real-time implementation of the described algorithm was developed for an iRobot Packbot, and results from real-world experiments are presented.",

A set of linguistically labelled polylines allows to build a compact geometrical representation of the indoor location where a set of representative points (or features) are semantically described. These features are processed in order to find a list of traversable segments whose middle points are heuristically clustered. Finally, a set of safe paths are calculated from these clusters. Both the environment representation and the safe paths can be used by a controller to carry out navigation and exploration tasks.

So it is required that the robots should be able to move in the complex and unpredictable environment where the ground might be soft and hard, even and uneven. To access to such terrains, a novel robot (NEZA-I) with the self-adaptive mobile mechanism is proposed and developed. It consists of a control system unit and two symmetric transformable wheel-track (TWT) units. Each TWT unit is driven only by one servo motor, and can efficiently move over rough terrain by changing the locomotion mode and transforming the track configuration. It means that the mobile mechanism of NEZA-I has self-adaptability to the irregular environment. The paper proposes the design concept of NEZA-I, presents the structure and the drive system of NEZA-I, and describes the self-adaptive principle of the mobile mechanism to the rough terrains. The locomotion mode and posture of the mobile mechanism is analyzed by the means of simulation. Finally, basic experiments verify the mobility of NEZA-I.",

Projective model of this system is derived, which provides a foundation for sphere-based calibration algorithm. It calibrates not only the conventional camera parameters, but also the mirror parameters. We also prove that a minimum of two spheres are needed to calibrate the seven parameters.",

        "abstract": "Haptic interfaces compatible with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are finding increasing interest as a tool to explore the neural correlates of human motor control and related dysfunctions. To achieve safety and MR compatibility, such devices have mainly relied on unconventional actuation methods suffering from limited bandwidth and non-linearities. This has resulted in complex control and restricted their use in applications involving fine and dynamic interaction with the hand and fingers. To address these limitations, we propose a concept for a shielded high-performance actuation system to be located inside the MR room, evaluate the effectiveness of the shielding and perform detailed MR compatibility tests. A conventional electromagnetic actuator is located within a steel shield to prevent mutual disturbance with magnetic fields of the scanner, which, together with power and control hardware, is placed within a Faraday cage with only a fiber-optical USB link to the control room. Detailed compatibility tests show that disturbing dynamic electromagnetic fields generated by the actuation system are well below the detectable threshold of the scanner, and actuator performance is not degraded by the MR environment. In combination with a light and stiff cable or rod transmission, the presented actuator technology, providing high transparency and force bandwidth, paves the way for fMRI-based neuroscience studies, e.g., to investigate the fine motor control of hand and fingers.",

Properties of the thermal SMA are similar to those of C. elegans muscle, which enables us to generate biologically relevant undulating motions. Each of 12 body segments composed of a pair of actuators is designed to be serially connected via a link that includes a motion control unit. Microcontroller is used to implement a simple sequential mode-based motion control scheme. Computer simulation and experimental results with a four segment prototype demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed robot design and control mechanism.",

We are investigating three main questions regarding the performance of the wearable haptic interface. The first question is whether stable and transparent presentation of contact with rigid surfaces on objects can be simulated with the wearable haptic interface. The second question is whether the performance of the haptic interface degrades when the user is able to walk around in the virtual environment while being tracked by a tracking system and using force feedback to navigate along rigid objects. The third question is whether the deflection of forces to the user's torso while operating the device disturbs the haptic interaction. In addition we are going to explain the mechanical construction of the wearable haptic interface and the dataflow of the virtual reality framework.",

The evaluation of the leg prototype is an important milestone in the development of HyQ, a Hydraulically actuated Quadruped robot. The prototype features two rotary joints actuated by hydraulic cylinders and has a mass of 4.5kg. We performed several experiments with the leg prototype attached to a vertical slider to tests the robustness of the mechanical design and the hydraulic actuation system. Besides the experimental evaluation of the hydraulic components, we also extensively studied the sensor data of the leg during periodic hopping. The results show that hydraulic actuation is suitable for legged robots because of its high power-to-weight ratio, fast response and ability to cope with high impact force peaks. Furthermore, we compare the cylinder force data obtained by the load cell with the calculated value based on the cylinder pressures to analyze if it is possible to eliminate this sensory system redundancy in the future. Through these studies, weaknesses of the design were identified and suggestions on how to improve them are presented.",

We report in this paper the design, simulation, and preliminary experimental results of a jumping robot that is 150 mm long. The robot design is inspired by the structure of vertebrates' musculoskeletal system and the function of muscles that are used for the jumping motion. A few essential muscles are applied to our robot in the form of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The jumping motion of a computer model is simulated to find a suitable pattern of SMA wire activation. The parameters obtained from the simulation are applied to a robot prototype in experiments. Experimental results show that the forward distance obtained from the jumping experiment is comparable to the simulation result.",

The handheld controller can be easily carried by firefighters and the joystick-based controller allows more accurate and rapid control for specific tasks in emergency situations. Both controllers are designed to gather situational information such as video feed and temperature and gas concentration data. We analyze the efficiency of the two controllers by carrying out a performance evaluation. To determine the usefulness of these controllers to firefighters, a questionnaire survey was conducted. Based on the opinions of firefighters, we suggest scenarios in which both controllers may be applicable at expected fire sites.",

        "abstract": "During traditional open procedures, surgeons directly palpate tissues before dissecting them. In this way, they can avoid the accidental damage of hidden arteries that can lead to fatal hemorrhage. New Minimally Invasive Surgical (MIS) techniques progressively decreased the instrument access into the patient's body to reduce scars and side effects. The major drawback of these procedures is that they do not permit surgeons to perform direct tactile exploration of internal tissues. Surgeons have to rely on preoperative images and anatomical knowledge to avoid artery locations. However, the exact artery position changes depending on the patient and his posture. Hence, it is of primary importance to assist surgeons with technology that can guide them during the surgical procedure. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a tactile display that reproduces pulse-like feedback on the surgeon's fingertip. The display bandwidth and performance of the ad-hoc control unit were assessed with encouraging results. In addition, the outcome of two psychophysical studies carried out in this work validate the usability of the display in terms of user perception.",

This paper describes work on the robot's face, a hybrid face composed of a plastic faceplate and an LCD display, and our implementation of facial expressions on this versatile platform. We report the implementation of two representations of affect space, each of which map the space of potential emotions to specific facial feature parameters and the results of a series of human-robot interaction experiments to characterize the recognizability of the robot's archetypal facial expressions. The tested subjects' recognition of the implemented facial expressions for happy, surprised, and sad was robust (with nearly 100% recognition). Subjects, however, tended to confuse the expressions for disgusted and afraid with other expressions, with correct recognition rates of 21.1% and 52.6% respectively. Future work involves the addition of more realistic eye movements for stronger recognition of certain responses. These results demonstrate that a hybrid face with affect space facial expression implementations can provide emotive conveyance readily recognized by human beings.",

        "abstract": "In the design of wearable robots, the possibility of dynamically regulating the mechanical output impedance is crucial to achieve an efficient and safe human-robot interaction and to produce useful emergent dynamical behaviors. In this paper we propose a Variable Impedance Differential Actuator (VIDA) for wearable robotics applications. The system comprises two actuators (one being an impedance-controlled rotary Series Elastic Actuator) connected through a Harmonic Drive in a differential configuration used to separately control output position and mechanical impedance. Design choices regarding the overall architecture and the single components are presented and discussed. The mechanical structure also comprises a custom-made torsion spring designed after a CAD/FEM optimization. An electromechanical model of the system has been developed and a control strategy, based on the equilibrium point approach, is simulated to validate the performances of the system against system requirements. The actuation architecture allows to implement a control strategy where an equilibrium position and impedance field are simultaneously and independently regulated. This is possible still adopting very simple control laws: two controls for position and impedance regulation of the two input shafts.",

We also developed high power motor drivers for the proposed method. An experiment of a high power joint test bench is shown.

Sorts of reactive emotions and the framework to generate these emotions against stimuli were identified based on psychological researches on humans' emotions. Computational models of reactive emotion system were also proposed with dynamic models. Each model realized necessary characteristics for reactive process successfully. The developed model was implemented in a toy-like robot which is called `GOMY'. The robot can show emotional response reactively against stimulus change. The proposed reactive emotion model can be considered as the most basic foundation of general emotional process for interactive robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for robust dance motion structure detection. In the japanese folk dance domain, teachers created illustrations of dance poses. These poses characterize the most important movements of a dance. So far there is no simple and reliable extraction method which can extract all poses as shown in these drawings. We use these poses for the Task Model (TM) in the context of Learning from Observation (LFO). LFO which is a well known technique for successful human to robot motion mapping, consists of tasks (what to do) and skills (how to do). We propose a novel approach, to extract special motions from a dance, called turning motions useful for skill mapping in the LFO paradigm. Furthermore, we use a modified version of this approach, to detect all poses as shown in the drawings, called turning poses. To achieve this we observe both forearms at the same time and analyze their movement in different 2-D coordinate planes. We evaluate the parameters with and without a weighting function where we minimize acceleration, velocity and power. We successfully demonstrate this novel method using two very different japanese folk dances and discuss further implications of this work in respect to the LFO paradigm and dances of other domains.",

This paper presents a novel method that detects relatively long variable-length unknown repeated patterns in a motion sequence efficiently. The major contribution of the paper is two-fold: (1) Partly Locality Sensitive Hashing (PLSH) [1] is employed to find repeated patterns efficiently and (2) the problem of finding consecutive time frames that have a large number of repeated patterns is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem which is solved via Dynamic Programming (DP) in polynomial time O(N1+1/\u03b1) thanks to PLSH where N is the total amount of data. The proposed method was evaluated by detecting repeated interactions between objects in everyday manipulation tasks and outperformed previous methods in terms of accuracy or computational time.",

        "abstract": "Our research focuses on anomaly detection problems in unknown environments using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). We are interested in detecting two types of abnormal events: sensory level anomalies (e.g., noise in an office without lights on) and time-related anomalies (e.g., freezing temperature in a mid-summer day).We present a novel, distributed, machine learning based anomaly detector that is able to detect time-related changes. It consists of three components. First, a Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network classifier is used to label multi-dimensional sensor data into discrete classes and detect sensory level anomalies. Over time, the labeled classes form a sequence of classes. Next, a symbol compressor is used to extract the semantic meaning of the temporal sequence. Finally, a Variable Memory Markov (VMM) model in the form of a Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST) is used to model and detect time-related anomalies in the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes/models the temporal sensor data using a symbol compressor and PST in a WSN. Our proposed detection algorithm is distributed, \u201clight-weight\u201d, and practical for resource constrained sensor nodes. We verify the proposed approach using a volcano monitoring dataset. Our results show that this approach yields the same performance as the traditional Markov models with much less cost.",

        "abstract": "A microwave Doppler sensor can monitor human motion without contact. It can sense wide range of motion from minute oscillation like respiration to large movement like walking because it measures the distance change between the target and the sensor as signal phase change. However, the proper method for the signal phase estimation is different between motion and respiration measurement. In this paper, we compare three methods for signal phase estimation and find the optimal method and parameters for each problem. For switching to the proper phase estimation method or monitoring human state, it is important to detect motion signal and respiration signal from the raw signal of sensor output. Three kinds of features, energy, frequency-domain entropy and histogram are extracted and are input into binary classifiers. We tested least squares, SVM and AdaBoost classifiers.",

In order to separate individual object motions from the self-motion of the observing camera, we implement a linear method to recover the full set of 3D motion parameters undergone by the camera. Based on the recovered camera motion and reconstructed depth information of the detected scene points, a criterion has been derived to determine how well individual scene points agree with the estimated camera motion. The classification of scene points is achieved by statistical analysis of the probability distribution function of the points' motion characteristics. After the initial classification, the identified dynamic scene points are further clustered into different objects by taking into account the underlying geometric distribution in the image. The approach is unique in that it can detect moving objects using a single pair of images and is completely automated. Several experiments have been carried out in challenging environments using two different hardware setups. A comparative study shows that the proposed classification method generates fewer false alarms compared to a standard one.",

In particular, we focus on solving minimal problems where the unknown 6-degree-of-freedom transformation between the two robots is determined based on the minimum number of measurements necessary for finding a discrete set of, in general, multiple solutions. In order to address the very large number of possible combinations of inter-robot observations, we identify symmetries in these problems and use them to prove that any of the possible extrinsic robot-to-robot calibration problems can be solved based on the solution of only 14 (base) minimal problems. Finally, we derive analytical solutions to three of these base problems, and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations.",

        "abstract": "Simulation in the context of engineering often focuses on very special details of global systems. Robot designers usually begin with the analysis of new actuators and joint designs. This corresponds to a \u201cbottom-up\u201d-strategy in the development of simulation models. For classical fields of application of robotics, e.g. in production plants with a well defined environment this is the approved method, because it allows very detailed insights into the analyzed subsystems. On the other hand, unpredictable effects of the interaction of multiple subsystems may easily be overseen. In particular, nontechnical environments like in moon exploration tasks or in a biological environment like in forestry applications are hard to describe in an analytical way to integrate them into an analytical simulation model. This is why this paper presents the idea and some practical aspects of the development of \u201cVirtual Testbeds\u201d. In a Virtual Testbed, the entire system is simulated as a whole in Virtual Reality - not only small subsystems of a global system. According to the requirements different subsystems are simulated with different levels of detail. In contrast to the classical \u201cbottom-up\u201d-strategy this can be seen as a \u201ctop-down\u201d-approach. Therefore the employment of a multi-body dynamics system as a platform for the development of versatile simulation and testing environments is proposed. Using the examples of the evaluation and testing of an extraterrestrial walking exploration robot design and the development of a method for self-localization in forestry, the idea is further deepened. As a special field of attention the integration of a method of soil simulation as a particular requirement of a Virtual Testbed for walking exploration robots is presented.",

        "abstract": "When planning robotic grasping and manipulation maneuvers, knowledge of the shape and pose of the object of interest is critical information. In order for an autonomous or semi-autonomous system to operate intelligently in an unstructured environment and interact with novel objects, it must have the ability to recover this information at run time, even when no a priori information of the object is available. In this paper, we describe the development and testing of an algorithm that can reconstruct the full 3D geometry of a novel object from just three images. A variant of shape from silhouettes, the algorithm first generates a rough surface approximation in the form of a point cloud. This approximation is then refined by fitting an eleven parameter geometric surface to the points in such a manner that the surface ignores noise and perspective projection shadows. We test the algorithm in both simulation and on several real world objects. We show that the algorithm provides accurate reconstructions that can be directly used to plan grasping maneuvers. Compared to other attempts in the literature, the proposed algorithm is faster, requires fewer images, is more accurate, and degrades gracefully in the presence of bad data. A real world test case is included that shows that the algorithm still yields usable results when the form of the object is amorphous or otherwise non-geometric.",

In service robotics systems, understanding the relationship between everyday objects and user intention is the key feature to provide suitable services according to context. RT Ontology has shown to be an efficient technique to represent this relationship. In the proposed method, text corpus grabbed from search engines and lightweight natural language processing techniques were used for term extraction and enabling RT Ontology automatic creation. On the other hand, ontology evolution mechanism is introduced. With these learning and evolution capabilities, the presented RT Ontology model may adapt dynamically to the changes of environment and human activities. This will help to improve the robustness of current RT service generation systems, while reduce much of required labor work for ontology development. Experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Recently, in medical field, different training methods for medical staff have been proposed. However, the lack of knowledge on the real improvements of trainees makes difficult the real effectiveness of those proposed methods. Therefore, we are proposing an Active Training system for the effective medical training. The Active training system is characterized by providing quantitative information of the trainee's performance of the task to the trainee, simulating real-world conditions of the task, and assuring training effectiveness. In order to fulfill each of these characteristics, we have developed Waseda Kyotokagaku Airway No.3 (WKA-3) which makes it possible to obtain quantitative information for the trainee's performance and reproduce the various cases, individual differences for the airway difficulties for the simulating real-world conditions of the task. In this paper, we are proposing a patient scenario generation which can reproduce the characteristics of the patient simulating real-world conditions of the task for WKA-3. In emergent situation or surgical operation, the characteristics of patients are presented in the three parameters such as: patient initial conditions, time variant status change, and reflex action. By adjusting, and combining each of the three parameters, we can reproduce the various patient scenarios. In this paper, we also state how to generate the Patient Scenario Generation using the position control and virtual compliance control. Finally, a set of experiments has been carried out to the doctor subjects in order to verify effectiveness of the proposed Patient Scenario Generation, and discuss the doctors about the result of the experiments.",

        "abstract": "There are several works on mobile robots that employed a single ball as their wheel. Each of them used a kind of inverted pendulum control and a specific ball drive mechanism. The requirement for the mechanism is to roll the ball in two orthogonal directions for maintaining robot attitude and traveling on a two dimensional surface. In addition to these rolling motions, rotation around a vertical axis is useful for turning the robot body. The author developed robots that used wheels for omnidirectional motion of the ball in previous works. However, the wheel was complex to produce in large quantities and expensive. The purpose of the work described in this paper is to develop a new simpler mechanism with drivability almost comparable to previous driving mechanism but lower in cost. The idea of a roller with semi-passive features and a ball drive mechanism are described as well as experimental results using a robot with the proposed mechanism.",

The model draws inspiration from the seabird Uria aalge, the common guillemot. It is implemented within a parametric study associated with aerial and aquatic performance, specifically aiming at minimizing energy of locomotion. The implications of varying wing geometry and kinematic parameters are investigated and presented in the form of nested performance charts. Trends within both the aquatic and aerial model are discussed highlighting the implications of parameter variation on the power requirements associated with both mediums. Conflicts of geometric parameter selection are contrasted between the aerial and aquatic model, as well as other trends that impact the design of concept vehicles with this capability. The model has been validated by implementing a heuristic optimization of its key parameters under conditions akin to those of the actual bird; optimal parameters output by the model correlate to the actual behaviour of the guillemot.",

        "abstract": "A big advantage of minimally invasive surgery is the quick recovery afforded by the minimal physical injury sustained by patients. However, the operative field provided by the endoscope camera is rather narrow. This paper discusses a new broad-view camera system, which is capable of providing a wider view of the internal organs during minimally invasive surgery. This system consists of a camera unit for capturing the image and a monitor for displaying the captured image. With the use of this system, the invasiveness of the procedure does not increase, and the other specifications of current minimally invasive surgery are maintained. Furthermore, it can function as a second camera (in addition to the one attached to the endoscope) and can help assess the overall state of the target area. In this paper, we present this a newly developed camera system, which is intended for use along with the proposed system. The camera system is composed of a miniature color CMOS camera, an indwelling needle, and an extra-thin connector. The specific design of the camera unit and the method for positioning it are shown here. The performance of this camera system has been confirmed through basic and laparoscopic surgery on animals.",

        "abstract": "As an important approach to ensure safety and naturalness, compliant motion is already implemented in large-size robots, but it is still an undeveloped area in child-oriented robots as it calls for a lightweight and compact solution compared with large-size robots. In this paper, we proposed the design of a social robot which aims at conducting safe and playful Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), especially with children. We built a teddy bear robot prototype based on hybrid passive-active compliant system which consists of flexible joints as passive part and compliant motion controller as active part. The compliant controller detects external perturbation through motor state variables, therefore force and torque sensors could be omitted to keep overall system compact. Experiments conducted in typical HRI scenarios showed that the hybrid passive-active compliant system enabled our robot to conduct safer and more interactive physical interaction compared with robot under traditional control method.",

The system is potentially capable of sharing the workspace with human workers, assuming the use in a cell manufacturing system. We propose a new 3-DOF gripper mechanism with two fingers which symmetrically move in parallel and each finger has a 2-DOF fingertip of a cylindrical shape. We also develop a lightweight arm with a weight compensation mechanism which is composed of a non-circular pulley and a spring to minimize required actuator torque. After verification of basic performance, the hand-arm system successfully performs a pick-and-place task for a discoid object from horizontal placement to vertical placement and vice versa. We demonstrate continuous 100 times pick-and-place operations without failure where its cycle time almost equals to a human worker.",

These features greatly contribute to design various small mechanisms such as a finger joint of a robot hand. The crown gear pair is meshing in face to face, one acts as a rotor and the other as a stator. The rotor gear has N teeth and the hub is connected to the output shaft. The spokes of rotor gear are elastically deformed according to gears rolling. The stator gear fixed on a housing has N - 1 teeth (or N + 1). The meshing of crown gear pair with several shapes of rack tooth are simulated, and proper parameters of rack to improve high rigidity of teeth are calculated. Finally, backlash and minimum input torque to rotate are evaluated using a prototype reducer.",

Rodents such as rats are often chosen as experimental subjects in these experiments. However, according to some researchers, the experiments on social interactions using animals are poorly- reproducible. Therefore, we consider that the reproducibility of these experiments can be improved by using a robotic agent that interacts with an animal subject. We have developed a novel quadruped rat-inspired robot, the WR-2 (Waseda Rat No.2), based on the dimension and body structure of a mature rat. It is capable of reproducing the behaviors such as walking, mounting, rearing and grooming of the rat.",

Patient transfer, such as lifting and moving a bedridden patient from a bed to a wheelchair and back, is one of the most physically challenging tasks in nursing care, the burden of which should be reduced by the introduction of robot technologies. We have developed a new prototype robot named RIBA with human-type arms that is designed to perform heavy physical tasks requiring human contact, and we succeeded in transferring a human from a bed to a wheelchair and back. To use RIBA in changeable and realistic environments, cooperation between the caregiver and the robot is required. The caregiver takes responsibility for monitoring the environment and determining suitable actions, while the robot undertakes hard physical tasks. The instructions can be intuitively given by the caregiver to RIBA through tactile sensors using a newly proposed method named tactile guidance. In the present paper, we describe RIBA's design concept, its basic specifications, and the tactile guidance method. Experiments including the transfer of humans are also reported.",

We focused on the bowel peristalsis as a model for a mechanism that can transport sludge with little water. In this paper, we suggest a mechanism that uses such a pump and confirmed its capability. In addition, we fabricated a peristaltic pump of six units, and conducted liquid transportation experiments as an operational check.",

After reviewing of the line-walking mechanism, power line inspection robot is described in detail. The pose adjustment analysis is carried out to make sure that the robot will keep in stable state when rolling on the power transmission line which forms a catenary curve. The obstacle-navigation cycle of the designed inspection robot is composed of a single-support phase and a double-support phase. The centroid of the robot will be adjusted to shift to the other leg to start a new single-support phase. The feasibility of this concept is then confirmed by performing experiments with a simulated line environment.",

This study clarified the basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots and developed PERNOD by means of psychological methodology. The results revealed six basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots: Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness. The 6 dimensions of PERNOD were originally developed for humanoid robots. Thus, these dimensions represent the organization of knowledge used in the recognition of humanoid robots. Usability of PERNOD was discussed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, to deal with the locomotion and performance in pipe or even in blood vessel condition, we design a novel type of hybrid microrobot that has characteristics of multi-functions, controllability, stability. The hybrid microrobot has simple structure, simple control method, and good dynamic. We develop the microrobot composed of rotating motion and fish-like locomotion to realize the wireless controllability capable of swimming and rotating motion. We design the rotation magnetic field, the motion mechanism of rotating motion and fish-like motions have been analyzed as well. Also, we design the hybrid microrobot by combining the rotating motion and fish-like fin motion. By applying the rotation magnetic field, we carried out the evaluating experiments for rotating motion and moving motion in a pipe. The experimental results indicated that, for the rotating motion, the rotating speed of 87rad/s and moving speed of 58mm/s; for the hybrid microrobot, the moving speed of 48mm/s can be obtained via frequency of the input current. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the microrobot has a rapid response. This microrobot will play an important role in both industrial and medical applications such as microsurgery.",

The purpose of this work is to develop flapping robots using a new type of piezoelectric material, that is, piezoelectric fiber composites. By using the composites, actuating as well as energy harvesting and sensing fibers can be embedded into the wing as part of the structure, which makes the robot flap while remaining compact and light. This paper describes the performance enhancement of the flapping robots capable of flapping and feathering motions using piezoelectric fiber composites. A unique mechanism with different stiffness for up-stroke and down-stroke and a new drive control using saturated sine wave are proposed in this paper. By introducing the mechanism and drive control, the performance about lift and thrust force has been improved remarkably.",

Compared with conventional artificial muscular underwater robots, powerful underwater robots with a very simple structure can be composed. This paper describes the development of a flexible underwater robot with caudal fin propulsion, which can generate large propulsive force and move at high speed. Besides, by utilizing the large propulsive force, pitch and roll motions are realized by attaching two pectoral fins to the robot.",

However, on account of track-terrain slippage and transformation caused by changes in sub-track angles, gyro-based odometry for tracked vehicles with sub-tracks experiences difficulties in estimating the exact location of the vehicles. In order to solve this problem, we propose an estimation method with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) for determining the position and pose of the tracked vehicles using terrain information. (In this study, position refers to the robot's position and pose.) In the proposed method, position are estimated using a particle filter. The subsequent position of each particle are predicted using a motion model that separately considers each contact point of the vehicle with the ground. In addition, each particle is analyzed using terrain and gravity information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.",

        "abstract": "A tele-operation system for a crane is developed. The crane consists of a small actuator and a large actuator in x and y direction respectively. The large actuators are controlled by input signals from an operator and the small actuators are used as a regulator and feedback controlled by a wire angle sensor. Since a motion of the suspended object can be approximated as a second order system, overshoots of the object inevitably happen at the moment when the operator give a stop command to the system. To avoid this overshoots, a novel user interface is developed where operators indicate via points or target point of the object on a monitor screen from the camera imaging the scene below the crane. The system interpolates the via points by using four order functions and give the velocity commands to the crane until the inputs of the via points are stopped. The final point is regarded as the target point. From experimental results, the effectiveness of the developed control system and its control algorithm is verified.",

        "abstract": "Foot mechanism of walking robots needs to adapt to rough terrain enough because the walking robot is requested to have the ability to walk stably on rugged ground. However, the foot mechanism of multi-leg walking robots have been often modeled as a point foot or a disc sole so far, and there is a problem that the robot can not fully use the sole area as a support polygon on rough terrain. To solve the problem, the terrain adaptive sole is developed which can adapt to the ground with small ruggedness and support the ankle moment to acquire stable footholds on uneven terrain. The terrain adaptive sole is composed of a deformation mechanism, a shape-fixing mechanism and a vertical force sensor, which are developed for quadruped walking robot TITAN VIII. The deformation mechanism changes the shape of the foot according to the terrain and the shape-fixing mechanism fixes the shape after the foot landing. These functions are achieved by a passive mechanism to be robust and lightweight. We demonstrate that TITAN VIII with the proposed terrain adaptive sole can successfully negotiate a rough terrain.",

For this purpose, the authors have been developing an Airway management training system. In particular, we have previously presented an evaluation model system to acquire quantitative information for the trainee's performance, and an actuated model system for real-world conditions of the task. In order to fulfill all of the characteristics of the active training system; in this paper, we would like to propose an integrated system, Waseda Kyotokagaku Airway No.3 (WKA-3) which integrates the function of both system models. For this reason, we have focused on embedding sensors and actuators with the link drive mechanism and the wire drive mechanism to a conventional patient model towards the development of a patient robot. In this paper, we present WKA-3 how to design the mechanism and how to redesign several organs to embed the sensors for the measurement of the trainee's performance. A set of experiment have been carried out to doctor subjects using the WKA-3 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system by asking doctors to evaluate the proposed system.",

TITAN X walks in leg form on rough terrain and makes tracked locomotion using track-belt on level or comparatively low-rough terrain. The characteristics of TITAN X are: 1) it has a hybrid function but is lightweight, 2) it has potential capabilities to demonstrate high-performance on highly-rough terrain. In this paper, details of leg design using a special belt are reported. Also form changing mechanisms are integrated into the system. We have constructed prototype of TITAN X to demonstrate basic performance. Experiments were conducted to verify the validity of the concept of track-changeable walking robot.",

        "abstract": "Animals and insects use their own navigating system to return home in various ways. One of the most widely used senses is vision. They use visual information to remember the home snapshot image which is useful in returning home from an arbitrary location. Inspired by behaviours of insects and other animals, there have been many homing algorithms applied to mobile robots. These methods use visual information to choose the moving direction by comparing the current landmark view with the snapshot taken at the nest. In this paper, we suggest a new image-based navigation method which is called landmark navigation with distance estimation. This method computes the distance to each landmark by using only the visual information of an omnidirectional camea. Estimated distance is then used to locate the robot in an environmental map. As a result, this new method shows better performance in returning home from an arbitrary location than other methods. The corresponding robotic experiments will be demonstrated.",

Two distributed coverage control algorithms are presented that both provide a solution to the problem by discrete coverage of a graph. The first method computes shortest paths and runs the Lloyd algorithm on the graph to obtain a centroidal Voronoi tessellation. The second method uses the Euclidean distance measure and locally exchanges mesh cells between approximated Voronoi regions to reach an optimal robot configuration. Both methods are compared and evaluated in simulations and in experiments with five robots on a curved surface.",

In order to accelerate the visual feedback, the distributed computational power across networks and appropriate data transmission mechanism are of particular interest. In this paper, a novel distributed computation with data scheduling is proposed for networked visual servo control systems (NVSCSs) aiming at improving the control performance. A realtime transport protocol is developed for image data transmission. For a NVSCS which is modeled as a continuous-time system with computation, transmission and holding delays, a switching control law is applied. A probabilistic sampling scheduler is derived such that the control performance and the network load caused by image data transmission are balanced. Experiments on two 1-DoF linear modules equipped with a camera are conducted to validate the proposed approach. A visual servo system without data scheduling is implemented for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate a comparable control performance of the proposed approach with an advantage of reduced network load.",

Various original algorithms are proposed to reconstruct, recognize and convey the object levitating on a new contactless distributed manipulation device. Experimental results show that each algorithm does a good job for itself and that all the algorithms together succeed in sorting and conveying the objects to their final destination. In the future, this architecture may be used to control MEMS-arrayed manipulation surfaces in order to develop Smart Surfaces, for conveying, fine positioning and sorting of very small parts for micro-systems assembly lines.",

        "abstract": "Major progress in robotics turns today's humanoid robots into ever safer, more robust, and more agile agents by the moment. However, it is still a long way until robots can safely operate in open environments. Especially in the area of service robotics, the need arises for robots to work flexibly in a human centered environment. One way towards this goal is to incorporate more and more of the mechanisms that can be found in humans for our robots. In this work we would like to propose a bio-inspired control architecture for an equally bio-inspired - namely anthropomimetic - humanoid robot. To achieve this, the human motor control system is analyzed and copied at a structural level. This results in a distributed control infrastructure that is capable of reducing the complexity of the control task by off-loading parts of the control problem into the robot's limbs. Finally, we will prove the fact that it is possible to control an anthropomimetic robot with a large number of degrees of freedom with the proposed control architecture.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a moving target tracking problem with mobile sensor networks. The moving target is assumed to be an intelligent agent, which is \u2018smart\u2019 enough to escape from the detection. We formulate this target estimation problem as a zero-sum game in this paper and use a so-called minimax filter to estimate the target position. The minimax filter is a robust filter that minimizes the estimation error by considering the worst case noise. Furthermore we develop a distributed version of the minimax filter for multiple sensor nodes. The distributed computation is implemented via a consensus filter. Finally, the mobile sensor nodes need to control their motions to move towards the estimated target position and avoid collisions with neighbors. A flocking algorithm is developed for this purpose. The simulation results show that the target tracking algorithm proposed in this paper provides a satisfactory result.",

Detection is achieved by means of a software contact-event sensor with no additional sensing hardware beyond the commercial actuators' standard shaft encoders. A simple finite state machine identifies disturbances as due either to an expected ground contact, a missing ground contact indicating leg fault, or an unexpected \u201cwall\u201d contact. Recovery proceeds as necessary by means of a recently developed topological gait transition coordinator. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system by presenting preliminary data arising from two reactive behaviors - wall avoidance and leg-break recovery. We believe that extensions of this framework will enable reactive behaviors allowing the robot to function with guarded autonomy under widely varying terrain and self-health conditions.",

The result is a compact and \u201csingularity free\u201d representation for two arm systems, named cooperative dual task-space. All the proposed control strategies share the same general scheme and are derived by using an analytical approach. Moreover, the mathematical treatment is given in a coherent and systematic fashion, and thus other strategies may be derived using the same argument. Experimental results show the effectiveness and usefulness of the cooperative dual task-space framework and the proposed control strategies.",

The center of mass (COM) dynamics are affected directly through contact force control to achieve stable balance. This idea is used to formulate DBFC considering the full rigid-body dynamics of the robot to produce desired contact forces. To achieve generic force control tasks, a virtual model controller, DBFC-VMC, is presented. Results presented from experiments on a force-controlled humanoid robot and simulation demonstrate the general purpose use of this control.",

        "abstract": "Usually, the joint transmission friction model for robots is composed of a viscous friction force and of a constant dry sliding friction force. However, according to the Coulomb law, the dry friction force depends linearly on the load driven by the transmission. It follows that this effect must be taken into account for robots working with large variation of the payload or inertial and gravity forces, and actuated with transmissions as speed reducer, screw-nut or worm gear. This paper proposes a new inverse dynamic identification model for n degrees of freedom (dof) serial robot, where the dry sliding friction force is a linear function of both the dynamic and the external forces, with a velocity-dependent coefficient. A new identification procedure groups all the joint data collected while the robot is tracking planned trajectories with different payloads to get a global least squares estimation of inertial and new friction parameters. An experimental validation is carried out with a joint of an industrial robot.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots that are employed in people's homes need to safely navigate their environment. And natural human-inhabited environments still pose significant challenges for robots despite the impressive progress that has been achieved in the field of path planning and obstacle avoidance. These challenges mostly arise from the fact that (i) the perceptual abilities of a robot are limited, thus sometimes impeding its ability to see relevant obstacles (e.g. transparent objects), and (ii) the environment is highly dynamic being populated by humans. In this contribution we are making a case for an integrated solution to these challenges that builds upon the analysis and use of implicit human knowledge in path planning and a cascade of replanning approaches. We combine state of the art path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms with the knowledge about how humans navigate in their very own environment. The approach results in a more robust and predictable navigation ability for domestic robots as is demonstrated in a number of experimental runs.",

This mechanism is composed of 4 piezoelectric actuators and pair of electromagnets and moves like an inchworm with less than a 10 nm resolution. We calculate the dynamical relationship between 3 DOF motion and 4 piezoelectric displacements. We also calculate the maximum velocity with no slip of electromagnets because the no slip condition is very important for motion repeatability. In several experiments, we have checked the theoretical validity and we confirm that the analysis procedure works well as an initial design of the inchworm mechanism. The design procedure, basic performance, and chip-mounting applications are also discussed as an advance in the new field of micro-robotics used in precision regions.",

The robot in this paper has three DOFs and two inputs, of which the nature is a nonlinear and underactuated system with nonholonomic dynamic constraints. The improved construction of two pendulums offers novel motion principle of spherical robot, which is moving simultaneously actuated by both eccentric moment and inertial moment generated by the two pendulums. Meanwhile the mobility is enhanced when the robot behaves dynamically. The emphasis is placed on the linear motion and turning in place motion control. The dynamic model of linear motion is formulated on the basis of Lagrange equation, and a smooth trajectory planning method is proposed for linear motion. A feedback controller is constructed to ensure the accurate trajectory planning. Turning in place motion is an indispensable element of omni directional locomotion which can enhance the mobility of spherical robots. The dynamic model of turning in place motion is derived on the theory of moment of momentum, and a stick-slip principle is analyzed. The two motion control methods are validated by both simulations and prototype experiments.",

A probabilistic scan matching technique using range scans gathered from a Mechanical Scanning Imaging Sonar (MSIS) is used together with the robot dead-reckoning displacements. The proposed method utilizes two Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs). The first, estimates the local path traveled by the robot while forming the scan as well as its uncertainty, providing position estimates for correcting the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the acoustic images. The second is an augmented state EKF that estimates and keeps the registered scans poses. The raw data from the sensors are processed and fused in-line. No priory structural information or initial pose are considered. Also, a method of estimating the uncertainty of the scan matching estimation is provided. The algorithm has been tested on an AUV guided along a 600 m path within a marina environment, showing the viability of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a development framework for social robots with which developers can easily prepare communicative behaviors based on tag-based sentences. Previous literature in human-robot interaction has revealed various useful non-verbal behaviors. But for developers, integrating such a large amount of non-verbal behaviors each time they build a social robot is not realistic. The more repertory of non-verbal behaviors acquire, the larger is the burden faced by developers to implement the non-verbal behaviors. Our software, however, only requires developers to prepare sentences with simple markup language for controlling explicit non-verbal behaviors and utterances. The backend system analyzes the tag input and adds implicit non-verbal behaviors accordingly. With the help of previous literature, the system is equipped with various communicative behaviors, so that the robot autonomously adjusts its gazes, gestures, and standing points. The system's effectiveness is demonstrated with examples on robot interaction where the system receives only simple sentences with scripting language to produce complex and communicative robot behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Tele-operation of robotic platforms has long suffered from the inability of the operator to effectively perform ancillary tasks while controlling the robot. Because of the focus required to perform tele-operation, the operator is limited in their ability to use the robot to improve their situational awareness, with tele-operation often becoming a detriment to their task rather than an enhancement. We present experimental results on the use of a tele-operated robotic system modified to include layered obstacle detection and avoidance routines and an open space planner. These algorithms help the operator shift their focus towards high-level tasks instead of low-level navigation. While experimental data shows that the increase in autonomy did not lead to a reduction in task completion time, obstacle collisions were reduced and has led to further investigation of cognitive load reduction during operation.",

        "abstract": "Pose graphs have become a popular representation for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. A pose graph is a set of robot poses connected by nonlinear constraints obtained from observations of features common to nearby poses. Optimizing large pose graphs has been a bottleneck for mobile robots, since the computation time of direct nonlinear optimization can grow cubically with the size of the graph. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for constructing and solving the linear subproblem, which is the bottleneck of these direct methods. We compare our method, called Sparse Pose Adjustment (SPA), with competing indirect methods, and show that it outperforms them in terms of convergence speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large set of indoor real-world maps, and a very large simulated dataset. Open-source implementations in C++, and the datasets, are publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Software for autonomous robots solving challenging tasks in research or application is becoming increasingly complex. System integration has to deal with various different functional components. To decouple those components from each other and to enable a modular and reuseable software architecture a robot middleware is typically used. But this intermediate layer introduces significant additional overhead during run-time. In this work a methodology is described to utilize specific application characteristics to improve communication efficiency between different robot software modules. By composing several components in a single thread memory copying or locking operations can be avoided, when data is exchanged between those parts. The optimization can be achieved without compromising the advantages of a communication layer. Still the modifications are transparent to the maybe already existing components. Experimental results in the scenario of autonomous soccer-playing humanoid robots are presented and exhibit remarkable reduction in communication overhead. Furthermore this approach can be implemented in or on-top of other communication layers.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient kinematical solution to a multi-robot system with serial and parallel mechanisms. JL-I is a reconfigurable robot featuring active spherical joints formed by serial and parallel mechanisms endowing the robotic system with the ability of changing shapes in three dimensions. The active joint here can combine the advantages of the high rigidity of a parallel mechanism and the extended workspace of a serial mechanism. However, the kinematic analysis of the serial and parallel mechanism is always the bottleneck in designing a robot and control realization. In order to deal with this problem, the whole kinematical analysis is organized in the sequence from the direct mechanical analysis related to the serial and parallel mechanism over the numerical solutions to the simplified kinematics expression. The latest results obtained demonstrate that the deduced closure-form solution is time efficient and easy to implement while offering a satisfactory motion performance in on-site experiments.",

Optimal base location and arm motion for minimizing the joint torques are examined by numerical simulations, and the base location where the robot arm is near a singular configuration at the start time of task is optimal. It is shown analytically that joint torques can supply energy to the system composed of the robot arm and the object efficiently near singular configurations of the arm.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In robotic applications the absolute pose is often obtained as the integral of successive relative rigid-body motions. As each relative rigid-body motion is typically the product of statistical inference, the integrated absolute pose will exhibit error build-up and the estimated trajectory will differ from the true trajectory undertaken by the system. Some application areas allow the system to receive additional information about its current absolute pose, for example from loop detection, which is more accurate than the integral of the relative rigid-body motions. The availability of this absolute information is usually less frequent than the information underlying the relative rigid-body motions. This contribution addresses an efficient closed form algorithm which minimally bends a trajectory such that the integrated pose is exactly equal to any particular desired pose. The manner in which the bending is distributed over the trajectory is controllable using weights. The proposed method will be compared against a maximum likelihood solution on simulated trajectories as well as on trajectories estimated from binocular and monocular data. The results indicate that the performance differences between the closed form approach and the maximum likelihood solution are negligible while the closed form approach is significantly more efficient.",

This research explores the feasible application of multi-finger robot hands except for the use as prostheses and grasping applications. The forearm EMG of a person who is massaged by the human hands is recorded and analyzed statistically. First, the root mean square (RMS) of the raw data is computed as the discrimination between normal and contracted states of the muscle. Then the EMG signal at contracted state is further divided into painful and comfortable groups based on the impulse factor which is defined to estimate the sharpness of waveform variations. As a consequence, two discriminative values of the EMG signal are generated to distinguish painful and comfortable feelings. Based on the relationship between the human feeling and the massage force, we get an appropriate range of input commands of the robot hand for massage applications. A grasp-kneading massage is performed on the human shoulder to verify the proposed process. As a result, an effective and comfortable massage using the multi-finger robot hand is realized.",

        "abstract": "When a camera is affixed on a dynamic mobile robot, image stabilization is the first step towards more complex analysis on the video feed. This paper presents a novel electronic image stabilization (EIS) algorithm for highly dynamic mobile robotic platforms. The algorithm combines optical flow motion parameter estimation with angular rate data provided by a strapdown inertial measurement unit (IMU). A discrete Kalman filter in feedforward configuration is used for optimal fusion of the two data sources. Performance evaluations are conducted using a simulated video truth model (capturing the effects of image translation, rotation, blurring, and moving objects), and live test data. Live data was collected from a camera and IMU affixed to the DAGSI Whegs mobile robotic platform as it navigated through a hallway. Template matching, feature detection, optical flow, and inertial measurement techniques are compared and analyzed to determine the most suitable algorithm for this specific type of image stabilization. Pyramidal Lucas-Kanade optical flow using Shi-Tomasi good features in combination with inertial measurement is the EIS algorithm found to be superior. In the presence of moving objects, fusion of inertial measurement reduces optical flow root-mean-squared (RMS) error in motion parameter estimates by 40%.",

Data fusion allows the advantages of two or more sensors to be combined, and complementary cooperation can be obtained. This paper presents two methods to embed depth information in omnidirectional images using the extrinsic calibration of a 2D laser range finder and a central catadioptric camera. The methods presented do not require a visible laser beam, but they assume the planar checkerboard patterns are visible for both the catadioptric camera and the 2D laser range finder. Unlike other approaches, the methods proposed used an invisible laser trace, and they are evaluated at pixel error level using ground truth data from the calibration patterns projected in the omnidirectional image. Results include a mean square error analysis of all calibration poses, and laser point projection on indoor omnidirectional images. We think that embedding range information in omnidirectional images is an interesting tool for data fusion approaches, which can be used in robot map building and localization.",

To investigate the learning process behind this computational scheme, we propose a learning method that embodies the features of biological systems, termed tacit learning. We have constructed a controller based on the notion of tacit learning and applied it to the control of the 36DOF humanoid robot to create the bipedal walking adapted to the environment. Experiments on walking showed a remarkably high adaptation capability of tacit learning in terms of gait generations, power consumption and robustness.",

In this paper, we present a simple architecture for robotic arm control which can be used for both. The model is based on some dynamical equations, which provide a motor control with exploring and converging capacities. A visuo-motor map is used to associate positions of the end effector in the visual space with proprioceptive position of the robotic arm. It enables a fast learning of the visuo-motor associations without needing to embed a priori information. The controller can be used both for accurate control and interaction. It has been implemented on a minimal robotic setup showing some interesting emergent properties. The robot can reproduce simple gestures in mimicry situation and finalized actions in deferred imitation situation. Moreover, it can even show some \u201cintention\u201d recognition abilities. Finally, the experiment of deferred imitation which inherits from learning by demonstration, also provides a good basis for cooperative and interactive experiments.",

We discuss an approach for determining a set of optimal parameters of ASI by considering both the uncomfortability sensation due to light flickering, the sharpness of the motion, and the amplitude of the vibration of the object. We also give an example of optimal parameter determination for human skin.",

The method makes use of metric maps for local navigation and a topological map for global path planning. Metric maps are generated as occupancy grids by a laser range finder to represent local information about partial areas. The global topological map is used to indicate the connectivity of the \u2018places-of-interests\u2019 in the environment and the interconnectivity of the local maps. Visual tags on the ceiling to be detected by the robot provide valuable information and contribute to reliable localization. The navigation scheme based on the hybrid metric-topological maps saves memory space and is also scalable and adaptable since new local maps can be easily added to the global topology, and the method can be deployed with minimum amount of modification if new areas are to be explored. The video demonstrated that the method is implemented successfully on physical robot in a hospital environment, which provides a practical solution for indoor navigation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents real-time MRI-based control of a ferromagnetic microcapsule for endovascular navigation. The concept was studied for future development of microdevices designed to perform minimally invasive interventions in remote sites accessible through the human cardiovascular system. A system software architecture is presented illustrating the different software modules to allow navigation of a microdevice in blood vessels, namely: (i) vessel path planner, (ii) magnetic gradient steering, (iii) tracking and (iv) closed-loop navigation control. First, the position recognition of the microrobot into the blood vessel is extracted using Frangi vesselness filtering from the pre-operation images. Then, a set of minimal trajectory is predefined, using FMM, to guide the microrobot from the injection point to the tumor area through the anarchic vessel network. Based on the pre-computed path, a GPC is proposed for robust time-multiplexed navigation along a 2D path in presence of pulsative flow. The simulation results suggest the validation of the proposed image processing and control algorithms. A series of disturbances introduced in the presence and absence of closed-loop control affirms the robustness and effectiveness of this predictive control system.",

We investigate the characteristics of three different walking gaits with different step lengths. Comparison of these walking gaits in walking velocity, efficiency and stability reveals the relation between step length and walking performance. Experimental results indicate that the gait which is more close to human normal walking achieves higher stability and energetic efficiency.",

In order for such devices to operate without an external power source, it is necessary to address a complex system design challenge: the integration of all of the required components on board the robot. This paper discusses the flight energetics of flapping-wing robotic insects with the goal of selecting design parameters that enable power autonomy and maximize flight time. The subsystems of the robot are analyzed both from a broad perspective and using a detailed set of models for a piezoelectrically driven two-wing design. The models are used to perform a system-level optimization for the maximum flight time permitted by current technology, compare the resulting robot configurations to biological insects across several key metrics, and discuss the effect of performance gains in various subsystems of the robot.",

        "abstract": "The 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 project with man landing on the moon reminds the world again by what science and engineering can do if the man is determined to do. However, a huge step can only be achieved step by step which may be relatively small at the beginning. Robotic exploration can provide necessary information needed to do the further step safely, with less cost, more conveniently. Trajectory generation for a robotic vehicle is an essential part of the total mission planning. To save energy by exploiting possible resources such as wind will assist a robotic explorer extend its life span and perform tasks more reliably. In this paper, we propose to utilize Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) methodology to generate energy efficient trajectores for the JPL Aerobot by exploiting wind. The Aerobot model is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral dynamics with control inputs as elevator deflection \u03b4e, thrust demand \u03b4T, vectoring angle \u03b4v for the longitudinal motion, aileron deflection \u03b4a, rudder deflection \u03b4r for the lateral motion. The outputs are the velocities and orientation of the Aerobot. The Aerobot state space model parameters are obtained from experimental identification on AURORA Airship since the actual JPL Aerobot is similar to the AURORA Airship. In this paper, the results show that with the state-space model, the proposed trajectory generation method can guide the Aerobot to take advantage of previously known wind profile to generate an energy-efficient trajectory.",

However, the efficiency to use the electric energy still needs deliberate research. Traditional EV has no choice to manage its energy flow, because it has only one traction motor. With the robotic research in 4 wheel independent drive (4WID), the driving task of the single traction motor can be shared by 4 independent in-wheel motors. By exploring the motor efficiency map, we propose the energy management strategy based on optimal driving torque distribution (ODTD). The total input power of the 4 motors can be minimized while the driving performance is still maintained, and electric energy consumption can be reduced compared with traditional single motor driving EV. Simulation results validate the proposed strategy. The energy management strategy can also be applied to multi-driving-wheel mobile robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for semantic place labeling by formulating the problem in terms of energy minimization. A method based on graph cuts is used to minimize energy for a function of data cost and smoothness cost. While the data term aims at assigning visual observations to a set of pre-specified place categories, using appearance-based hierarchical classifiers, the smoothness term incorporates contextual evidence from neighbors to ensure that the labels vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving discontinuities at the borders between adjacent places in the environment. Our proposed method achieved a performance of 91.85%, labeling 2,146 images from the challenging COLD database with place semantics. Correct labeling of 14.5% of images was the result of incorporating contextual information.",

To verify its feasibility and the effect of the proposed optimal gait pattern from the point view of the integrated system (human and exoskeleton), simulations were performed in the cases of walking on level ground and stair ascent/descent. Experiments such as on the metabolic cost of the human body with or without the assistance of the exoskeleton were conducted, and the power consumption of the exoskeleton was assessed, with the aim of improving the efficiency of the integrated system.",

This paper investigates an information enriched map constructed by the environment geometry from laser range finder and the indoor directive signs commonly seen in living/working environment from camera image. To implement this enriched map, multi-sensor fusion techniques are utilized for robust pose and sign estimations. Furthermore, an improved alignment technique is applied to reduce the computational complexity in a single Graph-SLAM process.",

With this algorithm, multiple mobile sensor nodes can collectively sample the environmental field and recover the environmental field function via machine learning approaches. The mobile sensor nodes are able to self-organise so that the distribution of mobile sensor nodes matches to the estimated environmental field function. In this way, it is possible to make the next-step sampling more accurate and efficient. The machine learning approach used for function regression is support vector regression (SV R) algorithm. A distributed SV R learning algorithm is used for on-line learning. The self-organised algorithm used for deployment is based on locational optimisation techniques. In particular, Lloyd's algorithm for optimising centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CV T) is used to spread mobile sensor nodes over the monitored environment. The environmental field function is simulated in static and dynamic settings and the demonstration on the simulated environments shows the proposed algorithm is effective.",

But owing to inexpressive representations, autonomous robots hardly conduct efficient tasks planning, especially in unknown conditions. The application of semantic knowledge in task planning is critically required in artificial intelligence research. In this paper, we focus on two topics: semantic knowledge representations and parallel planning for uncertainties. Firstly, a semantic memory system which is called EpistemeBase is proposed for indoor tasks planning, it includes five parallel agents: Assertion, Plan, Anticipation, Behaviour and Effect. Its framework is an evolving process, which consists of Datum, Information, Knowledge and Intelligence. Secondly, the same task planning is synchronously represented by five paralleled agents. This paralleled structure can well accelerate the process of tasks planning as well as better handle it under uncertainties. Finally, the experiment of tasks planning is conducted for measuring the reaction time of planning and uncertainties by using the EpistemeBase and the Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS) respectively.",

The presented algorithm was applied to the remote operational task, and qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed.

        "abstract": "In recent SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) literature, Pose Only optimization methods have become increasingly popular. This is greatly supported by the fact that these algorithms are computationally more efficient, as they focus more on the robots trajectory rather than dealing with a complex map. Implementation simplicity allows these to handle both 2D and 3D environments with ease. This paper presents a detailed evaluation on the reliability and accuracy of Pose Only SLAM, and aims at providing a definitive answer to whether optimizing poses is more advantages than optimizing features. Focus is centered around TORO, a Tree based network optimization algorithm, which has gained increased recognition within the robotics community. We compare this with Least Squares, which is often considered one of the best Maximum Likelihood method available. Results are based on both simulated and real 2D environments, and presented in a way where our conclusions can be substantiated.",

The proposed grasp quality measure is defined by the distance between the convex hulls of the absolute grasp wrench space (a-GWS) and the object wrench space (OWS), where a-GWS and OWS are, respectively, created by the active wrenches from the robot fingers with limited torque bounds and the uniform distribution of unitary normal disturbances on the surface of a polyhedral object. The computational algorithm for the grasp quality measure also yields the information of which spots of the object are fatal under the disturbance, which makes the algorithm practically useful. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed measure through numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "The recently introduced Minimum Uncertainty Maximum Consensus (MUMC) algorithm for 3D scene registration using planar-patches is tested in a large outdoor urban setting without any prior motion estimate whatsoever. With the aid of a new overlap metric based on unmatched patches, the algorithm is shown to work successfully in most cases. The absolute accuracy of its computed result is corroborated for the first time by ground-truth obtained using reflective markers. There were a couple of unsuccessful scan-pairs. These are analyzed for the reason of failure by formulating two kinds of overlap metrics: one based on the actual overlapping surface-area and another based on the extent of agreement of range-image pixels. We conclude that neither metric in isolation is able to predict all failures, but that both taken together are able to predict the difficulty level of a scan-pair vis-\u00e0-vis registration by MUMC.",

The cloth feature in PhysX has the potential of taking into account complex dynamics while at the same time being accelerated by a graphics processing unit. As an initial approach, muscle-shaped structures are simulated with the cloth feature and employed as actuators in a robotic structure where both morphology and control parameters are subject to optimization by a genetic algorithm. A linear and a spring-damper-based model have also been applied for reference. Stable locomotion has been successfully evolved, however, attention to simulation parameters has been necessary in order to avoid simulator instability.",

Such representations are based on shared biomechanical primitives inspired from kinematics, dynamics, and energetics. Our intension is twofold, initially to study the nature of aggressive biomechanical models and then to classify their physical activities by evolving expression-trees with biomechanical synthesis. The methodology targets on evolving expression programs using the Gaussian Ground-plan Projection Area model, to discriminate among three aggressive behaviours and recognise the individual actions involved. For the n-class problem, three programs have been evolved, each for an aggressive behaviour such as the arm-Launch, the legLaunch, and the bodyLaunch behaviour, so that to be able to examine separately the evolvable characteristics induced. The proposed approach has evidently shown strong classification and discrimination performances.",

In most of underwater robots, electric motors are used as actuators to drive the robotic arm/arms, but using electric motors for underwater manipulators may be problematic due to the size/weight of the robotic arm and need to waterproof the electric motors. We develop a joint mechanism composed of combinations of rigid and flexible members, which can be deformed by a prismatic actuator fixed onto two rigid parts. We utilize a leaf spring as the flexible joint and a McKibben actuator driven by water hydraulic pressure as the prismatic actuator. The number of members in this mechanism is smaller than that of a mechanism composed of a combination of one pulley and one coil spring. One advantage of this mechanism is the avoidance of gears, thus eliminating sliding parts from the joint.",

        "abstract": "Viscoelastic materials are known to exhibit temporal response that changes force or displacement at the contact interface under position or force control, respectively. In this paper, we conduct experimental study using force control to explore and observe creep phenomenon in robotic grasping in order to better understand the nature of such contact interface, which has been widely used in soft robotic fingers, robotic feet, and contact surface of robotic arms. We found that the creep response under a constant external force exhibits the characteristics of exponentially increasing or decreasing temporal response. Such characteristics are similar in nature to those found in the relaxation response of viscoelastic materials when the grasping is under position control. Two different types of creep responses are found, depending on the state of grasping. Both Types I and II in creep response mirror the Types I and II in relaxation response. We also found that different loading rates under force control result in different elastic response, in addition to the temporal response. This is an interesting finding because the Fung's model postulates for an elastic response that is independent of, and can be separated from, the temporal response. The experimental results do not show such independence.",

To improve the performance of the impedance controller, system parameter estimations with extended kalman filter and gravity compensation have been investigated on the robot hand. Experimental results show that, for the harmonic drive robot hand with joint toruqe feedback, accurate position tracking and stable torque/force response can be achieved with cartesian and joint impedance controller. In addition, a FPGA-based control architecture with flexible communication is proposed to perform the designed impedance controller.",

Closed-chain kinematic structure affects the dynamics formulations by several constraints. Therefore, especially for higher degrees of freedom manipulators, manipulation of implicit and bulky dynamics formulation looses the tractability of the analysis. In this paper, a methodology and some simplification tools are introduced to achieve explicit dynamics formulation for parallel manipulators. This methodology is applied for the dynamics analysis of the most celebrated parallel manipulator, namely Stewart-Gough platform. By avoiding any recursive or component-wise derivations, the resulting dynamics formulation provides more insight for designers, and can be much easier used in any model-based control of such manipulators. In order to verify the resulting dynamics equations, Lagrange method is used to derive and compare the manipulator mass matrix. This methodology can be further used to formulate the explicit dynamics of other parallel manipulators.",

        "abstract": "In real-world situations, a robot may often encounter \u201cunder-determined\u201d situation, where there are more sound sources than microphones. This paper presents a speech separation method using a new constraint on the harmonic structure for a simultaneous speech-recognition system in under-determined conditions. The requirements for a speech separation method in a simultaneous speech-recognition system are (1) ability to handle a large number of talkers, and (2) reduction of distortion in acoustic features. Conventional methods use a maximum likelihood estimation in sound source separation, which fulfills requirement (1). Since it is a general approach, the performance is limited when separating speech. This paper presents a two-stage method to improve the separation. The first stage uses maximum likelihood estimation and extracts the harmonic structure, and the second stage exploits the harmonic structure as a new constraint to achieve requirement (2). We carried out an experiment that simulated three simultaneous utterances using impulse responses recorded by two microphones in an anechoic chamber. The experimental results revealed that our method could improve speech recognition correctness by about four points.",

At the basis of interaction, a fundamental role is played by the ability to actively regulate the interaction forces. In this paper we propose a technique for controlling the interaction forces exploiting a proximal six axes force/torque sensor. The major assumption is the knowledge of the point where external forces are applied. The proposed approach is tested and validated on the four limbs of the iCub, a humanoid robot designed for research in embodied cognition. Remarkably, the proposed approach can be used to implement active compliance in other non passively back-drivable manipulators by simply inserting one or more force/torque sensor anywhere along the kinematic chain.",

        "abstract": "In autonomous bimanual operation of a robot, parallelized planning and execution of a task is essential. Elements of a task have different functional and spatial relationships. They may depend on each other and have to be executed in a specific order or they may be independent and their order can be determined freely. Consequently, individual actions can be planned and executed in parallel or not. In a proof of concept, this paper shows that the structure of a task and its mapping onto subordinate planners can significantly influence planning speed and task execution. Independent tasks are planned using two parallel path planners. Dependent tasks are planned using one path planner for both arms. Using a simple, yet expandable experimentation scenario, the resulting recommendations for parameterizing path planners are verified on a humanoid robot. For execution on the real robot a violation of the rigid body model used in path planners had to be addressed.",

The state-of-the-art solution to this problem is the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm that quickly finds a feasible solution. However, the RRT algorithm does not return better results with additional time. We introduce RRT++, an anytime extension of the basic RRT algorithm.

        "abstract": "For effective trajectory formation of robots, we propose a method to extract candidate points of the destination of walking people from their walking trajectories. The method is useful for setting the candidate points of the destination automatically which is necessary to estimate the pedestrians' destination. We assume that potential fields influence pedestrians. After estimating parameters of the potential fields and evaluating their minimum points, we extracted candidate points of the respective destinations of pedestrians. To estimate the parameters of the potential fields accurately, we classified data of pedestrian' walking trajectories into groups. Thereby, the trajectories leading to the same destination are gathered in one group. We designed an evaluation function that indicates the conformity between the trajectory and the destination to classify the data correctly. Results obtained from experiments in an actual environment to verify the availability of the proposed method show that appropriate candidate points of the destination are extracted.",

To achieve this aim, this study examines adopting a spinal structure with variable viscoelasticity and multiple joints. In order to investigate the effect of this spinal structure, a physical model of the spinal structure and a quadruped robot incorporating this design were developed, and the relationship between the gait pattern of the legs of the robot and viscoelasticity as a source of passive oscillation of the spinal structure was observed. The experimental results indicate that there are several interactions between the gait pattern and the viscoelasticity that can achieve one of various types of successful locomotion. These results suggest that the proposed spinal structure is a suitable body design for facilitating multi-modal locomotion at low computational costs.",

Our new approach, called Hierarchical BVP Path Planner, enables real-time performance on large environments.

However, these sensors are rarely used for commercial machines requiring safety since it is difficult to eliminate the possibility of failure. Although fault tolerance is an important issue, no critical method for general force measurement is proposed in the past. Hence, this paper proposes a fault tolerance measurement method using sensing devices with redundancy. The proposed method accomplishes both: fault detection without additional sensors; and force estimation during fault period. Furthermore, the fault detection handles many kinds of faults such as disconnection of wires, peeling of strain gauge, and so on. The validity of the proposed method is verified through some simulations and experiments.",

We define a set of specifications for fusion methods appropriate for MRMS environments. In light of these specifications, we review two popular algorithms for probabilistic sensor fusion, Linear Opinion Pool (LOP) and Logarithmic Opinion Pool (LGP). To overcome difficulties of applying them to a MRMS setting, a new method is introduced, p-norm Opinion Pool (POP). Comparing to LOP and LGP, POP is more compatible with the specifications and more flexible, successfully handling situations of agreement and disagreement between sensors. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we check performance of the POP and compare it with LOP and LGP. We also implement a real-world experiment through which the performance of POP is examined.",

Our approach is based on seventh order B\u00e9zier curves to connect vertexes of the tree, generating paths that do not violate the main kinematic constraints of the vehicle. The methodology also does not require complex kinematic and dynamic models of the vehicle. The smoothness of the acceleration profile of the entire path is directly guaranteed by controlling the curvature values at the extreme points of each B\u00e9zier that composes the tree. The proposed algorithm provides fast convergence to the final result with several other advantages, such as the reduction in the number of vertexes of the tree because the method enable connections between vertexes of the tree with unlimited range. In an environment with few obstacles, a very small quantity of vertexes (sometimes only two) is sufficient to take the robot between two points. The properties of the seventh order B\u00e9zier formulation are also used to avoid collisions with static obstacles in the environment.",

The algorithm explores the state-space using a bi-directional rapidly exploring random tree (biRRT) in order to find a feasible trajectory between an initial and goal state. By incrementally scheduling LQR controllers, it attempts to connect states so as to link the two trees. These attempts are evaluated by verifying that the connected state is inside the controllable area of an infinite time horizon controller at the goal. This allows for a rapid delineation of equivalent neighborhoods in the state-space. As a result, random exploration is terminated as soon as a feasible solution is made possible by feedback means, avoiding oversampling and partially introducing optimal actions at the neighborhood of the connection. The algorithm is demonstrated and compared against a biRRT using single-link pendulum and cart-pole swing-up tasks amongst obstacles, the latter showing a nearly order of magnitude more efficient search.",

        "abstract": "Multi-camera systems are used in many domains such as vision-based robotics or video surveillance. An accurate extrinsic calibration is usually required. In most of cases, this task is done by matching features through different views of the same scene. However, if the cameras' fields of view do not overlap, such a matching procedure is not feasible anymore. Despite this constraint, this article deals with a simple and flexible extrinsic calibration method. The main contribution is the use of an unknown geometry scene and a planar mirror to create an overlap between views of the different cameras. Furthermore, the impact of the mirror refraction is also studied. The aim is the calibration of two non-overlapping cameras embedded on a vehicle, for visual navigation purpose in urban environment. The proposed approaches have been validated with both synthetic and real data in a metrological experimental framework.",

The main contribution of this paper lies in the proposal of using multi-agent solution to address the flocking problem of particles in micro environment. The proposed framework can be applied to many bio-applications such as cell sorting, cell property characterization, and so on, with high throughput and precision.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach for purely vision based mobile robot navigation. The visual obstacle avoidance and corridor following behavior rely on the segmentation of the traversable floor region in the omnidirectional robocentric view. The image processing employs a supervised approach in which the segmentation optimal with respect to the appearance of the local environment is determined by cross validation over 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device (PMD) camera. The range data in the front view provides the seeds and validation data to supervise the appearance based segmentation in the omniview. Segmentation relies on histogram backprojection which maintains separate appearance models for floor, obstacles and background. A naive Bayes classifier predicts the occupancy of the robots local environment by fusing the evidence provided by different segmentations and models. The classification error is analyzed on ground truth data generated by a PMD camera and manually segmented scenes. The scheme is highly robust with respect to ambiguous and misleading visual appearances of obstacles and floor, thus enabling the robot to navigate safely in unstructured environments of diverse appearance, texture and illumination. The proposed vision algorithm and the navigation behavior demonstrate a robust performance in extensive robotic experiments across several hours of autonomous operation.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method of measuring position of daily commodities placed on a floor. Picking up an object on a floor will be a typical task for a robot working in our daily life environment. However, it is difficult for a robotic vision to find a small daily life object left on a large floor. The floor surface may have various texture and shadow, while other furniture may obstruct the vision. Various objects may also exist on the floor. Moreover, the surface of the object has various optical characteristics: color, metallic reflection, transparent, black etc. Our method uses a laser range finder (LRF) together with a mirror installed on the wall very close to floor. The LRF scans the laser beam horizontally just above the floor and measure the distance to the object. Some beams are reflected by the mirror and measure the distance of the object from virtually different origin. Even if the LRF fails two measurements, the method calculates the position of the object by utilizing information that the two measurements are unavailable. Thus, the method achieves two major advantages: 1) robust against occlusion and 2) applicable to variety of daily life commodities. In the experiment, success rate of observation of our method achieves 100% for any daily commodity, while that of the existing method for a cell-phone is 69.4%.",

A centipede-like multi-legged robot is composed of segmented trunks which have a pair of legs and are connected with fore and/or rear ones by joints. This control scheme realizes locomotion control of multi-legged robot on uneven terrain with perfectly decentralized manner. The main concept of the control scheme is to relay the contact points from the fore leg to the rear leg. By creating contact points of the first legs adequately on the environment, the robot can climb over obstacles and be navigated successfully. Finally, the result of physical simulation of a 20-legged robot shows the availability of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to copy human dexterity of manipulation with force feeling to robot manipulation. We adopt Jenga game as our first target task. This paper describes our strategic implementation how robot removes blocks from Jenga tower. In this paper, we make Jenga kinematics model. First we show kinematics model of stable Jenga tower. Another kinematics model is of transition period of removing block. Using these kinematics models, robot manipulator chooses the most safe block to remove. But of course, there exist difference of acting force between ideal model and actual Jenga tower. So the robot judges the acting force against ideal one whether the block can be removed or not. When it is judged not to remove, the robot changes to next candidate to remove. According this force based manipulation strategy, the robot has achieved to remove more than twelve blocks form Jenga block tower. During competition with human, the robot can remove a block after more than twenty blocks are removed.",

In order to verify these characteristics, a robot arm with two links that are driven by planetary gear is developed in this paper. First, the complicated muscle structure is simplified as a three-pair six-muscle model including the biarticular muscle. Then based on the configuration, statics at the endeffector is redefined and a force control algorithm is suggested. The suggested statics and force control have the advantage of its simplicity. Then a novel robot arm to emulate the biarticular muscle is developed. A planetary gear system is adopted to transfer torque generated by a motor to two joints. Unnecessary coupling caused by the planetary gear is removed by disturbance observer control. Experiments done by the robot arm verifies the effectiveness of the suggested statics and force control.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This work proposes a mechatronic solution to increase the back-drivability of a state-of-the art robot for wrist neurorehabilitation. The final goal is to reduce robot mechanical impedance in order to cope with intrinsic kinematic constraints, which are adopted by the human brain to solve redundancy during pointing tasks with the wrist. The handle of the robot has been provided with a load cell and a direct force control scheme has been implemented to minimize the interaction forces/torques between the user and the robot. To this aim gravity, inertia and friction of the more proximal DOF of the robot (relative to Pronation/Supination (PS) movements) have been estimated and compensated for. The proposed solution resulted in a 70% reduction of the end-point perceived inertia in PS DOF as well as in a decrease of torques exerted by the user during both 1-DOF and 3-DOFs tasks. The average reduction of interaction torques is around 81% and 78% respectively. This work constitutes an important starting point for the analysis of the effect that different levels of robot transparency could have on the human neural constraints adopted during redundant tasks, such as pointing movements with the wrist.",

However, they struggle to control the force, they do not handle collisions graciously and are generally bad at interacting significantly with partially unknown or kinematically constrained environments. One solution is to add a force sensor in the closed-loop control of backdrivable actuators [1], but this is limited in terms of stability, safety and robustness [2][3]. One of the foremost initiatives using this method was undertaken by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and resulted in three generations of extensively optimized lightweight robotic arms [4] that can physically interact with people. Performances are impressive but robustness is still an issue [5].",

However, there exist some challenging issues in over-constrained mechanisms like CDRPMs. In contrast to serial manipulators, complexity of parallel manipulator forward kinematics (FK) is one of the main issues being under study in the control of such manipulators. Moreover, using extra sensory data is a common approach in the FK solution of rigid-linked parallel manipulators, which is considered by fewer researchers for CDRPMs. In this paper, tension force sensors of the cables are used as an extra sensor to simplify analytical solution of the FK for a planar CDRPM. To find a suitable solution, geometrical and physical characteristics of the robot are analyzed. It is shown that the proposed method provides the required accuracy and significantly improves the process time compared to the conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "The number of ropes for a fully constrained, tendon-based robot has to be larger than the actuated degrees of freedom since ropes only impose unidirectional constraints. This actuation redundancy implicates that more position information is available than would be required for the the determination of the end-effector pose. This leads to an optimization problem for the forward kinematics of the robot which has to be solved in real-time. Furthermore, the kinematics of tendon-based robots are often kept simple in existing systems by guiding the ropes through holes into the workspace. This facilitates the description of the rope vectors. However, this solution is not applicable for high-load applications, as friction would cause excessive non-linearities and wear. To solve the forward kinematics of tenon-based robots, we introduce a physics-based interpretation of the mentioned optimization problem. The robotic system is described as a damped oscillator whose resting position is equal to the optimal solution. As a major advantage over the known algorithms, this physics-based approach is quantifiable in terms of accuracy of the solution and number of iterations. Furthermore, the design and mathematical description of a deflection unit's geometry is presented. This deflection unit guides the rope smoothly into the workspace and its relevant influence on the kinematic equations can be compensated. The physics-based approach is experimentally evaluated on a tendon-based haptic interface, the r3-system, and it is compared to the solutions using only the minimum set of sensor information.",

This fractional impedance controller was found to realize superior impact absorption for the purpose of flexible contact for assistive and rehabilitation robots. This paper presents a preliminary evaluation of this concept using simulations and experiments. The numerical analysis results demonstrate that a fractional impedance controller has superior impact absorption performance than a conventional controller for contact with the elastic objects, especially for high stiffness objects and high velocity movement. The numerical analysis also reveals that using a fractional controller improved the robustness with respect to the robot dynamics. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that the fractional controller effectively suppresses the force between a person and a robot.",

        "abstract": "The use of technology for automation of surgical tasks has great potential in the field of robotic surgery. Automation of surgical robots essentially involves designing a control scheme for precise and automatic positioning of robotic manipulators. This objective can be achieved by the use of Visual servoing. We have developed a visual-servoing-based robotic laparoscopic surgery system. The visual servoing system enables autonomous control of a robot arm in a surgical set-up. In this paper, we propose algorithms for the automatic positioning of the laparoscope and the surgical instruments under small incisions of skin. We have verified the performance of the system theoretically and experimentally.",

        "abstract": "In bilateral telemanipulation algorithms based on time-domain passivity, internal friction in the devices poses an additional energy drain. Based on a model of the friction, the dissipated energy can be estimated and reclaimed inside the energy balance of the control algorithm. As long as the estimate is conservative, passivity of the entire system is maintained. In this paper we consider two types of friction and discuss the influence of two types of measurement noise. Without noise compensation the dissipated energy is largely overestimated. A compensation method based on the probability density of the noise is proposed. This leads to an energy estimate which is always conservative even in the presence of measurement noise and does not require additional filtering. Simulation results are provided that show the increase in obtained transparency when this energy compensation technique is applied.",

Robots co-existing with humans in domestic and public environments are expected to behave as companions, also engaging in playful interaction. If a robot is small, we foresee that people will want to be able to pick it up and express their intentions playfully by hugging, shaking and moving it around in various ways. Such robots will need to recognize these gestures--which we call \u201cfull-body gestures\u201d because they affect the robot's full body. Inertial sensors inside the robot could be used to detect these gestures, in order to avoid having to rely on external sensors in the environment. However, it is not obvious which gestures typically occur during play, and which of these can be reliably detected. We therefore investigate full-body gesture recognition using Sponge Robot, a small humanoid robot equipped with inertial sensors and designed for playful human-robot interaction.",

        "abstract": "Central pattern generator (CPG) is used to control the locomotion of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, such as walking, running or swimming. It consists of biological neural networks that can produce coordinated rhythmic signals by using simple input signals. In this paper, a full-body joint trajectory generator is proposed for stable bipedal walking by using an evolutionary optimized CPG. Sensory feedback pathways are proposed in the CPG structure, which uses force sensing resistor (FSR) signals. In order to optimize the parameters of CPG, quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is employed. Then, controller is developed to control the position of both ankles and pelvis and the pitching angles of shoulders. The proposed trajectory generator controls the position of the center of pelvis along lateral direction, and the pitching angle of both shoulders in addition to the position of both ankles for stable biped locomotion. The stability of biped locomotion along lateral direction is improved by controlling the position of the center of pelvis along lateral direction. To reduce yawing momentum, the pitching angle of both shoulders are controlled. The effectiveness is demonstrated by simulations with the Webot model of a small-sized humanoid robot, HSR-IX and real experiments with HSR-IX.",

The vehicle has a pair of long-fins installed symmetrically on its body. A set of inertial sensors are applied for collecting its velocity and pose information. And an embedded control system and a driving system based on FPGA are designed for generating and switching motion modes. Based on its motion discipline and system architecture, black-box identification is employed for system modeling. Therefore, according to the control system and driving system, a fuzzy logic PID control scheme is proposed for the underwater vehicle. A fuzzy logic controller is applied for the vehicle before the error is reduced to a given range. Then PID controller is applied when the error is within the given range. Here, velocity control is considered, which involves swimming speed and yaw angle. The fuzzy logic PID control scheme is used for the goals respectively. And Yaw angle control is prior to the swimming speed control. Finally, simulation results show the proposed control scheme is valid.",

We also explore a hypothesis that postural feedback gains in standing balance should change with perturbation size. From an engineering point of view this is known as gain scheduling. We use an optimization approach to see if feedback gains should scale with the perturbation for a simulated robot. We simulate models in the sagittal and lateral plane and in 3-dimensions, use a horizontal push of a given size, direction and location as a perturbation, and optimize parametric controllers for different push sizes, directions and locations. During a simulated perturbation experiment, the appropriate controller is continuously selected based on the current push. For an impulse, the simulated robot recovers back to the initial state; for a constant push, the robot moves to an equilibrium position which leans into the push and has zero joint torques. We show the performance of optimized parametric controllers in response to different external pushes.",

        "abstract": "New gait planning using a nonholonomic model with difference equation constraints is proposed for biped robot walking. A model of a pivoting telescopic segment is used as the kinematic foothold selection model of a bipedal robot. The repetitive and discontinuous constraints of pivoting, expanding, and contracting make up the set of walking trajectory data. The k-step reachable region is defined as the set of the k-th state that the system can reach from the initial state, and the motion planning is solved using the Jacobian matrix of the state with regard to the input series. The difference equation constraints can be discussed as a digital control of continuous-time nonholonomic systems. The gait planning is modified based on the limiting condition for the HRP-2 humanoid robot. Energy consumption is evaluated based on the linear-pendulum model and the gait planning is optimized. The feasibility of the proposed walking planning is demonstrated through a numerical simulation and an experiment involving the HRP-2 humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Affordances are fundamental descriptors of relationships between actions, objects and effects. They provide the means whereby a robot can predict effects, recognize actions, select objects and plan its behavior according to desired goals. This paper approaches the problem of an embodied agent exploring the world and learning these affordances autonomously from its sensory experiences. Models exist for learning the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian Network encoding this knowledge. Although Bayesian Networks are capable of dealing with uncertainty and redundancy, previous work considered complete observability of the discrete sensory data, which may lead to hard errors in the presence of noise. In this paper we consider a probabilistic representation of the sensors by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and explicitly taking into account the probability distribution contained in each discrete affordance concept, which can lead to a more correct learning.",

We employ fast shape estimation, probabilistic model fitting and verification methods capable of dealing with different kinds of symmetries, and combine these with a triangular mesh of the parts that have no other representation to model previously unseen objects of arbitrary shape. Our approach is enhanced by the information given by the geometric clues about different parts of objects which serve as prior information for the selection of the appropriate reconstruction method. While we designed our system for grasping based on single view 3D data, its generality allows us to also use the combination of multiple views. We present two application scenarios that require complete geometric models: grasp planning and locating objects in camera images.",

In this paper, we propose a framework to generate the contact state graph automatically. All faces of the polyhedral objects are triangulated. A sub-contact is defined as single contact between two polyhedral objects and a contact state is presented with a set of the sub-contacts. There are two sub-contacts, a vertex-triangle contact and an edge-edge contact. According to convexity or concavity of the edges composing the triangle, the vertex-triangle contact and the edge-edge contact are classified into 10 types and 7 types, respectively. A contact state graph is made by evolutionary transitions of the sub-contacts. This procedure is accomplished only using the topology of the sub-contacts, which is possible in real-time. The proposed framework is evaluated by an example of square peg-in-hole assembly.",

The simultaneous avoidance of multiple obstacles in real time by all link segments of a manipulator is still a hard task both in practice and in theory. We present a systematic scheme for the generation of collision free movements for redundant manipulators in scenes with arbitrarily many obstacles. Based on the dynamical systems approach to robotics, constraints are formulated as contributions to a dynamical system that erect attractors for targets and repellors for obstacles. These contributions are formulated in terms of variables relevant to each constraint and then transformed into vector fields over the manipulator joint velocity vector as an embedding space in which all constraints are simultaneously observed. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by implementing it on a real anthropomorphic 8-degrees-of-freedom redundant manipulator. In addition, performance is characterized by detecting failures in a systematic simulation experiment in randomized scenes with varying numbers of obstacles.",

Gesture is one such behavior, frequently used by human speakers to illustrate what they express in speech. The production of gestures, however, poses a number of challenges with regard to motor control for arbitrary, expressive hand-arm movement and its coordination with other interaction modalities. We describe an approach to enable the humanoid robot ASIMO to flexibly produce communicative gestures at run-time, building upon the Articulated Communicator Engine (ACE) that was developed to allow virtual agents to realize planned behavior representations on the spot. We present a control architecture that tightly couples ACE with ASIMO's perceptuo-motor system for multi-modal scheduling. In this way, we combine conceptual representation and planning with motor control primitives for meaningful arm movements of a physical robot body. First results of realized gesture representations are presented and discussed",

Usually, this problem is solved by means of time-grid discretization of the continuous constraints. Unfortunately, discretization may lead to unsafe motions since there is no guarantee of constraint satisfaction between time samples. First, we show that constraints such as joint position and velocity do not need time-discretization to be checked. Then, we present the computation method based on Taylor polynomials to evaluate more complex constraints over time-intervals.

        "abstract": "Industrial implementation of robots is to perform the assigned tasks in the minimum possible time in the cycle comes up to increase productivity and reduce the cost. The cycle time is strongly linked to the robot trajectory cycle to the task. However, the optimization of the robot trajectory cycle the robot visited a set of points which represent the robotics task. Similar to persons in traveling the robot execute the task into shorter time if has a shorter path. However the trajectory cycle of the robot is strongly related to the displacement in coordinate space rather than operational space. In fact, the shorter distance between two task points is the shorter distance between two configurations. Since robot has different configurations in each task point the minimum trajectory should be chosen between each successive configuration. However the order of visiting the task point also affects the trajectory distance. Moreover the relative robot position to the task also has a trivial effect on the task time. In this work we develop a method to optimize the order of visiting the task point taking into consideration the robot configuration and the placement of the robot in the robotized site. Mainly, this method is based on Genetic Algorithms and it takes into consideration the multiplicity solutions of the robot Inverse Kinematics Model (IKM), the task point visit order and the placement of robot at the same time.",

However, geometric properties of tilt-and-torsion angles are not completely understood and fully utilized in synthesis of novel zero-torsion PKMs. In this paper, we study geometric properties of the so called zero-torsion motion types via differential geometry of Lie groups. We show that zero-torsion motion types admit simple representations under canonical coordinates of the first kind of the special Euclidean group SE(3). Using the proposed representation, we give a classification of zero-torsion PKMs. The synthesis condition for several well known zero-torsion PKMs are correctly identified. We will conduct type synthesis of zero-torsion PKMs in a separate paper.",

The proposed system utilizes upper body part tracking in a 9-dimensional configuration space and two Multi-Layer Perceptron/Radial Basis Function (MLP/RBF) neural network classifiers, one for each arm. Classification is achieved by buffering the trajectory of each arm and feeding it to the MLP Neural Network which is trained to recognize between five gesturing states. The RBF neural network is trained as a predictor for the future gesturing state of the system. By feeding the output of the RBF back to the MLP classifier, we achieve temporal consistency and robustness to the classification results. The proposed approach has been assessed using several video sequences and the results obtained are presented in this paper.",

We present a frontier based algorithm for finding a route to a goal in a fully unknown environment, where information about the goal region (GR), the region where the goal is most likely to be located, is available. Our algorithm efficiently chooses the best candidate frontier cell, which is on the boundary between explored space and unexplored space, having the maximum \u201cgoal seeking index\u201d, to reach the goal in minimal number of moves. Modification of the algorithm is also proposed to further reduce the number of moves toward the goal. The algorithm has been tested extensively in simulation runs and results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively directs the robot to the goal and completes the search task in minimal number of moves in bounded as well as unbounded environments. The algorithm is shown to perform as well as a state of the art agent centered search algorithm RTAA*, in cluttered environments if exact location of the goal is known at the beginning of the mission and is shown to perform better in uncluttered environments.",

        "abstract": "Estimation of people tracking may become divergent in the presence of occlusion. Since the interactions between people and environments can be mathematically modeled and probabilistically estimated, stream field based tracking provides the solution where the state of the occluded people is estimated by inferring the interactive force between the virtual goal of a person and environmental features. Such tracker suffers from high computation complexity because of the multi-hypotheses of the person's goal and feature-based map. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel virtual force field (VFF) based tracking algorithm that can be realized with a single hypothesis for the person's goal and grid-based map. The occupied grids generate repulsive forces while the person's goal generates attractive force in the virtual force field. Since the virtual force field based tracking integrates map, person, and the person's goal, the position of the person sheltered by the environment can be accurately estimated in unknown environments. Compared with the Kalman filter with constant acceleration (CA) model and stream field based algorithms, our proposed scheme significantly improves the tracking accuracy in case of occlusion.",

Our method enables combination of color information from a wide field of view camera with a 3D LIDAR point cloud from an actuated planar laser scanner. We extend previous work on robust camera-only graph-based segmentation to the case where spatial features, such as surface normals, are available. Our combined method produces segmentation results superior to those derived from either cameras or laser-scanners alone. We verify our approach on both indoor and outdoor scenes.",

A supervised localization method is employed to select graspable segments.

        "abstract": "We present a novel momentum-based method for maintaining balance of humanoid robots. By controlling the desired ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) at each support foot, our method can naturally deal with non-level and non-stationary ground at each foot-ground contact, as well as different frictional properties. We do not make use of the net GRF and CoP which may be difficult or impossible to compute for non-level grounds. Our method minimizes the ankle torques during double support. We show the effectiveness of this new balance control method by simulating various experiments with a humanoid robot including maintaining balance when two feet are on separate moving supports with different inclinations and velocities.",

The effectiveness of the maintenance scheme depends on the A/D sequence, number of gripper changes and the path used in an A/D procedure. However, in a constrained 3D environment simulating realistic models, path planning of the parts becomes more complex because of the factors like complex geometry computations, obstacles, orientation and initial/final position of the part. In this case the path planning of the parts becomes an important factor affecting the overall efficiency of the maintenance process. Therefore, to address this problem an intelligent assembly planner is developed with a combined approach based on potential field method and genetic optimization process for MAD path planning. Furthermore, haptic-assisted feature is implemented for user support for realistic 3D MAD path planning simulations.",

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a reliable method to haptically guide the user within a virtual robotic task, by means of: on-line, collision free, path planning generated trajectories. To accomplish haptic guidance three stages must be correctly done: the first one where the user selects the desired objects and obstacles within a virtual environment to set up the task, the second one, where a path planner looks for the task trajectory and, the third one, where the user is constrained to on-line generated local channels and solution paths that offer a reliable path guidance system to achieve the task movements.",

Different from the traditional serpentine motion, the head of the snake-like robot would always maintain its direction along the forward direction of the whole robot. By utilizing this particular characteristic, the obstacles in front of the undulatory motion could be detected conveniently by a distance sensor installed on the head module. Based on the analysis of the configuration of the snake-like robot in the head-navigated locomotion, CPG-based control is introduced for the control system. Two kinds of control strategies for the realization of the automatic obstacle avoidance are proposed. Both simulation and experiment have been carried out to verify the proposed motion pattern.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a high performance vision tracking system for mobile robot using sensor data fusion. For mobile robots, it is difficult to collect continuous vision information due to robot's motion. To solve this problem, the proposed vision tracking system estimates the robot's position relative to a target and rotates the camera towards the target. This concept is derived from the human eye reflex mechanism, known as the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), for compensating the head motion. This concept for tracking the target results in much higher performance levels, when compared with the conventional method that rotates the camera using only vision information. The proposed system do not require heavy computing loads to process image data and can track the target continuously even during vision occlusion. The robot motion information is estimated using data from accelerometer, gyroscope, and encoders. This multi-sensor data fusion is achieved using Kalman filter. The proposed vision tracking system is implemented on a two-wheeled robot. The experimental results show that the proposed system achieves excellent tracking and recognition performance in various motion scenarios, including scenarios where camera is temporarily blocked from the target.",

        "abstract": "The author has proposed a novel method for generating a dynamic gait based on anterior-posterior asymmetric impact posture tilting the robot's center of mass forward. The primary purpose of this method is to asymmetrize the impact posture by actuating the robot's telescopic-legs to make overcoming the potential barrier at mid-stance easy, and the mechanical energy is accordingly restored. We have already validated our method through numerical investigations of a planar rimless wheel model with telescopic legs. The results implied that the robot motion becomes remarkably high-speed and the need of ankle brake was indicated. This paper then extends the method to a planar telescopic-legged biped model incorporating the brake effect of ankle spring, and numerically investigate the gait properties. We also discuss the role of anterior-posterior asymmetric shape of human foot from the viewpoint of zero moment point.",

Hence, the author's group has developed a method to separate a diffuse image from an image of high-speed video with specular reflection components. The method is based on an estimation technique based on luminance variation due to flicker of a light with an AC source. However, the method has a serious issue that it is limited for lights with an AC source. This study gets rid of the limitation by implementing a high-speed strobe light to the camera and produce flickers by artificial means. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed method.",

In particular, we introduce the analysis tools for investigating the potential injury a human would suffer during robot-human impacts. Furthermore, we outline our concept for establishing a procedure towards standardized crash testing in robotics with automobile crash-test dummies. Since it is only possible to investigate blunt impacts with these devices, we developed a drop testing setup for analyzing soft-tissue injury in robotics from a biomechanics perspective. In the second part of the paper, some of our methods for task preserving and task relaxing motion schemes are described, which enable collision avoidance in real-time. The algorithms are well suited to work in an integrated fashion with the soft robotics control developed for the DLR Lightweight Robot III (LWR-III). In addition, it is shown how the torque sensing capabilities of the robot can be used to support reactive motion schemes. Finally, an overview of our human-friendly control architecture for the LWR-III is given, which unifies the rich bundle of developed methods for this manipulator",

When object movement detection for whole of a room is performed, there are several challenging difficulties: sizes of objects on the camera images are small, non-objects such as humans also exist on the images, objects are sometimes difficult to detect in specific viewpoints because of occlusion by humans or furniture or color similarity to near objects. In this work, to detect object movements robustly though the object sizes are small, we apply multiple view integration via features extracted from \u201cstable changes\u201d on each viewpoint. To discriminate between object and non-object, we focus on motion of changed regions. Our experiment in a room environment shows the multiple view integration method improves recall rate of object detection performance by about 0.2 when false positive rate is over 0.1.",

        "abstract": "Most people believe SLAM is a complex nonlinear estimation/optimization problem. However, recent research shows that some simple iterative methods based on linearization can sometimes provide surprisingly good solutions to SLAM without being trapped into a local minimum. This demonstrates that hidden structure exists in the SLAM problem that is yet to be understood. In this paper, we first analyze how far SLAM is from a convex optimization problem. Then we show that by properly choosing the state vector, SLAM problem can be formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem with many quadratic terms in the objective function, thus it is clearer how far SLAM is from a linear least squares problem. Furthermore, we explain that how the map joining approaches reduce the nonlinearity/nonconvexity of the SLAM problem.",

This capability is based on the non-linear characteristics of the muscles and the motor control architecture that can control motion and exerted force independently. Mechanical impedance (i.e. stiffness, viscosity and inertia) constitutes the most solid characteristic for describing the dynamic behavior of human movements. This paper presents a method for estimating upper limb impedance characteristics in the three-dimensional (3D) space, covering a wide range of the arm workspace. While subjects maintained postures, a seven-degrees-of-freedom (7-DoFs) robot arm was used to produce small displacements of subjects' hands along the three Cartesian axes. The end-point dynamic behavior was modeled using a linear second-order system and the impedance characteristics in the 3D space were identified using the measured forces and motion profiles. Experimental results were confirmed with two subjects.",

In this paper, Empirical Copula is introduced to recognize dynamic human hand motions for the first time using the proposed motion template and matching algorithm. The huge computational cost of Empirical Copula is alleviated by the proposed re-sampling processing. The experiments with human hand motions including grasps and in-hand manipulations demonstrate Empirical Copula outperforms the Time Clustering (TC) method, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in terms of recognition rate. In addition, Empirical Copula is also proved to be able to recognize different motions from different subjects.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a navigation algorithm that considers the states of humans and other robots in order to achieve harmonious coexistence between robots and humans. When navigating through humans and robots with different functions, a robot should not only pay attention to obstacle avoidance and goal seeking, it should also take care of whether it interferes with other people or robots. To deal with this problem, we propose several harmonious rules, which guarantee a safe and smooth navigation in multi-human and multi-robot (MHMR) environment. Based on those rules, a practical navigation method-human- centered sensitive navigation (HCSN)-is proposed. HCSN considers the fact that both humans and robots have sensitive zones depending on their security regions or on psychological feeling of people. We model these zones as various sensitive fields with priorities, whereby robots tend to yield socially acceptable movements.",

For the acceptance of robots in general and humanoid robots, which are even closer to people's daily life, in particular a main aspect is their appearance and how they act and move in human centered environments. Especially safety strategies are crucial for a widespread acceptance of these machines. In our work we target this safety aspect by approaching this issue from the direction how humans respond to external stimuli. To achieve such human-like reflexes a general reflex unit, based on special variants of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model has been built. Instances of this reflex unit are adapted to special reflex types and connected to form dependent reflex behaviors. The concept of these neural structures and its evaluation by means of several experiments are presented in this paper. The results are depicted in detail and future aspects of our ongoing work are addressed.",

We define an ensemble as a synchronized performance produced through interactions between independent players. To attain better synchronized performance, the robot should predict the human's behavior to reduce the difference between the human's and robot's onset timings. Existing studies in such synchronization only adapts to onset intervals, thus, need a considerable time to synchronize. We use a coupled oscillator model to predict the human's behavior. Experimental results show that our method reduces the average of onset time errors; when we use a metronome, a tempo-varying metronome or a human drummer, errors are reduced by 38%, 10% or 14% on the average, respectively. These results mean that the prediction of human's behaviors is effective for the synchronized performance.",

        "abstract": "Industrial robots, designed for performing operations quickly, repeatedly and accurately have a long heritage in the manufacturing industry, operating in relatively static environments and in large numbers. Trends in the oil and gas industry to improve safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impact suggest the use of industrial robotics. New developments in regions difficult or dangerous for humans to work in could be enabled with maintenance, inspection and repairs carried out by remotely-controlled industrial robots. This new application area highlights some difficulties with today's robots, as they do not adapt well to dynamic environments, do not offer rich human-robot interaction and are not simple for end-users to program. In addition, the oil and gas context presents a challenging work environment for robots as they are exposed to variable and often extreme weather and need to be safe for use alongside explosive hydrocarbons. As robots are introduced, issues of trust and accountability come to the fore as well as how they fit into organisational structures. If robots have too little autonomy, human operators will waste time attending to robots instead of attending to their work tasks. If robots are highly autonomous, situational awareness of plant activity is diminished. A balance needs to be struck to find a level of autonomy suitable for the task, the realistic capabilities of the automation, and the need to actively engage human operators in a constructive fashion. These issues also relate to what form the interface takes for remote or co-located robot control, as well as how information and activity is represented for remote operators. The contribution of this paper is a discussion of issues relating to human-robot interaction for future industrial robotics, in particular for the oil and gas industry",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a new robot control and learning framework. By integrating previously presented as well as new methods, the robot is able to learn an invariant and generic movement representation from a human tutor. We argue that in order to apply such generic representations to new situations and thus create a flexible system, the use of interaction is beneficial. The interaction is based on a kinematically controlled model of a human tutor, which is used as a model-based filter and also for recognizing postures that influence the interaction. In addition, a new movement segmentation scheme is presented that is based on correlating movements by the tutor's hand with the salient objects in the scene. The focus of this paper is on the interactive learning aspects of the system and particular emphasis is given to an experiment in which the humanoid robot ASIMO learns from a human tutor. The system includes extensive generalization capabilities that result from an online adaption of the robot's body schema and the exploitation of inter-trial variance from multiple demonstrations. This enables the robot to reproduce the movement in new situations. For example, a stacking task that the tutor performed one-handed can be executed bi-manually by the robot.",

Mechanical systems and robots have been used for assisting in landmines location and improving the quality of humanitarian demining tasks. These new systems are expected to enhance safety, efficiency, time duration, etc, but many improvements are still needed in order to realize a practical system. In this paper, new vision techniques for improving the effectiveness of terrain mapping using stereo vision camera under high-contrast light conditions, i.e., mixed direct sunlight and shadowed areas, are introduced. Furthermore, trajectory optimization taking in account the obtained terrain map is also analyzed, which greatly reduces time consumption for landmine location marking tasks. These newly introduced methods greatly contribute to overall increase in reliability and efficiency of humanitarian demining tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a localization method for humanoid robots navigating in arbitrary complex indoor environments using only onboard sensing. Reliable and accurate localization for humanoid robots operating in such environments is a challenging task. First, humanoids typically execute motion commands rather inaccurately and odometry can be estimated only very roughly. Second, the observations of the small and lightweight sensors of most humanoids are seriously affected by noise. Third, since most humanoids walk with a swaying motion and can freely move in the environment, e.g., they are not forced to walk on flat ground only, a 6D torso pose has to be estimated. We apply Monte Carlo localization to globally determine and track a humanoid's 6D pose in a 3D world model, which may contain multiple levels connected by staircases. To achieve a robust localization while walking and climbing stairs, we intergrate 2D laser range measurements as well as attitude data and information from the joint encoders. We present simulated as well as real-word experiments with our humanoid and thoroughly evaluate our approach. As the experiments illustrate, the robot is able to globally localize itself and accurately track its 6D pose over time.",

In these such cases, traditional filtering methods usually fail to provide reliable estimates because of the highly corrupted sensor measurements. This work proposes to model the data fusion problem for heavily disturbed systems through a hybrid systems modeling framework and presents an online hybrid stochastic filter capable of tracking the system's state in unfavorable operating conditions. Simulated and experimental results compare the proposed filter's performance with the traditionally used Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and show its usefulness as a robust localization filter for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) designed for aerial power lines inspection.",

It extends terrain elevation models by incorporating two types of representations: (1) ground representations based on averaging the height in the point cloud, (2) object models based on a voxelisation of the point cloud. The approach is deployed on Riegl data (dense 3D laser data) acquired in a campus type of environment and compared against six other terrain models. Amongst elevation models, it is shown to provide the best fit to the data as well as being unique in the sense that it jointly performs ground extraction, overhang representation and 3D segmentation. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting model is also applicable to path planning.",

Our method allows for the smooth trade-off of accuracy for efficiency and for the incorporation of GPS measurements during real-time operation, thereby offering significant advantages over other SLAM solvers. Like other stochastic SLAM methods, such as SGD and TORO, our technique is robust to local minima and eliminates the need for costly relinearizations of the map. Unlike other stochastic methods, but similar to exact solvers, such as iSAM, our technique is able to process position-only constraints, such as GPS measurements, without introducing systematic distortions in the map. We present results from the Google Street View database, and compare our method with results from TORO. We show that our solver is able to achieve higher accuracy while operating within real-time bounds. In addition, as far as we are aware, this is the first stochastic SLAM solver capable of processing GPS constraints in real-time.",

In addition, we demonstrated that a hysteresis with respect to gait pattern occurs during the gait transition similarly to humans and animals, and we examined the mechanisms of the hysteresis from a dynamic viewpoint.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture, which is aimed to address both coalition formation and execution for tightly-coupled multirobot tasks in a single framework. Many task allocation algorithms have been previously proposed without explicitly enabling the sharing of robot capabilities. Inspired by information invariant theory, ASyMTRe was introduced which enables the sharing of sensory and computational capabilities by allowing information to flow among different robots via communication. However, ASyMTRe does not provide a solution for how a coalition should satisfy sensor constraints introduced by the sharing of capabilities while executing the assigned task. Furthermore, conversions among different information types1 are hardcoded, which limits the flexibility of ASyMTRe. Moreover, relationships between entities (e.g., robots) and information types are not explicitly captured, which may produce infeasible solutions from the start, as the defined information type may not correspond well to the current environment settings. The new architecture introduces a complete definition of information type to guarantee the feasibility of solutions; it also explicitly models information conversions. Inspired by our previous work, IQ-ASyMTRe uses measures of information quality to guide robot coalitions to satisfy sensor constraints (introduced by capability sharing) while executing tasks, thus providing a complete and general solution. We demonstrate the capability of the approach both in simulation and on physical robots to form and execute coalitions that share sensory information to achieve tightly-coupled tasks.",

        "abstract": "It is well-known that iff the robot with its end-effector force control is passive, the closed loop system consisting of the robot and an arbitrary passive environment is asymptotically stable. Passive robot control, however, limits the achievable robot impedance reduction. Recently, investigated what performance can be achieved with nonpassive control when uncertainty bounds for the environment are known. The question of stability margins neglected in is treated in our companion paper. In this paper we report on experiments on a full scale industrial robot in order to identify six transfer functions from the velocity reference of the inner velocity loop to the end effector force output for six different environments, from solid wall to air. It is shown how the experimental data also makes it possible to compute the impedance of the controlled robot. Two controllers are designed: one marginally stable but with nonpassive and low-gain controlled robot impedance at low frequencies, and another controller respecting the stability margin of closed loop sensitivity gain less than 6 dB, but with a passive controlled robot impedance that has higher gain for low frequencies than that of the first controller. The designs are compared experimentally by having the robot interact with environments of different impedances, and with a human operator leading the robot The paper is concluded by a short discussion of the possible need of controller adaption when a robot operates in varying impedance environments, and interacts with a human operator.",

In identifying the large DOF systems like humanoid robots, the converged solution is difficult to be obtained. In this paper, we propose the method to realize physical consistency and computational stability. As inertial parameters of each link are represented with a finite number of mass points, the constraints can be approximated by linear inequalities. We also propose to solve the optimization problem, which minimizes the errors both from measured data and the priori parameters extracted from the geometric model like CAD data. The method can estimate standard inertial parameters, which is a useful notation to be used for other applications.",

In this paper we present the realization of a robotic flexible endoscope steering system that uses the endoscopic images to control the tip orientation towards the direction of the lumen. Two image-based control algorithms are investigated, one is based on the optical flow and the other is based on the image intensity. Both are evaluated using simulations in which the endoscope was steered through the lumen. The RMS distance to the lumen center was less than 25% of the lumen width. An experimental setup was built using a standard flexible endoscope, and the image-based control algorithms were used to actuate the wheels of the endoscope for tip steering. Experiments were conducted in an anatomical model to simulate gastroscopy. The image intensity-based algorithm was capable of steering the endoscope tip through an endoluminal path from the mouth to the duodenum accurately. Compared to manual control, the robotically steered endoscope performed 68% better in terms of keeping the lumen centered in the image.",

In contrast with previous approaches that rely upon homographies, our approach does not require multiple images (either stereo or optical flow). It also does not require the camera to be calibrated, even for lens distortion. The technique combines three visual cues for evaluating the likelihood of horizontal intensity edge line segments belonging to the wall-floor boundary. The combination of these cues yields a robust system that works even in the presence of severe specular reflections, which are common in indoor environments. The nearly real-time algorithm is tested on a large database of images collected in a wide variety of conditions, on which it achieves nearly 90% detection accuracy.",

        "abstract": "There are applications where different objective lenses have to be used for microscope imaging. Rotary nose-pieces cannot be used when larger objectives are required and when there is a physical space limitation. It is also very difficult and time consuming to change the objective lens manually and locate and focus on the same spot again; This may prevent any attempt for automating an image-guided robot-assisted procedure using the microscope images with different objective lenses. A linear lens changing mechanism has been developed which makes it possible to slide the objectives under a microscope. Image processing algorithms have been used to determine the optimal position of the lenses with respect to the source of light, compensate for changes in the focal length in case of non-parfocal objectives and to locate and focus on the exact same spot, regardless of the objective change. A 3-DOF micromanipulator has been used to move the microscope with respect to the substrate. As one of the most challenging applications, this can facilitate objective lens change in computer-assisted patch clamping with multiple electrodes.",

Maintaining accurate localization for the duration of a mission is important for a variety of tasks, such as planning the vehicle trajectory and ensuring coverage of the area to be inspected. Our approach only uses onboard sensors in a simultaneous localization and mapping setting and removes the need for any external infrastructure like acoustic beacons. We extract dense features from a forward-looking imaging sonar and apply pair-wise registration between sonar frames. The registrations are combined with onboard velocity, attitude and acceleration sensors to obtain an improved estimate of the vehicle trajectory. We show results from several experiments that demonstrate drift-free navigation in various underwater environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an architecture for learning and reproducing movements with a robot in interaction with a human teacher. We focus on the movement representation and propose three enhancements to increase generalization capabilities: Firstly, we introduce a flexible task-level movement representation that is based on neuropsychological findings. Movement is represented in task-oriented frames of reference, and generalizes to a variety of different situations. Secondly, we propose a mechanism to decouple the task descriptors from the perceived objects in the robot's environment. This allows to formulate a set of generic controllers, and to interactively create associations with perceived objects. Thirdly, we introduce a method to dynamically modify the system's body schema to account for structural changes such as having grasped a tool. The changes are consistently treated in the kinematics computations. This permits to generalize movements to be carried out in different ways, for instance with different hands or bi-manually. A set of experiments in an interactive imitation learning situation underline the capabilities of the proposed concepts.",

Our starting point was a mathematical model showing that if the baby uses a sensory motor architecture for the recognition of the facial expression then the parents must imitate the baby facial expression to allow the on-line learning. In this paper, a first series of robotics experiments showing that a simple neural network model can control the robot head and learn on-line to recognize the facial expressions (the human partner imitates the robot prototypical facial expressions) is presented. We emphasize the importance of the emotions as a mechanism to ensure the dynamical coupling between individuals allowing to learn more complex tasks.",

        "abstract": "At the heart of multi-robot task allocation lies the ability to compare multiple options in order to select the best. In some domains this utility evaluation is not straightforward, for example due to complex and unmodeled underlying dynamics or an adversary in the environment. Explicitly modeling these extrinsic influences well enough so that they can be accounted for in utility computation (and thus task allocation) may be intractable, but a human expert may be able to quickly gain some intuition about the form of the desired solution. We propose to harness the expert's intuition by applying imitation learning to the multi-robot task allocation domain. Using a market-based method, we steer the allocation process by biasing prices in the market according to a policy which we learn using a set of demonstrated allocations (the expert's solutions to a number of domain instances). We present results in two distinct domains: a disaster response scenario where a team of agents must put out fires that are spreading between buildings, and an adversarial game in which teams must make complex strategic decisions to score more points than their opponents.",

We model a motion as a nonlinear autonomous (i.e. time-invariant) dynamical system, and define the sufficient conditions to make such a system globally asymptotically stable at the target. The convergence of all trajectories is ensured starting from any point in the operational space. We propose a learning method, called Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), that estimates parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model via an optimization problem under non-linear constraints. Being time-invariant and globally stable, the system is able to handle both temporal and spatial perturbations, while performing the motion as close to the demonstrations as possible. The method is evaluated through a set of robotic experiments.",

        "abstract": "The flutist robot WF-4RIV at Waseda University is able to play the flute at the level of an intermediate human player. So far the robot has been able to play in a statically sequenced duet with another musician, individually communicating only by keeping eye-contact. To extend the interactive capabilities of the flutist robot, we have in previous publications described the implementation of a Music-based Interaction System (MbIS). The purpose of this system is to combine information from the robot's visual and aural sensor input signal processing systems to enable musical communication with a partner musician. In this paper we focus on that part of the MbIS that is responsible for mapping the information from the sensor processing system to generate meaningful modulation of the musical output of the robot. We propose a two skill level approach to enable musicians of different ability levels to interact with the robot. When interacting with the flutist robot the device's physical capabilities / limitations need to be taken into account. In the beginner level interaction system the user's input to the robot is filtered in order to adjust it to the state of the robot's breathing system. The advanced level stage uses both the aural and visual sensor processing information. In a teaching phase the musician teaches the robot a tone sequence (by actually performing the sequence) that he relates to a certain instrument movement. In a performance phase, the musician can trigger these taught sequences by performing the according movements. Experiments to validate the functionality of the MbIS approach have been performed and the results are presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Since 2007, our research is related to the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot, which it has been designed to imitate the saxophonist playing by mechanically reproducing the organs involved for playing a saxophone. Our research aims in understanding the motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication. In a previous paper, the Waseda Saxophone Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs has been presented. Moreover, a feedback error learning with dead time compensation has been implemented to control the air pressure of the robot. However, such a controller couldn't deal with the overblowing effects (unsteady tones) that are found during a musical performance. Therefore; in this paper, the implementation of an Overblowing Correction Controller (OCC) has been proposed and implemented in order to assure the steady tone during the performance by using the pitch feedback signal to detect the overblowing condition and by defining a recovery position (off-line) to correct it. Moreover, a saxophone sound evaluation function (sustain phase) has been proposed to compare the sound produced by human players and the robot. A set of experiments were carried out to verify the improvements on the musical performance of the robot and its sound has been quantitatively compared with human saxophonists. From the experimental results, we could observe improvements on the pitch (correctness) and tone stability.",

In order to obtain a clear image of the carotid artery ready for medical diagnosis, the authors developed real-time image processing algorithms to detect the carotid artery and tissue layers of its walls in the B-mode ultrasound images. Sequential patterns of the ultrasound probe trajectory for scanning the surface of the neck and searching the carotid, were implemented and tested on the Waseda-Tokyo Women's Medical-Aloka Blood Flow Measurement Robot System No. 1 Refined II (WTA-1RII). An experiment with eleven volunteers was carried out and the results show that the system obtained clear images of the carotid artery in 91% of the trials.",

Robots are equiped with laser scanners which are used to detect the obstacles in the environment. Then, a real-time panel method is used to calculate the streamlines of the potential flow around the complex shaped rigid objects, providing the robots with safe trajectories to the target. The swarm of robots is also forced to keep a desired formation during navigation using potential functions. Potential flow algorithms provide navigation with smooth paths to the target. The algorithm can be used in dynamic environments in real-time as the changes in the medium are detected.",

        "abstract": "The expression of reactive behaviour is a significant and important requirement in robotic software engineering, since robots must cope with a wide range of unpredictable events and environments. However it is important that the semantics for reactive expression can be used across different architectures and languages. The RADAR robot programming language provides architecture- and language-independent semantics for managing the reactive parts of robot software together with the deliberative parts, allowing greater interaction between the two. We evaluate the architecture-independence of RADAR, as an example, by implementing its reactive semantics using the OpenRTM-aist component-based, distributed architecture. Our goal is to evaluate what limitations the choice of implementation environment may place on the capabilities of such an architecture-independent semantics. In our implementation, we aimed to produce a standard OpenRTM-aist system using the RADAR semantics. We have found that the architecture-independent semantics concept works well in the case of RADAR, although some specific improvements are needed for full interaction between deliberative and reactive sections of robotic software.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the key features of upper limb exoskeletons is their ability to take advantage of the human arm kinematic redundancy in order to modify the subject's joint dynamics without affecting his/her hand motion. This is of particular interest in the field of neurorehabilitation, when an exoskeleton is used to interact with a patient who suffers from joint motions desynchronization, resulting e.g. from brain damage following a stroke. In this paper, we investigate this problem from the robot control point of view. A first general controller is derived which uses viscous force fields in order to generate joint torques counteracting any velocities that are perpendicular to a given set of constraints. In order to minimize energy dissipation, a second controller is proposed that still uses viscous force fields, but in a way that the mechanical power dissipated by the viscous control is null at any time. This controller does not impose any trajectory to the hand and the robot only moves in response to the forces generated by the patient. This approach is experimented on a 4-DOF exoskeleton with a healthy subject. Results exhibit the basic properties of the controller and show its capacity to impose an arbitrary chosen joint constrain for 3-DOF pointing tasks without constraining the hand motion.",

Our methods employ a dynamic variant of the brushfire algorithm to update only those cells that are actually affected by changes in the environment. In experiments in different environments we show that our update strategies for distance maps and Voronoi diagrams require substantially fewer cell visits and significantly less computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, the dynamic Voronoi diagram also improves on previous work by correctly dealing with non-convex obstacles such as building walls. We also present a dynamic variant of a skeletonization-based approach to Voronoi diagrams that is especially robust to noise. All of our algorithms consider actual Euclidean distances rather than grid steps. An open source implementation is available online.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a microphone array structure for a spoken-oriented robot dialog system that is designed to discriminate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the target speech and that of the robot internal noise. First, we investigate the performance of the noise estimation conducted by semi-blind source separation (SBSS) in presence of both the diffuse background noise and the robot internal noise. The result indicates that the noise estimation of the SBSS is not good. Next, we analyze the DOA of the robot internal noise in order to determine the reason of the above result; we find out that the internal noise is always in-phase at the microphone array and overlap spacial with the target speech. Based on this fact, we propose to change the microphone array structure from the broadside array to the end-fire array in order to discriminate the DOAs of the target speech and the internal noise. Finally, we evaluate the word accuracy in a dictation task in presence of both diffuse background noise and robot internal noise to confirm the advantage of the proposed structure. Simulation results shows that the proposed microphone array structure results in approximately 10% improvement of the speech recognition performance.",

        "abstract": "This work presents the development of an arm-equipped tracked vehicle named HELIOS IX for search and rescue tasks in urban environments. HELIOS IX operator has to tele-operate several tasks such as opening of doors, negotiation of stairs and handling objects. However due to the complexity and kinematics of the system, these tasks are difficult to be carried out without some level of automation. This study proposes one of the shared autonomy type operator-supporting system for HELIOS IX. It is based on a laser range finder (LRF), finger-attached LED beam guiding systems and on a finger 3 axes force sensor interfaced by a novel reinforcing metal plate. Carrying out several experiments we could demonstrate that, tele-operation task can become easier by the introduction of the 3D space approaching assistance of the LRF, object grasping assistance of the LED beams attached on the fingers, and by the force following assistance of the force sensor attached to the wrist.",

        "abstract": "In home service robot applications, robots often deal with textured objects. The variation of surface's reflectivity may decrease the accuracy of depth measurement of structured light 3D camera. In this paper, we propose a new method to correct the boundary of structured light pattern in order to increase the accuracy of depth measurement. The algorithm first estimates the reflection index of the surface. The light stripe is deconvoluted to remove the smooth effect of the camera lens. Finally, the edge is normalised by the reflection index, and the boundary is estimated from the intersection between the corrected versions of the edge and its inverse. The experimental results show that with the proposed boundary estimator, there are significant improvements in term of surface smoothness of textured objects.",

The principle idea is to filter irrelevant information by selecting regions of interest in the disparity map from stereo images and to use the geometrical constraints of the stereo camera system in order to filter out useless descriptors in early stages of the processing chain. Experimental results show that this setup improves overall performance in comparison to similar systems by a factor of two to five.",

Previous research indicated that the feedback force based on obstacle range information prevented accurate motion control of the mobile robot since human operator's commands were distorted by the feedback force. To solve this problem, a new force rendering approach with variable feedback gain is proposed. In proposed scheme, force feedback gain is adaptively tuned based on measured distances to the obstacle and time derivatives of the distances. Stability of the proposed bilateral teleoperation architecture was analyzed and the performance is proved by simulations. Results of simulation and experimental study proved that the quality of the mobile robot bilateral teleoperation with variable force feedback gain is significantly better than the conventional approach with constant feedback gain.",

The RRT is a powerful tool for a simple request, but the performances of approaches falls sharply when the search has several narrow passages. The introduction of several trees can reduce this problem, but has the disadvantage of requiring the control of the number and the growth of these trees. However, this can be done using the properties of the Visibility-PRM. Combining the ideas of the Visibility-PRM with a multi-RRT (local trees), a new algorithm is presented and experimental results show the importance and effectiveness of the method.",

While models of the human operator estimating position trajectories have been already applied in teleoperation, in the present paper, we propose the incorporation of force-based human haptic interaction models. This new approach allows to transfer the strength of advanced model-mediated teleoperation, i.e. increased stability and fidelity, to scenarios where forces applied to the remote environment are of importance. As an application example we present a tele-rehabilitation scenario which was implemented on a 1 DoF teleoperation system. Position and force fusion algorithms integrating human haptic interaction models are defined for time delay and packet loss compensation. The results demonstrate clearly the benefit of incorporating force-based human haptic interaction models into teleoperation systems.",

We propose a novel approach to improving system-level performance of hybrid control architectures by incrementally improving the deliberative layer's model of the reactive layer's execution of its plans. Incremental supervised learning techniques are employed to learn the model. Quantitative and qualitative results from a physics-based simulator are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for extracting a model of movement primitives and their sequential relationships during online observation of human motion. In the proposed approach, movement primitives, modeled as hidden Markov models, are autonomously segmented and learned incrementally during observation. At the same time, a higher abstraction level hidden Markov model is also learned, encapsulating the relationship between the movement primitives. For the higher level model, each hidden state represents a motion primitive, and the observation function is based on the likelihood that the observed data is generated by the motion primitive model. An approach for incremental training of the higher order model during online observation is developed. The approach is validated on a dataset of continuous movement data.",

Our infinite mixture of experts approach instead automatically infers an appropriate partitioning (number of subtasks and assignment of data points to each one) directly from the data. We illustrate the applicability of our technique by learning a suitable set of subtasks from the demonstration of a finite-state machine robot soccer goal scorer.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Gaussian Mixture Regression has been shown to be a powerful and easy-to-tune regression technique for imitation learning of constrained motor tasks in robots. Yet, current formulations are not suited when one wants a robot to learn incrementally and online a variety of new context-dependant tasks whose number and complexity is not known at programming time, and when the demonstrator is not allowed to tell the system when he introduces a new task (but rather the system should infer this from the continuous sensorimotor context). In this paper, we show that this limitation can be addressed by introducing an Incremental, Local and Online variation of Gaussian Mixture Regression (ILO-GMR) which successfully allows a simulated robot to learn incrementally and online new motor tasks through modelling them locally as dynamical systems, and able to use the sensorimotor context to cope with the absence of categorical information both during demonstrations and when a reproduction is asked to the system. Moreover, we integrate a complementary statistical technique which allows the system to incrementally learn various tasks which can be intrinsically defined in different frames of reference, which we call framings, without the need to tell the system which particular framing should be used for each task: this is inferred automatically by the system.",

During the iterative motion refinement, a confidence value specifies an area of allowed refinement around the nominal trajectory. A novel method for continuous generation of motions from a hidden Markov model (HMM) representation of motion primitives is proposed, which incorporates relative time information for each state. On the real-time control level, the kinesthetic teaching is handled by a customized impedance controller, which combines tracking performance with soft physical interaction and allows to implement soft boundaries for the motion refinement. The proposed methods were implemented and tested using DLR's humanoid upper-body robot Justin.",

        "abstract": "When dealing with the design of robotic fingers driven by tendons, one can be inspired by the human index finger tendon distribution. The structure of the designed robot finger has to minimize the number of tendons required without sacrificing either the actuated degree of freedom or the maximal output force produced at the fingertip. In this paper, a biomechanical study of the index finger under normal and abnormal conditions is developed. Under abnormal conditions, when some pathology affects the musculo-tendon units, the number of intact muscular actuators will be reduced. A three-dimensional biomechanical model for a static force analysis is developed through anatomical and kinematic studies. An optimization approach is then used to determine muscle force distributions corresponding to maximal fingertip strength when performing isometric force tasks. Further common cases of injured flexors and extensors are analyzed. The simulation method of such abnormalities is described and the results are reported. This investigation allows us to analyze the importance of the tendons distribution in order to enhance the robotic hands design process. In fact, the obtained force distributions are linked to the further required motor torques of the artificial robotic finger driven by tendons. Hence, the developed approach can be with great help whenever the motor sizing process is investigated.",

Basically, each of radio frequency (RF) localization system and pyroelectric infrared (PIR) monitoring system provides the coarse information of individuals' location respectively. We develop a sensor network based localization method called WPIR intersection algorithm to determine the fused position from PIR and radio frequency signal localization system which utilizes received signal strength (RSS) model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a wireless pyroelectric sensory fusion system and WPIR intersection algorithm which can be applied in multi target tracking issues against pure PIR sensing system. Furthermore, WPIR intersection algorithm provides higher accuracy than PIR or RF localization respectively. With the proper localization and tracking in the indoor environment, the provisions of appropriate services for people can be realized.",

From these considerations, a source number detector based either on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion is derived within an original coherent broadband beamspace MUSIC method. This constitutes a theoretically sound solution, well-suited to robotics as it requires no subjective threshold setting and has a limited computational cost. Experimental results validate the approach. All the necessary theoretical background is provided, so that the paper is self-contained.",

        "abstract": "Transfer of container filled with liquid may generate sloshing, considered an undesirable effect in many systems. This research explores the use of input shaping technique to suppress sloshing on transfer of liquid container using multi-joint robot arm. By input shaping principle, acceleration command is shaped using two impulses in such a way to cancel each other's response. Position trajectory is then translated as joint angles trajectory, which is then fed to Mitsubishi PA10-7C robot arm. Simple pendulum model with damping element is applied to analyze sloshing phenomena. Experimental results show that the employed input shaping technique reduces sloshing during and after container transfer.",

Motivated by the application of an ocean vehicle performing an autonomous ship hull inspection, we consider a planning problem for a fully-actuated, six degree-of-freedom hovering AUV using a bathymetry sonar to inspect the complex structures underneath a ship hull. We consider a discrete model of the structure to be inspected, requiring only that the model be provided in the form of a closed triangular mesh. A dense graph of feasible paths is constructed in the robot's configuration space until the set of edges in the graph allows complete coverage of the structure. Then, we approximate the minimum-cost closed walk along the graph which observes 100% of the structure. We emphasize the embedding of observations within the edges of the graph as a means of utilizing all available sensor data in planning the inspection.",

        "abstract": "We present an integrated and fully autonomous eye-in-hand system for 3D object modeling. The system hardware consists of a laser range sensor mounted on a six-DOF manipulator arm and the task is to autonomously build 3D model of an object in-situ, i.e., the object may not be moved and must be scanned in its original location. Our system assumes no knowledge of either the object or the rest of the workspace of the robot. The overall planner integrates a next best view (NBV) algorithm along with a sensor-based roadmap planner. Our NBV algorithm while considering the key constraints such as FOV, viewing angle, overlap and occlusion, efficiently searches the five-dimensional view space to determine the best modeling view configuration. The sensor-based roadmap planner determines a collision-free path, to move the manipulator so that the wrist mounted scanner is at the view configuration. If the desired view configurations are not collision free, or there is no free path to reach them, the planner explores the workspace such that facilitates the modeling. This is repeated until the entire object is scanned. We have implemented the system and our results show that system is able to autonomously build a 3D model of an object in an unknown environment.",

Examining the observability of the 3D SLAM system leads to the the conclusion that the system remains observable provided that at least one of these conditions is satisfied i) two known landmarks of which the connecting line is not collinear with the vector of the acceleration are observed ii) three known landmarks which are not placed in a straight line are observed.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a reactive leg motion generation method which integrates geometric constraints into its generation process. In order to react given instructions instantaneously or to keep balance against external disturbances, feasible steps must be generated automatically in real-time for safety. In many cases this feasibility has been realized by using predefined steps or admissible stepping regions. However, these predefinitions are often too conservative or valid only in limited situations. The proposed method considers geometric constraints in addition to joint limits during its generation process and it can utilize the ability of the robot to a maximum extent. It can generate feasible walking pattern in real-time by modifying the swing leg motion and the next landing position at each control cycle. The proposed method is validated by experiments using a humanoid robot HRP-2.",

And in recent years, the miniaturization of the liquid dosing system as well as the accuracy of liquid transfer has gradually become a hot research field. In this paper, a MEMS (Micro-electromechanical system) flow sensor was integrated with a PZT(Piezoelectric Transducer) pump to make a closed-loop drug dosing system. Benefiting from the feedback of sensor information, the system can self-adjust the driving voltage of the PZT pump to precisely dispensing desired liquid volume. First, the structure and principle of the PZT pump will be introduced briefly. Secondly, the MEMS flow sensor is presented. Finally, the fuzzy PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential) closed-loop control strategy is proposed to calculate and adjust the driving voltage in real-time. Finally, experiment results show that the drug delivery system could precisely delivery drug volume with error smaller than 0.01\u00b5L when desired volume is 100\u00b5L.",

        "abstract": "In Japan, the number of elderly persons who take medicine regularly has been increasing due to population aging. Since they can have the serious accidents caused by incorrect medication, we propose a medication monitoring system to detect incorrect medication. The system is composed of an intelligent medicine case, house-embedded sensors, and a database server. The case recognizes whether an elderly person has picked up correct medicine from its storage space to confirm the quantity of dosing. The case also estimates the present living condition of him/her to confirm the timing of dosing. By using the results, the case can evaluate the adequacy of medication. The sensors collect the information necessary for living condition estimation. The server accumulates the adequacy into its database. By using the system, caretakers can check the adequacy through a web interface and can receive an emergency e-mail if the adequacy becomes too low. We used background subtraction method for quantity confirmation and fuzzy inference method for timing confirmation. We confirmed that the case was able to detect 4 types of medicines in its storage space with considerable accuracy and the system was able to confirm 11 common timings with satisfactory accuracy by experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new framework for fast and reliable traffic sign detection using images obtained from a single front-facing road vehicle camera. Our focus is on a methodology for reducing the computational requirements and increasing the performance of existing detection methods by refining the image space search using 3D scene geometry. Information concerning physical traffic sign dimensions and vehicle camera parameters is integrated into a model that predicts the image scales and locations at which traffic signs are likely to appear. We apply our framework to a Haar-feature-based detection method trained on a collection of stop signs. Experimental results show that the refined image search space results in much less computation time while retaining the same true positive detection performance as existing methods that search all image scales and locations. In addition, false positives at physically implausible traffic sign locations are eliminated.",

        "abstract": "Multi-resident activity recognition is among a key enabler in many context-aware applications in a smart home. However, most of prior researches ignore the potential interactions among residents in order to simplify problem complexity. On the other hand, multiple-resident activities are usually recognized using cameras or wearable sensors. However, due to human-centric concerns, it is more preferable to avoid using obtrusive sensors. In this paper, we propose dynamic Bayesian networks which extend coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs) by adding some vertices to model both individual and cooperative activities. In order to improve performance of the model, we categorize sensor observations based on data association and some domain knowledge to model multiple-resident activity patterns. We then validate the performance using a multi-resident dataset from WSU (Washington State University), which only includes non-obtrusive sensors. The experimental result shows that our model performs better than other baseline classifiers.",

        "abstract": "The overall performance of a robotic system is commonly expressed by a single scenario-specific metric which is supposed to be optimized. However, the metric describing the performance of a single subtask within a scenario may be different. Nevertheless, the scenario performance is most likely dependent on the subtask performances but a mutual transformation is not straightforward in general, especially in complex robotic systems. This leads to what we call the common pricing problem, i.e. the problem to determine the functional relationship among a set of different performance criteria and then account for this relationship in the various optimizations throughout all system layers. In this paper we present an approach to first learn a probabilistic model of the metric interdependencies, and thereafter utilize this model for performance estimation and optimal task parameterization during planning and execution respectively. The proposed method is validated in a simulation.",

The fuzzy voice commands include fuzzy linguistic terms like \u201clittle\u201d and quantitative meaning of such terms depends on the environmental conditions. Therefore the robot's perception of the corresponding environment is modified by acquiring the user's perception through a series of vocal cues. The user's willingness to change the robot's perception is identified based on the vocal cues to improve the adaptation process. The primitive behaviors related to the end-effector movements of a robot manipulator are considered and evaluated by a behavior evaluation network (BEN). A vocal cue evaluation system (VCES) is used to evaluate the vocal cues to adapt the robot's perception by modifying the BEN. The user's satisfactory level for the robot's movements is utilized to track the satisfaction of the user. A situation of cooperative rearrangement of the user's working space is used to illustrate the proposed system by a PA-10 robot manipulator.",

The main idea is to push the robot to perform babbling in the goal/operational space, as opposed to motor babbling in the actuator space, by self-generating goals actively and adaptively in regions of the goal space which provide a maximal competence improvement for reaching those goals. Then, a lower level active motor learning algorithm, inspired by the SSA algorithm, is used to allow the robot to locally explore how to reach a given self-generated goal. We present simulated experiments in a 32 dimensional continuous sensorimotor space showing that 1) exploration in the goal space can be a lot faster than exploration in the actuator space for learning the inverse kinematics of a redundant robot; 2) selecting goals based on the maximal improvement heuristics is statistically significantly more efficient than selecting goals randomly.",

Although such an interface is popular for CG character animation, there have not been any practical systems that can appropriately handle the kinematic and dynamic conditions required for moving actual biped robots stably without falling down. In our interface, every time a key pose is created, modified or removed, the system immediately processes automatic trajectory adjustment of the feet and the waist so that the key poses and the interpolated motion can always meet the conditions. This enables a user to edit variety of motions in an intuitive and flexible way without paying attention to the conditions. We implemented the interface and confirmed that characteristic whole body motions of a realistic humanoid robot HRP-4C were easily created with it and the actual HRP-4C successfully performed them.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems such as exoskeletons can be effectively used in the reduction of fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) associated with physical tasks, but robots which work in physical contact with humans pose problems with user safety. A novel approach to developing intrinsically safe robots is to use passive actuators which have the advantage of being safer, ensuring stability, high force/weight ratios and lower power consumption. It is however not clear how effective an exoskeleton utilizing passive actuators would be in reducing fatigue and the risk of MSD. This paper analyzes the benefit of using such a system with results from dynamic simulations and an experiment using a specially designed mechanism used for evaluation. Results indicate that fatigue and effort could be reduced if robot impedance is minimized. Experiments also highlighted issues of implementing such a system into practice.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates and realizes the self-sensing capability of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators. SMA exhibits large stroke, high energy density, and requires low driving voltage. To make SMA more applicable to small scale robotic manipulations, its motion control using accurate self-sensing is necessary. The presented technique builds a self-sensing model by measuring the SMA electrical resistance. Effects of pretension force on strain and force self-sensing are investigated. The model is polyfitted to replace sensor electronics for strain or force feedback. A pretensioner is specifically designed to provide sufficient pretension force without affecting the subject to be actuated. The advantages gained from using polyfitted self-sensing models are demonstrated through several step response control experiments. With the merits shown, we expect this technique can be utilized for SMA actuators in meso to micro scale applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a proposal of an iterative learning control method for a musculoskeletal arm to acquire adequate internal force to realize human-like natural movements. Additionally, a dynamic damping ellipsoid at the end-point is introduced to evaluate internal forces obtained through the iterative learning. In our previous works, we have presented that a human-like smooth reaching movement using a musculoskeletal redundant arm model can be obtained by introducing a nonlinear muscle model and \u201cthe Virtual spring-damper hypothesis\u201d. However, the internal forces have been determined heuristically, so far. In this paper, an iterative learning control method is used for acquisition of an adequate dynamic damping ellipsoid according to a given task, in order to determine internal forces more systematically. It is presented that the learning control scheme can perform effectively to realize given desired tasks, even under the existence of strong nonlinear characteristics of the muscles. After acquiring a given task, the dynamic damping ellipsoid is introduced to evaluate the relation between a damping effect generated by the acquired internal forces and a trajectory of the end-point. Some numerical simulations are performed and the usefulness of the learning control strategy, despite strong nonlinearity of the muscles, is demonstrated through these results.",

In the proposed mechanism, a set of two different hollow-shaped silicone rubber cushions (SRCtrans and SRCstiff : Silicone Rubber Cushion for transmission and for adjusting stiffness, respectively) are sandwiched between an output link and a motor-driven disk. SRCtrans, which is pressed against the motor-driven disk, plays the following three important roles: (1) it transmits rotational motion from the motor to the output link; (2) it absorbs excessive external forces by its elastic deformation and the slippage on the surface of the motor-driven disk; and (3) it allows the estimation of external forces using the information regarding the degree of deformation. On the other hand, SRCstiff, which is placed below SRCtrans, controls the characteristics of joint compliance. SRCtrans is pressed strongly against the motor-driven disk by the expansion of SRCstiff. As a result, the output link can endure the external force without slippage. This paper describes the detail of joint structure and its fundamental performance.",

Appearance SLAM models a robot's environment topologically by a graph whose nodes represent strategically interesting places that have been visited by the robot and whose arcs represent spatial connectivity between these places. Specifically, we discuss and compare various methods for identifying the next location that is sufficiently different visually from the previously visited location or node in the map graph in order to decide whether a new node should be created. We survey existing techniques of keyframe detection in image retrieval and video analysis. Using experimental results obtained from visual SLAM datasets, we conclude that the feature matching method offers the best performance among five representative methods in terms of accurately measuring the amount of appearance change between robot's views and thus can serve as a simple and effective metric for detecting keyframes. This study fills an important but missing step in the current appearance SLAM research.",

Combined with mechanical design of long fins proposed in current literatures, we explore the application of coupled nonlinear oscillators in the modeling of swimming gaits and propose a kinematic modeling framework. Coupled nonlinear oscillators can also be regarded as models of artificial Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for swimming gait control of fish robots. The advantages of this method over the normal sinusoidal functions based method are discussed. The synchronization of multiple oscillators is derived, which can be utilized for the coordination of multiple joints of fish robots and the online gait transition. The framework is applied and tested in swimming motion control of an eight-DOF undulatory fin prototype. The effectiveness of the control is shown through experiments.",

Three different objective functions are implemented, leading to significantly different robot movements. The high computational demands of an online realtime optimization are met by parallel computation on distributed computing resources (a cluster with 32 CPU cores). The system achieves a catch rate of > 80% and is regularly shown as a live demo at our institute.",

A substrate is placed on the end-platform of the parallel robot system, on which three markers are utilized as the reference information to the kinematics parameters estimation. The markers are identified by the AFM scanning in order to identify the kinematics parameters of the whole system. Based on the classic Gauss-Newton algorithm, the position and orientation can be solved.

However, because not only softness but also stiffness is required for precise task execution, the simultaneous realization of softness and stiffness using time varying stiffness is required in the real environment. We focus on the robot motion, and propose a realization method of time varying stiffness using robot motion and nonlinear passive stiffness. To realize the purpose-designed property of the time dependent stiffness, the nonlinear property of the passive stiffness has to be arbitrary designed considering the robot dynamics. In this paper, we propose the nonlinear property design method of passive stiffness based on kineto-statics with closed kinematic chain. The mechanism is synthesized based on the optimization of the generative force or torque, and purpose-designed stiffness is realized. The proposed method is evaluated by simulations and experiments using the prototype of the landing mechanism.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for evaluating the danger within the environment of a robot manipulator. It is based on the introduced concept of kinetostatic danger field, a quantity that captures the complete state of the robot - its configuration and velocity. The field itself is invariant with respect to objects around the robot and can be computed in any given point of the workspace using measurements from the proprioceptive sensors. Moreover, all the computation can be performed in closed form, yielding compact algebraic expressions that allow for real time applications. The danger field is not only a meaningful indicator about the risk in the vicinity of the robot, but can also be fed back within control skills that implement some well known safety strategies like collision avoidance and virtual impedance control, provided that some environment perception is available in order to determine the points where the field should be computed. Kinematic redundancy for simultaneous task performance and danger minimization can be exploited. The methodology described in the paper is supported with simulation results.",

        "abstract": "We describe the Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM) library for message passing and data marshalling. The primary goal of LCM is to simplify the development of low-latency message passing systems, especially for real-time robotics research applications. Messages can be transmitted between different processes using LCM's publish/subscribe message-passing system. A platformand language-independent type specification language separates message description from implementation. Message specifications are automatically compiled into language-specific bindings, eliminating the need for users to implement marshalling code while guaranteeing run-time type safety. LCM is notable in providing a real-time deep traffic inspection tool that can decode and display message traffic with minimal user effort and no impact on overall system performance. This and other features emphasize LCM's focus on simplifying both the development and debugging of message passing systems. In this paper, we explain the design of LCM, evaluate its performance, and describe its application to a number of autonomous land, underwater, and aerial robots.",

In this paper, we present a lane detection and tracking approach designed to work in challenging environments where lane boundaries may be low-contrast and changeful with noise due to a number of factors such as wear, type, lighting and weather conditions, etc. In the method, a sophisticated cascade lane feature detector is applied to cope with challenging environments at the very beginning of the detection and a weighted graph is subsequently constructed by integrating intensity as well as geometry cues, reflecting the confidence of each pixel as a lane feature. In order to deal with complex road geometry, we employ Catmull-Rom splines to represent lane boundaries and the left and right lane boundaries are estimated separately in a tracking process using particle filter based on the weighted graph. In the proposed framework, unlike most of previous methods we lay a strong emphasis on accurate and effective lane feature detection since the challenges happen in the very first step of lane detection, and accurately detected lane features can be expected to reduce the complexity and difficulty, as well as improve the accuracy of lane detection in the following steps.",

We explore dependent Gaussian processes to provide a multi-resolution representation of space and associated uncertainties, while integrating sensors from different modalities.

This paper proposes a methodology for a robot to classify indoor environments into semantic categories. Classification task, using data collected from a laser range finder, is achieved by a machine learning approach based on the logistic regression algorithm. The classification is followed by a probabilistic temporal update of the semantic labels of places. The innovation here is that the new algorithm is able to classify parts of a single laser scan into different semantic labels rather than the conventional approach of gross categorization of locations based on the whole laser scan. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm using a data set available in the public domain.",

A method to check for inconsistencies between the data provided by these two heterogeneous sensors is proposed and discussed. First, uncertainties in the estimated transformation between the laser and camera frames are evaluated and propagated up to the projection of the laser points onto the image. Then, for each pair of laser scan-camera image acquired, the information at corners of the laser scan is compared with the content of the image, resulting in a likelihood of correspondence. The result of this process is then used to validate segments of the laser scan that are found to be consistent with the image, while inconsistent segments are rejected. Experimental results illustrate how this technique can improve the reliability of perception in challenging environmental conditions, such as in the presence of airborne dust.",

The lattices studied are the Cubic, Body Centred Cubic (BCC), Face Centred Cubic (FCC), hexagonal prismatic and finally the Mean Centred Cuboidal (MCC). An algorithm for generic quantization to any low dimensional lattice is presented allowing this analysis to be easily extended to other 3D lattices of interest. Tests are undertaken on uniform sampled random data and laser range data from mobile robot platforms including an autonomous skid steer loader. The improvements in accuracy, memory requirements and consistency under rotation for the alternative lattices over the cubic lattice are typically 5-10%. The radial distribution of lattice points is studied through the distribution of points assigned to the same lattice cell and that in neighbouring cells. For instance only 12 neighbouring cells need checking for the FCC lattice as opposed to the cubic lattice which requires 26. Not only are fewer checks required but the distance variation associated with points in adjacent voxels of the FCC lattice is substantially lower than that of a cubic lattice. For the FCC lattice these point distances have a 30% smaller standard deviation and a 40% smaller range. These results make algorithms, such as collision checking and scan/map matching, which often involve many proximity checks, significantly faster and more accurate.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm that deterministically plans the simultaneous, collision-free movement of n hexagonal metamorphic robots (modules) over any contiguous surface composed of modules in a hexagonal grid. A planning stage algorithm identifies narrow passages between surface cells where moving modules will come into contact. After identifying all narrow passages on a surface, our algorithm identifies the cells that can be used to build temporary structures across the entrance to each narrow passage using 1, 2, or 3 modules. The algorithm does not use intermodule message passing at any stage of the traversal, making it suitable for modules with limited communication capabilities. The algorithm maintains optimal spacing between moving modules throughout the traversal. Our current algorithm is an improvement over previous bridging algorithms because the bridging cells are situated such that when they are filled with modules, they do not form narrow passages (pockets) on the surface. In this paper, we also propose a multi-layered technique for finding longer bridges. We discuss the complexity and performance of our algorithms and give an example of the results of simulating them using a discrete event simulator.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel concept of movement primitives called Stylistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (SDMPs) for motor learning and control in humanoid robotics. In the SDMPs, a diversity of styles in human motion observed through multiple demonstrations can be compactly encoded in a movement primitive, and this allows style manipulation of motion sequences generated from the movement primitive by a control variable called a style parameter. Focusing on discrete movements, a model of the SDMPs is presented as an extension of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) proposed by Ijspeert et al.. A novel learning procedure of the SDMPs from multiple demonstrations, including a diversity of motion styles, is also described. We present two practical applications of the SDMPs, i.e., stylistic table tennis swings and obstacle avoidance with an anthropomorphic manipulator.",

        "abstract": "In order to address the problem of failure detection in the robotics domain, we present in this contribution a so-called self-awareness model, based on the system's internal data exchange and the inherent dynamics of inter-component communication. The model is strongly data driven and provides an anomaly detector for robotics systems both applicable in-situ at runtime as well as a-posteriori in post-mortem analysis. Current architectures or methods for failure detection in autonomous robots are either implementations of watch dog concepts or are based on excessive amounts of domain-specific error detection code. The approach presented in this contribution provides an avenue for the detection of more subtle anomalies originating from external sources such as the environment itself or system failures such as resource starvation. Additionally, developers are alleviated from explicitly modeling and foreseeing every exceptional situation, instead training the presented probabilistic model with the known normal modes within the specification of the robot system. As we developed and evaluated the self-awareness model on a mobile robot platform featuring an event-driven software architecture, the presented method can easily be applied in other current robotics software architectures.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Research in robot navigation usually concentrates on implementing navigation algorithms that allow the robot to navigate without human aid. In many real world situations, it is desirable that the robot is able to understand natural gestures from its user or partner and use this understanding to guide its navigation. Some algorithms already exist for learning natural gestures and/or their associated actions but most of these systems does not allow the robot to automatically generate the associated controller that allows it to actually navigate in the real environment. Furthermore, a technique is needed to combine the gestures/actions learned from interacting with multiple users or partners. This paper resolves these two issues and provides a complete system that allows the robot to learn interaction protocols and act upon them using only unsupervised learning techniques and enables it to combine the protocols learned from multiple users/partners. The proposed approach is general and can be applied to other interactive tasks as well. This paper also provides a real world experiment involving 18 subjects and 72 sessions that supports the ability of the proposed system to learn the needed gestures and to improve its knowledge of different gestures and their associations to actions over time.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of learning and efficiently representing discriminative probabilistic models of object-specific grasp affordances particularly when the number of labeled grasps is extremely limited. The proposed method does not require an explicit 3D model but rather learns an implicit manifold on which it defines a probability distribution over grasp affordances. We obtain hypothetical grasp configurations from visual descriptors that are associated with the contours of an object. While these hypothetical configurations are abundant, labeled configurations are very scarce as these are acquired via time-costly experiments carried out by the robot. Kernel logistic regression (KLR) via joint kernel maps is trained to map the hypothesis space of grasps into continuous class-conditional probability values indicating their achievability. We propose a soft-supervised extension of KLR and a framework to combine the merits of semi-supervised and active learning approaches to tackle the scarcity of labeled grasps. Experimental evaluation shows that combining active and semi-supervised learning is favorable in the existence of an oracle. Furthermore, semi-supervised learning outperforms supervised learning, particularly when the labeled data is very limited.",

We show how an object representation and a grasp generated on it can be integrated with the task requirements. The scientific problems tackled are (i) identification and modeling of such task constraints, and (ii) integration between a semantically expressed goal of a task and quantitative constraint functions defined in the continuous object-action domains. We first define constraint functions given a set of object and action attributes, and then model the relationships between object, action, constraint features and the task using Bayesian networks. The probabilistic framework deals with uncertainty, combines a-priori knowledge with observed data, and allows inference on target attributes given only partial observations. We present a system designed to structure data generation and constraint learning processes that is applicable to new tasks, embodiments and sensory data. The application of the task constraint model is demonstrated in a goal-directed imitation experiment.",

We learn the parameters by establishing a relation between the applied forces and the corresponding surface deformations. To determine the parameters, we minimize the difference between the observed surface of an object that is deformed by a real manipulator and the deformed surface obtained with a deformation simulator based on finite element methods. To establish the correspondences between the surfaces, our approach applies a 3D registration technique based on point-clouds which is used as the basis for comparing the results of the simulation system with the observations of the real deformations. As we demonstrate in real-world experiments, our system is able to estimate appropriate parameters that can be used to predict future deformations. This information can directly be incorporated into motion planning approaches that are designed for robots operating with deformable objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new solution to the loop closing problem for 3D point clouds. Loop closing is the problem of detecting the return to a previously visited location, and constitutes an important part of the solution to the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) problem. It is important to achieve a low level of false alarms, since closing a false loop can have disastrous effects in a SLAM algorithm. In this work, the point clouds are described using features, which efficiently reduces the dimension of the data by a factor of 300 or more. The machine learning algorithm AdaBoost is used to learn a classifier from the features. All features are invariant to rotation, resulting in a classifier that is invariant to rotation. The presented method does neither rely on the discretisation of 3D space, nor on the extraction of lines, corners or planes. The classifier is extensively evaluated on publicly available outdoor and indoor data, and is shown to be able to robustly and accurately determine whether a pair of point clouds is from the same location or not. Experiments show detection rates of 63% for outdoor and 53% for indoor data at a false alarm rate of 0%. Furthermore, the classifier is shown to generalise well when trained on outdoor data and tested on indoor data in a SLAM experiment.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Segmenting range data into semantic categories has become a more and more active field of research in robotics. In this paper, we advocate to view this task as a problem of fast, large-scale retrieval. Intuitively, given a dataset of millions of labeled scan points and their neighborhoods, we simply search for similar points in the datasets and use the labels of the retrieved ones to predict the labels of a novel point using some local prediction model such as majority vote or logistic regression. However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word. Our experiments on real world 3D scans show that the resulting approach, called spectrally hashed logistic regression, can be ultra fast at prediction time and outperforms state-of-the art approaches such as logistic regression and nearest neighbor.",

        "abstract": "We present a probabilistic localization and orientation estimation method for mobile agents equipped with omnidirectional vision. In our appearance-based framework, a scene is learned in an offline step by modeling the variation of the image energy in the frequency domain via Gaussian process regression. The metric localization of novel views is then solved by maximizing the joint predictive probability of the Gaussian processes using a particle filter which allows to incorporate a motion model in the prediction step. Based on the position estimate, a synthetic view is generated and used as a reference for the orientation estimation which is also performed in the Fourier space. Using real as well as virtual data, we show that this framework allows for robust localization in 2D and 3D scenes based on very low resolution images and with competitive computational load.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of enabling a robot to autonomously open doors, including novel ones that the robot has not previously seen. Given the large variation in the appearances and locations of doors and door handles, this is a challenging perception and control problem; but this capability will significantly enlarge the range of environments that our robots can autonomously navigate through. In this paper, we focus on the case of doors with door handles. We propose an approach that, rather than trying to build a full 3d model of the door/door handle-which is challenging because of occlusion, specularity of many door handles, and the limited accuracy of our 3d sensors-instead uses computer vision to choose a manipulation strategy. Specifically, it uses an image of the door handle to identify a small number of \u201c3d key locations,\u201d such as the axis of rotation of the door handle, and the location of the end-point of the door-handle. These key locations then completely define a trajectory for the robot end-effector (hand) that successfully turns the door handle and opens the door. Evaluated on a large set of doors that the robot had not previously seen, it successfully opened 31 out of 34 doors. We also show that this approach of using vision to identify a small number of key locations also generalizes to a range of other tasks, including turning a thermostat knob, pulling open a drawer, and pushing elevator buttons.",

The proposed system takes into account the important characteristics of the task and the redundancy of the robot to determine a controller that is safe for the user. The constraints of the task are first extracted using several examples of the skill demonstrated to the robot through kinesthetic teaching. An active control strategy based on task-space control with variable stiffness is proposed, and combined with a safety strategy for tasks requiring humans to move in the vicinity of robots. A risk indicator for human-robot collision is defined, which modulates a repulsive force distorting the spatial and temporal characteristics of the movement according to the task constraints. We illustrate the approach with two human-robot interaction experiments, where the user teaches the robot first how to move a tray, and then shows it how to iron a napkin.",

        "abstract": "Our ultimate goal is introducing energy-efficient walking patterns to actual humanoid robots. It is known that limit cycle based walking methods, e.g. Passive Dynamic Walking, have such a desired property. Unfortunately, the application of the methods has been limited to simple planar biped models. In this paper, we propose a way of extending limit cycle based walking pattern generation toward a 7DOF 3D biped with ankles, knees, an upper body and with flat feet. This is achieved via first decoupling roll and pitch motions in the frontal/sagittal planes, and then, by designing a limit cycle based walking pattern in the sagittal plane for a planar 5DOF model with ankles, knees and torso. Robustness of the motion is ensured via a feedback control method based on mechanical energy. Then, the planar motion pattern is projected back into 3D space by incorporating dynamic components for gravity compensation and designing a proper trajectory for ankle roll motion. The performances of the walking pattern generator and the controller are confirmed via numerical simulations. The results are presented also as animated motion of a 7DOF 3D biped in the accompanying video.",

To our best knowledge, this is the first paper dealing with the path planning problem on natural tree environment. Different from conventional motion planning approach that requires constructing a complex configuration space, this paper divides the planning problem into two parts, i.e., path and motion planning problem so as to reduce the dimension of the problem. An intuitive method to represent a climbing space is proposed that highly simplifies the path planning problem. With the use of a dynamic programming algorithm, an optimal path to reach a target position can be acquired in linear time. In addition, an efficient motion planning algorithm for a tree climbing robot named TreeBot is developed to make TreeBot follow the planned path.",

Unlike other methods, we consider situations where individuals can move freely and can escape from the formation, moreover they must be regrouped by multiple mobile robots working cooperatively. The problem is addressed by introducing a \u201cDiscrete Time Motion\u201d model (DTM) and a new cost function that minimizes the work required by robots for leading and regrouping people. The guiding mission is carried out in urban areas containing multiple obstacles and building constraints. Furthermore, an analysis of forces actuating among robots and humans is presented throughout simulations of different situations of robot and human configurations and behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are used in warehouses, distribution centers and manufacturing plants in order to automate the internal material flow. Usually AGVs are designed to transport large and heavy transport units such as Euro-pallets or mesh pallets. Just-in-time inventory management and lean production requires small transportation units to enable one-piece-flow. Furthermore short production cycles require a flexible material flow which can not be fulfilled by continuous material handling devices like belt or roll conveyors. A solution to meet these demands are small mobile robots for material transport which can replace conventional conveyor systems or large AGVs. The paper presents localization and tracking of an omnidirectional mobile robot equipped with Mecanum wheels, which was designed to transport Euro-bins in a distribution center or warehouse. Localization is realized by sensor fusion of range measurements obtained from an IEEE 802.15.4a network and laser range finders. The IEEE 802.15.4a network is used for communication as well as for global localization. Laser range finders are used to detect landmarks and to provide accurate positioning for docking maneuvers. The range measurements are fused in a Monte Carlo Particle Filter. The paper develops a new motion model for an omnidirectional robot as well as a sensor model for IEEE 802.15.4a range measurements. The experimental results presented in the paper show the effectiveness of the developed models.",

As a mean of enhancing the mobile range, it is necessary to have various locomotion modes.

In this paper, we aim to realize a stable locomotion along some unknown test courses with transition between biped and quadruped walks. To achive this transition, we propose a method to get environmental information and internal conditions. Robot plans locomotion based on recognition of test courses and estimate stability of walking using Bayesian Network. The effectiveness of proposed method is verified by experiments.",

It features a water-tight structure, a large motion range pitch joint of \u00b190 degree and a high output-power actuator arrangement, based on the coupled drive concept. Furthermore the control method \u201cLoop Gait\u201d is discussed. For this gait the ACM-R7 forms a loop shape and rolls like a wheel on the rim. We introduce the \u201cSerpenoid Oval\u201d for the loop shape. It s formed by a smooth sinusoidal angular motion of the joints. Moreover we consider the modification of the \u201cSerpenoid Oval\u201d for steering and obstacle avoidance. The performance is then verified by several motion experiments.",

Demands for lower cost of care can be met if these systems are employable in a flexible manner for a large variety of procedures. To protect the initial investment the capabilities of a robotic system need to be expandable as new tasks arise. To oblige the needs of future robotic support in hospitals, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed the versatile robotic system MiroSurge for medical applications. This paper presents a 3 DoF instrument for Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery which is mounted to the hollow wrist of the DLR MIRO robot arm. The MICA instrument consists of a versatile drive train and a detachable task specific tool with its tool interface, shaft, 2 DoF wrist, 7 DoF force/torque sensor and the actuated functional end. With the current cable-driven tool, gripping and manipulation forces of above 10 N are feasible and dynamics is high enough for surgery at the beating heart.",

In the past, methods based on random sampling like Probabilistic Roadmap and its variants proved to be able to efficiently solve many important instances of that problem. Performance of these methods degrades drastically in the presence of narrow passages. We propose a different approach to motion planning which combines elements of both cell decomposition methods and sampling based methods. We estimate signed distance to the boundary of free space at sampling points and use that information to guide farther exploration. Cell decomposition is used to generate deterministic sampling positions with non-uniform and dynamically adjusted densities. We report the results of experiments with implementation of our method.",

        "abstract": "Today's household appliances are quickly increasing their features and functions. These new technologies require innovative training methods to maintain learning motivation especially with older users, because they may need more time to learn. Conventional manuals are insufficient to maintain motivation in this population. Previously studied assistive communication robots also have difficulty explaining a second device because their strong presence distracts the user from the device during explanation. We propose an anthropomorphized learning method that sustains older people's motivations to learn new technologies. Our method creates an anthropomorphized household appliance using robot eyes and arms. This method assists the learning process using human expressions. These human-like expressions attract users during training and maintain learning motivation. Our system uses three forms of anthropomorphization: pointing, directive motion, and emotion. We designed and implemented both hardware and software and evaluated the method by training older people to learn a vacuum's features. Our method increased older people's emotional status by an average of 2.53 points compared with the manual learning that decreased emotional status by \u2212.53. This increased emotional status suggests that our system could maintain older users' motivation more effectively compared with traditional manual methods.",

For the purpose, we use operation range. The operation range is for actuator attached to every joint of robot and provides generable joint torque and velocity and their relation (between generating torque/velocity and addable velocity/torque). While we introduced a manipulability measure using the operation range in our previous paper, it was for a limited class due to large computational effort and we could not evaluate whole space of object velocity and could not consider whole space of external wrench. This paper proposes new manipulability measures which can evaluate whole space of object velocity, taking the effect of external wrench in whole space into consideration.",

The robot localizes sound direction and recognizes what sound it is while the robot is in motion. Then the system estimates the positions of the sound sources using triangulation from a short time period of directional localization results. Three key components are denoted: (1) accurate directional localization and separation of multiple sound sources using a microphone array (2) separated sound recognition from a several tens of milliseconds input signal (3) sound position estimation using the RAndom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm from a tracked sound stream. By combining these techniques, the proposed system provides surrounding sound information: \u201cWhere does the sound come from?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the sound?\u201d. It works with short term signal input, and is helpful to initially notice surrounding events.",

        "abstract": "A safe traversal of a mobile robot in an unknown environment requires the determination of local ground surface properties. As a first step, a broad structure of the underlying environment can be established by clustering terrain sections which exhibit similar features. In this work, we focus on an unsupervised learning approach to segment different terrain types according to the clustering of acquired vibration signals. Therefore, we present a Markov random field-based clustering approach taking the inherent temporal dependencies between consecutive measurements into account. The applied generative model assumes that the class labels of neighboring vibration segments are generated by prior distributions with similar parameters. A temporally constrained expectation maximization algorithm enables the efficient estimation of its parameters considering a predefined set of neighboring vibration segments. Since the size of the neighbor set proves to be data-dependent, we derive a general means of estimating this set size from the observed data. We show that the Markov random field clustering approach generates valid models for a variety of driving speeds even in situations of frequent terrain changes.",

        "abstract": "The developed mobile manipulator is primarily composed of a mobile base, a robot manipulator and an eye-in-hand vision system. The material handling of a mobile manipulator has two stages: guiding the mobile base between stations, and picking up a workpiece from a station. Fast landmark recognition and obstacle detection based on color segmentation are proposed for path following, obstacle avoidance and mobile base positioning. Using the machine vision, a vision-based vector field histogram method is modified and applied to guide the mobile manipulator for obstacle avoidance. However, after the mobile manipulator arrives at the station, positioning errors of the mobile base and the non-horizontality of ground inevitably cause position and orientation errors of the mobile base relative to the station. A vision-guided control strategy with a behavior-based look-and-move structure is presented. This strategy is based on six predefined image features. In the designed neural fuzzy controllers, each image feature is taken to generate intuitively one degree of freedom motion command relative to the camera coordinate frame using fuzzy rules, which define a specific visual behavior. These behaviors are then combined and executed in turns to perform grasping tasks.",

A perceptual model for evaluating this relation is suggested, and experiments - simulated as well as using a real robot - are presented. We indicate how this model can be used for important tasks such as communication of spatial knowledge, abstract reasoning and learning, taking as an example direct and indirect visual search. We also demonstrate the model experimentally and show that it produces intuitively feasible results from visual scene analysis as well as synthetic distributions that can be put to a number of uses.",

We develop a new haptic interface called \u201cForce Blinker 2\u201d to navigate the visually impaired. In Force Blinker 2, rotating weights and repulsive magnets are used to reduce the force generated to the direction opposite the traveling direction, which caused false recognition in the previous system, \u201cForce Blinker 1.\u201d In Force Blinker 2, the rotational radius of the weight varies depending on the velocity of the rotational weight. Ten visually impaired subjects evaluated Force Blinker 2 by comparing it with Force Blinker 1, a fixed radius type interface. The directions presented by Force Blinker 2 were correctly recognized at a rate of approximately 85%, which is approximately a 10% improvement over the rate by Force Blinker 1.",

        "abstract": "Due to scale effects, the releasing of micro objects has been a long-standing challenge in micromanipulation applications. In this paper a micromanipulation system is presented based on the adhesion control with compound vibration. This adhesion control technique employs inertia force to overcome adhesion force achieving 100% repeatability with releasing accuracy of 4\u00b10.5\u03bcm, which was experimentally quantified through the manipulation of 20-100\u03bcm polystyrene spheres under an optical microscope. The micromanipulation system consists of a microgripper and a piezoelectric ceramics module. The compound vibration comes from the electrostatic actuator and the piezoelectrically driven actuator. Surface and bulk micromachining technology is employed to fabricate the microgripper used in the system from a single crystal silicon wafer. Experimental results confirmed that this adhesion control technique is independent of substrate. Theoretical analyses were conducted to understand the releasing mechanism. Based on this preliminary study, the micromanipulation system proves to be an effective solution for active releasing of micromanipulation.",

This paper focus on the whole process of this novel sensor from the working principle, parameter determination to the FEM simulation and so forth. This sensor can enlarge the displacement of the PZT by utilizing the lever principle and the strain gauges can perceive the variation without amplifying the noise. About this sensor, we also use the flexure hinges as the rotation joints to obtain the expansion. In addition, we provide the accurate model for this special kind of displacement sensor, and through that people could design and set every parameter freely. Whatever the simulation results in FEM or the experiment data, both of which show that the sensor can perceive the displacement of the PZT actuator in micro/nano scale. Also, the characteristic experiment shows that the proposed sensor has a better performance such as higher level linearity, resolution than its former two generations.",

        "abstract": "Interestingly Humans are able to maintain rough estimations of visibility, reachability and other capabilities of not only themselves but of the person they are interacting with. Studies in neuroscience and psychology suggest that from the age of 12-15 months children start to understand the occlusion of others line-of-sight and from the age of 3 years they start to develop the ability, termed as perceived reachability for self and for others. As such capabilities evolve in the children, they start showing intuitive and proactive behavior by perceiving various abilities of the human partner. Inspired from such studies, which suggest that visuo-spatial perception plays an important role in Human-Human interaction, we propose to equip our robot with the capabilities to maintain various types of reachabilities and visibilities information of itself and of the human partner in the shared workspace. Since these analyses will be basically perceived by performing a virtual action onto the agent and roughly estimating what that agent might be able to 'see' and 'reach' in 3D space, we term these representations as Mightability Maps. By applying various set operations on Weighted Mightability Maps, robot could perceive a set of candidate solutions in real time for various tasks. We show its application in exhibiting two different behaviors of robot: co-operative and competitive. These maps are also quick to compute and could help in developing higher-level decisional capabilities in the robot.",

        "abstract": "When an assistant robotic manipulator cooperatively performs a task with a human and the task is required to be highly reliable, then fault tolerance is essential. To achieve the fault tolerance force within the human robot cooperation, it is required to map the effects of the faulty joint of the robot into the manipulator's healthy joints' torque space and the human force. The objective is to optimally maintain the cooperative force within the human robot cooperation. This paper aims to analyze the fault tolerant force within the cooperation and two frameworks are proposed. Then they have been validated through a fault scenario. Finally, the minimum force jump which is the optimal fault tolerance has been achieved.",

We model the system as a partially-observable Markov decision process and use a sampling-based method in the belief space (the space of posterior probability density functions over the state space) to find a belief-feedback policy. This approach allows us to analyze the evolution of the belief more accurately, which can result in improved policies when common approximations do not model the true behavior of the system. We demonstrate that our method performs comparatively, and in certain cases better, than current methods in the literature.",

The system is designed such that during flight, the angular rate of a UAV is captured by an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) and is relayed to a pilot controlling the vehicle from inside the motion simulator. Efforts to further increase pilot SA led to the development of a mixed reality chase view piloting interface. Chase view is similar to a view of being towed behind the aircraft. It combines real world onboard camera images with a virtual representation of the vehicle and the surrounding operating environment.",

        "abstract": "Future applications will bring unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to near Earth environments such as urban areas, causing a change in the way UAVs are currently operated. Of concern is that UAV accidents still occur at a much higher rate than the accident rate for commercial airliners. A number of these accidents can be attributed to a UAV pilot's low situation awareness (SA) due to the limitations of UAV operating interfaces. The main limitation is the physical separation between the vehicle and the pilot. This eliminates any motion and exteroceptive sensory feedback to the pilot. These limitation on top of a small field of view from the onboard camera results in low SA, making near Earth operations difficult and dangerous. Autonomy has been proposed as a solution for near Earth tasks but state of the art artificial intelligence still requires very structured and well defined goals to allow safe autonomous operations. Therefore, there is a need to better train pilots to operate UAVs in near Earth environments and to augment their performance for increased safety and minimization of accidents.",

Vision-based navigation in outdoor environments is still challenging because of large illumination changes. To cope with various illumination conditions, we use 2D occupancy grid maps generated from 3D point clouds obtained by a stereo camera. Furthermore, we incorporate salient line segments extracted from the ground into the grid maps. This grid map building is not much affected by illumination conditions. On the grid maps, the robot poses are estimated using a particle filter that combines visual odometry and map-matching. Experimental results showed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method under various weather and illumination conditions.",

This paper addresses the problem of controlling an autonomous robot to avoid obstacles for reactive route following navigation. The four-wheeled mobile robot is equipped with three monocular cameras for route following and a range sensor for obstacle avoidance. The equipped robot moves route environments using a reactive navigation method. When an obstacle is detected by a range sensor, the proposed obstacle avoidance method estimates the free space in the route and generates the turning direction vector for heading the robot to the free space which is wider than other space. We executed experiments about the navigation algorithm of the robot with an obstacle including curved path environments in this paper. Through the experiment results in various cases, it is discovered that the proposed method has a better time performance for obstacle avoidance in comparison with other conventional technique.",

        "abstract": "Self-localization is important for mobile robots in order to move accurately, and many works use an omnidirectional camera for self-localization. However, it is difficult to realize fast and accurate self-localization by using only one omnidirectional camera without any calibration. For its realization, we use \u201ctracked scale and rotation invariant feature points\u201d that are regarded as landmarks. These landmarks can be tracked and do not change for a \u201clong\u201d time. In a landmark selection phase, robots detect the feature points by using both a fast tracking method and a slow \u201cSpeed Up Robust Features (SURF)\u201d method. After detection, robots select landmarks from among detected feature points by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained by feature vectors based on observation positions. In a self-localization phase, robots detect landmarks while switching detection methods dynamically based on a tracking error criterion that is calculated easily even in the uncalibrated omnidirectional image. We performed experiments in an approximately 10 [m] \u00d7 10 [m] mock supermarket by using a navigation robot ApriTau\u2122 that had an omnidirectional camera on its top. The results showed that ApriTau\u2122 could localize 2.9 times faster and 4.2 times more accurately by using the developed method than by using only the SURF method. The results also showed that ApriTau\u2122 could arrive at a goal within a 3 [cm] error from various initial positions at the mock supermarket.",

To do so, an algorithm is needed to assign tasks to mobile robots which minimizes communication among the static sensors in order to extend the lifetime of the network. We present three algorithms to solve this task allocation problem: a centralized algorithm, an auction-based algorithm, and a novel distributed algorithm utilizing a spanning tree over the static sensors to assign tasks. We compare the assignment quality and communication costs of these algorithms experimentally. Our experiments show that at a small cost in assignment quality, the distributed tree-based algorithm significantly extends the lifetime of the static sensor network.",

        "abstract": "We present a vision-based navigation and localization system using two biologically-inspired scene understanding models which are studied from human visual capabilities: (1) Gist model which captures the holistic characteristics and layout of an image and (2) Saliency model which emulates the visual attention of primates to identify conspicuous regions in the image. Here the localization system utilizes the gist features and salient regions to accurately localize the robot, while the navigation system uses the salient regions to perform visual feedback control to direct its heading and go to a user-provided goal location. We tested the system on our robot, Beobot2.0, in an indoor and outdoor environment with a route length of 36.67m (10,890 video frames) and 138.27m (28,971 frames), respectively. On average, the robot is able to drive within 3.68cm and 8.78cm (respectively) of the center of the lane.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to the indirect simultaneous positioning task of deformable objects based on robust linear output regulation methods. Indirect control requires maneuvering control points defined on a deformable body to desired locations by manipulating points located elsewhere on the object. The proposed control scheme uses a linearization of the deformable object dynamics into a state-space model for which the inputs are the forces applied to the manipulation points and the outputs are the positions of the control points. Then, the indirect simultaneous positioning task is treated as a classical robust linear output regulation problem. The proposed controller can compensate for deformable model nonlinearities and material uncertainties. The controller performance is illustrated through simulation and experimental results obtained on a planar deformable object model. The experiment was conducted using a robot controlled to apply desired end-effector forces on the planar object.",

The set of experiments, which have been recorded as video sequences, show a group of people being guided by a team of three people (who play the role of the guide robots). The model used in the simulation process is called Discrete Time Motion model (DTM) described in [7], where the environment is modeled using a set of potential fields, and people's motion is represented through tension functions. The video sequences were recorded in an urban space of 10:000 m2 denominated Barcelona Robot Lab, where people move in the urban space following diverse trajectories. The motion (pose and velocity) of people and robots extracted from the video sequences were compared against the predictions of the DTM model. Finally, we checked the proper functioning of the model by studying the position error differences of the recorded and simulated sequences.",

In order to automate the manufacture process and also hand down the skillful techniques of sweets making, it is necessary to investigate the mathematical models of such objects and estimate their physical properties. This paper introduced a five-element physical model to describe the deformation behaviors of such materials. Using finite element (FE) method, a 2D/3D FE dynamic model was formulated to simulate arbitrary shaped objects. An approach for estimating physical parameters was then proposed based on FE simulation and nonlinear optimization. To capture both forces and deformation behaviors, two sets of parameters were identified and employed to simulate real Japanese sweets. A series of experimental results validated the FE model and property estimation method.",

        "abstract": "Human motor control has always acted as an inspiration in both robotic manipulator design and control. In this paper, a modeling approach of anthropomorphism in human arm movements during every-day life tasks is proposed. The approach is not limited to describing static postures of the human arm but is able to model posture transitions, in other words, dynamic arm movements. The method is based on a novel structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that is constructed using motion capture data. The structure and parameters of the model are learnt from the motion capture data used for training. Once trained, the proposed model can generate new anthropomorphic arm motions. These motions are then used for controlling an anthropomorphic robot arm, while a measure of anthropomorphism is defined and utilized for assessing resulted motion profiles.",

        "abstract": "This paper formulates the dynamics of 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) robotic hand that consists of an index finger and an opposable thumb like the human hand. This system has two geometrical constraints and five velocity constraints generated during the object manipulation task. The three of the velocity constraints are associated with the joint angles of the robot, and are combined to the proposed system on the basis of observations about the fact that the distal two joints of the index finger are mechanically coupled. Based on the equations of motion including these constraints, we perform precise orientation control of a rectangular object grasped by the 5-DOFs robotic hand in the situation that grasping forces are not defined during the manipulation. The manipulation task given is one-finger control (index finger), for which a serial two-phased (STP) controller that had previously been proposed is modified. In experiments, we demonstrate that a simple integral controller designed by eliminating the second stage of the STP controller works well in the soft-fingered manipulation. In both simulations and experiments, it is clearly indicated that Jacobian matrices and the grasping forces are not necessarily required in the control law for accomplishing dexterous manipulation tasks. In other words, it is implied that a complete modelless and grasping-forceless control can be achieved in the task-space control.",

        "abstract": "MEMS-based microgrippers with integrated force sensor have proved their efficiency to perform dexterous micromanipulation tasks through gripping forces sensing and control. For force control, knowledge based models are more relevant and gives better physical significance than the use of black box models. However this approach is often limited by many problems commonly encountered in the MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) structures such as: complex architectures, nonlinear behaviors and parameters uncertainties due to fabrication process at the micrometer scale. For these reasons theoretical approaches must be compared with experiments. This paper describes a modelling approach of a MEMS-based microgripper with integrated force sensor while handling micro-glass balls of 80\u03bcm diameter. Therefore, a state space representation is developed to couple both the dynamics of the actuation and sensing subsystems of the gripper through the stiffness of the manipulated object. A knowledge based model is obtained for small displacements at the tip of the gripper arms (small gripping forces) and is compared with experimental approaches. Good agreements are observed allowing interesting perspectives for the control.",

        "abstract": "In many mobile robotic manipulation tasks it is desirable to interact with the robots surroundings without actually grasping the object being manipulated. Non-prehensile manipulation allows a robot to interact in situations which would otherwise be impossible due to size or weight. This paper presents the derivation of a mathematical model of an object pushed by a single point and sliding in the presence of friction where the dynamic effects of mass and inertia are significant. This model is validated using numerical simulation. The derived dynamic model is also compared with a kinematic approximation from literature, showing that under certain conditions, the motion of a pushed object is similar to the motion of a non-holonomic vehicle. Finally, the results of experimental investigations are discussed and promising directions for further work are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Human robot interaction is an emerging area of research with many challenges. Knowledge about human behaviors could lead to more effective and efficient interactions of a robot in populated environments. This paper presents a probabilistic framework for the learning and representation of human motion patterns in an office environment. It is based on the observation that most human trajectories are not random. Instead people plan trajectories based on many considerations, such as social rules and path length. Motion patterns are learned using an incrementally growing Sampled Hidden Markov Model. This model has a number of interesting properties which can be of use in many applications. For example, the learned knowledge can be used to predict motion, infer social rules, thus improve a robot's operation and its interaction with people in a populated space. The proposed learning method is extensively validated in real world experiments.",

        "abstract": "High-speed path tracking with a kinematically redundant manipulator mounted on a flexible base is addressed. Thereby, possible vibrations of the base are to be suppressed. In general, the presence of kinematic redundancy allows these two subtasks to be performed simultaneously. In practice, however, this can be done only within very limited areas of workspace, separated by singularity loci that change dynamically while the end-effector tracks the desired path. To avoid controller performance degradation in the neighborhood of such dynamic singularities, and to allow transitions between the distinct workspace areas through singularity boundaries, we propose here a new method for reactionless motion generation within a specified neighborhood of the singularity. In contrast to previous works, this method makes use of a nonzero coupling momentum which is conserved upon entering the neighborhood.",

The main idea is to improve the performance of image clustering via fusing depth cue, color, spatial location, and edge confidence in six-dimensional color-depth feature space. It integrates the monocular depth cue estimation, mean shift filtering and graph cuts algorithm together. Firstly, the dark channel prior based atmospheric transmission estimation is employed to recover monocular depth cue. Then the mean shift filtering in the weighted color-depth space is proposed to obtain cluster regions with correct boundaries. Finally, graph cuts algorithm is applied to achieve the final regional grouping. Experimental results indicate the proposed method has excellent performance in outdoor natural environments.",

        "abstract": "We present a generalization of the Koenderink-van Doorn (KvD) algorithm that allows robust monocular localization with large motion between the camera frames for a wide range of optical systems including omnidirectional systems and standard perspective cameras. The KvD algorithm estimates simultaneously ego-motion parameters, i.e. rotation, translation, and object distances in an iterative way. However due to the linearization of the rotational component of optic flow, the original algorithm fails for larger rotations. We present a generalization of the algorithm to arbitrary rotations that is especially suited for omnidirectional cameras where features can be tracked for long sequences. This reduces the need for vector summation of several individual motion estimates that leads to accumulation of odometry errors. The significant improvement in the performance of the proposed generalized algorithm compared to the original KvD implementation is validated using simulated data. The algorithm is also tested in a real-world experiment with ground-truth data obtained from an external tracking system. The experiment was carried out using a novel compact omnidirectional camera that is designed for small aerial vehicles. It consists of an off-the-shelf webcam that is combined with a reflective surface machined into acrylic glass.",

When computation and memory are limited, visual tracking becomes difficult or impossible, and map representation and update costs must remain low. Our system constructs a map of structured views using only weak temporal assumptions, and performs recognition and relative pose estimation over the set of views. Visual observations are fused with differential sensors in an incrementally optimized graph representation. Using variable elimination and constraint pruning, the graph complexity and storage is kept linear in explored space rather than in time. We evaluate performance on sequences with ground truth, and also compare to a standard graph SLAM approach.",

A novel transportation system, WIP-car is proposed in this paper, which is composed of a mobile wheeled inverted pendulum system, a driven chair, an acceleration pedal and a deceleration pedal, which are used to drive the chair forward or backward such that the car can be accelerated or decelerated. The neural-adaptive implicit control is designed for dynamic balance and stable tracking of desired trajectories of WIP-car. Neither the dynamics nor the dimension of the regulated system is required to be known, while the relative degree of the regulated output is assumed to be known. Under the assumption that WIP-car is feedback linearizable, adaptive neural network is introduced to cancel the inversion dynamics error. Simulation results demonstrate that the system is able to track reference signals satisfactorily with all closed loop signals uniformly bounded.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a passive haptic device which consists of wires with servo brakes and its control method for physical support of human being. Since servo brakes control a point constrained by wires, this passive system is intrinsically safe and has a wide operating range. We especially develop a motion support system controlled on plane and conduct a path following experiment for illustrating a possibility of the passive haptic device with wires. We also analyze the system's characteristics by calculating the feasible braking force, and then improve the operating range of the system based on the analysis. Experimental results on path following function illustrate the validity of the system and its control method.",

C-PRP employs passive dynamics with respect to the force applied by a human. Its appropriate motion is controlled using the servo brakes. In this paper, we derive and analyze a feasible braking force/moment that can be applied to the robot on the basis of the characteristics of the servo brakes. In addition, we propose a motion control algorithm for C-PRP based on the analysis of this feasible braking force/moment. This algorithm is independent of the number of casters.

In this paper, two adaptation methods to external force; \u201cslow adaptation\u201d and \u201crapid adaptation\u201d are proposed for smoother reaching movements and submissive behavior to follow the force. These make smooth endpoint speed profiles and movements flexible to follow external force without detecting the force. The slow adaptation moderates the manipulator's endpoint acceleration, and it also enables the manipulator to handle subsequent changes of target endpoint positions. If the endpoint position is significantly changed by excessive external force, the rapid adaptation works to follow the force and restart the reaching movement smoothly. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed through computer simulations.",

We focus on forward velocity estimation towards the computation of standard energy cost functions for legged locomotion. Points are chosen as image features and the model of each camera is based on the traditional pinhole projection. The resulting filter's state is composed of the rigid body pose and velocities, together with a measure of depth for each tracked point. By taking inspiration from nature's large predatory and grazing mammals eye configuration, we suggest, via simulation results, a solution for the question of finding the best orientation of two cameras, between side and frontal facing, for velocity estimation in a forward moving robot.",

This paper presents a model to generate robot motions based on reliable predictability evaluated through a dynamics learning model which self-organizes object features. The model is composed of a dynamics learning module, namely Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB), and a hierarchical neural network as a feature extraction module. The model inputs raw object images and robot motions. Through bi-directional training of the two models, object features which describe the object motion are self-organized in the output of the hierarchical neural network, which is linked to the input of RNNPB. After training, the model searches for the robot motion with high reliable predictability of object motion. Experiments were performed with the robot's pushing motion with a variety of objects to generate sliding, falling over, bouncing, and rolling motions. For objects with single motion possibility, the robot tended to generate motions that induce the object motion. For objects with two motion possibilities, the robot evenly generated motions that induce the two object motions.",

First we choose constraint functions that describe the configuration variables along a desired motion in terms of some independent parametrization variable. This lets us describe the closed-loop system by some reduced order dynamics, the solution of which gives a feasible trajectory for the desired motion. By using the method of transverse linearization for controller design, we achieve exponential orbital stability to a desired trajectory. Numerical simulations confirm this property and show good convergence to a desired periodic motion when initialized from a resting state.",

Since it is one of the most important abilities for auditory robots to recognize vocal messages correctly, the proposed method is designed to maximize the confidence measure of a speech recognition since the measure is thought to be strongly related to the accuracy of the speech recognition. However, the cost function to optimize is hard to model explicitly, and it is difficult to obtain the gradient that is normally utilized to derive the motion. In order to overcome this difficulty, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation(SPSA) that does not require an explicit model of the cost function is applied to generate robot motion. The effectiveness of the approach was verified through real experiments: the robot could get better speech recognition rate after it approached the sound source by measuring the confidence measure.",

        "abstract": "Omnidirectional mobile robots, i.e., robots that can move in any direction without changing their orientation, offer better manoeuvrability in natural environments. Modeling the kinematics of such robots is a challenging problem and different approaches have been investigated. One of the best approaches for a nonholonomic robot is to model the robot's velocity state as the motion around its instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). In this paper, we present a motion planner designed to compute efficient trajectories for such a robot in an environment with obstacles. The action space is modeled in terms of changes of the ICR and the motion around it. Our motion planner is based on a Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm to sample the action space and find a feasible trajectory from an initial configuration to a goal configuration. To generate fluid paths, we introduce an adaptive sampling technique taking into account constraints related to the ICR-based action space.",

The strategy involves manipulating the object at high speed. By moving the robot at high speed, we can assume that the dynamic behavior of the linear flexible object can be obtained by performing algebraic calculations of the robot motion. Based on this assumption, we derive a model of the linear flexible object and confirm the validity of the proposed model. Finally, we perform simulation of dynamic knotting based on the proposed model. Results of an experiment demonstrating dynamic knotting with a high-speed robot arm are shown.",

The robots are required to fulfill formation requirements while meeting velocity/acceleration constraints and avoiding collisions. Coordination is achieved by planning robot velocities along the paths through a velocity optimization process. An objective function for minimizing formation errors is established and solved by a linear interactive and general optimizer. Motion planning can be further adjusted online to address emergent demands such as avoiding suddenly-appearing obstacles. Simulations and experiments are performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated motion planning in multirobot formations.",

Taking into account the positive and negative effect of mechanical passive elements implemented in joints, this motion-planning method can enables the hand-arm system to establish the active BE contact at the appropriate body-site and to select the joints that perform the movement for executing the given task.

Especially moving objects detection and classification by laser scanners mounted on a mobility is required for mobile robots and autonomous cars. In this paper, we propose a moving objects detection and classification method based on grid trajectories acquired from sequential laser scan data. Grid trajectories are obtained by voting sequential laser scan points on a grid map, and these trajectories not only work for a correct scan segmentation, but also represent the size and the speed of moving objects. We classify a moving object into either a person, a group of people, a bike, a car based on its grid trajectory. In our experiments, our mobility mounted laser scanners acquired scan data in the university campus, and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "Visually estimating a robot's own motion has been an active field of research within the last years. Though impressive results have been reported, some application areas still exhibit huge challenges. Especially for car-like robots in urban environments even the most robust estimation techniques fail due to a vast portion of independently moving objects. Hence, we move one step further and propose a method that combines ego-motion estimation with low-level object detection. We specifically design the method to be general and applicable in real-time. Pre-classifying interest points is a key step, which rejects matches on possibly moving objects and reduces the computational load of further steps. Employing an Iterated Sigma Point Kalman Filter in combination with a RANSAC based outlier rejection scheme yields a robust frame-to-frame motion estimation even in the case when many independently moving objects cover the image. Extensive experiments show the robustness of the proposed approach in highly dynamic environments with speeds up to 20m/s.",

Open-loop playback of high frequencies offers a promising way to generate rich contact transients and textures, but complex high frequency dynamics cause distortion. This paper explores the equalization and dynamic decoupling of multi-DOF haptic devices for accurate open-loop playback. Toward this end, a user study is performed to determine the frequency limit of human force direction sensitivity at 35Hz. This information together with experimental system identification techniques is used to develop a strategy for equalization in different frequency bands. Finally, MIMO equalization is accomplished through online simulation of the system model under the control of an LQR tracking controller.",

Due to the large frictional forces within the gearing of such robots, a force-feedback controller is necessary to precisely control the forces the robot applies when manipulating its environment. This paper proves passivity, and therefore guarantees stability, of a model-based force controller in one degree of freedom (DOF) when subject to viscous and Coulomb friction. The controller is then expanded to muli-DOF systems. In addition to maintaining the robustness of the 1-DOF controller, the multi-DOF controller provides additional freedom to design the closed loop dynamics of the robot. This freedom allows the control designer the ability to shape and optimize how the system feels from a users perspective. The robustness of the controller is experimentally validated and the freedom to modify the closed loop dynamics is explored using a 2-DOF device.",

        "abstract": "Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras gain depth information by emitting amplitude-modulated near-infrared light and measuring the phase shift between the emitted and the reflected signal. The phase shift is proportional to the object's distance modulo the wavelength of the modulation frequency. This results in a distance ambiguity. Distances larger than the wavelength are wrapped into the sensor's non-ambiguity range and cause spurious distance measurements. We apply Phase Unwrapping to reconstruct these wrapped measurements. Our approach is based on a probabilistic graphical model. We use loopy belief propagation to detect and infer the position of wrapped measurements. Besides depth discontinuities, our method utilizes multiple modulation frequencies to identify wrapped measurements. In experiments, we show that wrapped measurements are identified and corrected, even in situations where the scene shows steep slopes in the depth measurements.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel batch algorithm for SLAM problems that distributes the workload in a hierarchical way. We show that the original SLAM graph can be recursively partitioned into multiple-level submaps using the nested dissection algorithm, which leads to the cluster tree, a powerful graph representation. By employing the nested dissection algorithm, our algorithm greatly minimizes the dependencies between two subtrees, and the optimization of the original SLAM graph can be done using a bottom-up inference along the corresponding cluster tree. To speed up the computation, we also introduce a base node for each submap and use it to represent the rigid transformation of the submap in the global coordinate frame. As a result, the optimization moves the base nodes rather than the actual submap variables. We demonstrate that our algorithm is not only exact but also much faster than alternative approaches in both simulations and real-world experiments.",

The parallel way in which the proposed structures are built reduces the time the signal is propagated in the loops, which outperforms the well-known serial cascade structure. Additionally, employing forward dynamical models relieves one of having to find the compensator, unlike feedforward or IMC(Internal Model Control)/(2DOF)IMC systems. The robustness of the proposed structures is significantly higher than that offered by the most commonly used control systems, i.e. the single-loop PID control. An example of implementing the n-MFC structure for position control of a directly driven two-joint serial manipulator is also given in the paper.",

The filter uses relative (local) measurements obtained from image based motion estimation through visual odometry, as well as global measurements produced by landmark matching through a pre-built visual landmark database and range measurements obtained from radio frequency (RF) ranging radios. We show our results by using the camera poses output by our system to render views from a 3D graphical model built upon the same coordinate frame as the landmark database which also forms the global coordinate system and compare them to the actual video images. These results help demonstrate both the long term stability and the overall accuracy of our algorithm as intended to provide a solution to the GPS denied ubiquitous camera tracking problem under both vision-aided and vision-impaired conditions.",

Within this system the boundary edge is partitioned into subsegments, each allocated to a particular robot such that workload is balanced across the robots. Also, to minimize the time between sampling local areas of the boundary edge, it may be desirable to minimize the difference between each robots progression (i.e. phase) along its allocated sub segment of the edge. The paper introduces a new distributed controller that handles both workload and phase balancing. Simulation results are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the controller in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) under ice edge sampling application. Successful results from experimentation with three iRobot Creates are also presented.",

First, the robot dynamics is formulated as being dependent on the communication network where two robots - if in communication - can access each other's position and goal information. Next, three alternative strategies for establishing the communication network depending on the robots' states are presented: deterministic, game-theoretic and mixed approaches. In the first approach, the network is defined deterministically based on the robots' states and the communication range. The game-theoretic network formation is based on utilizing the conflict between the communication gain and cost. The mixed approach integrates features from deterministic and game-theoretic approaches. An extensive statistical study investigates comparative performance characteristics for exploration, zone and procession type goals.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system that gives a mobile robot the ability to recognize target speaker's speech, even if the robot performs an action and there are multiple speakers talking in the room. Associated problems to this system are twofold: (1) While the robot is moving, the joints inevitably generate ego-motion noise due to its motors. (2) Recognizing target speech against other interfering speech signals is a difficult task. Since typical solutions to (1) and (2), motor noise suppression and sound source separation, both introduce distortion to the processed signals, the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) deteriorates. Instead of removing the ego-motion noise with conventional noise suppression methods, in this work, we investigate methods to eliminate the unreliable parts of the audio features that are contaminated by the ego-motion noise. For this purpose, we model masks that filter unreliable speech features based on the ratio of speech and motor noise energies. We analyze the performance of the proposed technique under various test conditions by comparing it to the performance of existing Missing Feature Theory-based ASR implementations. Finally, we propose an integration framework for two different masks that are designed to eliminate ego noise and to filter the leakage energy of interfering sound sources. We demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a high ASR accuracy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Advancing research into autonomous micro aerial vehicle navigation requires data structures capable of representing indoor and outdoor 3D environments. The vehicle must be able to update the map structure in real time using readings from range-finding sensors when mapping unknown areas; it must also be able to look up occupancy information from the map for the purposes of localization and path-planning. Mapping models that have been used for these tasks include voxel grids, multi-level surface maps, and octrees. In this paper, we suggest a new approach to 3D mapping using a multi-volume occupancy grid, or MVOG. MVOGs explicitly store information about both obstacles and free space. This allows us to correct previous potentially erroneous sensor readings by incrementally fusing in new positive or negative sensor information. In turn, this enables extracting more reliable probabilistic information about the occupancy of 3D space. MVOGs outperform existing probabilistic 3D mapping methods in terms of memory usage, due to the fact that observations are grouped together into continuous vertical volumes to save space. We describe the techniques required for mapping using MVOGs, and analyze their performance using indoor and outdoor experimental data.",

We achieve this by solving an ID association problem in the WMSN. We then generate local maps for nodes in immediate vicinity and merge them together to get a global map.

        "abstract": "An important pre-requisite for many tasks like Visual Servoing and visual SLAM is the task of tracking the underlying features. The use of planar features for these purposes has gained importance recently. Complementing current planar tracking works in the robotics literature, which use multiple features, we formulate the tracking problem using multiple planes. Inspired by the maturity in understanding of geometric quantities like the homography in computer vision, we develop a system based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) that localizes the camera and estimates the plane parameters of a scene, using homographies as measurement. Homographies are estimated using tracked feature points. We show that this framework provides significant robustness and stability to the system under significant changes of illumination, occlusion etc. Finally, we also propose a Convex optimization based solution for the initialization of this system, which is capable of producing globally optimal estimates, and is a useful algorithm in its own right. Several synthetic and real results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",

All results so far reported with MCOR have been on data collected by ourselves. In this work, we introduce new advancements in the MCOR algorithm to increase its effectiveness and ability to deal with complex real data from outside datasets. These advancements include the integration of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features and an improvement in training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCOR framework, we first show a comparison of the MCOR algorithm to an outside dataset to show its basic advantages. We then demonstrate the advanced MCOR features on real television video datasets in particular cooking.",

In this paper, we propose a multirobot motion coordination strategy that can maintain multirobot connectivity as well as guarantee obstacle avoidance.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Social robots that provide services to humans in real environments have been developed in recent years. Such a robot should appropriately recognize its users' orders through human-like communications because of user-friendliness. However, their styles of communicating are too diverse to achieve this goal. If the robot could shape their styles, its recognition ability would be improved. An entrainment, which is a phenomenon where human's behavior is synchronized with robot's behavior, can be useful for this shaping. Previous studies have reported the entrainment occurring in the same modality, but they have given little attention to entrainment across different modalities (e.g., speech and gestures). We need to consider this cross-modal effect because human-robot interaction is inherently multi-modal. In this paper, we defined \u201cmutual entrainment\u201d as the entrainment across different modalities and investigated the effect of it through a laboratory experiment. We evaluate how the frequency of human pointing gestures varies with the amount of information in robot speech, and as a result, we found that the gesture frequency increased as the amount of information decreased. The results suggest that smoother human-robot communications can be achieved by shaping human behavior through mutual entrainment.",

Gait pattern is known to be related to gait parameters, such as cadence, stride length, and walking speed. Thus, prior before the discussion of gait pattern planning, the planning of gait parameters for natural walking should be addressed. This work utilizes multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) to predict natural gait parameters for a given subject. The inputs of the MLPNN are age, gender, body height, and body weight of the targeted subject. The MLPNN is trained to output a suitable walking speed and cadence for given subject. Two MLPNNs are trained to study the efficiency and accuracy in predicting the desired outputs, for two different setups. First setup is that the MLPNN is trained specifically for slow speed condition only. In second setup, the MLPNN is trained for both slow and normal speed conditions. The results of the MLPNNs are presented in this paper. The efficiency and accuracy of the MLPNNs are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Natural language is a flexible and intuitive modality for conveying directions and commands to a robot but presents a number of computational challenges. Diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. In this paper we present a micro-air vehicle (MAV) capable of following natural language directions through a previously mapped and labeled environment. We extend our previous work in understanding 2D natural language directions to three dimensions, accommodating new verb modifiers such as go up and go down, and commands such as turn around and face the windows. We demonstrate the robot following directions created by a human for another human, and interactively executing commands in the context of surveillance and search and rescue in confined spaces. In an informal study, 71% of the paths computed from directions given by one user terminated within 10m of the desired destination.",

This is done first via simulations, with a simple planar manipulator and then with a six-DOF manipulator. From the results it becomes apparent that natural-motion path tracking outperforms constant-speed path tracking in terms of peak joint speed, peak joint torque and total mechanical power, ensuring thereby a higher average tracking speed. The results are also confirmed via experiments with a real six-DOF robotic limb.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) problem in an unknown environment. We consider the realistic scenario in which the robot has to navigate to a goal position in an unknown environment consisting of static and movable objects. The robot may move objects if the goal can not be reached otherwise or if moving the object may significantly shorten the path to the goal. We consider real situations in which the robot only has limited sensing information and where the action selection can therefore only be based on partial knowledge learned from the environment at that point. This paper introduces an algorithm that significantly reduces the necessary calculations to accomplish this task compared to a direct approach. We present an efficient implementation for the case of planar, axis-aligned environments and report experimental results on challenging scenarios with more than 50 objects.",

In addition, gaze control architecture is proposed, which estimates the size of local map confidence area, self-localization error, surrounding obstacles and obstacle-free distance against those obstacles in the local map.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the control problem for a group of mobile robots keeping a geometric formation is considered. The proposed architecture of control allows to each robot to avoid obstacles and to rejoin the desired formation. To not complicate the control of such a system, it is proposed to divide the overall complex task into two basic tasks: attraction to a dynamical target, and obstacle avoidance. Thus, a desired geometric shape is defined and each robot has to track one node of this mobile shape. Each robot has to be autonomously able to avoid disturbing obstacles and to rejoin the formation in a reactive manner. Moreover, it chooses the optimal avoidance side thanks to limit-cycle method in order to reach as rapidly as possible its virtual target. The proposed control architecture is implemented in a distributed manner. In addition, this architecture uses the same control law (Lyapunov stable) for the two elementary tasks, and the switching from one task to another occurs only by changing the set-points. Experimental results validate the proposed control architecture.",

        "abstract": "Target tracking problems have been extensively studied for both robots and sensor networks. In this paper, we consider a target tracking problem in which a sensorless tracking robot must maintain close proximity to an unpredictably moving target. To assist the robot, a network of sensor nodes, each equipped with a binary proximity sensor, is spread through the environment. This architecture has the benefit of eliminating the need for information-rich sensors on the tracker, while supplying it with nonlocal observations of the target. However, it also introduces new complications due to the mobility of the tracker and the energy limitations of the sensor nodes. To address these issues, we present algorithms that allow both the tracker and the sensor nodes to maintain partial information about the target's location. The contribution of this work is an algorithm that manages the propagation of information across this network, making message delivery decisions on-the-fly, based on each message's informative value for the tracker. We present an implementation along with simulation results. The results show that our system achieves both good tracking precision and low energy consumption in both start-up and steady state phases of the problem, and that its performance is superior to that of earlier methods for this problem.",

The nodes compute paths for the robots within their communication range given information about robots only in their vicinity and communicating only with neighbors. The objective is to compute paths that are collision-free, minimize the occurrence of deadlocks, as well as the time it takes to reach the robots' goals. This paper formulates this challenge as a distributed constraint optimization problem. This formulation lends itself to a message-passing solution that guarantees collision-avoidance despite only local knowledge of the world by the network nodes. Simulations on benchmarks that cannot be solved with coupled or simple decoupled schemes are used to evaluate parameters and study the scalability, path quality and computational overhead of the approach.",

This walking pattern is generated in Lateral Accessory Lobe (LAL) and the ventral protocerebrum (VPC) domain which controls physical exercise. Therefore, in this study, we elucidate the process of this behavior by constructing a neural network model of the LAL domain. Concretely, we build a model that treats some numbers of neurons as one neuron and estimate strength of each connection between 10 neuron representatives of neuron groups with Genetic Algorithm. The estimated network is verified and consided from engineering and biology.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present various new insights on the effect intrinsic joint elasticity has on safety in pHRI. We address the fact that the intrinsic safety of elastic mechanisms has been discussed rather one sided in favor of this new designs and intend to give a more differentiated view on the problem. An important result is that intrinsic joint elasticity does not reduce the Head Injury Criterion or impact forces compared to conventional actuation with some considerable elastic behavior in the joint, if considering full scale robots. We also elaborate conditions under which intrinsically compliant actuation is potentially more dangerous than rigid one. Furthermore, we present collision detection and reaction schemes for such mechanisms and verify their effectiveness experimentally.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new redundancy-based strategy for avoiding joint limits of a robot arm. This strategy is based on defining three functions for each joint: an activation function; an adaptive gain function; and a tuning function. These functions allow determining automatically the required sign and the suitable magnitude for the avoidance process at each joint. The problem of adding an additional task with the main task and the avoidance process is also considered and solved. As for the redundancy framework, a new large projection operator based on the norm of the usual error is used to enlarge the redundancy domain for applying our proposed avoidance strategy. The experimental results obtained on a 6 dof robot arm in eye-in hand visual servoing show that the new avoidance strategy gives smooth joint avoidance behavior without any tuning step. Using the new projection operator allows a significant improvement of the joint avoidance process, especially in the case of a full rank task function.",

The noise model is represented by three parameters of feature points as input: (I) The number of inliers among feature points, (II) Average of distances between feature points, (III) Variance of interior angles. The correlation between these parameters and estimation error is also described. To approximate the complicate noise model accurately, our technique adopts Hybrid neural Fuzzy Inference System (HyFIS) for a learning engine. The noise model is created with HyFIS beforehand, and then the error of visual odometry is estimated by the noise model and compensated on the fly. Learning results of the noise model and results of 6DOF localization in untextured and dynamic environments are presented, effectiveness of our technique is shown.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel way to learn sampling distributions for sampling-based motion planners by making use of expert data. We learn an estimate (in a non-parametric setting) of sample densities around semantic regions of interest, and incorporate these learned distributions into a sampling-based planner to produce natural plans. Our motivation is that certain aspects of the workspace have a local influence on planning strategies, which is dependent both on where, and what, they are. In the event that learning the density estimate of the training data is impractical in the original feature space, we utilize a non-linear dimensionality-reduction technique and perform density estimation on a lower-dimensional embedding. Samples are then lifted from this embedded density into the original feature space, producing samples that still well approximate the original distribution. A goal of this work is to learn how various features in the environment influence the behavior of experts - for example, how pedestrian crossings, traffic signals and so on affect drivers. We show that learning sampling distributions from expert trajectory data around these semantic regions leads to more natural paths that are measurably closer to those of an expert. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique in various scenarios for a virtual car-like robotic vehicle and a simple manipulator, contrasting the differences in planned trajectories of the semantically-biased distributions with conventional techniques.",

The device consists of an optical sensor designed for a computer mouse and dual laser light sources for generating a laser speckle pattern. It detects the motion of a moving surface at a large distance from the surface, from 80 mm to 300 mm, by tracking the laser speckle pattern. The use of dual laser light sources makes the tracking robust for both large distances from the ground and different surface materials. Some fundamental experiments validated the performance of the device, which tracked surfaces of different materials with high accuracy under various height conditions. Finally, the device was mounted on our mobile robot, and simple experiments were conducted on a slippery sandy terrain to evaluate the usefulness of the device as a noncontact odometry system.",

It is dexterous in that it is fully nonlinear, can explicitly incorporate discontinuities in the motion planning i.e., finger gaiting, and allows rolling finger contacts. The sensing and fuzzy controller are intended to provide robustness that is necessary for real-world manipulation tasks that are characterized by modeling errors and are subjected to unmodeled external disturbances.

However, when picking up objects of unknown lengths, orientations and gripping points, the overall kinematics of a robot in the teleoperation system becomes uncertain. Therefore, new controllers are required that can guarantee the stability and motion tracking performance of the system in the presence of both dynamic and kinematic uncertainties in the master and the slave robots. In this paper, first the uncertain dynamics of the human operator and the environment are incorporated into the dynamics of the master and the slave, respectively. Then, for a teleoperation system with uncertain dynamics and kinematics, nonlinear adaptive controllers are designed for both the master and the slave. The controllers do not need exact knowledge of the dynamics of the master, the slave, the operator, or the environment, or of the kinematics of the master or the slave. The stability and position tracking convergence of the entire teleoperation system are studied. The validity of the theoretical results is verified by simulations.",

The feedforward control is based on a helicopter model that is derived using a number of carefully chosen simplifications to make it suitable for the purpose. The model is inverted for the calculation of rotor collective and cyclic pitch angles given the wind disturbance. The control strategy is then applied on a small helicopter in a controlled wind environment and the effectiveness and advantage of the feedforward controller is demonstrated through flight tests.",

It is a one-leg planar hopping robot which imitates the mode of displacement of kangaroos. Lagrangian dynamic model of the hopping robot is computed on the different phases of the jumping cycle. A new control scheme is proposed to control the leg thrust during stance phase for planar hopping. A nonlinear model predictive control has been combined with Raibert's approach which has improved significantly its performances. A simulator has been developed to simulate the behavior of the controlled robot. The proposed control approach is validated in simulation and is compared with Raibert's approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach to surface fitting for the creation of a 3D surface map for use by a small articulated wall-climbing robot. Both a laser range finder and a low-resolution camera are used to acquire data in a sparse manner. By scanning at large intervals, such as every 5\u201310\u00b0, and then fusing the data, it is shown that it is possible to fit planar surfaces at an accuracy comparable to dense range scanning. Infinite planes are fit to lines extracted from the range scans and then the image corners and lines are used to provide polygon boundaries on these planes. This method is faster and more flexible, both in acquiring data and in computing the planar features and less memory is required. This method also works well in feature poor environments where stereo vision can struggle and does not need to process the feature correspondences in the typical fashion which also saves time. This surface fitting approach is demonstrated using a real data set and results show promise in providing quick yet accurate 3D planar surfaces which could be integrated into SLAM and motion planning frameworks.",

The aim of the type of Fisher matrix discussed is the experiment design for parameter estimation of nonlinear state space models. A definition for the sampling of experiments is stated, which is convenient for software implementation. Both, measurement samples that belong to a coherent sequence and samples from independent experiments, may be stored together in one single data structure. Since the covariance matrix of the prediction error is required in the Fisher matrix, a method for its a-priori prediction is proposed. A servo-hydraulic positioning system serves as a validation example. The comparison of the a-priori and a-posteriori Fisher matrices of this example show that the method proposed is suitable to provide an approximation of an optimality criterion for experiment design.",

Navigation summaries are a specialization of video summaries, where the focus is on video collected by a mobile robot, on a specified trajectory. We are interested in finding a few images that epitomize the visual experience of a robot as it traverses a terrain. This paper presents a novel approach to generating summaries in form of a set of images, where the decision to include the image in the summary set is made online. Our focus is on the case where the number of observations is infinite or unknown, but the size of the desired summary is known. Our strategy is to consider the images in the summary set as the prior hypothesis of the appearance of the world, and then use Set Theoretic Surprise to compute the novelty of an observed image. If the novelty is above a threshold, then we accept the image. We discuss different criterion for setting this threshold. Online nature of our approach allows for several interesting applications such as coral reef inspection, surveying, and surveillance.",

The OpenRobots Ontology (ORO) kernel allows to turn previously acquired symbols into concepts linked to each other. It enables in turn reasoning and the implementation of other advanced cognitive functions like events, categorization, memory management and reasoning on parallel cognitive models.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the Object Interaction Language (OIL) that allows programming and coordination of distributed, heterogeneous sensor-actuator networks, such as sensor networks and multi-robot systems. OIL is an interpreted, object oriented language and is contained in an OIL environment. An OIL environment provides communication between agents and allows agents to exchange code snippets among each other. Possible implementations of OIL environments can be \u2014 in the simplest case \u2014 a sheet of paper with OIL code literally printed on it, or a computational agent endowed with sensors, actuators and wireless communication. The atomic primitive in OIL is the intent for which implementation is resolved during runtime, potentially using code from other OIL environments and leading to distributed execution. We develop the structure of the language and demonstrate its key properties using a distributed computation task that is parallelized via an OIL environment. We evaluate the algorithm empirically by running OIL code on a team of six computational agents that communicate wirelessly. We then show experimentally how OIL can be used to allocate sensing and mobility in a multi-robot system using a case study in navigation, where one robot dynamically provides laser range data to another robot which is blind to its environment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel object concept model, which encodes the relationship among appearance, functions and usage, is proposed. The essential attribute of an object (artifact) is its function that achieves a particular purpose. Therefore, the function model is constructed through observations from a camera at first. The function is defined as changes in the work object before and after tool use. At the same time, the usage model is constructed from observations of the hand shape, grasping parts, and contact points of the tool. And then, the proposed system learns the object concept that is based on the relationship among appearance, and learnt function and usage models. The object appearance is represented by SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform). Since the proposed models are based on the graphical model, it is possible for the system to stochastically infer unobservable information from observed one. For example, the system can infer usage and/or functions of the tool visually through the proposed model. Some experimental results using the system, in which the proposed model is implemented, are shown to validate the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "One of the major challenges in developing autonomous systems is to make them able to recognize and categorize objects robustly. However, the appearance-based algorithms that are widely employed for robot perception do not explore the functionality of objects, described in terms of their affordances. These affordances (e.g., manipulation, grasping) are discriminative for object categories and are important cues for reliable robot performance in everyday environments. In this paper, we propose a strategy for object recognition that integrates both visual appearance and grasp affordance features. Following previous work, we hypothesize that additional grasp information improves object recognition, even if we reconstruct the grasp modality from visual features using a mapping function. We considered two different representations for the grasp modality: (1) motor information of the hand posture while grasping and (2) a more general grasp affordance descriptor. Using a multi-modal classifier we show that having real grasp information significantly boost object recognition. This improvement is preserved, although to a lesser extent, if the grasp modality is reconstructed using the mapping function.",

Not only geometric information such as free space shape but also semantic information such as object names are sometimes important. We call such a map making environment information summarization because how to summarize may change depending on the purpose of the map and the context. One important aspect of such summarization is the deadline, which imposes a time constraint on the robot's mapping activity. We therefore develop an observation planning method for the summarization with deadlines. The method can cope with various types of deadlines specified in the form of loss function. Experimental results shows various robot behaviors are generated by only changing the deadline specification.",

In this contribution we present a CPG design based on coupled oscillators, generating the required stepping movements of a limb for omnidirectional motion. Movements are online modulated through small value changes in the CPG's parameters as required to perform the desired omnidirectional locomotion in a quadruped robot. We also present a methodology to modulate the CPG's parameters, reducing the control dimensionality, described in terms of the robot's translational speed, angular velocity and walking orientation. Results show the proposed controller is well suited for the online generation and modulation of the motor patterns required to achieve the desired omnidirectional walking motion.",

        "abstract": "Force guided assembly is attractive but the implementation is challenging when uncertainties are present. In these cases, contact models that guide the assembly process are attractive. This article elaborates the usage of static contact models, which map displacements to force-torque vectors of particular contact situations (force-torque map). This model, a map of discrete points, contains force and torque values that correspond to position errors. The inversion of this map, using forces and torques measured from an assembly attempt, yields correction movements in order to accomplish the assembly iteratively. A hypothesis stating the dependency of the model's quality on its injectivity is investigated. This aspect is studied thoroughly in so-called redundancy maps, which reveal regions of considerable ambiguity of the model. Experimental results are presented, which validate the hypothesis about the dependency of the convergence of the assembly process on the ambiguity of the initial position. In addition to the peg-in-hole problem, which has become a standard scenario to validate force guided assembly, the scope of this article also covers force guided assembly of more complex parts. Here, the analysis gives evidence to believe that it is unlikely that the implementation convergences acceptably, which is validated by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "The theory of stochastic observability is vital in describing the performance of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) as a nonlinear stochastic state estimation problem quantifying effects of random noise on its observability. We show that the eigen space corresponding to the stochastically unobservable states of the state error covariance matrix of the SLAM problem initialized with unknown initial conditions are in the null space of the information matrix associated with observations of the SLAM problem. We establish by using theoretical analysis and examples that the stochastically unobservable directions of the SLAM state space can be changed by modifying the observation model of the SLAM problem. We then use simulations and experiments to show that stochastically observable directions of state space and their degree of stochastic observability can be modified as required in a particular application (such as surveying, mapping and surveillance) by changing the vehicle path with respect to the landmarks in the environment by selecting which landmarks to observe and by modifying the observation model.",

Due to the fact that (in general) such regions are not unique, the computation methods used usually reflect the envisioned application and/or underlying assumptions made. This paper introduces a parallelizable algorithm for the efficient computation of independent contact regions, under the assumption that a user input in the form of initial guess for the grasping points is readily available. The proposed approach works on discretized 3D-objects with any number of contacts and can be used with any of the following models: frictionless point contact, point contact with friction and soft finger contact. An example of the computation of independent contact regions comprising a non-trivial task wrench space is given.",

Easy algorithms for the n-dimensional continuous and discrete cases are presented. The applicability to non-linear systems is also pointed out.

However, in methods such as on-line sinusoidal regression, synchronization between the measured signal and the physical vibrational phenomenon is critical to properly damp vibrations. This paper comes back on the capture delay estimation as done in previous works and highlights the limitations of such a method. Then a new method using a synchronization sensor is proposed. Based on a cross-correlation technique, a novel algorithm for effective time delay estimation is derived. Experimental validation demonstrates that this method yields improved delay estimation which could be beneficial to the vibration damping.",

        "abstract": "This paper represents the method to manipulate the objects with the upper body of a humanoid robot by capturing human motions in real-time. To control the upper body of a humanoid robot and make it behave as a human does, we define several virtual spring-damper elements between the humanoid robot and the human. The resultant motions given by the virtual forces of the elements lead the humanoid robot to move as the human acts. We employ the forward dynamics formulation to represent the dynamics model of humanoid upper body as an articulated body system with those virtual spring-damper elements for obtaining the resultant motions. Due to considering the whole dynamics of upper body, it is easy to resolve the ill-posedness or singularity of inverse kinematics problem and to involve external forces. The present method may be of use in teaching a humanoid robot working skills or detailed motions of a human. For validating the proposed method, we transited human motions to a humanoid robot using a motion capture system and controlled the robot to grasp an object passed by a person simultaneously.",

Particularly, we define three types of human gestures for object learning by the size of target objects; holding small objects, pointing at medium ones and contacting two corners of large ones. The regions of interest where objects are likely to be located are interpreted from those gestures and represented as rectangles in captured images. For object segmentation, we suggest a marker-based watershed segmentation method which segregates an object within a region of interest in real-time performance. Experimental results show that the segmentation quality of our method is as good as that of the GrabCut algorithm, but the computational time of ours is so much faster that it is appropriate for practical applications.",

Like in the case of conventional DUKF the proposed algorithm demonstrates quick convergence of the parameter vector. In addition, experimental results indicate an increased performance when the proposed methodology is utilized. The applicability and performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified by combining the proposed DUKF with a non-linear controller on a modified Videoray ROV in a test tank. The on-line estimation of the vehicle states and dynamic parameters is achieved by fusing data from a Laser Vision System (LVS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).",

        "abstract": "The main purpose of robot calibration is the correction of the possible errors in the robot parameters. This paper presents a method for a kinematic calibration of a parallel robot that is equipped with one camera in hand. In order to preserve the mechanical configuration of the robot, the camera is utilized to acquire incremental positions of the end effector from a spherical object that is fixed in the word reference frame. Incremental positions of the end effector are related to incremental positions of encoders of the motors of the robot. A kinematic model of the robot is modified in order to take into account possible errors of kinematic parameters. The solution of the model utilizes incremental positions of the resolvers and end effector, the new parameters minimizes errors in the kinematic equations. Spherical properties and intrinsic camera parameters are utilized to model sphere projection in order to improve spatial measurements. The robot system is designed to carry out tracking tasks and the calibration of the system is finally validated by means of integrating the errors of the visual controller.",

In addition, due to the shape of a humanoid, it is expected to have motions like a human. In order to overcome its operational difficulties and to provide a humanlike motion, a teleoperation with the motion imitation is studied in this paper. Specifically, a framework for online generation of a footprint from a human walking motion is proposed. The human walking motions acquired from a motion capture device are parameterized and normalized to give a human independent foot motion. The normalized parameters are restored by a humanoid considering its hardware limit. The restored footprints generate a walking trajectory of a humanoid, which imitates the human walking motion in terms of the footprint. Experiments are conducted with MAHRU-R, a humanoid robot developed in KIST.",

By introducing planning and execution threads running in parallel, the robot can keep moving even during the replanning process as long as the motion is safe. The proposed method can be applied to discontinuous input of environmental changes that may occur due to incomplete perception. We then address a roadmap reuse method for efficient replanning to make use of the increasing knowledge about the environment, by introducing working and learning roadmaps. A general interface with robot motion controller is also defined so that the method can be applied to various types of robots. The proposed method is validated through planning simulations with moving obstacles.",

The proposed trajectory planner can be fully executed online by the robot control system, thanks to its inherently discrete-time behavior and to its limited computational requirement. The outputs of the nonlinear filter used as a trajectory planner include the derivatives of the desired position in the cartesian plane up to the third order. This allows the implementation of feedback linearization control schemes that can transform the dynamics of a mobile robot in a double chain of three integrators, exploiting the highest derivative of the filter's output as a feedforward action. Finally, the paper reports experimental results obtained by the full implementation of the proposed trajectory planning and control scheme on a real unicycle-like robot.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach that simultaneously estimates the kinematic model of an articulated object based on the trajectory described by the robot's end effector, and uses this model to predict the future trajectory of the end effector. One advantage of our approach is that the robot can directly use these predictions to generate an equilibrium point control path for operating the mechanism. Additionally, our approach can improve these predictions based on previously learned articulation models. We have implemented and tested our approach on a real mobile manipulator. Through 40 trials, we show that the robot can reliably open various household objects, including cabinet doors, sliding doors, office drawers, and a dishwasher. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using the information from previous interactions as a prior significantly improves the prediction accuracy.",

Based on Dubins strategy two types of solution approaches will be discussed, the first is a numerical technique which is computationally intensive and the second is based on 3D geometry from which we will derive an analytical solution. In the second approach, the computational time is very low and the strategy can be implemented for real-time path planning problems. Unlike the existing iterative methods which yield suboptimal paths and are computationally more intensive, this geometrical method generates an optimal path in lesser time. Due to its simplicity and low computational requirements this approach can be implemented on fixed wing aerial vehicles with constrained turn radius.",

The motion of the robot in the environment is modeled as a weighted transition system. The mission is specified by a general linear temporal logic formula. In addition, we require that an optimizing proposition must be repeatedly satisfied. The cost function that we seek to minimize is the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. For every environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robot trajectory which minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated by robotic monitoring and data gathering. In this setting, the optimizing proposition is satisfied at locations where data can be uploaded, and the formula specifies a an infinite horizon data collection mission. Our method utilizes B\u00fcchi automata to produce an automaton (which can be thought of as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporal logic formula. We then present a graph algorithm which computes a path corresponding to the optimal robot trajectory. We also present an implementation for a robot performing a data gathering mission.",

        "abstract": "In range-based localization, the trajectory of a mobile object is estimated based on noisy range measurements between the object and known landmarks. In order to deal with this uncertain information, a Bayesian state estimator is presented, which exploits optimal stochastic linearization. Compared to standard state estimators like the Extended or Unscented Kalman Filter, where a point-based Gaussian approximation is used, the proposed approach considers the entire Gaussian density for linearization. By employing the common assumption that the state and measurements are jointly Gaussian, the linearization can be calculated in closed form and thus analytic expressions for the range-based localization problem can be derived.",

        "abstract": "Information about a user and his intentions can be gained evaluating images acquired from the user's subjective perspective. A possibility to yield high quality images, even under dynamic conditions, is to align a camera with the human gaze direction. Thus, the camera orientation system must cope with the high dynamic human eye movements. Since the system is intended to be head-mounted it must keep small and light. In this paper a spherical parallel manipulator with three degrees-of-freedom is introduced. Beside the kinematic the dynamic model is derived. Furthermore the workspace/package ratio is optimized. To estimate the needed actuator forces and velocities, kinematic and dynamic simulations are carried out. Simulations and measurements obtained with a prototype are presented. Both, simulations and measurements, demonstrate that the device meets the requirements.",

This paper presents an optimization scheme to generate impact motions for humanoid robots. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that impulsive force exerted on a target by a humanoid robot's whole body is maximized while guaranteeing the stability. A punching motion is generated by the scheme as an example and evaluated by performing simulations.",

Very few groups have explored designs with spherical morphology. During the past ten years, the number of robots with spherical shape and related studies has substantially increased, and a lot of work is done in this area of mobile robotics. Interest in robots with spherical morphology has also increased, in part due to NASA's search for an alternative design for a Mars rover since the wheel-based rover Spirit is now stuck for good in soft soil. This paper presents the spherical amphibious robot Groundbot, developed by Rotundus AB in Stockholm, Sweden, and describes in detail the navigation algorithm employed in this system.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a plausible approach for a humanoid robot to define its own body parts based on the correlation of two different sensory signals: vision and proprioception. The high correlation between the motions in vision and proprioception informs the robot that the visually attractive object is related to the motor function of its own body. When the robot finds the highly motor-correlated object during head-arm movements, the visuomotor cues such as the body posture and visual features are stored in a visuomotor memory. Then, developmentally, the robot defines the motor-correlated objects as the own-body parts without prior knowledge on the body appearances and kinematics. It is also adaptable to extended body parts such as a grasped tool. The body movements are generated by stochastic motor babbling. The visuomotor memory biases the babbling to keep the own-body parts in sight. This memory-based bias towards the own-body parts helps the robot explore the large head-arm joint space. The acquired visuomotor memory is also used to anticipate the own-body image from the motor commands in advance of the body movement. The proposed approach was evaluated with two humanoid platforms; iCub and James.",

        "abstract": "The representation of probabilistic graphical model often encodes a network whose size is unboundedly large. Such networks pose particular challenges to inference algorithms, specifically making the task of robot path queries highly inefficient due to poor locality of memory references. Whereas a more predictable, resolution complete method yields a highly compact graph structure that captures much of the signal in distributing the configuration free space. In this paper we demonstrate an efficient data parallel algorithm for mapping the computationally intensive, Reachability Roadmap method on the GPU. For our implementation on the recently introduced NVIDIA's Fermi architecture, we show roadmap construction time under twenty seconds for a closure resolution of 55\u00d755\u00d755 cells. Moving forward, our system is well positioned to address smooth navigation of robots in a dynamically changing 3D virtual environment.",

The resulting corrections are fed back into to the visual odometry system to limit its drift over long sequences. We demonstrate our system on a series videos from challenging indoor environments with moving occluders, visually homogenous regions with few features, scene parts with large changes in lighting and fast camera motion.

        "abstract": "Dynamic maneuvers have been successfully implemented on many prismatic legged robots. Systems with articulated legs of significant relative mass pose more of a challenge in part due to the physics of thrusting with rotating limbs, which results in undesired non-vertical impulses, and in part due to the control problem of synchronizing ankle and knee joints. Presented here is an experimental articulated leg system that simplifies the control of an articulated monopod through the use of a joint-coupling tendon. The ankle is coupled to the thigh with an inelastic tendon, which causes automatic horizontal impulse compensation on liftoff for varying knee thrusts. Using a tendon-coupled ankle, stable sustained hopping is achieved for a fixed-torso monopod with a very simple control strategy, and with minimal hip actuator effort, while hopping in place is achieved for short time periods with a bipedal robot with freely pitching torso.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel navigation and motion planning algorithm for mobile vehicles in rough terrains. The main purpose of the algorithm is to generate feasible trajectories while selecting smoother paths, in the sense of level of roughness, toward the goal position. The purpose is achieved by adapting the passivity-based model predictive control optimization setup (PB/MPC), recently proposed for flat terrains, to the case of an outdoor irregular terrain. The passivity-based concept is used to enhance MPC in order to stabilize the goal position guaranteeing the task completion. The framework which is obtained can exploit any vehicle model in order to carefully take into account the vehicle dynamics and terrain structure as well as the wheel-terrain interaction. The inherited property of the MPC optimization allows to impose any additional constraint into the PB/MPC navigation, such as those needed to prevent vehicle rollover and unnecessary sideslip. The cost function representing the level of roughness along a candidate path is used to select the appropriate terrain areas toward the goal position. The results have been verified by several simulation examples.",

        "abstract": "Planning feasible paths in fully three-dimensional environments is a challenging problem. Application of existing algorithms typically requires the use of limited 3D representations that discard potentially useful information. This article proposes a novel approach to path planning that utilizes a full 3D representation directly: the Three-Dimensional Normal Distributions Transform (3D-NDT). The well known wavefront planner is modified to use 3D-NDT as a basis for map representation and evaluated using both indoor and outdoor data sets. The use of 3D-NDT for path planning is thus demonstrated to be a viable choice with good expressive capabilities.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the theory and the simulation of an improved velocity potential approach for path planning by which a mobile robot avoids standing and/or moving obstacles by using the hydrodynamic potential. This potential function for path planning is feasible for guiding a mobile robot to avoid an arbitrarily moving obstacle and to reach the goal in real time without finding the local maximum or minimum points in all cases. In this theory, there are two problems. One is that a mobile robot accelerates rapidly when it avoids a moving obstacle. The other is that a mobile robot has a discontinuous velocity when it is passing a moving obstacle. An ellipse field, which is obtained by using the conformal transformation, and a correction function, which generates the continuous velocity field, are installed in the previous potential function to cope with the difficulty. As a result, a mobile robot can gradually avoid a moving obstacle from further away, and can be safely guided without rapid acceleration.",

There exist a variety of terrain-assessment algorithms and these methods follow the trend of low-fidelity at low-cost and high-fidelity at high-cost. We present a modular path-planning algorithm that uses a hierarchy of terrain-assessment methods; from low-fidelity to high-fidelity. Using all the available sensor data, the visible terrain is assessed with the low-fidelity, low-cost method. The decision to assess a piece of terrain with the high-fidelity, high-cost method is made considering potential path benefits and the cost of assessment. The result is a lower combined cost of the path and terrain assessment that exploits the capabilities of the robot chassis where prudent. We demonstrate the technique on a large number of simulated path-planning problems using fractal terrain, as well as provide preliminary results from an experimental field test carried out on Devon Island, Canada.",

Therefore, it was possible to run simulations and carry out analyses of the performance of JSEG image segmentation technique through Matlab/Octave platforms, along with the application of customized Back-propagation algorithm and statistical methods as structured heuristics methods in a Simulink environment. Having the aforementioned procedures been done, it was practicable to classify and also characterize the HSV space color segments, not to mention allow the recognition of patterns in which reasonably accurate results were obtained.",

We extend our work by introducing laser reflection intensity as a novel feature for people detection, achieving significant improvement of detection rates. In concrete, we propose a method for calibration of laser intensity data, a method for segment separation using laser intensity, and introduce two new intensity-based features for people detection: the variance of laser intensity and the variance of intensity differences.

        "abstract": "There is ample research on the stabilization of haptic teleoperation systems under communication time delay. Little attention, however, has so far been paid to the usefulness of delayed haptic feedback on task performance. While the usefulness of haptic feedback in no-delay teleoperation has been previously established, this paper investigates whether haptic feedback helps to improve task performance in the presence of delay. We consider peg-in-the-hole insertion, which is a dexterous manipulation task requiring high force levels at certain points during the task execution. Through a user study involving unilateral and bilateral teleoperation experiments under different delays, it is observed that in both unilateral and bilateral teleoperation, the task completion time increases as delay increases. It is also seen that haptic feedback helps reduce the amount and rate of energy transfer to the environment and the occurrence of larger robot/environment interaction forces. However, with the users mindful of minimizing contact forces, haptic feedback causes the task to take more time compared to no haptic feedback regardless of the time delay. Thus, for tasks where low completion times are crucial given a tolerance for larger forces, unilateral feedback may be sufficient.",

Actuators in the assistive system are replaced with powerful ones to supports human hand, wrist and elbow activities with larger force and torque.

In traditional PD structures, the force feedback is simply determined by the position and velocity of the master and the slave manipulators, which may induce large resistance forces to the operator even in free motion. In this paper, a novel PD bilateral controller is proposed to tackle this problem. By incorporating a distance variable in the controller, we show that the appropriate force feedback can be obtained which still guarantees the system stability. To validate the proposed algorithm, an experiment is also carried out on our single degree of freedom teleoperation system. The results indicate that this strategy is effective for safe teleoperation missions.",

The goal of this project is to develop a navigation system that use secondary inertial variables, such as velocity, to enable long-term precise navigation in the absence of Global Positioning System (GPS) and beacon signals. In this scheme, measured zero velocity durations from the ground reaction sensors are used to reset the accumulated integration errors from the accelerometers and gyroscopes in position calculation. We achieved an average position error of 4 meters at the end of half-hour walks.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a grasping system for picking up an indicated object in a complex real-world environment using a parallel jaw gripper. The proposed grasping scheme comprises the following three main steps: (1) A user indicates a target object and provides the system with a task instruction on how to grasp it, (2) the system acquires geometric information about the target object and constructs a 3D environment model around the target by stereo vision using the information obtained from the task instruction, and (3) the system finds a grasp point based on grasp evaluation using the acquired information. As an example of the scheme, we examined the picking up of a cylindrical object by grasping at the brim. An important and advantageous feature of this scheme is that the user can easily instruct the robot on how to perform the object-picking task through simple clicking operations, and the robot can execute the task without exact models of the target object and the environment being available in advance.",

        "abstract": "We present a system for real-time fundamental frequency, i. e. pitch, extraction on a humanoid robot. The system extracts pitch using an 8 channel microphone array mounted on the Honda humanoid robot in a realistic Human-Robot interaction scenario. The main building blocks of the system are a multi-channel signal enhancement followed by robust pitch extraction and tracking. The signal enhancement is based on 8 channel Geometric Source Separation. For the pitch extraction the signal is first transformed with a Gammatone filter bank into the frequency domain. Next a histogram of zero crossing distances is calculated from all filter bank signals. During the calculation of the histogram spurious side peaks resulting from harmonics and sub-harmonics of the true fundamental frequency are inhibited. The resulting histogram then serves as input to a grid based Bayesian tracker which deploys Bayesian filtering in a forward step and Bayesian smoothing in a backward step on a 100ms time window. We demonstrate the performance of the system in a scenario where male and female speakers utter different phrases while standing at a normal interaction distance to the robot. For the evaluation we compare the pitch tracking results once obtained from a clean headset signal and once from the signals obtained from the robot. The results show that the tracking performance only degrades to a small extent in the realistic interaction scenario compared to the headset recordings.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of planar multi-robot realizations of connectivity graphs. A realization is a set of planar positions for a team of robots with a connectivity graph that is identical to an a priori given connectivity graph with the additional constraint that it must be feasible. Feasibility means that that the robots must not be overlapping with each other. As the associated mathematical problem is known to be NP-hard, a stochastic approach based on genetic algorithms is proposed. First, a population set based on randomly generated planar and feasible multi-robot positions is generated. Next, a fitness function that measures the similarity of the graph of each member is constructed. Finally, new reproduction operators that enable the evolution of generations are introduced. An extensive statistical study with different number of robots demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain fairly complicated network topologies.",

Planar surfaces are fitted into the sonar data and the subsequent registration method maximizes the overall geometric consistency within a search-space to determine correspondences between the planes. This approach has previously only been used on high quality range data from sensors on land robots like laser range finders. It is shown here that the algorithm is also applicable to very noisy, coarse sonar data. The 3D map presented is of a large underwater structure, namely the Lesumer Sperrwerk, a flood gate north of the city of Bremen, Germany. It is generated from 18 scans collected using a Tritech Eclipse sonar.",

We consider the situation where the start and goal configurations of the object constrain the robot to grasp the object with one hand, to give it to the other hand, before placing it in its final configuration. To realize such a task, the proposed framework treats the grasp computation, for one or two multi-fingered hands, of an arbitrarily-shaped object, the exchange configuration and finally the motion of the robot arms and body. In order to improve the planner performance, a context-independent grasp list is computed offline for each hand and for the given object as well as computed offline roadmap that will be adapted according to the environment composition. Simulation results show the planner performance on a complex scenario.",

The algebraic constraints of the interconnected systems are represented by a geometric object, called Dirac structure. This provides a powerful way to describe the non-contact to contact transition and contact viscoelasticity, by using the concepts of energy flows and power preserving interconnections. Using the port based model, an Intrinsically Passive Controller (IPC) is used to control the internal forces. Simulation results validate the model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the port-based approach.",

        "abstract": "The Time Domain Passivity Control Approach is gathering interest in the robotics field. Simplicity and flexibility and the fact that system design emerges from ideal cases make it a powerful stability tool for teleoperation systems. Communication time delay is an inherent attribute of nearly every realistic teleoperation system. Unless the communication channel guarantees transmission delays of less than the system sampling time, the delay must be considered in the design in order to guarantee stability and satisfy a desired degree of performance. In previous work it has been shown how passivity can be considered in the time domain and how control rules are derived from it in order to dissipate the energy produced by the delayed communication. However, a weakness of these approaches is the impossibility of observing the exact amount of energy stored in the communication channel due to its delayed nature. A passive estimation is therefore needed which outcomes in an over-dissipation and in turn impacts on transparency. In constrained communications over-dissipation may become apparent in the form of a non-neglectful position drift between master and slave. This paper tackles the over-dissipative behavior of the Passivity Controller by resembling the energetic behavior of an ideal communication, i.e. where no delay is present and the transmission is lossless. Thus, the communication channel is not just controlled to be passive, as has been the case up to now, but also lossless. Energy can be dissipated to prevent activity, but activity can be also produced to prevent dissipative behaviors. The approach is sustained with experimental results.",

The relationships between robots and humans will be conducted at close distances. Predicting people's future positions helps robots understand human behavior and react safely and naturally. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting people's positions in crossing behaviors, i.e. different trajectories people follow when they are crossing each other. We conducted a field experiment to gather various crossing behaviors of pedestrians in a shopping mall environment and analyzed them by focusing on \u201chot areas\u201d spaces where people modify their trajectories for crossing. We clustered typical crossing behaviors in hot areas and modeled them using Hidden Markov Models for predictions. Our algorithm more accurately predicts the future positions of pedestrians by considering moving direction and speed.",

The system is composed of an intelligent cabinet, a floor sensing system and a data management system. The position of an object can be classified into three areas: 1) in/on furniture, 2) on the floor, 3) held by a human or a robot. Being equipped with a RFID reader and loadcells, the intelligent cabinet measures the position of an object in/on itself. The floor sensing system which uses a laser range finder, measures the position of an object on the floor and the position of a human walking in a room. The data management system integrates the position data of the intelligent cabinets and the floor sensing system, and it performs position measurement of an object carried by a human. The data management system provides robots with position information to support robot activities.",

During assist, this new assist unit surely keeps the distance of two rollers, which transfer assist torque to tires. In this paper, first, the assist system, including the proposed assist unit, is explained. Furthermore, by using the prototype of the one hand drive wheelchair, implemented new assist units, the effectiveness of power assist function is confirmed, based on running experiments on the flat ground. In this experiment, we have found the following facts: For the user with enough manipulation ability, the power assist effect is week. On the other hand, for the user with inadequate power, the evident power assist effect is observed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a power assist method for a nonholonomic mobile robot designed to carry out office-oriented services. We developed a new mechanism for obtaining an approximate measurement of the zero moment point (ZMP) using three single-axis force sensors so that a robot pushed from any direction by a human can detect the direction and magnitude of the external force. We also propose impedance control to generate translational and rotational motion in accordance with ZMP displacement. This control method achieves a function whereby a robot that has been given an external force from a direction differing from its translation direction will follow the direction of the external force while rotating. The robot can also return automatically to its initial pose once the external force has been released. We show though experiments that our power assist method is effective in improving the operability and usability of an office-oriented robot.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the application of switching technology to hydraulic actuation. Over the last 50 years with advances in power electronics, faster and faster static switches have been developed and applied to the control of motors. Hydraulic technology evolved in the opposite direction: switching control was not considered, and more and more accurate proportional flow/pressure control devices (servovalves etc) were developed. However despite the sophistication of such valves, from an energetic viewpoint proportional control is dissipative and inefficient. Indeed, by analogy it can be seen as the equivalent of resistive (rheostatic) motor control. In robotic applications where high power density, ruggedness and reliability are key requirements hydraulic actuation can be a sensible choice. However, the low efficiency of proportional control can be a limitation and it is necessary to go beyond the paradigm of proportional flow/pressure control. One response to this challenge is to revisit traditional on-off hydraulic technology and develop \"power hydraulic\" devices that behave in analogous manner to their power electronic counterparts. \"Power hydraulics\" is a challenging and little explored technology due to the markedly non-linear behaviour of hydraulic systems and the need of components with dynamic specifications that are not readily available off-the-shelf. After an analysis of the real on-off characteristics of a valve, a prototype hydraulic switching converter, inspired by the electric DC-DC Buck converter, is presented and its performance in pressure control mode, relative to a classical proportional valve-controlled system, are assessed. An energy saving of 75% is achieved. Merits and limitations of the current design are identified.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses balancing for a hopping humanoid biped against various disturbances. Contrary to other studies, the present work focuses on the practical experiment with a real humanoid biped, HUBO2. Also, hopping is focused on among various types of locomotion since hopping is simple movement but more dynamic rather than walking. Two control strategies are proposed according to the magnitude of the disturbances. The one is the posture balance control for small disturbance, which uses the ankle torque of the stance leg. The other is to use the posture balancing control and the landing position control together for large disturbance. The landing position controller changes the landing position of the swing foot to maintain stability. The closed form solution of the landing position controller is addressed with the simplified model. As this simplification, both controllers are used together since the landing position controller cannot maintain a perfect balance alone. To this end, practical experiments with HUBO2 are conducted. In the experiments, HUBO2 maintains a balance against not only small disturbance but also large disturbance such as pushing through the proposed control strategies.",

        "abstract": "When a robot wants to manipulate an object, it needs to know what action to execute to obtain the desired result. In most of the cases, the actions that can be applied to an object consist of exerting forces to it. If a robot is able to predict what will happen to an object when some force is applied to it, then it's possible to build a controller that solves the inverse problem of what force needs to be applied in order to get a desired result. To accomplish this, the first task is to build an object model and second to get the right parameters for it. The goals of this paper are 1) to demonstrate the use of an object model to predict outcomes of actions, and 2) to adapt this model to an specific object instance for a specific robot.",

This paper proposes the use of a visual sensor which allows the simultaneous analysis of hand and eye motions in order to recognize the reach-to-grasp movement, i.e. to predict the grasping gesture. This solution fuses two viewpoints taken from the user's perspective. First, by using an eye-tracker device attached to the user's head; and second, by utilizing a wearable camera attached to the user's hand. The information from these two viewpoints is used to characterize multiple hand movements in conjunction with eye-gaze movements through a Hidden-Markov Model framework. In various experiments, we show that combining these two sources of information allows the prediction of a reach-to-grasp movement as well as the desired object.",

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is used to separate, manipulate and sense micro particles in several domains, such as in biological or Carbon Nano-Tubes (CNTs) manipulations. This paper tackles the creation of a closed loop strategy in order to control, using DEP, the trajectory of micro objects using vision feedback. A modeling of the dielectrophoresis force is presented to illustrate the non linearity of the system and the high dynamics of the object under dielectrophoresis. A control strategy based on the generalized predictive control method is proposed with the aim of controlling the trajectory, taking advantage of the high dynamics despite the non linearity. Simulated results are shown to evaluate our control strategy.",

This work presents a vision-based \u201cpredictive display\u201d system that compensates for visual delay. The approach is online and relatively uncalibrated, thus it has the advantage of being useful in unknown environments and many applications. From monocular eye-in-hand video, we incrementally compute a 3D graphics model of the robot site in real time using our new technique. The method exploits free-space/occlusion constraints on the scene to produce a physically consistent mesh. Novel vantage points are immediately rendered in response to the operator's control commands, without waiting for delayed video. We implement a full prototype tele-operation system where the operator controls, via a PHANTOM Omni device, a Barrett WAM robot mounted on a mobile Segway. Experiments with this setup validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. We demonstrate significant improvement in task completion time with predictive display on a real robot, while our previous related results were established only in simulation.",

The algorithm is composed of an object surface reconstruction algorithm and a local grasp planner, evolving in parallel. The former uses an elastic reconstruction surface, whose dimensions are assigned initially by a preshaping process, and which shrinks toward the object until some parts of the surface intercept the object visual hull. The latter moves the fingertips on the current available reconstruction surface towards points which are optimal (in a local sense) with respect to a certain number of indices weighting both the grasp quality and the kinematic configuration of the hand. Experiments are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Supermarkets, which are chosen here as an example, pose a challenging scenario because they usually have a cluttered and nested character. The robot has to avoid collisions with static and even with moving obstacles while interacting with nearby humans or a dedicated user respectively. This paper presents a hierarchical approach for the proactive avoidance of moving objects as it is used on the robot shopping trolley InBOT. The behavior-based control (bbc) of InBOT is extended by a reflex and a reactive behavior to ensure adequate reaction times when confronted with a possible collision. On top of the bbc a spatio-temporal planner is situated which is able to predict environmental changes and therefore can generate a safe movement sequence accordingly.",

        "abstract": "One essential capability of service robots lies in the identification and localization of objects in the vicinity of the robot. The extreme computational demands of this high-dimensional state estimation problem require approximations of the joint posterior even for small numbers of objects. A common approach to solve this problem is to marginalize the joint state space and to consider object-related state spaces which are estimated individually under the assumption of statistical independence. In practice, however, this independence assumption is often violated, especially when the objects are located close to each other, which leads to a reduced accuracy of this approximation, compared to the full joint estimation. To address this problem, we propose the new method denoted as Rule Set Joint State Update (RSJSU), which features a better approximation of the joint posterior in the presence of dependencies, and thus leads to better estimation results. We present experimental results in which we simultaneously estimate all six degrees of freedom of multiple objects.",

        "abstract": "Localization of rail vehicles is fundamental for any autonomous systems to perform tasks in logistics or personal transport. This contribution presents a novel onboard localization system, based on an eddy current sensor system (ECS), that is capable of a precise train localization when combined with a simple topological map. In contrary to commonly applied travel distance determination by integrating the estimated velocity, we propose an event triggered counting approach, which makes use of the unique sensor capabilities. Rail switches are chosen as landmarks for a global map association and as reliable start and end points for the counting procedure. They are extracted via a Bayesian filter approach, in particular hidden Markov models are applied for detection and classification. Additional features are modeled in a subsequent step and merged within a topological map employing a na\u00efve Bayesian approach in the spatial domain. This allows for a flexible sensor integration and an easy determination of the most probable vehicle position based on traveled distanced.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a representation of 3D object shape using a probabilistic volumetric map derived from in-hand exploration. The exploratory procedure is based on contour following through the fingertip movements on the object surface. We first consider the simple case of having single hand exploration of a static object. The cumulative pose data provides a 3D point cloud that is quantized to the probabilistic volumetric map. For each voxel we have a probability distribution for the occupancy percentage. This is then extended to in-hand exploration of non-static objects. Since the object is moving during the in-hand exploration, and we also consider the use of the other hand for re-grasping, object pose has to be tracked. By keeping track of object motion we can register data to the initial pose to build a consistent object representation. An object centered representation is implemented using the computed object center of mass to define its frame of reference. Results are presented for in-hand exploration of both static and non-static objects that show that valid models can be obtained. The 3D object probabilistic representation can be used in several applications related with grasp generation tasks.",

Our model is inspired from scientific studies of love in humans and aims to generate a bi-directional love between humans and robots. We refer to this sentimental connection as \u201cLovotics\u201d. We have formulated probabilistic mathematical models for identified factors of love, and aim to provide a clear, distinct and discrete interpretation of the intimacy between humans and robots. Such mathematical models are assembled by a Bayesian Network depicting the relationship between intimacy and the causal factors for love. Furthermore, a novel affective state transition system is proposed which takes into account not only the current state caused by interactions, but also the effects of the previous states and internal factors of the robot. Hence, the robot is capable of acting consistently and naturally. The behavior of the robot is controlled by the above two modules via an Artificial Neural Network to develop a realistic affective communication between a human and a robot.",

This leads to a natural, practical learning process, avoiding extra demonstration centers or kinesthetic teaching. By generating mission models for probabilistic decision making as Partially observable Markov decision processes, the robot is able to deal with uncertain and dynamic environments, as encountered in real world settings during execution.

By taken the advantage of coupling linkage mechanism, each finger with three phalanges could fulfill flexion-extension movement independently. Besides, each finger is equipped with torque and position sensors. Thus, the cosmetics and dexterity are improved remarkably compared to conventional prosthesis. The hardware architecture is divided into control system and EMG signal processing system. Moreover, a novel two-stage decision strategy combing the position-based impedance control scheme is implemented to realize the real-time sEMG control of the hand. According to the grasp experiment results, the hand can accomplish several grasp modes stably; the success rate of 10 modes is up to 90%.",

The purpose of adding the function F is to modify/adjust the inverted pendulum dynamics in such a way that disturbance caused by un-modeled dynamics (legs, arms, etc.) can be compensated or minimized. By changing the key parameters of the augmented function we can easily modify the inverted pendulum dynamics. The desired walking motion with maximized stability margin is achieved by optimizing the key parameters using genetic algorithm. The disturbance created by the un-modeled dynamics is minimized because full robot dynamics is considered in the optimization process. Simulations results show that the walking gait obtained using the proposed method is more stable than that obtained using the Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (LIPM).",

        "abstract": "Skill or motion transfer from someone to other persons is always required for dance teaching, rehabilitation, sports and so on. For teaching or transfer of motion, a dance notation and display of sequence of motion are often used effectively. However, these contain only the instantaneous postures of motion or professional subjective sense, it is not easy for beginners to understand the dynamical knack of motion. In this paper, we propose \u201cpseudo-reference\u201d that is a virtual target posture in the human motion. The pseudo-reference is developed based on the modeling of the human motion by the attractor design method which realizes an autonomous system. By comparing the nonlinear controller with conventional control systems (1DOF and 2DOF control system), the pseudo-reference is obtained as an embodiment of the implicit reference. The proposed method is performed with the inverted pendulum system and the tap dancing robot, and the validity and feasibility for motion transfer of the pseudo-reference are evaluated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an approach for a pursuit-evasion problem that considers a 2.5d environment represented by a height map. Such a representation is particularly suitable for large-scale outdoor pursuit-evasion, captures some aspects of 3d visibility and can include target heights. In our approach we construct a graph representation of the environment by sampling strategic locations and computing their detection sets, an extended notion of visibility. From the graph we compute strategies using previous work on graph-searching. These strategies are used to coordinate the robot team and to generate paths for all robots using an appropriate classification of the terrain. In experiments we investigate the performance of our approach and provide examples including a sample map with multiple loops and elevation plateaus and two realistic maps, a village and a mountain range. To the best of our knowledge the presented approach is the first viable solution to 2.5d pursuit-evasion with height maps.",

While significant progress has been made in robotic grasping of objects and geometric path planning for manipulation, such work treats the world and the object being grasped as immovable, often declaring failure when simple motions of the object could produce success. We analyze the mechanics of push-grasping and present a quasi-static tool that can be used both for analysis and simulation. We utilize this analysis to derive a fast, feasible motion planning algorithm that produces stable pushgrasp plans for dexterous hands in the presence of object pose uncertainty and high clutter. We demonstrate our algorithm extensively in simulation and on HERB, a personal robotics platform developed at Intel Labs Pittsburgh.",

The proposed method is achieved by the use of a system that integrates a robotic component and a numerical simulation component. The robotic component is used to measure the contact force and displacement at each point on the human body contacted by a robotic probe. The numerical simulation component identifies the material parameters using the proposed method, where two data sources are used, namely, (1) the measured data from the robotic part, and (2) simulated deformation data obtained by the finite element method. In order to validate the proposed system, we report initial results from several phantom tissue experiments, which demonstrate the ability of the system to quantitatively determine the elastic moduli of tissues. We also discuss several potential challenges in the future of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots are a subset of continuum robots constructed by combining pre-curved elastic tubes. As the tubes are rotated and translated with respect to each other, their curvatures interact elastically, enabling control of the robot's tip configuration as well as the curvature along its length. This technology is projected to be useful in many types of minimally invasive medical procedures. Because these robots are flexible by design, they deflect considerably when applying forces to the external environment. Thus, in contrast to rigid-link robots, their kinematic and static force models are coupled. This paper derives a multi-tube quasistatic model that relates tube rotations and translations together with externally applied loads to robot shape and tip configuration. The model can be applied in robot design, procedure planning as well as control. For validation, the multi-tube model is compared experimentally to a computationally-efficient single-tube approximate model.",

In that case, the proper tuning of parameters of DE is essential. We experiment sensor deployment in two maps for providing guidance about parameter tuning. The experimental results show better sensor deployment result according to guided parameter setting. The full coverage optimization strategy also shows proper result using guided parameters from the standard DE case.",

The data of range sensors are processed as localization methods to eliminate the external error which encoder odometry cannot be detected. Two concepts about localization method fusion and error elimination architecture are proposed. The first one combines results of localization methods and determines the best results based on the performance of localization methods in different scenarios. The second one contains the former and makes the posture information more reliable. In addition, the methods could correct the encoder odometry with the knowledge of skidding and slipping.",

        "abstract": "Reader antennas' configuration for two wheeled robots were evaluated to estimate their posture from floor-installed RFID tags. RFID systems where IC tags are installed under/on floors have widely been utilized in recent years as the next positioning infrastructure. The reader antennas should be properly placed on a robot so that such an environment can give full play to its potential capabilities of positioning the robot. This problem calls for guidelines in designing the configuration of reader antennas. Experiments using actual robots cannot offer sufficient data because of time and physical limitations, which prevent helpful and reproducible evaluations. We overcame this problem by constructing a simulation environment using a localization model and by evaluating the effects of configurations on positioning accuracy using computations. Of particular note, we found a \u201cforward-backward configuration effect\u201d from the results and had a detailed a discussion on how it occurred. Finally, a simple experiment using an actual robot validated the effect.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel 3D measurement system, which yields both depth and color information in real time, by calibrating a time-of-flight and two CCD cameras. The problem of occlusions is solved by the proposed fast occluded-pixel detection algorithm. Since the system uses two CCD cameras, missing color information of occluded pixels is covered by one another. We also propose a robust object recognition using the 3D visual sensor. Multiple cues, such as color, texture and 3D (depth) information, are integrated in order to recognize various types of objects under varying lighting conditions. We have implemented the system on our autonomous robot and made the robot do recognition tasks (object learning, detection, and recognition) in various environments. The results revealed that the proposed recognition system provides far better performance than the previous system that is based only on color and texture information.",

A multi-section trunk/tentacle robot is such a continuum manipulator. With a continuum robot, manipulation means a continuous whole-arm motion, often without a clear distinction between transport and grasping. In this paper, we address the novel problem of real-time motion planning for such a robot under uncertain conditions. We present an algorithm for on-line planning the motion of a planar continuum robot for grasping a target object amid an environment of other objects with uncertain movements. Our algorithm substantially extends the RAMP paradigm [19] for real-time adaptive motion planning to this new form of whole-arm manipulation. Simulation results are promising, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

The implementation of this system into an online setting involves short-term energy calculation, detection, segmentation and subsequent signal classification, all of which had to be reformulated based on previous off-line testing. This has included the formulation of a new classification and feature extraction method. This scheme utilises the discrete cosine transform to extract the frequency features from the time domain information, a univariate Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier and a two phase cross-validation procedure for feature selection and extraction. The performance of this classifier is presented alongside a real-time implementation of the decision fusion classification algorithm, with each achieving 96.28% and 93.12% respectively. The system testing takes into consideration potential segmentation of false positive signals. A simulation mapping commands to a planar wheelchair demonstrates the capacity of the system for assistive robotic control. These are the first real-time results published for a tongue-based human-machine interface that does not require a transducer to be placed within the vicinity of the oral cavity.",

Existing studies perform the computation entirely on robot processors or on dedicated servers. The robot processors are limited by their computation capability; real-time performance may not be achieved. Even though servers can perform tasks faster, the communication time between robots and servers is affected by variations in wireless bandwidths. In this paper, we present a system for realtime moving object recognition and tracking using computation offloading. Offloading migrates computation to servers to reduce the computation time on the robots. However, the migration consumes additional time, referred as communication time in this paper. The communication time is dependent on data size exchanged and the available wireless bandwidth. We estimate the computation and communication needed for the tasks and choose to execute them on robot processors or servers to minimize the total execution time, in order to satisfy real-time constraints.",

A fast planner is necessary to enable the robot to react to quickly changing human environments.

With this system, the operator feels sense of touch as if tracing the surface of an object. We use a high-speed projector-camera system to achieve high-speed measurement of the object surface so that high-frequency haptic feedback is maintained at a haptic device PHANToM. An actively directed structured light is projected so that the projected slit ray intersects with the haptic interaction point, which is determined by the stylus position of the haptic device. A camera image of this scene gives the positional relationship between the object surface and the haptic interaction point. We use this relationship to generate force feedback such that the haptic interaction point is pushed back to a point on the intersection of the slit ray and the object surface. Experimental results show that the proposed system displays an object shape correctly and that the high-speed measurement contributes to displaying smooth motion of an moving object.",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive and training simulators that provide realistic visual and haptic feedback during cell indentation tasks are currently investigated. Complex cell geometry inherent to biological cells and intricate mechanical properties drive the need for precise mechanical and numerical modeling to assure accurate cell deformation and force calculations. Advances in alternative finite element formulation, such as mass-tensor approach, have reached the state where they are applicable to model soft cell deformation in real time. The geometrical characteristics and the mechanical properties for different cells are determined with AFM indentation. A real-time, haptics-enabled simulator for cell centered indentation has been developed which utilizes the atomic force microscopy data (mechanical and geometrical properties of embryonic stem cells (mESC)) to accurately replicate the indentation task and predict the cell deformation during indentation in real-time. This tool can be used as a mechanical marker to characterize the biological state of the cell. The operator is able to feel in real-time the change in the stiffness during cell deformation between fixed and live cells. A comparison study with finite element simulations using a commercial software and the experimental data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physically-based model.",

By combining this reality with expertise from the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges in building autonomous driving platforms, we were able to design and develop an Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) system on a 2006 Volkwagen Passat Wagon TDI using automotive grade sensors. AVP provides the driver with both convenience and safety benefits-the driver can leave the vehicle at the entrance of a parking garage, allowing the vehicle to navigate the structure, find a spot, and park itself. By leveraging existing software modules from the DARPA Urban Challenge, our efforts focused on developing a parking spot detector, a localization system that did not use GPS, and a back-in parking planner. This paper focuses on describing the design and development of the last two modules.",

The robust identification of the user is especially important in the context of people tracking when there are frequent occlusions. In this paper we present a novel approach for recognizing the user of a mobile robot. Our approach assumes that the user wears a mobile footstep sensor whose data are fused with footstep data extracted from leg movements of people. It relies on a recursive Bayesian estimation scheme to calculate a posterior about the potential associations between the different footstep perceptions. Our approach has been implemented and tested on real data. In simulated experiments, in which we use ground truth leg movement data recorded with a motion capture suite, and with a real robot we demonstrate the robustness of our method even when multiple people are present.",

        "abstract": "Statically and dynamically reconfigurable robot mechanisms have been extensively studied by a number of researchers. Control formulations have been proposed for specific mechanisms and some researchers have tried to build unified frameworks for general robot control. This paper reports an extension of the differential drive mechanism that we call the Heterogeneous Differential Drive. Bridging the gap between differential drive mechanisms and skid-steered mechanisms, the heterogeneous differential drive permits the modular combination of different types of actuators with different capabilities under one unified framework. It is a step toward a unified framework for actuators we call Heterogeneous Drive Mechanisms that permits reconfigurable mechanisms with homogeneous or heterogeneous components. The heterogeneous differential drive is a theoretical class of vehicles that lies in the gray area between pure differential drive vehicles and pure skid steered vehicles, yet represents either at the extremes. The heterogeneous differential drive also provides the basis for our preliminary development of the heterogeneous drive. This paper develops the kinematic model of the heterogeneous differential drive from the kinematic model of the differential drive formulation and describes an example mechanism.",

From the system input point of view, the external force and system acceleration cannot be distinguished from each other. Thus, the best solution is to handle those quantities together. DEFIC is motivated from this observation. The external disturbance robustness and the plant/model mismatch compensation of DEFIC are explained based on the passivity-based control and Disturbance OBserver(DOB). Furthermore, it is illustrated how DEFIC can be extended to n-DOF manipulator control. The performance of DEFIC is verified with simulations, and the conclusion is followed directly.",

Estimating a relative posture between an object and a camera is an important task in these fields Visual markers are frequently used to estimate a relative posture between an object and a camera, but the usage of visual markers spoils a scene. In this paper, we propose a novel method for posture estimation by using kernel regressions and high frequency markers that do not spoil a scene. The markers are embedded in an object's texture in the high frequency domain and it is hard for people to notice the markers. We observe changes of spatial frequency of object's texture by using a high-definition camera to estimate the current posture of an object. We show the effectiveness of our method by experimental results with both simulated and real data.",

In contrast, our work predicts the impact on reliability on robotic missions. In our previous work, we presented a quantitative analysis to predict the probability of robot failure during a mission and use this to compare the performance of different robot team configurations. In order to comprehensively characterize robot failure, we proposed a taxonomy system which divides planetary robotic missions into three classes and showed how the taxonomy can be used as a framework to explore the reliability characteristics of each mission class. In this paper, we define and simulate common mission scenarios for each class in the taxonomy system and attempt to extract general reliability trends and mission characteristics for given robot and environment parameters. Our results show that, for comparable mission scopes with a fixed budget, exploration-type missions have maximum mission success probability for smaller team sizes than is the case for construction-type missions.",

In general, only an imprecise description of the heart dynamics and measurement systems is available. This means that the estimation of heart motion is corrupted by stochastic and systematic uncertainties. Without consideration of these uncertainties, the obtained results will be inaccurate and a safe robotic operation cannot be guaranteed. Until now, existing approaches for estimating the motion of the heart surface are either deterministic or treat only stochastic uncertainties. The proposed method extends the heart motion estimation to the simultaneous consideration of stochastic and unknown but bounded systematic uncertainties. It computes dynamic bounds in order to provide the surgeon with a guidance by constraining the motion of the surgical instruments and thereby protecting sensitive tissue.",

        "abstract": "We study two important problems in the area of robot grasping: i) the methodology and representations for grasp selection on known and unknown objects, and ii) learning from experience for grasping of similar objects. The core part of the paper is the study of different representations necessary for implementing grasping tasks on objects of different complexity. We show how to select a grasp satisfying force-closure, taking into account the parameters of the robot hand and collision-free paths. Our implementation takes also into account efficient computation at different levels of the system regarding representation, description and grasp hypotheses generation.",

The robots and tasks are characterized by resources as required by task execution. The robots are required to generate optimal solutions for the MRTA problem while forming coalitions to meet the resource constraints imposed by tasks. A leader-follower based coalition methodology is developed, with detailed discussions on leader selection, coalition forming and refinement algorithms. It is shown that the resource constrained task allocation problem can be well resolved by the proposed leader-follower coalition algorithms. Simulations performed on a mobile robot group demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In the proposed approach, an object lies on a flat background, and the goal of the robot is to interact with and classify each object so that it can be studied further. The algorithm considers each object to be classified using color, shape, and flexibility. Experiments on a number of different objects demonstrate the ability of efficiently classifying and labeling each item through interaction.",

Our goal is to build an on-line Behavior Map of surrounding environment. In this case, the road structure becomes important in order to understand entities behavior. From a general view-point, this paper demonstrates two important concepts: 1) the smooth integration of global, absolute but partial information (the Navi Map) in a local and relative map (the Behavior Map). This is demonstrated by the building of the Behavior Map composed of the roads structure and pedestrian/vehicle's position and trajectory. 2) the use of both global and local information to improve the understanding of the environment. This is demonstrated by the proposed \u201cPedestrian Warning System\u201d. From a technical viewpoint, the main contributions are: 1) the dual ground plane/image plane approach which avoid introduction of errors in both the cost function evaluation and the constraints for minimization, 2) the smooth and efficient integration of prior data in a realistic road model computation when they are available.",

        "abstract": "In recent years there was a tremendous progress in robotic systems, and however also increased expectations: A robot should be easy to program and reliable in task execution. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) offers a very promising alternative to classical engineering approaches. LfD is a very natural way for humans to interact with robots and will be an essential part of future service robots. In this work we first review heteroscedastic Gaussian processes and show how these can be used to encode a task. We then introduce a new Gaussian process regression model that clusters the input space into smaller subsets similar to the work in [11]. In the next step we show how these approaches fit into the Learning by Demonstration framework of [2], [3]. At the end we present an experiment on a real robot arm that shows how all these approaches interact.",

The versatile surgical lightweight robot MIRO developed at DLR (German Aerospace Center) is used to detect and mark the path of the IMA at the inner side of the thoracic wall. The robot is equipped with a tool combining a Doppler ultrasonography (US) probe and a medical marker pen. The position of the IMA is extracted from the US-images to place the tool above the artery via visual servoing. Additionally, the robot moves the tool in direction of the artery to mark the location of the IMA on it's path. To achieve an ideal contact situation for US-imaging along the whole path the contact force between tissue and probe is controlled according to force measurements based on the internal torque sensors of the robot. The evaluation of the robotic system by an animal experiment shows that the system is capable of robustly detecting the IMA.",

In this paper, we initially present an overview of the current trends and challenges within the oil and gas industry. This is followed by the latest results from our work towards realizing next generation robotized oil and gas facilities. These activities encompass indoor lab experiments, as well as outdoor demonstrations onsite. The onsite demonstration reported in this paper has been completed together with Shell and comprises the world's first prototype of a robot performing automatic scraper handling in real operational environments.",

We first design a task descriptor which encapsulates important elements of a task. The design originates from observations that manipulations involved in many everyday object tasks can be considered as a series of sequential rotations and translations, which we call manipulation primitives. We then propose a method that enables a robot to decompose a demonstrated task into sequential manipulation primitives and construct a task descriptor. We also show how to transfer a task descriptor learned from one object to similar objects. In the end, we argue that this framework is highly generic. Particularly, it can be used to construct a robot task database that serves as a manipulation knowledge base for a robot to succeed in manipulating everyday objects.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach allowing a robot to acquire new motor skills by learning the couplings across motor control variables. The demonstrated skill is first encoded in a compact form through a modified version of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) which encapsulates correlation information. Expectation-Maximization based Reinforcement Learning is then used to modulate the mixture of dynamical systems initialized from the user's demonstration. The approach is evaluated on a torque-controlled 7 DOFs Barrett WAM robotic arm. Two skill learning experiments are conducted: a reaching task where the robot needs to adapt the learned movement to avoid an obstacle, and a dynamic pancake-flipping task.",

        "abstract": "Musicians often have the following problem: they have a music score that requires 2 or more players, but they have no one with whom to practice. So far, score-playing music robots exist, but they lack adaptive abilities to synchronize with fellow players' tempo variations. In other words, if the human speeds up their play, the robot should also increase its speed. However, computer accompaniment systems allow exactly this kind of adaptive ability. We present a first step towards giving these accompaniment abilities to a music robot. We introduce a new paradigm of beat tracking using 2 types of sensory input - visual and audio - using our own visual cue recognition system and state-of-the-art acoustic onset detection techniques. Preliminary experiments suggest that by coupling these two modalities, a robot accompanist can start and stop a performance in synchrony with a flutist, and detect tempo changes within half a second.",

When the objects are previously known it is possible to employ techniques that exploit object models, like geometrical grasping simulators. On the other hand, a competent system will also be able to deal with unmodeled objects using general solutions. In this paper we present an integrated system for autonomous rigid-object pick-up tasks in domestic environments, focusing on the gripping of unmodeled objects and exploiting sensor feedback from the robot hand to monitor the grasp. We describe the perception system based on time-of-flight range data, the grasp pose optimization algorithm and the grasp execution. The performance and robustness of the system is validated by experiments including pick-up tasks on many different common kitchen items.",

The robotic jerboa kicks toward the direction which the horizontal component is large by its legs in order to jump forward effectively. The robotic jerboa is composed as its legs are protruded out of the side of its body respectively for realization of the quick turning. We show that the palm-top size robotic jerboa whose weight is of only 70[g] achieves the velocity of 1.5[m/s] and the turning angular velocity of 11.5[rad/s] instantaneously.",

        "abstract": "Cell manipulation has received considerable attentions in recent years. Most of cell manipulations are performed manually without guarantee of high precision and high throughput. This paper reports our latest research on integrating robotics technologies into optical tweezers system for manipulation and biomechanical characterization of human red blood cells (RBCs). We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the robot-tweezers system in manipulation of micro-beads, which is followed by stretching RBCs to different levels of deformations. The whole manipulation process is conducted with visual guidance and position feedback control, where the cell stretching direction is determined automatically through image analysis. The relationship between the stretching force and the induced deformation is obtained through force calibration and image processing. To characterize the mechanical properties of RBCs from the obtained experimental results, a mechanical model based cell property characterization strategy is introduced. Comparing the modeling results to the experimental data, the mechanical properties of human RBCs are characterized. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the robotic manipulation technology with optical tweezers can be used to manipulate biological cells, and further, to characterize the biomechanical properties based on the cell mechanical model.",

This operation has been performed by skilled workers and is considered to be difficult for automatization. During the development of the system, solutions are proposed for various engineering problems confronted. The problems are all due to the deformable properties of a wire harness. Many of them are general for other operations involved with deformable objects. The proposed methods in the research are verified by a successful demonstration of wire harness assembly under a condition similar to a real plant.",

To test the system developed, a part similar to airplane section 19 has been used. The inspection system is based on a robot carrying a headset made up of ultrasound sensors. Data are processed by an ultrasound processing program which maps the mechanical features of the inspected surface. The main requirement of the inspection is to perform the proper contact between the ultrasound sensors and the inspected surface. In order to guarantee suitable contact between them, a robot trajectory correction system running in real time has been applied. It is based on the measures given by four optical sensors located on the sides of the ultrasound headset. The integration and synchronization of the devices mentioned above make it possible to obtain an adequate inspection system for the external aircraft fuselage. Furthermore, inspection time has been significantly reduced; at the same time a fully-automated system has been developed to inspect the whole aircraft section surface.",

        "abstract": "3D data collected by a laser scanner has great potential for robotic applications. Exact geometrical models of the environment surrounding the robot can be created from these point clouds. But, before creating any model, the 3D point cloud has to be segmented and depending on the size and quality of the point cloud, this can be a very challenging task. This article describes a robust 3D scan segmentation technique, which is capable of segmenting a 3D point cloud in a short amount of time. The results of the segmentation are used to assist a teleoperator to manoeuvre a robot through an unknown environment. Our segmentation approach copes with indoor and outdoor environments, using only a minimum of assumptions, which makes it very robust. A 3D visualisation illustrates the segmentation results in a clear and user-friendly way.",

The goal of the system is reliable perception of a professional life environment in a scenario of the rehabilitation robot FRIEND. Reconstructed scenes are used to plan object manipulation with a 7-DoF manipulator arm. The robustness of boundary feature extraction is achieved by the means of including feedback control at image segmentation level. The objective of feedback is to adjust the segmentation parameters in order to cope with scene uncertainties, such as variable illumination conditions. Robustly extracted 2D object features are provided as input to the 3D object reconstruction module of the FRIEND vision system.

In view of both hydrodynamic problem and engineering approach, we develop a robotic prototype capable of multi-mode motion. A robust gait control for steady swimming using the central pattern generator (CPG) is proposed and has been successfully applied to the robot. The CPG can produce coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity while being simply modulated by control parameters including input drive, frequency, amplitude, threshold, etc., which will be suitable for manually interactive modulation. Using the CPG model, the robot is capable of performing and switching between various locomotion modes such as swimming forwards and backwards, turning and pitching, with the speed, direction and gait types modulated accordingly. A test-bed is provided and results are presented demonstrating interesting properties of the CPG-based control approach and feasibility of the CPG control for efficient propulsion.",

An image processing procedure is developed to estimate distances between the robot and obstacles based-on inverse perspective transformation (IPT) in image plane. A robust image processing solution is proposed to detect and segment navigatable ground plane area within the camera view. The proposed method integrate robust feature matching with adaptive color segmentation for plane estimation and tracking to cope with variations in illumination and camera view. After IPT and ground region segmentation, a result similar to the occupancy grid map is obtained for mobile robot obstacle avoidance and navigation. Practical experimental results of a wheeled mobile robot show that the proposed imaging system successfully estimates distance of objects and avoid obstacles in an indoor environment.",

Bionic hand is a human-like hand that has soft skin with distributed receptors and is driven by artificial pneumatic muscles. At the beginning of learning, it utilizes the result of physical interaction with the object: thanks to the hand compliance, regrasping will leads object's posture to stable one in the hand. This result can be successively used as object classification for learning dynamic interaction between the hand and the object by a recurrent neural network. We conduct experiments and show that the proposed method is effective for robust and fast object recognition.",

Likewise, a robust nonlinear control strategy is proposed to stabilize the PVTOL aircraft using RCLF, and we have employed the Riccati equation's parameters to compute and tune it in real-time. To validate the proposed control strategy, various simulations have been carried out. The controller has been also applied in real-time to a PVTOL prototype undergoing crosswinds. The experimental results show the good performance of the control algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a probabilistic online map merging system for a single mobile robot. It performs intermittent exploration by fusing laser scan matching and omnidirectional vision. Moreover, it can also be adapted to a multi-robot system for large scale environments. Map merging is achieved by means of a probabilistic Haar-based place recognition system using omnidirectional images and is capable of discriminating new and previously visited locations in the current or previously collected maps. This dramatically reduces the search space for laser scan matching. The combination of laser range finding and omnidirectional vision is very attractive because they reinforce one another when there is sufficient structure and visual information in the environment. In other cases, they complement one another, leading to improved robustness of the system. This is the first system to combine a probabilistic Haar-based place recognition system using omnidirectional images with laser range finding to merge maps. The proposed system is also algorithmically simple, efficient and does not require any offline processing. Experimental results of the approach clearly illustrate that the proposed system can perform both online map merging and exploration robustly using a single robot configuration in a real indoor lab environment.",

Algorithms based on visual appearance are becoming popular to detect locations already visited, also known as loop closures, because cameras are easily available and provide rich scene detail. These algorithms typically result in pairs of images considered depicting the same location. To avoid mismatches, most of them rely on epipolar geometry to check spatial consistency. In this paper we present an alternative system that makes use of stereo vision and combines two complementary techniques: bag-of-words to detect loop closing candidate images, and conditional random fields to discard those which are not geometrically consistent. We evaluate this system in public indoor and outdoor datasets from the Rawseeds project, with hundred-metre long trajectories. Our system achieves more robust results than using spatial consistency based on epipolar geometry.",

        "abstract": "A robust 2-D vehicle-positioning system based on constraint propagation on a data horizon is proposed. Using asynchronous unreliable absolute positions and reliable proprioceptive measurements, the proposed method outputs the bounds of the pose at any desired rate. A bounded error approach is used to propagate the imprecision of the input data to the final pose estimation. Measurements are represented by intervals taking errors into account. Integrity is assumed on proprioceptive measurements error bounds. In opposition, the bounds set on exteroceptive positions are not required to be guaranteed. Indeed, a relaxed intersection of constraints is applied to achieve robustness, given a maximum ratio of erroneous positions. This approach is implemented for an automotive vehicle equipped with a GPS receiver and a CAN gateway. An real experimental validation is carried out with a dataset including wrong GPS measurements and the crossing of a tunnel.",

Owing to the limited payload and power of the UAVs, we employ a monocular camera and a global positioning system (GPS) to carry out vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using both an unscented Kalman filter and a Kalman filter. Since this approach estimates the state of the UAV and the location of the target, we can estimate the position of the target in the image, even in the presence of CMs. Our experiments show that the proposed method successfully locks on to the target and estimates the state of the UAV.",

        "abstract": "The capability to overcome terrain irregularities or obstacles, named terrainability, is mostly dependant on the suspension mechanism of the rover and its control. For a given wheeled robot, the terrainability can be improved by using a sophisticated control, and is somewhat related to minimizing wheel slip. The proposed control method, named torque control, improves the rover terrainability by taking into account the whole mechanical structure. The rover model is based on the Newton-Euler equations and knowing the complete state of the mechanical structures allows us to compute the force distribution in the structure, and especially between the wheels and the ground. Thus, a set of torques maximizing the traction can be used to drive the rover. The torque control algorithm is presented in this paper, as well as tests showing its impact and improvement in terms of terrainability. Using the CRAB rover platform, we show that the torque control not only increases the climbing performance but also limits odometric errors and reduces the overall power consumption.",

The method works both on cameras with a fisheye lens and cameras with a catadioptric lens. A combination of an edge based method and a Hough transform method is suggested to find the rows. The vanishing point of several parallel rows is estimated using a second Hough transform. The method is evaluated on synthetic images generated with calibration data from real lenses. Scenes with several rows are produced, where each plant is positioned with a specified error. Experiments are performed on these synthetic images and on real field images. The result shows that good accuracy is obtained on the vanishing point once it is detected correctly. Further it shows that the edge based method works best when the rows consists of solid lines, and the Hough method works best when the rows consists of individual plants. The experiments also show that the combined method provides better detection than using the methods separately.",

Our proposed solution takes a sequence of upward facing omnidirectional images and coarse 3D models of cities to compute the geo-trajectory. The camera is oriented upwards to capture images of the immediate skyline, which is generally unique and serves as a fingerprint for a specific location in a city. Our goal is to estimate global position by matching skylines extracted from omni-directional images to skyline segments from coarse 3D city models. Under day-time and clear sky conditions, we propose a sky-segmentation algorithm using graph cuts for estimating the geo-location. In cases where the skyline gets affected by partial fog, night-time and occlusions from trees, we propose a shortest path algorithm that computes the location without prior sky detection. We show compelling experimental results for hundreds of images taken in New York, Boston and Tokyo under various weather and lighting conditions (daytime, foggy dawn and night-time).",

Typically, this is made possible through the static world assumption - the landmarks remain in the same location throughout the mapping procedure. Some prior work has addressed this assumption by splitting maps into static and dynamic sets, or by recognizing moving landmarks and tracking them. In contrast to previous work, we apply an Expectation Maximization technique to a graph based SLAM approach and allow landmarks to be dynamic. The batch nature of this operation enables us to detect moveable landmarks and factor them out of the map. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with a series of experiments with moveable landmarks in a structured environment.",

        "abstract": "SLIP models are generally known as one of the best and simplest abstractions describing the spring-like leg behavior found in human and animal running, and have thus been subject to exhaustive investigation. To exploit these findings in real robots, we utilize an operational space controller that projects the behavior of the SLIP model onto the dynamics of an actual segmented robotic leg. Additionally, we introduce a method to compensate for the energetic losses at the impact collisions, which are not accounted for in the simplified SLIP assumptions. This allows the direct application of existing dead-beat control strategies to arbitrary robotic legs, for which we can show that the collision and compensation effects in the actual leg enlarge the regions of stable running and reduce the minimally required locomotion speed. The necessary joint torque profiles can be generated in large part passively, for example by using high compliance series elastic actuators.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of predicting the probability of an accident in working environments where human operators and robotic manipulators co-operate. We show how, starting from a stochastic discrete time system describing human motion, it is possible to construct a discrete abstraction of the system (a discrete time Markov Chain) to predict the possible trajectories starting from an initial point. The DTMC is used to predict the future evolution for the system, for a fixed horizon, pinpointing the states that, at each step, can be marked as dangerous. This way, the system estimates the probability of an accident and stops the robot when the result is greater than a threshold.",

        "abstract": "When persons interact, non-verbal cues are used to direct the attention of persons towards objects of interest. Achieving joint attention this way is an important aspect of natural communication. Most importantly, it allows to couple verbal descriptions with the visual appearance of objects, if the referred-to object is non-verbally indicated. In this contribution, we present a system that utilizes bottom-up saliency and pointing gestures to efficiently identify pointed-at objects. Furthermore, the system focuses the visual attention by steering a pan-tilt-zoom camera towards the object of interest and thus provides a suitable model-view for SIFT-based recognition and learning. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed system through experimental evaluation in different environments with multiple pointers and objects.",

The proposal has to deal with the particularities of the MSIS in order to obtain range scans while correcting the motion induced distortions. The SLAM algorithm manages the relative poses between the gathered scans, thus making it possible to correct the whole Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) trajectories involved in the loop closures. Additionally, the loop closures can be delayed if needed. The experiments are based on real data obtained by an AUV endowed with an MSIS, a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and a Motion Reference Unit (MRU). Also, GPS data is available as a ground truth. The results show the quality of our approach by comparing it to GPS and to other previously existing algorithms.",

This paper presents a new approach using visual features to efficiently represent a series of locations along a path in an indoor environment. In the training stage, local features which are detected across multiple images from a single tour are combined to represent a real-world landmark, modelled by the expected variance of its descriptor. Those landmarks which represent the scene in the most efficient and discriminative manner are then retained, and this selection is optimized with respect to the scale of the environment. In the recognition stage, features detected in an image are matched to the landmarks in memory, based upon a novel similarity measure drawing from feature co-occurrence statistics.",

We design a navigation algorithm integrated with time delay of arrival (TDOA) techniques based on cross-correlation. To confirm the practicality of our approach, we design a robot docking scenario and develop an autonomous mobile robot with two microphone pairs, a camera and a laser range finder to conduct the experiments.

It remains an open problem to automatically convert these low-level map representations to semantic descriptions in order to effectively support high-level decision of a robot. Based on another representation of 3D point clouds, i.e. range image, this paper proposes a framework of segmentation and classification of range image, the objective of which is to annotate class labels to the data clusters that are obtained through a graph-based segmentation. Experimental results are presented and evaluated demonstrating that the proposed algorithm has efficiency in understanding the semantic knowledge of a large dynamic urban outdoor environment.",

The camera image and laser range data are fused using a Markov Random Field to estimate a 3D point corresponding to each image pixel. The textured 3D dense point cloud is segmented based on evidence of a boundary between regions of the textured point cloud. Clusters are discriminated based on Euclidean distance, pixel intensity and estimated surface normal using a fast, deterministic and near linear time segmentation algorithm. The algorithm is demonstrated on data collected with the Cornell University DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle. Performance of the proposed dense segmentation routine is evaluated in a complex urban environment and compared to segmentation of the sparse point cloud. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dense segmentation algorithm to avoid over-segmentation better than incorporating color and surface normal data in the sparse point cloud.",

        "abstract": "A team of robots working to explore and map an area may need to share information about landmarks so as to register their local maps and to plan effective exploration strategies. In previous papers we have introduced a combined image and spatial representation for landmarks: terrain spatiograms. We have shown that for manually selected views, terrain spatiograms provide an effective, shared representation for occlusion filtering and for combination of multiple views. In this paper, we present a landmark saliency architecture (LSA) that will automatically select candidate landmarks given some preference settings. Using a dataset of 21 outdoor stereo images generated by LSA, we show that the terrain spatiogram representation reliably recognizes automatically selected landmarks. The terrain spatiogram results are shown to improve on two purely appearance based approaches: template matching and image histogram matching.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) need positioning systems different than the Global Positioning System (GPS), which does not work in underwater scenarios. A possible solution to this lack of GPS signal are the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. SLAM algorithms aim to build a map while simultaneously localize the vehicle within it. These algorithms suffer from several limitations in front of large scale scenarios. For instance, they do not perform consistent maps for large areas, mainly because uncertainties increase with the scenario. In addition, the computational cost increases with the map size. It has been demonstrated that the use of local maps reduces computational cost and improves map consistency. Following this idea, in this paper we propose a new SLAM technique based on using independent local maps, combined with a global level stochastic map. The global level contains the relative transformations between local maps. These local maps are updated once a new loop is detected and the amount of overlapping between local maps is high. Thus, maps sharing a high number of features are updated through fusion, maintaining the correlation between landmarks and vehicle. Experimental results on real data obtained from the REMUS-100 AUV show that our approach is able to obtain large map areas consistently.",

The robot has two working modes, Normal Working Mode and Self-rescue Mode. Under normal working mode, the robot propels itself in the pipe just as other classical screw drive robots. When the robot encounters the obstacle and gets jammed, the lock up mechanism and motion control mechanism of the robot are activated. Then, the robot changes from working mode to self-rescue mode and moves away in the reverse direction to avoid jamming in the pipe. The change of the working mode is determined by the characteristics of the mechanism. The proposed mechanism can be used as a safety protection method for the pipe robot. Experiments have been conducted to testify the proposed mechanism. Compared with those with screw drive mechanisms, robots with self-rescue mechanism are able to avoid jamming in the pipe.",

Most of the recent methods only achieve reliable results in some particular well-arranged environments. In this paper, we describe a road detection algorithm for front-view monocular camera using road probabilistic distribution model (RPDM) and online learning method. The primary contribution of this paper is that the combination of dynamical RPDM and Fuzzy Support Vector Machines (FSVMs) makes the algorithm being capable of self-supervised learning and optimized learning from the inheritance of previous result. The secondary contribution of this paper is that the proposed algorithm uses road geometrical assumption to extract assumption based misclassified points and retrains itself online which makes it easier to find potential misclassified points. Those points take an important role in online retraining the classifier which makes the algorithm adaptive to environment changing.",

The intelligent robot must have the capability of understanding situations. The first step of understanding of the situation is to find where to focus on and how to behave. Focusing on some particular area or region needs selection of the objects of interaction relevant to the context. Moreover, the focused area needs to be semantically evaluated to quantify the semantic relations. In this paper, we first detect interacting objects based on dynamic interaction. Then we recognize probable objects using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Using the probable objects and a mutual supplementation model, we determine the contextual object. We form ROIs based on possible combinations of objects and the contextual object. Finally, we semantically evaluate each ROI. Various experimental results are provided to illustrate our method.",

The main concept of the proposed system is based on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and the opto-kinetic reflex (OKR) of the human eye. To realize the VOR concept, MEMS inertial sensors and encoders are used for robot motion detection. This concept turns the camera towards a selected target, counteracting the robot motion. Based on the OKR concept, the targeting errors are periodically compensated, using vision information. The fuzzy logic controller uses sensor data fusion to detect slip or collision occurrences. To calculate a heading angle of the camera accurately, the output of the fuzzy logic controller and the vision information from the camera are combined, using an extended Kalman filter. The proposed vision tracking system is implemented in a mobile robot and evaluated experimentally. The experimental results are obtained as the tracking and the recognition success rate using a mobile robot. The developed system achieved the excellent tracking and recognition performance during slip or collision occurrences under dynamic circumstances.",

We examine the premise that although long interaction time between robots and operators hurts the efficiency of the system, as it generates longer waiting time for robots, it provides robots with longer neglect time and better performance benefiting the system. In the paper we address the problem of how to choose the optimal service level for an operator in a system through a service level differentiation model. Experimental results comparing system performance for different values of system parameters show that a mixed strategy is a general way to get optimal system performance for a large variety of system parameter settings and in all cases is no worse than a pure strategy.",

In this paper, a path planning method is presented corresponding to the unique reconfiguration ability of this robot. This method can automatically adjust the relation between the rapid movement and the secure mobile position of the robot based on the distribution of obstacles that are around the robot, and this method can also automatically select an appropriate configuration to adapt the robot to the environmental variation according to the information of the current conditions. The problem of deadlock is avoided by using the Boundary Following. Further, a Reconfiguration Memory is provided to optimize the trace of the Boundary Following, and it can help the robot to search a new path. Simulation results validated the advantage of the proposed method which can get the best out of the unique accessibility of the shape-shifting robot and reduced effectively the length of the robot traveling path.",

To enhance their traversability on rough terrain, some are equipped with \u201cactive flippers.\u201d However, manual control of such flippers also increases the operator's workload, particularly for teleoperation with limited camera views. To eliminate this tradeoff, we developed a shared autonomy system using an autonomous controller for flippers that is based on continuous three-dimensional terrain scanning. In our system, real-time terrain slices near the robot are obtained using three laser range sensors, and these are integrated to generate three-dimensional terrain information. In this paper, we introduce the autonomous controller for the flippers and validate the reliability of the shared autonomy system through experimental results on actual rough terrain.",

The representation can be used for the construction of fractional order models and also for modeling of asymmetric velocity profiles. The natural boundary conditions, defined in this part of the paper, can also be used in modeling asymmetric velocity profiles.

This work studies power consumption of the locomotion system of wheeled skid-steer vehicles on hard horizontal terrain at walking speeds. This issue is very important for this kind of vehicles due to relevant power losses associated to dynamic friction during turnings. The paper adopts a kinematics approach to provide a simplified power model. This static model estimates motor power consumption as a function of the left- and right-side wheels' speeds. The model is defined through three constant parameters: the x-coordinate of the treads' instantaneous center of rotation on the ground plane, a traction resistance constant, and the ground-wheel friction coefficient. Furthermore, a simple experimental identification procedure is proposed to obtain the model parameters. A power analysis of the four-wheel skid-steer mobile robot Quadriga has been performed with different loads on concrete and marble floorings.",

Our method is based on the Reinforcement Learning of Visual Classes(RLVC) algorithm and adapts it for learning spatial visual selection in order to reduce computational complexity. Proposed algorithm also addresses aliasings due to not knowing previous actions and perceptions. Continuing learning shows our method is robust to perturbations in perceptual information. Our method also allows object recognition when class labels are used instead of physical actions. We have tried to gain maximum generalization while performing local processing. Experiments over visual navigation and object recognition tasks show that our method is more efficient in terms of computational complexity and is biologically more plausible.",

In contrast to previous contributions, an iterative method, that glue together the problem of kinematic motion planning with dynamic control, generates the sequence of feasible collision-free motions by combining in a single strategy the task-priority redundancy formalism with a joint model-free smooth force-motion control scheme based on a well-posed projection, which allows motions of the system only in the tangent subspace of the contact constrained manifold. Overall the new algorithm is able to compute fast and accurately local solutions involving severely constrained robotic motions. We have successfully verified in simulations the effectiveness of the proposed iterative method in the context of cooperative manipulation tasks.",

The tradeoff between the responsiveness and the range of motion is achieved by varying a length of linkage in the SBM. In this paper, we clarify the responsiveness of the SBM using the dynamics analysis. For the demonstration, we build an experimental SBM system with the high responsiveness, a practical range of motion, and a size comparable to a human arm. In the experiment, the effectiveness of the SBM is shown in a vertical lifting task. The characteristic of the SBM that generates a large acceleration at start is similar to the human arm moved by a muscle. The similarity between the SBM and the human arm is analyzed in terms of the static torque.",

This kind of manipulators have revealed as an interesting alternative to serial robots handling axisymmetric tools. Their particular geometry permits that, in one tool axis, inclination angles of up to 90 degrees are possible thus overcoming the orientation limits of the classical Stewart platform.",

It relies on a modular software architecture, which allows intuitive control over the robot and compensates latency-based risks by using Augmented Reality techniques together with path prediction and collision avoidance to provide the remote user with visual feedback about the tasks and skills that will be executed. Based on this architecture different skills with high dynamics are integrated in the robot control, so that they can be executed autonomously without the delayed feedback of the user. The skill-based grasping by adherence of smooth or fragile objects during a remote controlled picking and placing task will be exemplary presented.",

This paper proposes a novel tethered window cleaning robot named a \u201cSkyScraper-I\u201d and discusses its design. The SkyScraper-I has the functions to approach all the windows located on one side of a building by controlling the lengths of a pair of suspending tethers from the top of the building and to clean the whole surface of the windows. The robot consists of the vertically suspended sliding rod, a pair of clamping arms with clamping suction rollers on both ends, and a squeegee sliding mechanism to wipe the window. The clamping suction rollers have three functions: to fix the Sky-Scraper between the upper and lower frames of the window, to produce a suction force without touching the window, and to drive sideways for wiping all the window. From the several preliminary experiments, the SkyScraper-I demonstrated good mobility to move from window to window and to clean the surface of each window.",

        "abstract": "Wheeled exploration robots are prone to slip during locomotion on deformable rough planetary terrain, which leads to loss of velocity and extra consumption of energy. Experimental results show that the power required for driving a wheel is an increasing function of its slip ratio; further, the tractive efficiency decreases rapidly after it reaches a peak value when the slip ratio is between 0.05 and 0.2. In this study, wheel-soil interaction terramechanics, which considers the slip ratio as an important state variable, is applied to analyze the quasi-static equations of a planar robot system. The slip ratios of wheels are controllable, but the degree of freedom is the number of wheels minus 1. A generalized algorithm for distributing the slip ratios of all the wheels of a robot to optimize the energy consumption is presented. Experimental and simulation results show that the \u201cequal slip ratio\u201d is at least a sub-optimal solution for optimizing energy consumption. Further, a more robust control method has been developed; this methods aims to equalize the slip ratios of all the wheels while maintaining a constant body velocity on rough terrains, without solving the values of the slip ratios. This method is verified by controlling a virtual four-wheeled robot using dynamics simulations.",

Despite a lot of steering mechanisms successfully developed in past years, for miniature robots, real-time computation is still a limitation for robot path tracking. The design issues in cooperative control of battery-powered nonholonomic robots rest with the complicacy of the control strategies, the low power consumption and real-time processing capability. Conventionally, the improvement of computing speed mostly relies on the increment of the system clock and often results in some transient loss. Thus, an elaborate control algorithm developed for PC might not work on an embedded system. This paper presents a comprehensive steering algorithm which, via issuing predicaments for computation, will dramatically reduce the resource usage in hardware circuit design. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an embedded system for ubiquitous robotics using the field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology.",

On the other hand, working efficiencies are also important and cannot be ignored. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate a pedestrian's behavior. Based on the estimation, we realize smooth collision avoidances between a robot and a human. A robot detects pedestrians by using a laser range finder and tracks them by a Kalman filter. We apply the social force model to the observed trajectory for a determination whether the pedestrian intends to avoid a collision with the robot or not. The robot selects an appropriate behavior based on the estimation results. We conducted experiments that a robot and a person pass each other. Through the experiments, the usefulness of the proposed method was demonstrated.",

Given that the height of the camera and the angle between the camera and the floor are known, an image of the SoF can be efficiently distinguished from the other space-lines by a simple data-association method, deriving the line correspondence from a simplified homography matrix of two sequentially gathered images. Furthermore, use of SoF simplifies the analysis of the geometrical property of the camera projection matrix. Therefore, we can reconstruct SoF by using a one-step inverse projection. Once SoF is calculated from visual data processing, they are then used in a normal SLAM process as feature data. We employ a simple particle filter in our corridor SLAM. Experimental results show that it is sufficient for mapping a moderately sized building environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the inherent complexity in coordinating learned behavioral strategies of multiple agents working towards a common goal. Because of the interactions among the agents, a primary challenge of policy learning is escalating computational complexity with increasing number of agents and the size of the task space (including action choices and world states). We employ an approach that incorporates social constructs based on analogs from biological systems of high functioning mammals in order to constrain state-action choices in reinforcement learning. Additionally, we use state-space abstraction and a hierarchical learning structure to improve learning efficiency. Theoretical results bound the reduction in computational complexity due to state abstraction, hierarchical learning, and socially-constrained action selection in learning problems that can be described as decentralized Markov decision processes. Simulation results show that these theoretical bounds hold and that satisficing multi-agent coordination policies emerge, which reduce task completion time, computational cost, and memory resources compared to learning with no social knowledge.",

In the present work, we make use of sound localization technology using a microphone array, not only for localizing, but also for detecting sound intervals of multiple sound sources. In our previous work we have implemented and evaluated sound localization in the 3D-space using the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) method. In the present work, we proposed a method for detecting sound intervals based on the sound directivity information inferred from the dynamics of the MUSIC spectrogram. The proposed method achieved high sound interval detection accuracies and low insertion rates compared with the previous sound localization results.",

Real-world applications such as robots should cope with both moving and stationary sound sources. However, most studies assume only stationary sound sources. We introduce three key techniques to cope with moving sources, that is, Adaptive Step-size control (AS), Optima Controlled Recursive Average (OCRA), and Separation Parameter Switching (SPS). We implemented a real-time robot audition system with these techniques for our humanoid robot with an 8ch microphone array by using HARK which is our open-source software for robot audition. Preliminary results show that the performance of recognition of moving sound sources improved drastically, and also the performance of the system is shown through two speech dialog scenarios which requires sound source separation and automatic speech recognition for moving sources.",

At first, beamforming was used to separate the sound mixtures back to the original sources while preserving the original contents to the maximum extent. The residual interference was then suppressed by the time-frequency masking technique. A sequential least squares method was used in developing a matched beamformer to estimate the relative transfer function (RTF). From experimental results, it has been shown that the proposed method exhibits improved performance in sound source separation compared to conventional methods. Signal enhanced factor (SEF) was improved by an average of 8.39 dB over the baseline.",

But, is a naive agent able to learn by itself the structure of its interaction with the environment without any a priori information? This knowledge should be extracted through the analysis of the only information it has access to: its high-dimensional sensorimotor flow. Recent works, based on the sensorimotor contingencies theory, allow a simulated agent to extract the geometrical space dimensionality without any model of itself nor of the environment. In this paper, these results are validated using a more sophisticated auditive modality. The question of multimodality fusion is then addressed by fitting up the agent with vision. Finally, preliminary experimental results on a real robotic platform are presented.",

The natural representation of human hand motion has high dimensionality. For specific activities such as handling and grasping of objects, the commonly observed hand motions lie on a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold in hand posture space. Although full body human motion is well studied within Computer Vision and Biomechanics, there is very little work on the analysis of hand motion with nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. In this paper we use Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) to model the lower dimensional manifold of human hand motions during object grasping. We show how the technique can be used to embed high-dimensional grasping actions in a lower-dimensional space suitable for modeling, recognition and mapping.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a speedup and performance improvement of multi-channel semi-blind ICA (MCSB-ICA) with parallel and resampling-based block-wise processing. MCSB-ICA is an integrated method of sound source separation that accomplishes blind source separation, blind dereverberation, and echo cancellation. This method enables robots to separate user's speech signals from observed signals including the robot's own speech, other speech and their reverberations without a priori information. The main problem when MCSB-ICA is applied to robot audition is its high computational cost. We tackle this by multi-threading programming, and the two main issues are 1) the design of parallel processing and 2) incremental implementation. These are solved by a) multiple-stack-based parallel implementation, and b) resampling-based overlaps and block-wise separation. The experimental results proved that our method reduced the real-time factor to less than 0.5 with an eight-core CPU, and it improves the performance of automatic speech recognition by 2-10 points compared with the single-stack-based parallel implementation without the resampling technique.",

We have proposed an energy-based method, called passive creeping, to control the serpentine locomotion. This paper lays emphasis on the stability and the adaptability of the method. First, the local orbital stability of the movement is explicated based on the maximal Lyapunov exponent and the recurrence plot. Second, the adaptability to the environment is analyzed, and an optimal adaptive law based on the energy proportion is put into use to perfect the method. The particular advantages of the passive creeping include the comprehensive concept, the explicit control, and the inherent adaptability.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the effect of controlled outputs selection on the walking stability for an under-actuated planar biped robot. The control is based on tracking reference motions expressed as function of time. First, the reference motions are adapted at each step in order to create an hybrid zero dynamic system. Second, the stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with the linearization of the restricted Poincar\u00e9 map of the hybrid zero dynamics. It shows that for the same robot, and for the same reference trajectory, the stability of the walking can be modified by some pertinent choices of controlled outputs. Third, we find that, at the desired moment of impact for one step, the height of swing foot is nearly zero for all the stable walking, though the configurations of the robot are not the desired configurations. Based on this, we propose a new method to choose the controlled outputs to obtain the stable walking for robot. As a result, two stable domains for the controlled outputs selection are obtained. Furthermore, we point out that, this kind of control law, which based on reference motion as a function of time, can produce better convergent property than that based on reference motion as a function of a state of robot via pertinent choices of controlled outputs.",

In contrast to existing algorithms, our method optimizes stack stability in addition to stack volume. Furthermore, our algorithm explicitly handles cases where the construction of homogeneous layers of packages with equal height is impossible due to differences in package heights and quantities. The algorithm is a nested beam search that separately optimizes local and global evaluation criteria. We show successful results on both real world and synthetic data sets, compare our performance to an existing algorithm and demonstrate experimental applications in simulation and on a real palletizing robot.",

The proposed manipulator has an advantage that all driving actuators can be separated from the mechanical mechanism, in other words, we are able to separate all electrical components such as electrical actuators and wirings from mechanical linkage/joint components in the robotic manipulator. Thus the robotic manipulator including working joints and linkages can be manufactured using one or a few material(s) with light-weight and slim-size. Also, the proposed mechanism does not require the actuators to attach directly to driving joints and it can be independently controlled. In addition, we suggest the kinematic analysis of the proposed manipulator composed of input mechanisms, multiple 4-BAR mechanisms and output mechanisms. Finally, a variety of simulation results and a prototype are suggested to show the effectiveness of the stackable 4-BAR mechanisms.",

The UK nuclear legacy comprises a number of facilities that are significantly contaminated by radioactivity and non-radiological toxins. Here, the use of remote and teleoperated robotic solutions provide an invaluable option for the safe retrieval and disposal of contaminated materials. Since the behaviour of hydraulically-driven manipulators is dominated by the nonlinear, lightly-damped dynamics of the actuators, existing systems can suffer from a relatively slow and imprecise control action. For this reason, the research utilises a non-minimal state variable feedback approach to control system design, in which the control gains are updated at each sampling instant.",

        "abstract": "The goal of rescue robotics is to extend the capabilities and to increase the safety of human rescue teams. During a rescue mission a mobile robot is deployed on a rescue site and is operated from a safe place by a human operator. The operator can not see the robot and the environment and a decision on the path selection is very complicated. Our goal is to provide a kind of automatic \u201cpilot system\u201d to propose an operator a good direction or several options to traverse the environment, taking into an account the robot's static and dynamic properties. To find a good path we need a special path search algorithm on debris and a proper definition of a search tree, which can ensure smooth exploration. While the main goal of the algorithm is to keep the robot maximally stable at every step of its path, in some cases we need the robot to lose its balance and to change a 3D orientation discontinuously. Losing balance on purpose is an important feature for safe climbing up and going down the debris and it is the central issue of this paper. Exhaustive simulations were used to structure and analyze data and experiments were used to verify our approach to removing unsuitable directions of the search from the search tree.",

Using robot dynamics allows extra measures, such as energy efficiency, to be optimised alongside maximising the likelihood of intercepting the target. We derive a statistical model for a vision system and a Lagrangian dynamical model of a robotic arm, showing how to relate joint torques to the vision. The method is tested by applying it to the problem of catching a simulated moving object.",

A hybrid feedback controller designed in for stable walking along a straight line is modified so that it is capable of adjusting the net yaw rotation of the robot over a step in order to steer the robot along paths with mild curvature. The controller is designed on the basis of a single pre-defined trajectory for periodic walking along a straight line. In order to illustrate the role of internal/external (i.e., medial/lateral) rotation at the hip in achieving curved walking motions, the performance of two robots, one with internal/external rotation and one without, is compared.",

However, pedal wave have been used only for going straight in most of the prior studies. In particular horizontal steering of pedal wave by a real robot has not been investigated sufficiently. Therefore in this paper we studied a kinematically appropriate steering method of pedal wave using a continuous snake-like robot model. We proposed steering by superposition of a steering curvatures and a pedal wave's curvature, and investigated the condition of suitable steering curvature using kinematic simulations. The proposed steering method was verified by experiments with a real snake-like robot.",

        "abstract": "An easily retrofittable stereo vision based system for quick and temporary measurement of a mining shovel's swing angle is presented. The stereo camera is mounted externally to the upper swingable shovel house, with a clear view of the shovel's lower carbody. As the shovel swings from its 0\u00b0 swing angle position, the camera revolves with the shovel house, seeing differing views of the carbody. In real-time, the camera position is tracked, which in turn is used to calculate the swing angle. The problem was solved using the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approach in which the system learns a map of 3D features on the carbody while using the map to determine the camera pose. The contribution includes a locally maximal Harris corner selection technique and a novel use of 3D feature clusters as landmarks, for improving the robustness of visual landmark matching in an outdoor environment. Results show that the vision-based sensor has a maximum error of +/- 1\u00b0 upon map convergence.",

        "abstract": "Vision based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has recently received much research interest. However, vision based SLAM could be corrupted with the inclusion of moving entities, which makes it hard to operate in dynamic environments. Simultaneous localization, mapping and moving object tracking (SLAMMOT) serves as a solution to deal with moving objects while performing SLAM. The existing work has shown the feasibility of monocular SLAMMOT in dynamic environments. However, monocular SLAMMOT inherits the observability issue of bearings-only tracking in which moving entities would be unobservable according to motions of the camera and moving objects. In this paper, stereo-based SLAMMOT is proposed to solve the observability issue as well as increase the accuracy of localization, mapping and tracking. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed stereo SLAMMOT is superior than monocular SLAMMOT in dynamic environments.",

Furthermore, it enables the selection of tip stiffnesses that match varying task requirements. This paper introduces a computationally-efficient approach to continuum-robot stiffness control that is based on writing the forward kinematic model as the product of two transformations. The first transformation calculates the non-contact kinematics of the robot and can be formulated based on the specific type of continuum robot under consideration. The second transformation calculates the tip deflection due to applied forces and is efficiently computed using the special Cosserat rod model. To implement a desired tip stiffness, the two transformations are used to solve for the actuator positions that deform the manipulator so as to generate the required tip force at the measured tip position. The efficacy of the proposed controller is demonstrated experimentally on a concentric-tube continuum robot.",

        "abstract": "Distress inspection is an important task in pavement maintenance. Pavement inspection requires tremendous human resources, so many investigators start developing automatic and robotic inspection methods to increase the efficiency and accuracy. However, the systems they developed are applicable for network-level inspection (large areas, long-distance) but too expensive or too big for project-level inspection (small areas, short-distance). Dealing with this problem, some researchers have developed an autonomous vehicle for inspection. In this research, we specific focus on developing strategies for executing the inspection tasks using robots. We developed three strategies. The first strategy is random-walk. The second strategy is random-walk with map recording. The third one adds the vision capacity to the robot. To validate the three strategies, we developed a test field in a virtual environment. This test field includes 5 types of common distress, including an alligator crack, a patching, a breaking hole, a rectangular manhole and a circular manhole. We also developed a virtual robot which can autonomously navigate in the test field. We then implemented the three survey strategies in the robot and compare their performances with traditional longitudinal survey method. The results show that using the first strategy, we can increase frequency for passing the distresses; it means that robot can detect and collect data more times than traditional longitudinal survey. The results of the second strategy show that we can increase the repeatability by using map recording to guide random-walk. The results of third strategy show that the robot can find more distresses in a certain amount of time; it means that we can improve survey efficiency by adding vision capacity to adjust motion path when distresses detected. Comparing these strategies with conventional Longitudinal survey strategy(L strategy), the three proposed strategies have a higher possibility of revisiting distre... Show More",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for multi-modal scene exploration where initial object hypothesis formed by active visual segmentation are confirmed and augmented through haptic exploration with a robotic arm. We update the current belief about the state of the map with the detection results and predict yet unknown parts of the map with a Gaussian Process. We show that through the integration of different sensor modalities, we achieve a more complete scene model. We also show that the prediction of the scene structure leads to a valid scene representation even if the map is not fully traversed. Furthermore, we propose different exploration strategies and evaluate them both in simulation and on our robotic platform.",

An MAV actuation and transmission design capable of controlling flapping motions and deviations from the mean stroke plane using relatively simple modifications to a proven design is presented. This allows preliminary investigation into more power-efficient wing trajectories, an important concern for small MAVs. A theoretical quasi-steady model of flapping wing flight is used to predict wing motions, and these predicted trajectories are compared to empirically observed trajectories from a test device. The ratio of average lift to average aerodynamic power is used as an efficiency metric to compare stroke trajectories.",

In particular, researchers are seeking new paradigms along with efficient and robust task representations that facilitate adaptation to new contexts and provide a means to appropriately react to unforeseen situations. In this paper, we present a new method for robot behaviour synthesis, where intrinsic characteristics of \u2018Structured UKR manifolds\u2019 [13] are used to derive a closed-loop controller based on motion data obtained by the \u2018Robot Skill Synthesis via Human Learning\u2019 paradigm [10]. We apply the method to the task of swapping Chinese health balls with a real 16 DOF robotic hand. Our results indicate that the marriage of \u2018Structured UKR manifolds\u2019 with the \u2018Robot Skill Synthesis via Human Learning\u2019 paradigm yields an efficient way of realising a dexterous manipulation capability on real robots.",

The aim is to make the swimming of a fish robot capable of holding its station in one-dimensional unsteady adverse flow, i.e. to obtain adaptation to the variations of flow rate. With the sensory feedbacks including water environment information and the displacement of fish robot, a closed-loop swimming control scheme is developed. Firstly, inspired by a real carp fish swimming in adverse flow, control laws that regulate the tail beat frequency and amplitude of fish robots are formulated. A non-linear oscillator is applied to model the periodic swimming gaits. As controlling parameters of the oscillator, frequency and amplitude are dynamically tuned by the feedback control laws. The output of the oscillator that generates the adaptive swimming gaits is adjusted accordingly. The control method is verified through simulation and experiments on a BCF type fish robot.",

The results from experiments and simulation are presented, and are found to match well with each other. The nonlinear latency model was able to adequately represent both Type I and Type II relaxation responses. For the successive loading and holding with a soft contact, the model describes the behavior of step-wise increase of equilibrium strain and a polynomial relationship between the strain rate and the strain. The nonlinear latency model can successfully predict and model the behavior of anthropomorphic soft contact interface in grasping and manipulation when the grasped object is held in certain posture of prehension with repeated loading and/or unloading.",

Many tasks typically associated with robots, such as localization, would be valuable to perform on such devices. In this paper, we present an approach for indoor localization exclusively using the low-cost sensors typically found on smartphones. Environment modification is not needed. We rigorously evaluate our method using ground truth acquired using a laser range scanner. Our evaluation includes overall accuracy and a comparison of the contribution of individual sensors. We find experimentally that fusion of multiple sensor modalities is necessary for optimal performance and demonstrate sub-meter localization accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose an efficient preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG) approach to solving large-scale SLAM problems. While direct methods, popular in the literature, exhibit quadratic convergence and can be quite efficient for sparse problems, they typically require a lot of storage and efficient elimination orderings to be found. In contrast, iterative optimization methods only require access to the gradient and have a small memory footprint, but can suffer from poor convergence. Our new method, subgraph preconditioning, is obtained by re-interpreting the method of conjugate gradients in terms of the graphical model representation of the SLAM problem. The main idea is to combine the advantages of direct and iterative methods, by identifying a sub-problem that can be easily solved using direct methods, and solving for the remaining part using PCG. The easy sub-problems correspond to a spanning tree, a planar subgraph, or any other substructure that can be efficiently solved. As such, our approach provides new insights into the performance of state of the art iterative SLAM methods based on re-parameterized stochastic gradient descent. The efficiency of our new algorithm is illustrated on large datasets, both simulated and real.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Image-guided surgery offers great advantages to surgeons through the possibility to track tools in 3D space and to navigate based on the virtual model of the patient. In the case of robot-assisted procedures, both the inherent accuracy of the system components and the quality of the registration procedures are critical to provide high precision treatment delivery. One of the major barriers towards more technology-integrated procedures is the fact that alterations in the operating room environment can fundamentally change the performance of the system, decrease the accuracy, and therefore pose significant danger to the patient. Surgical events from the control point of view may include motion of the robot, motion of the camera, or motion of the patient. The paper describes a new concept to treat these events, to track and automatically compensate for abrupt changes that may affect the accuracy of a robot-integrated interventional system. Our solution is to use all available information at a given time, including the intra-operative tracker's internal base frame, to distinguish between different surgical events. The concept has been developed and tested on the neurosurgical robot system at the Johns Hopkins University.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a model for trail detection that builds upon the observation that trails are salient structures in the robot's visual field. Due to the complexity of natural environments, the straightforward application of bottom-up visual saliency models is not sufficiently robust to predict the location of trails. As for other detection tasks, robustness can be increased by modulating the saliency computation with top-down knowledge about which pixel-wise visual features (e.g., colour) are the most representative of the object being sought. This paper proposes the use of the object's overall layout instead, as it is a more stable and predictable feature in the case of natural trails. This novel component of top-down knowledge is specified in terms of perception-action rules, which control the behaviour of simple agents performing as a swarm to compute the saliency map of the input image. For the purpose of multi-frame evidence accumulation about the trail location, a motion compensated dynamic neural field is used. Experimental results on a large data-set reveal the ability of the model to produce a success rate of 91% at 20Hz. The model shows to be robust in situations where previous trail detectors would fail, such as when the trail does not emerge from the lower part of the image or when it is considerably interrupted.",

        "abstract": "Human-robot communication is a complex problem even in the terrestrial domain. Failure to properly communicate instructions to a robot and receive appropriate feedback can at the very least hamper the ability of the robot to perform its task, and at worst prevent the task from being completed. The problem of providing effective communication between a robot and its operator becomes even more complex underwater. Many communication channels available in the terrestrial domain become unavailable, and communication between team members and task oversight become even more complex. This paper describes initial experiments with the AQUATablet - a robot interaction device designed to be operated by a diver tethered to, or in visual communication with, an underwater robot. The basic requirements of the device are described along with design considerations and results of initial experiments with the device conducted in the pool and in the open ocean.",

Such bimanual tasks are difficult for people who have a stroke, but the tight neural coupling across the body has been hypothesized to allow individuals to self-rehabilitate by physically coupling their hands. To examine potential methods for robot-assisted bimanual rehabilitation, we performed a haptic tracking task where individuals experience a one degree of freedom trajectory on one hand and attempt to recreate it with their other hand. Despite the biomechanical and neurological symmetries present across the human body, subjects performed this task worse when working in the joint space (i.e., mirrored motion) than they did in the visually centered space. We also examined multiple input paths and show alternative rhythmic motions that may aid in rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "We present a model that is capable of synchronizing expressive gestures with speech. The model, implemented on a Honda humanoid robot, can generate a full range of gesture types, such as emblems, iconic and metaphoric gestures, deictic pointing and beat gestures. Arbitrary input text is analyzed with a part-of-speech tagger and a text-to-speech engine for timing information of spoken words. In addition, style tags can be optionally added to specify the level of excitement or topic changes. The text, combined with any tags, is then processed by several grammars, one for each gesture type to produce several candidate gestures for each word of the text. The model then selects probabilistically amongst the gesture types based on the desired degree of expressivity. Once a gesture type is selected, it coincides with a particular gesture template, consisting of trajectory curves that define the gesture. Speech timing patterns and style parameters are used to modulate the shape of the curve before it sent to the whole body control system on the robot. Evaluation of the model's parameters were performed, demonstrating the ability of observers to differentiate varying levels of expressiveness, excitement and speech synchronization. Modification of gesture speed for trajectory tracking found that positive associations like happiness and excitement accompanied faster speeds, with negative associations like sadness or tiredness occurred at slower speeds.",

Recognition and motion generation functions needed to perform daily assistance are developed, and these functions are used to design various behaviors involved in daily assistance. In our approach, the robot behaviours are divided into simple units which consist of 3 functions as check/plan/do, it provides us with high reusable and flexible development environment. Because sequential task execution can be achieved only after functions about failure detection and recovery, we also try to implement such functions in keeping with this approach. In addition to using simple behavior unit, multilayer error handling is effective. Experiments doing several daily tasks with handling daily tools showed the effectiveness of our system.",

        "abstract": "In today's industry, intuitive gesture recognition, as manifested in numerous consumer electronics devices, becomes a main issue of HMI device research. Although finger-tip touch based user interface has paved a main stream in mobile electronics, we envision touch-less HMI as a promising technology in futuristic applications with higher potential in areas where sanity or outdoor operation become of importance. In this paper, we introduce a novel HMI device for non-contact gesture input for intuitive HMI experiences. The enabling technology of the proposed device is the IPA (infrared Proximity Array) sensor by which realtime 3 dimensional depth information can be captured and realized for machine control. For the usability study, two different operating modes are adopted for hand motion inputs: one is a finger tip control mode and the other is a palm control mode. Throughput of the proposed device has been studied and compared to a traditional mouse device for usability evaluation. During the human subject test, the proposed device is found to be useful for PC mouse pointer control. The experimental results are shared in the paper as well.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we have applied phantom sensation and sensory saltation to generate spatial and directional information using a vibrotactile display pad providing vibrotactile cues, T-mobile. A grooved and slim design is applied to the contact side of the T-mobile for comfortable gripping, and the contact part consists of 12 vibrotactile panels which can operate independently and separately. To maintain isolation among vibrotactile actuators, the surface of the cover is divided into several pieces. Each vibrating module consists of a linear resonant vibrational motor, a section of covering surface, and a vibration isolator. As an evaluation of the developed device, two experiments were conducted to test whether directional information and spatial information can be successfully displayed by the device. As a result, spatial and directional information is useful for displaying intuitive information for hand-held navigation with vibrotactile feedback.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach of performing artificial tactile sensing based on the deployment of prismatic-tip optical fibers. The primary principle of the sensing schemes relies on light intensity modulation for detecting the deformation of an elastic element experiencing a force load. By measuring the change of light signal intensity, the magnitude of the applied force can be determined. The force distribution over an area can be evaluated using an array of optical fibers. The tactile sensor array prototype described in this paper demonstrates its capability and feasibility in performing tactile sensing and force measurement over a range of approximately 0 to 4.8 N. Due to its simple sensing structure, it is easy to manufacture and the sensor can be miniaturized for applications in dexterous robotic handling.",

We proposed a passenger model that considers the passenger's physical frame and seating condition. The passenger's seating condition is classified as upright, standard, or round-shouldered posture. The sway of a passenger with round-shouldered posture is smaller than that of a passenger with upright posture, and they can be represented by the proposed model. To suppress the sway of a wheelchair passenger's posture, the wheelchair driving pattern is optimized using the proposed passenger's posture model. The comfort of the passenger with respect to the proposed wheelchair driving is evaluated through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Involving humans to monitor complex areas using a network of cameras is expensive and prone to errors and fatigue. Hence arises the need for unmanned, cooperative camera systems that can identify targets with intelligent camera motions. Acquiring the targets requires panning of the cameras in a manner that minimizes the time and the contiguous space that goes unmonitored. Average Linear Uncovered Length (ALUL) quantifies the effect of a specific unmonitored area by computing the average length of all lines drawn through the area. This paper considers ALUL as a metric that indicates the target acquisition ability of a particular system configuration. When used in conjunction with temporal constraints, we can intelligently automate camera coverage to improve target acquisition and tracking performance of the system. The results from the experiments confirm that the coverage in constrained environments when the existing camera configuration cannot view large portions of the region of our interest improves when ALUL is considered.",

However, humans are capable to cope with those difficulties to achieve satisfactory tracking performance. Thus this paper presents a biologically-inspired method of visual tracking for moving robots by using object-based visual attention mechanism. This tracking method consists of four modules: pre-attentive segmentation, top-down attentional biasing, post-attentive completion processing and online learning of the target model. Experimental results in natural and cluttered scenes are shown to validate this general and robust tracking method.",

We combine classical sampling-based random tree planning with a reactive controller connecting sampling points with nontrivial trajectories, utilizing redundant DOFs to locally avoid obstacles. While the reactive planner operates locally on a short time scale, the complementary sampling-based method is able to find globally feasible solutions due to its larger preview horizon. Additionally, planning is done in a low-dimensional task space instead of the high-dimensional joint space. Comparing the average planning time and number of tree extensions for several scenarios and planning methods, we demonstrate that this hybrid planning approach is capable of solving a large fraction of planning queries while saving considerable planning time.",

We discovered that Ensis reduces burrowing drag by using motions of its shell to fluidize a thin layer of substrate around its body. We have developed RoboClam, a robot that digs using the same mechanisms as Ensis, to explore how localized fluidization burrowing can be extended to engineering applications. In this work we present burrowing performance results of RoboClam in Ensis' habitat. Using a genetic algorithm to optimize RoboClam's kinematics, the machine was able to burrow at speeds comparable to Ensis, with a power law relationship between digging energy and depth of n = 1.17, close to the n = 1 achieved by the animal. Pushing through static soil has a theoretical energy-depth power law of n = 2, which means that Ensis-inspired digging motions can provide exponential energetic savings over existing burrowing methods.",

        "abstract": "AZIMUT-3 is an omnidirectional non-holonomic (or pseudo-omnidirectional [1]) robotic platform intended for safe human-robot interaction. In its wheeled configuration, shown in Fig. 1, AZIMUT-3 uses eight actuators for locomotion: four for propulsion and four for steering the wheels, which can rotate 180 degrees around their steering axis. Propulsion is done using standard DC brushless motors (Bayside K064050-3Y) with optical encoders (US Digital E4-300-157-HUB, 0.3 deg of resolution), capable of reaching 1.47 m/s. The platform uses steerable wheels motorized using differential elastic actuators (DEA) [2], [3], which provide compliance, safety and torque control capabilities. AZIMUT-3's hardware architecture consists of distributed modules for sensing and low-level control, communicating with each other through a 1 Mbps CAN bus. A Mini-ITX computer equipped with a 2.0 GHz Core 2 duo processor running Linux with real-time patches (RT-PREEMPT) is used on-board for high-level control modules. Nickel-metal hydride batteries provide power to the platform for up to 3 hours of autonomy. A passive vertical suspension mechanism (Rosta springs) is used to connect the wheels to AZIMUT-3's chassis, allowing them to keep contact with the ground on uneven surfaces. The platform has a 34 kg payload capacity and weights 35 kg.",

        "abstract": "Vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicles (VTOL UAVs) are expected to perform dangerous mission such as rescue and exploring disaster site alone. As for the operation of a UAV in a rescue mission, teleoperation is preferred. This paper describes teleoperation of a miniature tail-sitter VTOL UAV. A teleoperation system is developed to navigate a tail-sitter UAV. A velocity estimation method for outdoor flight is described and a velocity control strategy based on attitude control for indoor hovering of tail-sitter VTOL UAVs is proposed. In order to verify the teleoperation system and velocity control strategy, indoor exploration and target tracking teleoperation are performed in this paper. Through the experiments, the operator successfully controlled a teleoperated tail-sitter VTOL UAV with non-line-of-sight. In addition, a preliminary obstacle avoidance system is also implemented to assist operator.",

To filter out these false motion vectors, we use temporal and spatial motion vector filter. The temporal motion vector filter uses the previous motion models to filter out abruptly changed motion vectors, and the spatial motion vector filter uses the motion vector's length information and the motion vector's direction information. The direction information of the motion vectors generated by independently moving objects are different from the direction of the vector generated by camera movement in 3D space, and the length information of the motion vector caused by triangulation error is different from the correctly triangulated points. We uses voting scheme to determine primary motion vectors. This algorithm has been tested on a service robot that works in outdoor environment. By using our method, we can deal with independently moving objects and problem caused by repetitive patterns and triangulation errors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to achieve temporal scaling of leg motions as a fundamental technique for a music feedback system of a dancing humanoid robot. We asked dancers to perform dance motion at normal musical tempo and faster musical tempos and observed how dancers modified performance for given musical tempos. The obtained insights from the observation are 1) a dancer needs to preserve leg postures that are important to emphasize dance expression, 2) there is a priority to determine what features of leg motion can be adjusted, and 3) stylistic leg motion resembles normal step motion if dancers cannot follow fast musical tempo completely. Based on these insights, we generate leg motion appropriately adjusted for changing musical tempo while maintaining balance. We validated our method via simulation experiments with a humanoid robot HRP-2.",

The majority of existing localization approaches, however, is based on the assumption that the environment is static which does not hold for most practical application domains. In this paper, we present a localization framework that can robustly track a robot's pose even in non-static environments. Our approach keeps track of the observations caused by unexpected objects in the environment using temporary local maps. It relies both on these temporary local maps and on a reference map of the environment for estimating the pose of the robot. Experimental results demonstrate that by exploiting the observations caused by unexpected objects our approach outperforms standard localization methods for static environments.",

For secure locomotion on soft soil, the proposed rover would become one of the good solutions because of its robustness to slipping and getting stuck in the soil. Furthermore, the rover is expected to move in various directions by using the dual screw units. However, the interaction between such screw unit and the surrounding soil is quite complicated and remains undefined. So, this paper attempts to model the tractive effort of the rover on the soil. The mathematical modeling is newly developed based upon terramechanics, addressing soil-vehicle interactive mechanics. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by simulation analyses.",

The inertial/magnetic sensor module has three accelerometers, three angular rate sensors, and three magnetometers. A tracking algorithm and a calibration algorithm are described. The tracking algorithm is for estimating the pen tip trajectories based on the sensor measurements, and the calibration algorithm is for estimating the relative position of the sensor module on the writing instrument. Experimental results for writing alphanumeric characters are presented. The relationship between tracking accuracy and writing speed is also discussed.",

This combination results in a mobile robot with no moving parts exposed to the environment, making it ideal for tasks where wheeled or legged robots fail. Instead of suppressing resonance, the new robot morphology relies on the dynamics of resonance for locomotion. Actuators mounted on a central sphere excite a natural mode of vibration by pulling on strings through which the sphere is mounted to a tetrahedral frame. A simple open loop controller is sufficient to cause directed motion by hopping and sliding in a prototype. Rolling as a further gait is investigated theoretically. Fully enclosed resonant dynamic robots could lead to a new type of robot locomotion powered from a vibration source only. This is useful in the microscale where traditional actuators are not available, and at the macroscale where the robot's high ruggedness is favorable.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "During the last two decades, software development has evolved continuously into an engineering discipline with systematic use of methods and tools to model and implement software. For example, object-oriented analysis and design is structuring software models according to real-life objects of the problem domain and their relations. However, the industrial robotics domain is still dominated by old-style, imperative robot programming languages, making software development difficult and expensive. For this reason, we introduce the object-oriented Robotics Application Programming Interface (Robotics API) for developing software for industrial robotic applications. The Robotics API offers an abstract, extensible domain model and provides common functionality, which can be easily used by application developers. The advantages of the Robotics API are illustrated with an application example.",

The Taguchi method was used to reduce the time needed to analyze the global performance of the robot manipulator. Grey relational analysis was performed to deal with the multiple performances of the manipulator by converting multiple responses into a single response with a Grey relational grade. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to analyze the effect of the link parameters on the performance of the robot manipulator, and to determine which link parameter affects the performance of the robot manipulator. The results of the optimization of the prototype robot manipulator and the comparison of the optimization results with those of an earlier study are presented herein.",

In this paper we establish a comparison of the principles underlying this algorithm with standard probabilistic SLAM approaches and identify the key difference to be an additive update step. Using this insight, we derive the novel, non-Bayesian Causal Update filter that is suitable for application in appearance-based SLAM. We successfully apply this new filter to two demanding vision-only urban SLAM problems of 5 and 66 km length. We show that it can functionally replace the core of RatSLAM, gaining a massive speed-up.",

There are three types of Sambots, docking Sambots, SEED Sambot and Connected Sambots. All docking Sambots adopt behavior-based controller that is independent of target configuration. The SEED Sambot and Connected Sambots are used to implement configuration growth. Self-assembly experiments of snake-like and quadruped configurations are conducted on the Sambot platform with five Sambots. The experimental results show the effectiveness and scalability of the distributed self-assembly algorithm.",

For our purpose we abstracted the robot hardware entirely from the control algorithms using the common device driver concept of modern operating systems. The software architecture is split into two modular parts. On the one side, there are device drivers that communicate with the hardware components. On the other side, there are realtime applications realized as Simulink Models, which provide advanced control algorithms. This ensures a clean separation between the two modules and provides a communication over a common and approved interface. Furthermore we investigated how we can ensure synchronization to the hardware over the device driver interfaces and how we can ensure that it meets hard realtime requirements. The main result of this paper is to realize a synchronization between LWR-III hardware and Simulink control applications while targeting small latencies with respect to hard realtime requirements. The design is implemented and verified on WindRiver\u2122VxWorks\u2122.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a nonlinear controller for hovering flight and landing control on a moving platform for a Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by exploiting the measurement of the average optical flow. The VTOL vehicle is assumed to be equipped with a minimum sensor suite (a camera and an IMU), manoeuvring over a textured flat target plane. Two different tasks are considered in this paper: the first one concerns the stability of hovering flight and the second one concerns regulation of automatic vertical landing on a moving platform using the divergent optical flow as feedback information. Simulation and experimental results performed on a quad-rotor UAV demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.",

        "abstract": "Collective and swarm robotics explores scenarios involving many robots running at the same time. A good platform for collective-robotic experiments should provide certain features among others: it should have a large battery life, it should be able to perceive its peers, and it should be capable of interacting with them. This paper presents the marXbot, a miniature mobile robot that addresses these needs. The marXbot uses differential-drive treels to provide rough-terrain mobility. The marXbot allows continuous experiments thanks to a sophisticated energy management and a hotswap battery exchange mechanism. The marXbot can self-assemble with peers using a compliant attachment mechanism. The marXbot provides high-quality vision, using two cameras directly interfaced with an ARM processor. Compared to the related work, the marXbot has better energy management, vision, and interaction capabilities. By allowing complex tasks in large environments for long durations, the marXbot opens new perspectives for the collective-robotic research.",

        "abstract": "The impressive manipulation capabilities of the human hand are undoubtedly related to the thumb opposition. Such a versatility is highly desirable in the context of humanoid robots, in particular when performing object manipulation. Biomechanical data, surgery procedures and rehabilitation surveys represent an excellent base from which a robotic design can be inferred. This knowledge must be understood to identify the properties required for manipulation skills, and especially, to obtain a holistic view of the thumb functionality. Several designs have been realized, that concentrated on biomimetism or on classical mechanism designs. Therefore, it is currently difficult for designers to obtain a clear overview of the properties required for a functional robot thumb. In the present case, a robotic hand with size, forces, velocity and shape comparable to the human ones, is envisioned. Unlike most of robotic designs-where the fingers are modular and the thumb is simply a finger placed in opposition-the thumb benefits from an intensive functional analysis. This paper gathers anatomy, surgery and rehabilitation data and identifies the properties required for human like manipulation. Based on this synergy, guidelines are presented that are fused and applied to the hand design of the Integrated Hand arm project of DLR.",

        "abstract": "We present a moving horizon approach for estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system that may be subject to inequality constraints. The method takes advantage of a recent smoothing algorithm proposed in the literature based on interior point techniques. The approach exploits the same decomposition used for unconstrained Kalman-Bucy smoothers. Hence, the number of operations required by the algorithm scales linearly with the length of the horizon, making it suitable for online applications. We apply this method to the robot localization problem, showing that it is able to produce much more accurate results than the iterated Kalman filter with little additional computational effort.",

This paper discusses the first stage. RRT (Rapidly-explored Random Tree) is utilized for the planning. The main problem is how to modify the sequence of randomly sampled double support postures into practically acceptable one. Some post-processing techniques including thinning and smoothing are presented. A necessary condition of the series of milestones is that a pair of adjacent postures has to share one fixed supporting foot as the pivot. In order to thin out unnecessary milestones, bypass nodes are inserted and Dijkstra's method is applied. A computer simulation in which a humanoid robot travels in an environment with some pieces of furniture is demonstrated.",

We propose a novel threat assessment module, consisting of an intention predictor and a threat assessor, which augments the host vehicle's path planner with a real-time threat value representing the risks posed by the estimated intentions of other vehicles. This new threat-aware planning approach is applied to the CL-RRT path planning framework, used by the MIT team in the 2007 DARPA Grand Challenge. The strengths of this approach are demonstrated through simulation and experiments performed in the RAVEN testbed facilities.",

A fully decentralized geometric self-configuration approach is proposed to deploy individual robots at a given spatial density. Specifically, each robot interacts with three neighboring robots in a selective and dynamic fashion without using any explicit communication so that four robots eventually form a regular tetrahedron. Using such local interactions, the proposed algorithms enable a swarm of robots to span a network of regular tetrahedrons in a designated space. The convergence of the algorithms is theoretically proved using Lyapunov theory. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithms.",

And we propose a scanner for three dimensional visualization of photoelastic stress analysis. As result, we quantified that the maximum contribution of error from stress direction in the first half of the fringe is 2.52% for the stress magnitude measurements.

These trifocal features depend only on the camera projection matrices and can be retrieved from point correspondences across the three views: initial, current, and desired. The Jacobian matrix that relates joint velocities and variations of the trifocal features is estimated online using least-squares. The visual servoing performance is evaluated for various easy and challenging motions, such as the translational motion along the view axis and the large rotation around the view axis. Simulations with a 6-DOF eye-in-hand manipulator show that the proposed uncalibrated approach rapidly converges in all cases.",

        "abstract": "Trajectory generation consists in computing a feasible trajectory between a start and a goal state-time, for a given robotic system. We presented in our previous works a trajectory generator called Tiji, geared towards complex dynamic systems subject to differential constraints. Moreover, it is able to handle a final time constraint, ie an interval of time during which the goal state must be reached, and to provide an admissible trajectory that ends close to the goal state-time if no solution exists to connect both states. This paper is a natural extension of these works, and presents several applications of our trajectory generator. Arbitrary robotic systems may be handled. Furthermore, the control-oriented nature of Tiji and its ability to handle a final time constraint makes it a useful tool to embed into various reactive approaches (trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance). Simulation and experimental results illustrate the different systems and navigation approaches in which Tiji has been embedded.",

Central to this approach is the use of second order sliding mode unknown input observers for estimating the external forces acting on the manipulators. The use of these observers removes the need for both velocity and force sensors, leading to a lower cost hardware setup that provides all of the advantages of a position-force teleoperation algorithm. A proof of stability for each of the master and slave manipulators and their associated observers and controllers is given, as well as stability results for the entire closed loop in the presence of time delays. Experimental results are presented, confirming the validity of this approach in practice.",

A teleoperated robotic hand has been developed for the European Space Agency by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for a lunar rover prototype. Studies carried out on this telerobotic system investigated several criteria critical to telemanipulation in space: (1) grasping task completion time, (2) grasping task difficulty, (3) grasp quality, and (4) difficulty level for the operator to assess the grasp quality. Several test subjects were allocated to remotely grasp regular and irregular shaped objects, under different combinations of visual- and force-feedback conditions. This work categorized the benefits of visual- and force-feedback in teleoperated grasping through several performance metrics. Furthermore, it has been shown that, with local joint-level impedance control, good grasping performance with rigid hard objects can be achieved, even with limited force-feedback information and low communication bandwidth. On the other hand, a performance ceiling was also found when grasping deformable objects, where the limited force-feedback setup cannot sufficiently reflect the object boundary to the teleoperator.",

The use of B-Splines allow environment to be represented without having to extract specific geometric features such as lines or points. Our previous work proposed a new observation model that enables raw measurements taken from a laser range finder to be transferred into relative position information between the control points of a B-Spline and the robot pose where the observation is made. One of the unresolved issues in the work was the estimation of the observation covariance, which is addressed through an analytical approach in this paper. As the uncertainty associated with the observation model is accurately defined and an optimization approach is used in the estimation process, the proposed SLAM algorithm can produce consistent estimates. Both simulation and experimental data are used for evaluation of the results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the long term objectives of robotics and artificial cognitive systems is that robots will increasingly be capable of interacting in a cooperative and adaptive manner with their human counterparts in open-ended tasks that can change in real-time. In such situations, an important aspect of the robot behavior will be the ability to acquire new knowledge of the cooperative tasks by observing humans. At least two significant challenges can be identified in this context. The first challenge concerns development of methods to allow the characterization of human actions such that robotic systems can observe and learn new actions, and more complex behaviors made up of those actions. The second challenge is associated with the immense heterogeneity and diversity of robots and their perceptual and motor systems. The associated question is whether the identified methods for action perception can be generalized across the different perceptual systems inherent to distinct robot platforms. The current research addresses these two challenges. We present results from a cooperative human-robot interaction system that has been specifically developed for portability between different humanoid platforms. Within this architecture, the physical details of the perceptual system (e.g. video camera vs IR video with reflecting markers) are encapsulated at the lowest level. Actions are then automatically characterized in terms of perceptual primitives related to motion, contact and visibility. The resulting system is demonstrated to perform robust object and action learning and recognition on two distinct robotic platforms. Perhaps most interestingly, we demonstrate that knowledge acquired about action recognition with one robot can be directly imported and successfully used on a second distinct robot platform for action recognition. This will have interesting implications for the accumulation of shared knowledge between distinct heterogeneous robotic systems. Show More",

A laser-based operator-selection interface enables an operator to select an area to clean, and the robot autonomously performs a wiping motion using equilibrium point control. We evaluated the performance of the system by measuring the ability of the robot to remove an area of debris on human skin. We tested the performance of the behavior algorithm by commanding the robot to wipe off a 1-inch square area of debris placed on the surface of the upper arm, forearm, thigh, and shank of a human subject. Using image processing, we determined the hue content of the debris and used this representation to determine the percentage of debris that remained on the arm after the robot completed the task. In our experiments, the robot removed most of the debris (>96%) on four parts of the limbs. In addition, the robot performed the wiping task using relatively low force (<3 N).",

A key to the practical usefulness of multirobot systems is the ability to have a large number of robots effectively controlled by small numbers of operators. In this paper, two modalities for controlling a team of 24 robots in a foraging task in an urban search and rescue environment are compared. In both modalities, multiple operators must monitor video streams from the robots to detect and mark victims on a map as well as teleoperating robots that cannot get themselves out of difficult situations. In the first modality, the operators must also provide waypoints for the robots to explore, using both video and a partially completed map to choose appropriate waypoints. In the second modality, the robots autonomously plan their paths, allowing operators to focus on monitoring the video, but without being able to interpret video streams to guide exploration.

Our application is imaging the benthos using an autonomous underwater vehicle with limited communication to surface craft. Robotic exploration of this nature demands in situ data analysis. To this end, this paper presents results of using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) filter, an Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model (IGMM) and a Variation Dirichlet Process model (VDP) for the classification of benthic habitats. All of the models are trained using unsupervised methods. Furthermore, the IGMM and VDP are trained without knowing the the number of classes in the dataset. It was found that the sequential information the HMM filter provides to the classification process adds lag to the habitat boundary estimates, reducing the classification accuracy. The VDP proved to be the most accurate classifier of the four tested, and also one of the fastest to train. We conclude that the VDP is a powerful model for entirely autonomous labelling of benthic datasets.",

        "abstract": "To design, to study, and to control mixed animals-robots societies is a challenging field of scientific exploration that can bring new frameworks to study individual and collective behaviors in animal and mixed robot-animal societies. In the Chicken Robot project we aim at developing a mobile robot, able to collaborate with a group of chicks and to control certain group behaviors. The first research step is to build formal models of relevant animal behaviors by performing ethological experiments. Hence, one of the principal tasks is to design a setup equipped with appropriate monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a toolset for running chick-robot experiments and analyzing results. It includes an autonomous PoulBot robot and an experimental setup, able to autonomously record experimental video and audio data, to detect displacements of chicks and robots, to detect their calling activity and to provide robots with these data. We also present a visual data analysis system to extract behavioral features of individual chicks using the variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model classification with a particle filters based prediction of future positions of chicks. We show how these tools are currently used to carry out chick-robot experiments, to collect behavioral data and to extract animal behavioral features that allow us to build behavioral models bound to be implemented in the robot.",

        "abstract": "We consider how prior information can be exploited to improve the quality of SLAM. Prior information, such as aerial imagery, can be readily obtained for many environments. However, this information is often collected at a different time, using different sensors, different representations and from different vantage points than those used by the robot undertaking SLAM. In this paper, we describe a general probabilistic framework to overcome these difficulties. Our framework models the environment as a random set of latent structures which are observed by a set of sensing systems. Each sensing system gives rise to a different kind of map and, by associating features from the same structure across the different maps, parameterised constraints between the sets of features can be constructed. These parameterised constraints make it possible to transfer information between map representations. We demonstrate the use of the framework in a simulated environment to illustrate how geometric features of different dimensions can be fused together.",

Through a combination of visual cues provided by stereo omnidirectional color cameras and ladar-based structural information, the algorithm is able to detect and track rough paths despite widely varying tread material, border vegetation, and illumination conditions. The approaching trail region is simply modeled as a circular arc of constant width. Using an adaptive measure of color and brightness contrast between a hypothetical region and flanking areas, the tracker performs a robust randomized search for the most likely trail region and robot pose relative to it with no a priori appearance model. Stereo visual odometry improves tracker dynamics on uneven terrain and permits local obstacle map maintenance. A motion planner is also described which takes the trail shape estimate and local map to plan smooth trajectories around in-trail and near-trail hazards. Our system's performance is analyzed on several long sequences with diverse appearance and structural characteristics using ground-truth segmentations.",

Environments such as pedestrian streets, hospital corridors, train stations or airports. We formulate the problem as planning a minimal cost trajectory through a potential field, defined from the perceived position and motion of persons in the environment. A Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed as a solution to the planning problem, and a new method for selecting the best trajectory in the RRT, according to the cost of traversing a potential field, is presented. The RRT expansion is enhanced to account for the kinodynamic robot constraints by using a robot motion model and a controller to add a reachable vertex to the tree. Instead of executing a whole trajectory, when planned, the algorithm uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach, where only a short segment of the trajectory is executed while a new iteration of the RRT is computed. The planning algorithm is demonstrated in a simulated pedestrian street environment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, stable hopping of a one-legged, articulated robot with a flat foot is investigated. The robot has a special feature that before taking off, it goes through an underactuated phase in which the foot rotates about the unactuated toe on the ground. By having the underactuated phase, the robot can perform stable human-like hops with longer hopping distances. To devise a systematic trajectory design methodology for the robot, its dynamics including the ground-foot impact and the hopping constraints are carefully studied. An optimization procedure is then proposed to plan the feasible actuated trajectories which not only meet specific performance requirements but also attain certain optimality with respect to actuation energy. The hopping strategy and the optimal trajectories are verified by simulations and hardware implementation. Experiments indicate that the robot not only can stably perform hops with different hopping distances on the level ground but also can successfully hop up/down staircases.",

        "abstract": "In this paper the problem of computing a rigid object trajectory in an environment populated with deformable objects is addressed. The problem arises in Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery (MIRS) from the needs of reaching a point of interest inside the anatomy with rigid laparoscopic instruments. We address the case of abdominal surgery. The abdomen is a densely populated soft environment and it is not possible to apply classical techniques for obstacle avoidance because a collision free solution is, most of the time, not feasible. In order to have a convergent algorithm with, at least, one possible solution we have to relax the constraints and allow collision under a specific contact threshold to avoid tissue damaging. In this work a new approach for trajectory planning under these peculiar conditions is implemented. The method computes offline the path which is then tested in a surgical simulator as part of a pre-operative surgical plan.",

By introducing a virtual target point, the whole motion process is divided into two parts. The first one is employed to realize tracking control and the other one is adopted to implement point stabilization. Each part produces a feedback control law by using backstepping technique. Moreover, to solve the speed and torque jump problems and make the controller generate smooth and continuous signal when controllers switch, the neural dynamics model is integrated into the backstepping. The stability of the proposed control system is analyzed by using Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

A decoupling method is proposed to decouple the robot's dynamic model such that the tracking controller can be synthesized using backstepping and sliding-mode control in both kinematic and dynamic levels. The FBFN is employed to on-line learn the uncertain parts of the tracking controller, thus achieving adaptive capability.

        "abstract": "Transfer learning refers to reusing the knowledge gained while solving a task, to solve a related task more efficiently. Much of the prior work on transfer learning, assumes that identical robots were involved in both the tasks. In this work we focus on transfer learning across heterogeneous robots while solving the same task. The action capabilities of the robots are different and are unknown to each other. The actions of one robot cannot be mimicked by another even if known. Such situations arise in multi-robot systems. The objective then is to speed-up the learning of one robot, i.e., reduce its initial exploration, using very minimal knowledge from a different robot. We propose a framework in which the knowledge transfer is effected through a pseudo reward function generated from the trajectories followed by a different robot while solving the same task. The framework can effectively be used even with a single trajectory.We extend the framework to enable the robot to learn an equivalence between certain sequences of its actions and certain sequences of actions of the other robot. These are then used to learn faster on subsequent tasks. We empirically validate the framework in a rooms world domain.",

The stiffness of HNBs were obtained in full tensile elongation experiments, ranging from 0.009 N/m at rest position to 0.297 N/m at full elongation before breaking with a resolution of 0.0031 N/m. The non-linear behavior of the HNB's measured stiffness is clearly revealed for the first time in full range.

        "abstract": "Percutaneous interventions have attracted significant interest in recent years, but most approaches still rely on straight line trajectories between an entry site and a soft tissue target. Thus, to this day, a flexible probe able to bend along predefined curvilinear trajectories within a highly compliant medium without buckling is still an open research challenge. In this paper, we describe the concept of a \u201cprogrammable bevel\u201d tip, which is inspired by the ovipositor of certain wasps: the offset between two parts of a probe determines the steering direction of the tip thanks to a set of bevels included at the tip of each segment. A kinematic model of the flexible probe and programmable bevel arrangement is derived. Several parameters of the kinematic model are calibrated experimentally using our first prototype of the flexible probe, codenamed STING. Open- (feed-forward) and closed-loop (feedback) control strategies are then derived and implemented in simulation using the chained form representation, originally developed to control car-like robots. Simulated results demonstrate accurate two-dimensional needle steering in the presence of velocity, position, and initial posture disturbances.",

        "abstract": "Audio-visual (AV) integration is one of the key ideas to improve perception in noisy real-world environments. This paper describes automatic speech recognition (ASR) to improve human-robot interaction based on AV integration. We developed AV-integrated ASR, which has two AV integration layers, that is, voice activity detection (VAD) and ASR. However, the system has three difficulties: 1) VAD and ASR have been separately studied although these processes are mutually dependent, 2) VAD and ASR assumed that high resolution images are available although this assumption never holds in the real world, and 3) an optimal weight between audio and visual stream was fixed while their reliabilities change according to environmental changes. To solve these problems, we propose a new VAD algorithm taking ASR characteristics into account, and a linear-regression-based optimal weight estimation method. We evaluate the algorithm for auditory-and/or visually-contaminated data. Preliminary results show that the robustness of VAD improved even when the resolution of the images is low, and the AVSR using estimated stream weight shows the effectiveness of AV integration.",

In this paper, we present mixed stereoscopic vision system made of a fish-eye camera and a perspective camera for altitude estimation. Contrary to classical stereoscopic systems based on feature matching, we propose a plane sweeping approach in order to estimate the altitude and consequently to detect the ground plane. Since there exists a homography between the two views and the sensor being calibrated and the attitude estimated by the fish-eye camera, the algorithm consists then in searching the altitude which verifies this homography. We show that this approach is robust and accurate, and a CPU implementation allows a real time estimation. Experimental results on real sequences of a small UAV demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

Next, to extend the velocity input control in a kinematic level to the torque input control in a dynamical level, an extended nonholonomic double integrator consisting of the kinematic and dynamical models is treated as a controlled object model. A quasi-continuous exponential stabilizing controller is further derived for such an extended model by using the same way as used in the kinematic level control. The effectiveness of the present method is proved with some demonstrative simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an underwater cooperative box-pushing scenario in which three autonomous robotic fish that sense, plan and act on their own move an elongated box from some initial location to a goal location. With the onboard monocular camera, the robotic fish can estimate the pose of the object in the swimming tank. Considering the complexity of the underwater environment and the limited capability of a single robotic fish, we address the task by decomposing it into three subtasks and assigning them to capable robotic fish. With one robotic fish observing the box at the goal location and two robotic fish pushing the left and right ends of the box, the box can be moved gradually towards the goal location. The subtask consists a series of behaviors, each designed to fulfill one step of the subtask. The robotic fish coordinate through explicit communications and distribute the subtasks with a market-based dynamic task allocation method. Task reallocation mechanism that permits robotic fish to auction its assigned task to capable ones is used to cope with unexpected changes in the environment and the limited sensing range of the robotic fish. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop a robot control system using a microcomputer for an underwater robot with a buoyancy control system based on the spermaceti oil hypothesis. Sperm whales have a spermaceti organ in their head that is filled with spermaceti oil. It is said that sperm whales control their buoyancy by melting or coagulating spermaceti oil. In the previous papers proposed an underwater robot with a buoyancy control device using its theory. The robot was radio controlled and it had no sensor. Therefore, the robot could not detect water depth. Also, it was not able to control its own depth. In addition, the robot could not dive because it had no cooling system. In this paper, we built a depth control circuit using a microcomputer and pressure sensor. The pressure sensor detected the robot's depth, and the microcomputer controlled the robot's position. And, we made a new buoyancy control device using a peltier element. A peltier element was used for heating and cooling systems of the paraffin wax. Then, we experimented with the robot control. As a result, we confirmed that when we ordered a target water depth, the robot dived, floated and maintained the depth itself by detecting its own position. In addition, we confirmed that when a disturbance occurs, the robot returned to the former depth.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents with uncertain trajectories. Existing algorithms suffer from the \u201cfreezing robot\u201d problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in \u201cjoint collision avoidance\u201d: They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably.",

        "abstract": "Typical tasks of future service robots involve grasping and manipulating a large variety of objects differing in size and shape. Generating stable grasps on 3D objects is considered to be a hard problem, since many parameters such as hand kinematics, object geometry, material properties and forces have to be taken into account. This results in a high-dimensional space of possible grasps that cannot be searched exhaustively. We believe that the key to find stable grasps in an efficient manner is to use a special representation of the object geometry that can be easily analyzed. In this paper, we present a novel grasp planning method that evaluates local symmetry properties of objects to generate only candidate grasps that are likely to be of good quality. We achieve this by computing the medial axis which represents a 3D object as a union of balls. We analyze the symmetry information contained in the medial axis and use a set of heuristics to generate geometrically and kinematically reasonable candidate grasps. These candidate grasps are tested for force-closure. We present the algorithm and show experimental results on various object models using an anthropomorphic hand of a humanoid robot in simulation.",

The words of this alphabet are used to replace recurrent local 3D structures, which leads to a substantial compression of the entire point cloud. We optimize our model in terms of complexity and accuracy by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Experimental evaluations on large real-world data show that our method allows robots to accurately reconstruct environments with as few as 70 words.",

Based on these properties, the robot can find its own direction easily, with its surroundings range data, so that the accumulated error in the calculated direction can be avoided. In this paper, we propose a method to know the robot direction using scanned range data of the environment walls, and the method to build the map by connecting the scanned range data using this property. We also present an example of experimental results of indoor map making by a mobile robot without using the odometry, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes our novel work of using GPUs to improve the performance of a homography-based visual servo system. We present our novel implementations of a GPU based Efficient Second-order Minimization (GPU-ESM) algorithm. By utilizing the tremendous parallel processing capability of a GPU, we have obtained significant acceleration over its CPU counterpart. Currently our GPU-ESM algorithm can process a 360\u00d7360 pixels tracking area at 145 fps on a NVIDIA GTX295 board and Intel Core i7 920, approximately 30 times faster than a CPU implementation. This speedup substantially improves the realtime performance of our system. System reliability and stability are also greatly enhanced by a GPU based Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, which is used to deal with such cases where ESM tracking failure happens, such as due to large image difference, occlusion and so on. In this paper, translation details of the ESM algorithm from CPU to GPU implementation and novel optimizations are presented. The co-processing model of multiple GPUs and multiple CPU threads is described in this paper. The performance of our GPU accelerated system is evaluated with experimental data.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning in the high-dimensional, continuous spaces typical in robotics, remains a challenging problem. To overcome this challenge, a popular approach has been to use demonstrations to find an appropriate initialisation of the policy in an attempt to reduce the number of iterations needed to find a solution. Here, we present an alternative way to incorporate prior knowledge from demonstrations of individual postures into learning, by extracting the inherent problem structure to find an efficient state representation. In particular, we use probabilistic, nonlinear dimensionality reduction to capture latent constraints present in the data. By learning policies in the learnt latent space, we are able to solve the planning problem in a reduced space that automatically satisfies task constraints. As shown in our experiments, this reduces the exploration needed and greatly accelerates the learning. We demonstrate our approach for learning a bimanual reaching task on the 19-DOF KHR-1HV humanoid.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a system under development to enable humans and robots to collaborate as peers on tasks in a shared physical environment, using only implicit coordination. Our system uses Conditional Random Fields to determine the human's intended goal. We show the effects of using different features to improve accuracy and the time to the correct classification. We compare the performance of the Conditional Random Fields classifiers by testing the classification accuracy with both the full observation sequence, as well as accuracy when the observations are classified as the observations occur. We show that Conditional Random Fields work well for classifying the goal of a human in a box pushing domain where the human can select one of three tasks. We discuss how this research fits into a larger system we are developing for peer-to-peer human robot teams for shared workspace interactions.",

They speed up the validation process and allow researchers to modify their code accordingly. However, a problem occurs when simulation results are not consistent with real world results. Researchers have found inconsistencies due to odometry error and team size. However, no research has studied the effects specific to robot teams that affect the realism of multi-robot experiments. This paper shows how simulation results vary from experimental results when conducting multi-robot experiments. Simulation and real experiments are performed using different environments and cooperation paradigms. Results show that specific environmental features and cooperation paradigms significantly affect the usefulness of simulated results when predicting performance of real robot teams.",

In this paper we aim to draw attention to text as a readily available source of semantic information in robotics by implementing a system which allows robots to read visible text in natural scene images and to use this knowledge to interpret the content of a given scene. The reliable detection and parsing of text in natural scene images is an active area of research and remains a non-trivial problem. We extend a commonly adopted approach based on boosting for the detection and optical character recognition (OCR) for the parsing of text by a probabilistic error correction scheme incorporating a sensor-model for our pipeline. In order to interpret the scene content we introduce a generative model which explains spotted text in terms of arbitrary search terms. This allows the robot to estimate the relevance of a given scene with respect to arbitrary queries such as, for example, whether it is looking at a bank or a restaurant. We present results from images recorded by a robot in a busy cityscape.",

        "abstract": "The occupancy grid is a popular tool for probabilistic robotics, used for a variety of applications. Such grids are typically based on data from range sensors (e.g. laser, ultrasound), and the computation process is well known. The use of stereo-vision in this framework is less common, and typically treats the stereo sensor as a distance sensor, or fails to account for the uncertainties specific to vision. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute occupancy grids from stereo-vision, for the purpose of intelligent vehicles. Occupancy is initially computed directly in the stereoscopic sensor's disparity space, using the sensor's pixel-wise precision during the computation process and allowing the handling of occlusions in the observed area. It is also computationally efficient, since it uses the u-disparity approach to avoid processing a large point cloud. In a second stage, this disparity-space occupancy is transformed into a Cartesian space occupancy grid to be used by subsequent applications. In this paper, we present the method and show results obtained with real road data, comparing this approach with others.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Increasingly, robots are being applied to challenges in human environments such as soldier and disability assistance, household chores, and bomb disposal. To maximize a robot's capabilities within these dynamic and uncertain environments, robots must be able to manipulate objects with unknown constraints, including opening and closing doors, cabinets, and drawers. Practicality suggests that these tasks be done at or near human speed. A simple and low cost method is proposed to achieve these ends - utilizing joint compliance to resolve forces non-tangent to the path of travel. In this paper, joint compliance is achieved by means of a clutch mechanism located in line with the manipulator joint motors. When an object is to be moved, the motors are disengaged from the joints using the clutch, thus allowing the joints to move freely with the object while force is applied by the mobility platform. This enables the robot to move an object within its constraints without the need for a precise forcing vector, minimizing sensing needs as well as computation time. Other implementations of the technique are also possible, including use of inverse dynamics, back-drivable motors, and/or actively controlled slip clutches for gravity and friction compensation. The effectiveness and robustness of this approach are demonstrated through kinematic analysis, dynamic simulation, and physical experimentation on three differently sized doors and a drawer.",

Along this enumeration the VSA-HD conceptual layout has been selected as being good trade-off between mechanical complexity and overall performance.

The force calculation is implemented using the surface formulation of the force. First, the interacting surfaces are approximated with triangular meshes. Then, the surface roughness is taken into consideration by separately adding the asperity heights to each point of the smooth reference surfaces. Three different models are used to describe the rough surfaces: sinusoidal, fractal, and probabilistic. All the three models show considerable reduction in the force values as a function of the roughness peak height or the inclination angle of the surfaces. Despite the reduction of the force values for rough surfaces, van der Waals force is considered to be an essential part when calculating the total interaction force for micromanipulation purposes.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the target motion around the contact in the satellite capture operation using a free-flying space robot. The contact force has the potential for pushing the target beyond the manipulator reach or making the target have a tumbling motion. An impedance control is useful to prevent the robot hand from pushing the target. However, the relationship between the dynamics parameters, contact characteristics, and target motion have not been clarified yet. In this paper, virtual mass of impedance system (VMI) model is proposed to represent the influence of the hand impedance on the target motion. Using this model, the condition to prevent the robot pushing the target away is clarified.",

The aim of this paper is to address the task of automatically finding people lying on the ground in images taken from the on-board camera of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In this paper we evaluate various state-of-the-art visual people detection methods in the context of vision based victim detection from an UAV. The top performing approaches in this comparison are those that rely on flexible part-based representations and discriminatively trained part detectors. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrate that by combining multiple models we can increase the reliability of the system. We also demonstrate that the detection performance can be substantially improved by integrating the height and pitch information provided by on-board sensors. Jointly these improvements allow us to significantly boost the detection performance over the current de-facto standard, which provides a substantial step towards making autonomous victim detection for UAVs practical.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the operator assisted automated assembly of a 3-legged spatial platform by using a vision guided multi-probe assembly process. This is the first step towards the ultimate goal of building a microscale active spatial platform. Two issues are highlighted in this paper: contact management and vision feedback. Using multiple probes for part grasping and manipulation has the advantage of robustness and versatility as compared to micro-grippers. However, the contacts between the probes and the part need to be carefully managed to ensure a grasp that is stable for part pick-up and yet manipulable to allow part motion in a controlled fashion. By using vision guidance, the probes can be coordinated to grasp the parts and lift them off the die securely and reliably. We show that the contacts act as point contacts with friction, so when a part is pressed against a stationary probe, the part rotates about the axis between the contacts, changing its orientation so it may be inserted into a slot in the substrate. We have demonstrated that the three legs can be assembled in a fully automated fashion via multiple-camera vision feedback. The platform is at present assembled via tele-operation. The assembled microstructure measures 450 \u00b5m\u00d7600 \u00b5m. We are now working on the full automation of the assembly onto a substrate populated with MEMS actuators.",

We show that the visual information allows the construction of control strategies for different kinds of flying modes: hover flight, forward flight at constant speed. A hierarchical control strategy is developed and implemented. The local stabilization of the vehicle is proven. Experimental autonomous flight was successfully achieved which validates the visual algorithm and the control law.",

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a vision-based collision detection algorithm suitable for fixed-wing aerial robotics. The system was evaluated using highly realistic vision data of the moments leading up to a collision. Based on the collected data, our detection approaches were able to detect targets at distances ranging from 400m to about 900m. These distances (with some assumptions about closing speeds and aircraft trajectories) translate to an advanced warning of between 8\u201310 seconds ahead of impact, which approaches the 12.5 second response time recommended for human pilots. We make use of the enormous potential of graphic processing units to achieve processing rates of 30Hz (for images of size 1024-by-768). Currently, integration in the final platform is under way.",

The controller is designed to cope with both unknown robot dynamics parameters and unknown motion of the object. Based on the fact that the unknown position of the moving object appears linearly in the closed-loop dynamics of the system if the depth-independent image Jacobian is used, we developed a nonlinear observer to estimate the 3-D motion of the object on-line and an adaptive algorithm to estimate the robot dynamic parameters. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot, we employed the Lyapunov method to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors. Experimental results are presented to support the approach in this paper.",

We present a system with a downward-facing camera and light ring to provide robust visual odometry estimates. We mounted the system under the robot which allows it to operate in conditions such as large crowds or low ambient lighting. We demonstrate that the visual odometry estimates are sufficient to generate closed-loop PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) and LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controllers for motion control in three different scenarios: waypoint tracking, small disturbance rejection, and sideways motion. We report quantitative measurements that demonstrate superior control performance when using visual odometry compared to wheel encoders. Finally, we show that this system provides high-fidelity odometry estimates and is able to compensate for wheel slip on a four-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot base.",

Using measurements from cameras and infrared range sensors, a temporary local map is built probabilistically with Gaussian processes and adaptively to the change of the route curvature. Based on the probabilistic map, RRT searches the most robust and efficient local path with the probability of collision, and the robot is controlled along the selected path. The performance of the proposed method was verified by reducing not only centering error and standard deviation in simulations but also travel time in real experiments.",

We applied the described methods to virtual-reality TV broadcasting studio environments in Germany in order to close a gap in TV studio automation. The presented approach uses robot camera systems based on industrial robots in order to allow high-precision camera manipulation for virtual TV studios, without limiting the degrees of freedom that a robot manipulator can provide. To take robotic automation in TV studios to a completely new dimension, we have imparted intelligence to the system by tracking the TV presenter in real-time, allowing him or her to move naturally and freely within the TV studio, while maintaining the required scene parameters, such as position in the scene, zoom, focus, etc. according to prior defined scene behaviors. The tracking system itself is distributed and has proven to be scalable to multiple robotic camera systems operating synchronously in real-world studios.",

Our proposal to solve this problem is that the controller for visual servoing of the hand and the one for eye-vergence should be separated independently based on decoupling each other, where the trackablity is verified by Lyapunov analysis. Then the effectiveness of the decoupled hand & eye-vergence visual servoing method is evaluated through simulations incorporated with actual dynamics of 7-DoF robot with additional 3-DoF for eye-vergence mechanism by amplitude and phase frequency analysis.",

In order to be suitable for human robot interaction, the designed method should be free to work on the moving camera platform and also can achieve real-time performance. The dimension of human posture model is extremely high, and we hereby focus on the visual extraction of head and arms. A hierarchical structure model is proposed to solve the tracking problem by particle filter with partitioned sampling in the order of head, upper arm and the forearm. The hand position, straight edge of arm and temporal information are combined by the multiple importance sampling particle filter to efficiently estimate the irregular gesture of arms on image frames. The visual clues of the motion, appearance and shape to human face and arms are to verify the various hypotheses from the multiple importance sampling schemes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking approach, extensive experiments have been performed, of which the results appear to be quite promising.",

In its default configuration, hardware designs, firmware, and software are all available to deliver an out-of-the-box robot control solution comprising 6 degree-of-freedom inertial sensors, a microprocessor, and wireless communication, along with general purpose input/output pins, serial ports, and control outputs for interfacing to additional sensors and actuators. The entire project is open source and a process is in place to enable modification of any component, allowing for easy adaptation to any need. WARPWING is already in use in a number of labs, with each research group contributing its expertise to enhance the platform and make such modifications available to others as well.",

The MLR has multiple types of locomotion such as biped walking, quadruped walking and brachiation. This transfer is carried out through vertical ladder climbing as the robot must raise its body to start brachiating. As a result we have designed two stable transfer motions from walk to climb and from climb to brachiate, while contact situations and constraints of the robot are changing during the transfers. In addition, we have proposed a control algorithm by considering the reaction force from environment, and the setting of parameter is based on a kinetic model of the robot in order to tolerate relative position errors between the robot and its environments such as rungs of the ladder. The robustness of the designed motions with error corrections is experimentally verified.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a comparative study on using water and air as actuation means for the control of a fluidic muscle (designed for air) and assesses the performance, particularly from a dynamic and energetic point of view. A medium with higher bulk modulus such as oil/water is believed to increase pressure and force bandwidths and reduce sensitivity to load variations, as is the case with conventional hydraulic stiff actuation systems. However in this application the inherent flexibility of the muscle plays a major role. Water has been chosen because of its non-flammability, environmental friendliness and the low solubility of air in it. The operating pressure range of the pneumatic muscle is 0-6 bar (typical range of a pneumatic system) that is well below typical operating pressures of hydraulic systems (typically over 100 bar). At such low pressures the dynamic behaviour of water is less predictable because of the higher likelihood of entrapped air in the water which physically occurs when operating at low pressures. This can majorly affect water bulk modulus and hence its dynamic performance. Therefore, the behaviour of the system in this unconventional pressure range for a liquid must be more thoroughly investigated. Theoretical and experimental analyses on a dedicated test rig have been carried out to assess these assumptions.",

        "abstract": "Home monitoring plays an important role within pervasive healthcare, particularly for monitoring the elderly and patients with chronic disease. For assessing activities of daily living, one of the most challenging problems for research remains that of accurate transition detection and characterisation. Early detection of a change in these transitions, such as difficulty getting up from a seated position, can be an indicator of further complications which often precede a fall. Such changes can also accompany early stage neurological disorders which can be treated effectively to improve quality of life. In this paper, we present a system for the accurate characterisation of motion based upon the fusion of ambient and wearable sensors. A probabilistic, privacy respectful method for the extraction of detailed 3D posture information is proposed and fusion with an ear-worn accelerometer and gyroscope is discussed. We present results detailing high accuracy in the recognition of complex motions over four subjects.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to propose a diagnosis and treatment scenario by assistance of bystander and echography robot for trauma patient. Quick treatment is important for patients who have shock by internal bleeding. Therefore, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST), which is a simple and quick diagnostic method, was developed as a first lifesaving step in a hospital. However, a shock patient has little time, and transportation to a hospital may take too long. Therefore, we aim at development of a system which enables FAST at injury scene by assistance of bystander. To develop the system, life-saving flow and a FAST device are significant issues. First, we constructed a diagnosis and treatment scenario. Then, we developed a tele-echography robot system which has 4-DOF that a bystander could attach. This robot is attached to each roughly FAST areas of patient body by a bystander and remotely fine-tuned position by a doctor in a hospital. In this way, a bystander may not do an exact positioning. In addition, the robot has a mechanism to generate contact force between echo probe and patient body surface by two springs. This mechanism not only fit in patient body motion but also reducing the number of controlled axis. To confirm the medical applications of the scenario and the robot, we performed experiments with some examinees and doctors. We confirmed effectiveness of the mechanism and that a bystander could attach the robot to each roughly FAST areas of patient body. We also confirmed that a doctor could do FAST with the robot by remote-controlled on the roughly FAST areas in approximately three minutes. These results show that the robot would enable FAST by assistance of bystander, and the scenario would make FAST faster than the time required transporting the patient to the hospital.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach to hierarchy formation of human behaviors, extraction of the behavioral transitions, and their application to prediction and automatic generation of behaviors. Human demonstrator motion patterns are stored as motion symbols, which abstract the motion data by using Hidden Markov Models. The stored motion patterns are organized into a hierarchical tree structure, which represents the similarity among the motion patterns and provides abstracted motion patterns. Concatenated sequences of motion patterns are stochastically represented as transitions between the abstracted motion patterns by using an Ngram Model, and the transitional relationships of the human behaviors are extracted. The behavioral hierarchy and transition model make it possible to predict human behaviors during observation and to generate sequences of motion patterns automatically while maintaining a natural motion stream, as if the system is a \u201ccrystal ball\u201d to reflect future behaviors. The experiments validates the proposed framework by using a developed visualization system, which shows the demonstrator or the operator the established hierarchical tree and the transition network of the motion patterns, predicted behaviors and generated sequences of the motion patterns.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a visual path following control scheme for wheeled mobile robots based on the epipolar geometry. The control law only requires the position of the epipole computed between the current and target views along the sequence of a visual memory. The proposed approach has two main advantages: explicit pose parameters decomposition is not required and the rotational velocity is smooth or eventually piece-wise constant avoiding discontinuities that generally appear when the target image changes. The translational velocity is adapted as required for the path and the approach is independent of this velocity. Furthermore, our approach is valid for all cameras obeying the unified model, including conventional, central catadioptric and some fisheye cameras. Simulations as well as real-world experiments with a robot illustrate the validity of our approach.",

It consists of force and position signals applied to the user's hand in order to improve safety, accuracy, and speed in some telepresent tasks. Wide-area haptic guidance assists the user in reaching a desired position in a remote environment of arbitrary size without degrading the feeling of presence. Several methods for haptic guidance are analyzed. With active haptic guidance, the user is guided by superimposed forces that pull him into the desired direction of motion, whereas under passive haptic guidance, the movement of the user is lightened in the preferred direction and constrained in the other directions. By using closed-loop haptic guidance instead of open-loop haptic guidance, not only is the user guided to his target but also the deviation from the desired target path is reduced. The proposed guidance methods were tested with a haptic interface specifically designed for extended range telepresence.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method of wide-baseline image matching based on the intersection context of coplanar line pairs especially designed for dealing with poorly textured and/or non-planar structured scenes. The line matching in widely separated views is challenging because of large perspective distortion and the violation of the planarity assumption in local regions. To overcome the large perspective distortion, the local regions are normalized into the canonical frames by rectifying coplanar line pairs to be orthogonal. Also, the 3D interpretation of the intersection context of the coplanar line pairs helps to match the non-planar local regions by adjusting the region of interest of the canonical frame according to the different types of 3D non-planar structures. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method offers efficient yet robust wide-baseline line matching performance under unreliable detection of end-points of line segments and poor line topologies or junction structures. Comparison studies and experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method for various real world scenes.",

Movable obstacles are detected using active sensing and a color range sensor, and when an obstacle is moved, the perception of the environment is reconstructed. Active sensing is defined as the classification of an object as either movable or static after the robot tries to push the object using its arm. This classification is collectively based on force sensor inputs, joint angles, and color range sensor inputs. In order to gather information from the environment, we use a color range sensor consisting of a TOF (Time of Flight) range sensor and conventional stereo cameras. Finally, we show experimental result in the environment with movable obstacles such as a table and chairs. Humanoid robot HRP-2 detects that a chair is a movable obstacle, moves the chair to clear a path to its goal, and then reaches the goal.",

This paper proposes a method for objectively comparing how well a haptic interface covers the reachable workspace of human arms. Two system configurations are analyzed for a recently introduced haptic device that is based on two DLR-KUKA light weight robots: the standard configuration, where the device is opposite the human operator, and the ergonomic configuration, where the haptic device is mounted behind the human operator. The human operator directly controls the robotic arms using handles. The analysis is performed using a representation of the robot arm workspace. The merits of restricting the comparisons to the most significant regions of the human workspace are discussed. Using this method, a greater workspace correspondence for the ergonomic configuration was shown.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the persuasion effect of a robot's whispering behavior that consists of a whispering gesture and a request made in a small voice. Whispering gestures naturally make close distance and create warmth feelings with subjects, and requests in quiet voices with whispering gestures also create familiar impressions, which are effective factors of persuasion. We believe that such physical behavior as whispering is one persuasion advantage held by real robots over computers. We conducted a between-subjects experiment to investigate the effectiveness of these two factors on persuasion. In the experiment, the robot requests an annoying task of the subjects; writing as many multiplication table equations as possible. As a result, whispering gestures significantly increased the working time and the number of equations. On the other hand, the loudness of the voice in the request had no effect. We believe the results indicate the effectiveness of physical behavior for persuasion in human-robot interaction.",
