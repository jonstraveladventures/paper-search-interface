        "abstract": "An efficient approach for the adaptive control of approximately and partially known mechanical systems, like traditional soft computing, uses \"uniform structures\" for modeling, but these structures are obtained from certain Lie groups as the symplectic group or the generalized Lorentz group. This approach considerably reduces the number of free parameters in the model. Until now its efficiency was investigated for mechanical uncertainties and external dynamic interactions. In this paper the behavior of the electric drives are also included in the investigations. A 1-DOF mechanical system, a pendulum driven by a DC motor in a computed torque control, is investigated via simulation. The necessary torque is calculated from a formal primitive mechanical model and an adaptivity rule. For adaptivity real number scaling and the generalized Lorentz group elements are used. It is concluded that a single adaptive loop can compensate for the mechanical and the electrical uncertainties simultaneously.",

Moreover, the graphical user-friendly nature of Simulink allows the SRTK to be a flexible tool that can easily be customized to fit the specific needs of the user, that is, based on the layered approach of the SRTK, the user can perform operations such as calibration, joint control, Cartesian control, Cartesian PD control, impedance control, some trajectory generation tasks, and real-time simulation of the Puma 560 through a user-friendly MATLAB-based graphical user interface without writing any code. The SRTK allows a researcher to use the Puma 560 without the burden of the external issues related to the control, interface, and software issues, while providing for the flexibility for easily modifying components for increased functionality.",

The concept of obstacle range is proposed, and the intersection between obstacle ranges is investigated based on geometrical reasoning. The necessary and sufficient condition for reachability is derived, along with a reachability test algorithm. Based on obstacle ranges, the algorithm requires no analytical expression of obstacle boundaries. It is computationally efficient and can be applied to sensor-based autonomous robotic systems.",

The tuning algorithm is composed of an optimization procedure based on the complex method and has the following features: (1) it does not require any dynamic model of controlled systems; (2) it tunes the feedback gain under an arbitrary performance index and is applicable to both linear and nonlinear control laws; (3) the algorithm is concise and has a few adjusting parameters; and (4) the tuning process proceeds well and the on-site tuning for actual systems is possible. It is also confirmed by the experiments using both simulations and actual systems that the proposed tuning method is effective to the stabilization control of an inverted pendulum.",

The developed full-body human-form robot has a five-jointed flexible spine. Each joint (vertebra) has 3 DOFs. Between each two vertebrae is a \"disk\" made of silicone rubber. The spine is controlled by eight tendons, whose tensions can be controlled using tension-sensors and locally distributed microcontrollers.

We have previously developed a multi-DOF ultrasonic motor consisting of a spherical rotor and a bar-shaped stator. The rotor rotates around three perpendicular axes using three natural vibration modes of the stator. In this study, a multi-DOF unilateral master-slave system using the multi-DOF ultrasonic motor is developed. Master and slave arms for the system have similar configurations, so that an operator can easily handle the master-slave system. First, driving characteristics of the multi-DOF ultrasonic motor are clarified experimentally and analytically in order to design the slave arm and its controller. Next, the master-slave arms and the unilateral feedback controller for the master-slave system are developed. Finally, the motion control tests of the system are performed to show the applicability of the master-slave system.",

This paper presents an error modeling of an odometry system for a synchronous drive system and a possible strategy in order to evaluate this error. The odometry error is modeled by introducing four parameters characterizing its systematic and non-systematic components (translational and rotational). We introduce five experimentally measurable quantities for a given robot motion, which we call observables. On the basis of our odometry error model we analytically compute the average values of the observables, which depend on the previous four parameters and on the considered robot motion. We suggest a possible strategy in order to simultaneously estimate the four parameters by estimating the observables. We show that our strategy only requires to measure the change in the orientation and position between the initial and the final configuration of the robot related to suitable robot motions. The strategy was applied to the platform Nomad150.",

First, we develop a kinematic model of the vehicle in error coordinates expressed in a moving reference frame, which is partially linked to the vehicle. We give a change of coordinates and input combined with a new variable instead of the time-index that transform the original system into a form that can be viewed as a perturbation of a nominal linear time-invariant system. The nonlinear term in the perturbed system satisfies a linear growth bound. Subsequently, linear control feedback is applied to the full nonlinear system and local exponential stability of the closed-loop perturbed system is achieved. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "Model based technologies form the core of advanced robotic applications such as model predictive control and feedback linearization. More sophisticated models result in higher quality but the use in embedded real-time control systems imposes strict requirements on timing, memory allocation, and robustness. To satisfy these constraints, the model implementation is often optimized by manual coding, an unwieldy and error prone process. The paper presents an approach that exploits code synthesis from high level intuitive and convenient multi-body system (MBS) model descriptions. It relies on an object-oriented C++ library of MBS components tailored to the computations required in robot control such as forward and inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and Jacobians. Efficient model evaluation algorithms are developed that apply to multi-body tree structures as well as kinematic loops that are solved analytically for a certain class of loop structures.",

It is necessary to know his behavior over the long term. The ideal intelligent support system can measure the data about human actions in the daily life, accumulate them, understand the behavior and the patterns thereof, and adapt thereto. An accumulation and summarization system of human daily action data based on sensing in 1 room, \"Robotic Room II\", is designed and the accumulation system integrating with the measurement parts is implemented. It is confirmed that accumulation over the long term is possible by experiments for accumulation of human action data in ordinary life. Moreover, as the first step of an analysis of the accumulated data, a summarization algorithm based on the changes of the room states is proposed. It is confirmed that the summarized data enables us to catch the most of the changes of the room states. Finally, a possibility of application for life monitoring by means of summarization is also illustrated.",

Previously reported approaches and experimental results are reviewed. A new adaptive force control algorithm for velocity/position controlled robot arms in contact with surfaces of unknown linear compliance is reported. The controller provably guarantees global asymptotic convergence of force trajectory tracking errors to zero when the robot is under exact or asymptotically exact inner loop velocity control. An additional result which guarantees arbitrarily small force errors for bounded inner loop velocity tracking errors is presented. Comparative experiments show the new adaptive velocity (position) based controller and its non-adaptive counterpart to provide performance superior to that of previously reported position based force controllers.",

It is composed of a leg motion controller and a gait pattern controller. The leg motion controller drives the actuators of the legs by using local feedback control. The gait pattern controller involves nonlinear oscillators with mutual interactions. In the paper, capability of adaptation of the proposed control system to variance of the environment is verified through numerical simulations and hardware experiments. With the input signals from the touch sensors at the tips of the legs, the nonlinear oscillators tune the phase differences among them through mutual entertainments. As a result, a gait pattern corresponding to the states of the system or to the properties of the environment emerges. The robot changes its gait pattern adaptively to variance of the environment and establishes a stable locomotion while suppressing the energy consumption.",

The LEM is suitable for real time simulation and virtual environment interaction. The approach implements a static solution for elastic global deformation of objects filled with fluids based on Pascal's Principle and the volume conservation. The volumes are discretised into long elements, defining meshes several order of magnitudes smaller than tetrahedral or cubic meshes. We show how these volumes are constructed when the method is applied to a general mesh. We also propose a method for collision detection when two such objects interact. Finally, we show how we can perform dynamic simulation when the physics of the objects are modeled using bulk variables: pressure, density, volume and stress. This approach is particularly interesting for real time simulation of soft tissue undergoing small deformations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Presents an extended Kalman filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation using the newly developed MARG (magnetic, angular rate, and gravity) sensors. Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation. A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time. Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels. In all cases the filter was able to converge and accurately track rotational motions.",

        "abstract": "We analyze inherent time-delay of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vision system in measuring postures of moving objects, and present the minimum sensing time-delay obtainable. Slow shutter speed in COTS vision systems causes motion-blur in moving objects, which invites vagueness in time-delay as well as in measured position. We can overcome the vagueness by introducing exposure time-delay. Considering the exposure time-delay and image transfer time of overlay boards, we can find out the minimum sensing time-delay (MSTD) in COTS vision systems. Also, by utilizing the field-interleaved scanning and slow readout speed of COTS cameras, we propose a posture determination algorithm that guarantees MSTD, which uses both field-based processing and processing during overlaying methods. To verify validity of the proposed MSTD and the algorithm, the overall time-delay of our COTS vision system is measured directly via pendulum experiments.",

A hybrid motion simulation consisting of both physical and numerical models is an effective method to test the motions of a spacecraft under zero G on the ground. The authors have developed a hybrid zero G motion simulator based on a highspeed parallel link mechanism. A wide response bandwidth and high stiffness of the simulator have made it possible to simulate the contact motions with high precision. In this paper, they evaluate analytically the simulator characteristics and verify experimentally the impact of dynamics on the hybrid motion simulation by comparing it with a collision experiment under zero G in a drop-shaft facility. The results imply that the simulator is highly reliable for the impact dynamics simulation under zero G.",

In this paper, we propose a simple color landmark model for self-localization and a fast landmark detection and tracking algorithm based on the proposed landmark model. We develop a color landmark with symmetric and repetitive structures, which shows invariant color histogram characteristics under some geometric distortions. Detection and tracking of the model are accomplished by a factored sampling technique in which color similarity is estimated by the color histogram intersection. We also use the color similarity to update the color histogram model of the landmark model for robust tracking under illumination change. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique through experiments in cluttered indoor environments.",

The need for this balance is particularly acute in space applications, where hostile environments demand fast reactions, and remote locations dictate careful management of consumables that cannot be replenished. However, fast reactions typically require procedural representations with limited scope and handling long-term considerations in a general fashion is often computationally expensive. We describe three major areas for autonomous systems for space exploration: free-flying spacecraft, planetary rovers, and ground communications stations. In each of these broad applications areas, we identify operational considerations requiring rapid response and considerations of long-term ramifications. We describe these issues in the context of ongoing efforts to deploy autonomous systems using planning and task execution systems.",

This paper investigates the relationship between robotic morphology and intelligence against task and/or environmental conditions and the characteristics of functions emerging in evolutionary robotic systems. The robotic system used in the study has a reconfigurable morphology and intelligence, which were designed by genetic programming. The robotic morphology is represented as a graph structure constructed from cells with motor and visual sensors, and the intelligence is a computer program defined by a parse tree. In this study, a simulation of a task in which the robot had to maintain a certain distance from an object was executed. The results clarify the importance of conformity between morphology and intelligence, and show that effective functions emerge as the result of such conformity between morphology, intelligence, task and environment.",

This work presents a NN planner, used to control a simulated robot in a stochastic landmark-navigation problem, which plans at an abstract level. The controller has both reactive components, based on actor-critic RL, and planning components inspired by the Dyna-PI architecture (this roughly corresponds to RL plus a model of the environment). Coarse planning is based on macro-actions defined as a sequence of identical primitive actions. It updates the evaluations and the action policy while generating simulated experience at the macro level with the model of the environment (a NN trained at the macro level). The simulations show how the controller works. They also show the advantages of using a discount coefficient tuned to the level of planning coarseness, and suggest that discounted RL has problems in dealing with long periods of time.",

One of the main issues in the robotic wheelchair research is autonomous obstacle avoidance for safety. However, this is difficult because most moving obstacles in the real world are human beings. They sometimes change their motion abruptly. The paper presents an intelligent wheelchair that can avoid collisions with such human pedestrians safely and comfortably for each other. We assume that the information whether or not a pedestrian has noticed the wheelchair and which direction he/she wants to go can appear in the face direction. Thus our intelligent wheelchair is continuously observing the pedestrian's face in its front area, realizing smooth passing by changing its collision avoidance strategy based on the face information and the range data from the ultrasonic sensors. Experimental results show the effectiveness and comfortableness of the proposed method.",

We first describe some of the control problems encountered in a typical, large, possibly unknown mechanical compliance, and present the result that shows the possibility to cope with these uncertainties in an adaptive way. Next, we describe the initial development of a new prototype arm under construction in our laboratory. The arm is designed to achieve arbitrary position tracking in 3D with controlled effective compliance at the joints.",

However, parallel manipulators such as a Stewart platform have relatively small workspace compared to serial manipulators. Based on the characteristics of small motion range, nonlinear coefficient matrices can be approximated to constant ones. The modeling errors caused by such approximation are compensated for by an H-infinity controller that treats the error as disturbance. The proposed inverse dynamics controller with approximate dynamics combined with H-infinity control shows good tracking performance even for fast tracking control in which computation of full dynamics is not easy to implement.",

We present here a new type of image-based map formed by panoramic models enriched with depth and 3D planarity information. We take an advantage of the scene geometry implicitly contained in the model to localize a mobile robot that is moving in the same environment. The novelty of this model compared to the existing image-based maps is that the motion of the robot is not restricted to a predefined path or locations close to the original images. Experimental results demonstrate this approach.",

        "abstract": "Many control applications are by nature distributed, not only over different processes but also over several processors. Managing such a system with respect to the startup of processes, internal communications and state changes quickly becomes a very complex task. The paper presents a distributed control architecture which supports a formal model of computation as described by Lyons and Arib (1989). The architecture is primarily intended for robot control but has a wide range of potential applications. We motivate the design and implementation of the architecture by discussing the desired properties of a robot system capable of doing real-time tasks like manipulation. This leads to functionality such as a process algebra controlling the life-cycle of the processes, grouping and distribution of processes and internal communication transparent to location. Our implementation does not in itself introduce any bottlenecks due to a tree structure with local control over processes which gives an efficient and scalable architecture. At the end, an example scenario in which a fairly advanced problem like opening a door using a mobile robot with a manipulator arm is demonstrated in the presented framework.",

The framework is based on a task-oriented approach which builds on the \"task deduction\" capabilities of a VR system and a task planning component. Robots far from the control station can be controlled as easily as robots near it. This paves the way for a new quality of user-friendly man-machine interfaces for automation applications. This work has been enhanced by a new structure that allows to distribute the VR application over multiple computers. With this new step, it is now possible for multiple users to work together in the same virtual room, using only an Internet or ISDN connection. The distribution technology has been further developed to run the virtual world on many synchronized PC so that a panorama projection or even a cave can be run with 10 PC instead of high-end workstations, thus cutting down the costs for such a visualization environment drastically and allowing for a new range of applications.",

The theoretical analysis and design method of this actuator unit is presented. This actuator can rotate a spherical rotor. The orientation of the spherical rotor, which has three degree of freedom, is controlled by solving nonholonomic kinematics equations between the rotor and the drive unit.

        "abstract": "A dexterous tele-micromanipulation system using haptic interfaces has been developed for the application in assembling electrical/optical parts for electrical devices, micro-machine, etc. The paper describes the development of visual operation support systems for tele-micromanipulation systems. Because of its better manipulation positioning accuracy, stiffness and speed characteristics, a parallel mechanism micromanipulator was chosen for our system. While the parallel manipulator has the above-mentioned merit, there is the disadvantage that the parallel mechanism's workspace is narrow and the translation motion workspace changes depends on the posture of end-effector. Providing workspace information in real time to the human operator, he can recognize the workspace and helps planning the micromanipulation process. A parallel manipulator motion is restricted by three factors: mechanical limits of the passive joints, collision between the links and actuators limitations. Results of numerical workspace analysis considering the above factors are shown. Based on the workspace analysis, a VR simulator and workspace display systems for micromanipulator are proposed. The feasibility of the use of a workspace display system for micromanipulation is then discussed.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this study is to investigate the intelligence necessary for a machine such as a human-friendly robot working in an environment where humans and robots coexist. It seems to be required to manufacture a human-friendly robot that can communicate with human beings as a test bed or platform. Since face and facial expressions are crucial factors for communication, we have been developing a face robot which has a human-like face and can express facial expressions similar to human being. The important factors of the face robot for coexistence and communication with humans are: 1. human size and compactness; and 2. ease of control. While we have used air cylinders with pressurized air for the first-generation of face robot, to accomplish these two factors, we decided to use a SMA (shaped memory alloy) actuator driven by electricity and built the second-generation of face robot. Although we succeeded in making a human size face robot, it came to clear that the SMA does not have enough power and speed. To overcome these issues, we developed an air-tube-actuator driven by pressurized air and manufactured the third-generation of face robot. In the paper, we show how to build the third-generation of face robot and its basic ability.",

First, a mechanism to estimate the relation between the sensor inputs and the control outputs is derived based on the least-mean-square method. Then, by observing the information matrix of the estimator, a method to find robot's redundancy with respect to a given task is derived. Applying the proposed scheme to the visual servoing task of a manipulator, we show several experimental results demonstrating that the method can find redundancy automatically, and can assign the redundant degrees to another task.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method to deal with false matches that occur in almost every iteration of iterative closest point (ICP) based registration algorithms. First, a set of correspondences between the two images to be registered are established using the standard ICP criterion. From this set of correspondences, the algorithm as described in Liu et al. (2000) is employed to estimate the essential point defined by geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors. After a rigid motion, the essential point must be equidistant from reflected correspondences and thus, relative differences between motion equations can be computed and geometric histograms are then constructed at each step of the iteration. False matches are eliminated by only selecting correspondences that show a small relative difference between the two sides of the motion equation. A number of experiments based on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate, robust, and efficient for the registration of free-form shapes with large motions.",

        "abstract": "As highly complicated interaction dynamics exist, it is therefore extremely difficult to design controllers for legged robots. Evolutionary robotics is one of the most promising approaches, but there still exist several problems that have to be solved. One of the critical problems is that evolved agents generally tend to over adapt to their given environments through the evolutionary process. In other words, they lack rich adaptability. Therefore, it is highly necessary to establish a method that enables one to efficiently construct adaptive controllers that can cope with different situations. For this purpose we introduce the concept of neuromodulators, allowing the evolvement of neural networks which can adjust not only the synaptic weights, but also the structure of the neural network by blocking and/or activating synapses or neurons. We apply this concept to create an adaptive controller for a quadruped robot which not only can walk forward but also regulate the torque output applied to each joint, according to the current situation.",

In this paper, we describe both batch and online shape-from-motion algorithms for omnidirectional cameras, and a precise calibration technique that improves the accuracy of both methods. The shape-from-motion and calibration methods are general, and they handle a wide variety of omnidirectional camera geometries. In particular, the methods do not require that the camera-mirror combination have a single center of projection. We describe a noncentral camera that we have developed, and show experimentally that combining shape-from-motion with this design produces highly accurate motion estimates.",

        "abstract": "The research in the field of advanced robotics is turning its attention more and more to man and his assistance, by developing systems such as service robots, personal robots, and even humanoid robots. Interaction control of such robot manipulators is of paramount importance for an effective execution of manipulation and tracking and, over all, for a safe and effective interaction with the humans. The paper concerns the problem of the control of an 8 degree of freedom anthropomorphic arm named DEXTER, mounted on the mobile platform of the MOVAID System, a robotic system for household personal assistance. The goal is to realize a compliant control for this manipulator in tasks of assistance to disabled and elderly people. On the basis of the control theory applied to industrial robotics, a specific compliant control solution has been developed for the DEXTER peculiar mechanical structure and actuation system, which cause a coupled joint configuration. The solution provides the capability of regulating the robot compliance according to the level of stiffness of the interaction environment. The paper describes the theoretical model of the control system, the implementation on the MOVAID platform and the experimental results in the execution of a set of demonstration tasks.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle odometry is a nonlinear dynamical system in echelon form. Accordingly, a general solution can be written by solving the nonlinear equations in the correct order. Another implication of this structure is that a completely general solution to the linearized (perturbative) dynamics exists. The associated vector convolution integral is the general relationship between the output error and both the input error and reference trajectory. Solutions for errors in individual coordinates are in the form of line integrals in state space. Response to initial conditions and translational scale errors, among others, is path independent and vanishes on all closed trajectories. Response to other errors is path dependent and can be reduced to expressions in error moments of the reference trajectory. These path dependent errors vanish on closed symmetric paths, among others. These theoretical results and the underlying error expressions have many uses in design, calibration, and evaluation of odometry systems.",

The aim of the method is to estimate all joint angles to manipulate objects in the virtual space. In this method, the hand regions are extracted from multiple images obtained by the multi-viewpoint camera system. By integrating multi-viewpoint silhouette images, a hand pose is reconstructed as a \"voxel model\". Then all joint angles are estimated using three dimensional model fitting between hand model and voxel model. Two experiments were performed: (1) the estimation of joint angles by the silhouette images from the hand-pose simulator, (2) hand pose estimation using real hand images. The experimental results indicate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for vision-based interfaces, though it requires faster implementation for real-time processing.",

The experiment shows that the system can recognize human action like human does.

        "abstract": "Recently, the evolutionary robotics (ER) approach has attracted attention in the field of robotics and artificial life, since it can automatically synthesize controllers by taking the embodiment and the interaction dynamics with the environment into account. However, the ER approach still has several issues to be solved. One is that it becomes significantly difficult to evolve the whole controller in one go (1-shot evolution), as task complexity and/or environment interaction dynamics increases. This is called the bootstrap problem. It is necessary to develop a method that can efficiently increase a controllers' ability without impairing the previously obtained ones. We propose a method for incremental evolution of neurocontrollers by introducing a receptor-ligand concept, the polymorphic property of neural circuits through diffusion-reaction mechanism of chemical substances, so-called neuromodulators. To investigate the effectiveness of our approach, we take a peg-pushing task, which requires an appropriate sequence of behavior to accomplish a task, as a practical example.",

        "abstract": "We model human sensations in virtual reality applications using cascade neural networks. In the modeling process, the dimension of inputs presented to the humans and the sensation systems may be very high. In this research we propose using the independent component analysis (ICA) to achieve input reduction. We obtain human sensation data from a full-body motion virtual reality interface - \"motion-based movie\". A fixed-point ICA algorithm is applied to achieve feature extraction and input selection for reducing the dimension of the environmental stimulus data. The fidelity of the sensation models trained using the reduced inputs is verified by the hidden Markov model based similarity measure. The performance of input reduction using ICA is compared with that using the principal component analysis. Experimental results showed that the input selection scheme based on ICA is capable of improving the modeling performance of the computational sensation systems and reducing the input dimension by 60%.",

From the viewpoint of the recognition of environment and the maneuverability of teleoperator, it is desired that one should be able to deal with the teleoperation like the usual operation and get the feeling of directly manipulating objects by the tool. This study accomplishes this goal by reconstructing the slave environment into a compact spherical display at the master side and realizing accurate visual/haptic registration. The validity of proposed system is demonstrated by experiments of teleoperation.",

        "abstract": "We (1999) have previously presented a new scan-matching algorithm based on the iterative dual correspondence (IDC) algorithm, which showed a good localization performance even in the case of severe changes in the environment. The problem with the IDC algorithm is that there is no good way to estimate the covariance matrix of the position estimate, thus prohibits an effective fusion with other position estimates from other sensors, e.g., by means of the Kalman filter. In this paper we present a new way to estimate the covariance matrix by estimating the Hessian matrix of the error function that is minimized by the IDC scan-matching algorithm. Simulation results show that the estimated covariance matrix correspond well to the real one.",

This system uses a combination of multiple sources of information and model matching to detect and track a human hand so that the user can point toward an object of interest and guide the robot to go near to it or locate that object's position in the room.

The kinematical and dynamic equations of the two parts were derived apart. The proposed control approach combines organically a conventional model-based controller with a neural networks controller. The neural networks approximate the dynamic anti-model of FLP and decompose the desired trajectory of end point into two parts, desired trajectory of axis of the last joint and desired outer corner of the last joint. Those would be realized by conventional controllers. By combining, the approach has not only solved the problem of nonlinearity and calculation inefficiency of the dynamic model of a flexible manipulator but also lessen greatly the size of the neural network and thus improve the convergence speed The proposed approach achieves fine control effect on the emulation with a three links planar manipulator with a flexible last link.",

For statically stable gaits, by placing some minor restrictions on how the leg motions are generated, we develop an easily computable classification of the best gait patterns (leg phasings) to be used for any given motion. This simple geometric construction allows easy generation of stable, omnidirectional walking gaits for any quadruped satisfying only some very weak assumptions about the location of the center of mass relative to the workspace of the legs. It is also well-suited to a modular approach in which the control of individual legs is decentralized. We also implement an omnidirectional dynamic trot gait using a similar approach. Transitions involving a change in the direction of motion of the robot are initiated at one of two fixed points of the foot placement curves for each leg in all gaits. Experimental data is presented showing the effectiveness of these techniques.",

        "abstract": "Development of optimal design methods for general 6 degree-of-freedom parallel manipulators is important in obtaining an optimal architecture or pose for the best kinematic performance. Use of a performance index such as the condition number of the Jacobian matrix that is composed of nonhomogeneous physical units may lack physical significance. In order to avoid unit mismatch in the Jacobian matrix, the paper presents a new Jacobian formulation by use of three point generalized coordinates, which results in a (9/spl times/9) dimensionally homogeneous Jacobian matrix. The condition number of the new Jacobian matrix is used to design an optimal architecture or pose of parallel manipulators for best dexterity. A design example with a Gough-Stewart platform parallel manipulator by using the proposed formulation is shown to generate the same optimal configuration as from using the other Jacobian formulation methods.",

The two-link flexible robot arm consists of a first rigid link and a second flexible link. The first and second joint angular velocities are described by use of four cubic polynomial functions. Then, applying both the constraint conditions and the initial and final conditions of the joint angular velocities, the trajectory of the two-link flexible robot arm is expressed by use of the four unknown parameters. Then, the fitness function of the genetic algorithm for the residual vibration reduction of the second flexible link is defined using the four unknown parameters as the genes, and the optimal trajectory planning algorithm is constructed by use of the genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the numerical calculations and the experiments were carried out, and it is confirmed that the residual vibrations can be greatly reduced.",

In this paper, we investigate the computational mechanisms for visual attention in such a system. Stimuli in the environment excite a dynamical neural network that implements a saliency map, i.e., a winner-take-all competition between stimuli while simultaneously smoothing out noise and suppressing irrelevant inputs. In real-time, this system computes new targets for the shift of gaze, executed by the head-eye system of the robot. The redundant degrees-of-freedom of the head-eye system are resolved through a learned inverse kinematics with optimization criterion. We also address important issues how to ensure that the coordinate system of the saliency map remains correct after movement of the robot. The presented attention system is built on principled modules and generally applicable for any sensory modality.",

The PPAM design, operation and characteristics are presented. A rotative joint actuator, made of two antagonistically coupled PPAMs, is discussed to demonstrate their suitability for robotics. It has several properties that are similar to those of skeletal joint actuators. Positioning tasks are seen to be performed very accurately using a simple PI control. Furthermore, the antagonistic actuator can easily be made to have a soft or careful touch, contributing greatly to a safe robot operation. In view of all the characteristics PPAMs are very well suited for automation and robotic applications.",

In a detection phase, the probabilities of the color of each pixel belonging to various objects are computed. Then templates of a person are placed at various image positions and the criterion of matching to a person is computed for each position. If a template is matched to a person, a more precise position of the person is determined near the matched position.

This controller is successfully tested in both simulations and experiments. It is capable of adjusting to step changes in reference posture, as well as standing on a moving balance board. Finally, we suggest tests to benchmark posture controllers.",

This is not the case for multi-agent systems, however. We describe one approach to representing joint team activities using a finite state machine augmented with synchronization primitives for orchestration of group activities. This representation encodes a sequence of activities that can be distributed across a team of robots and executed in a coordinated manner. We then show how such a representation can be mapped onto a behavior-based formalism for execution, as supported by a distributed, multi-robot control architecture, CAMPOUT. We demonstrate the proposed mechanisms within the context of a challenging task, where two rovers collectively carry an extended container over rough terrain.",

A semi-autonomous control method for omnidirectional wheelchairs is proposed. In addition to allowing the normal joystick commands of the wheelchair operator, this method provides a collision avoidance function using external sensors. The proposed method does not employ unexpected autonomous movements conflicting with the operator's joystick commands, because this tends to create discomfort for users and can be dangerous for infirm patients. Instead, the proposed method merely alerts the operator to the presence of an obstacle; this is accomplished by changing the impedance of the joystick essentially creating resistance against moving the joystick in the dangerous. direction. The wheelchair's motion remains controlled only by the operator's joystick commands, while a collision is avoided successfully. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments with an onmidirectional wheelchair.",

The second model uses human brain EOG (electrooculography) signals picked up by electrodes placed on both sides of a person's head to carry out the same eye movement detection and control tasks as mentioned above. Theoretical issues on sensor failure detection and recovery, and signal processing techniques used in sensor data fusion are studied using statistical methods and artificial neural network based techniques.

The morphology of the body and neural systems have a close relationship to each other. The model of the robot is designed so that the morphology of the body and neural systems emerge simultaneously. The morphology of the body and neural systems are generated using a genetic programming. The tasks are that the robots move on ground including hills of different heights in the two dimensional lateral simulated world under the effect of gravity. The robots are evaluated based both on a moving distance and an efficiency. As a result, various combinations between the morphology of the body and neural systems of the robots were emerged. The evolved robots were able to go over hills which they had not experienced.",

The state space is partitioned into cells and the stability regions found using cell to cell mapping. Our new approach gives a fractal rough set identity to the domains of attraction where cells are identified according to their fractal dimension as fully stable, possibly stable and unstable. There the stability domain is a rough set where fully stable cells determine the lower approximation of the domain, and possibly stable cells its rough boundary. Consequently, the totality of these cells forms an upper approximation to the rough stability domain. The boundary of this domain which is a rough set of cells having a fractal dimension as an attribute of roughness is smoothed, minimising the inherent stability uncertainty of the region, using a reinforcement learning technique which takes into account the stability history of each fractal/rough cell. This new approach intended to reinforce the performance of a controller under stability uncertainty is applied for illustrative purposes to a two-axis robot arm under dynamic load.",

The extreme versatility of the modular systems requires a new paradigm in programming. We present a software architecture for this type of robot, in particular the PolyBot, which has been developed through its third generation. The architecture, based on the properties of the PolyBot electro-mechanical design, features a multi-master/multi-slave structure in a multi-threaded environment, with three layers of communication protocols.

Robot dynamics algorithms in terms of so called normalized quasi- velocities are recursive in nature and consists of two recursions: one starts from a base of the manipulator towards its tip and the second in opposite direction. Both recursions are described by making use of vector-matrix notation. In the second work authors introduce an instantaneous eigenstructure quasi-velocity formulation as a result of numerical mass matrix factorization. Both PD controls were tested on a model of manipulator with two degrees of freedom. In this paper we adopt standard PD control known in robotic literature to a case when robot dynamics is formulated in terms of quasi-velocities.",

It is based on wave variable transformations and identification of time delay properties. This scheme achieves better position and force tracking than similar architectures, by estimating the current value of time delay and compensating its variations by adjusting a single control parameter. We derive some of the analytical properties of this scheme, and we show system performance by simulating a simple Internet-based teleoperation system.",

        "abstract": "A lot of research on assembly automation problems has been made by many researchers from a variety of communities, e.g., manufacturing, artificial intelligence and so on. They mostly focused on the geometric constraints related to a considered task, e.g., relative configuration change between the peg and the hole. Such an approach, however, seems valid only when the dimensional tolerance is fairly large so that it allows the relative configuration of the two mating parts to be changed in an obvious fashion. The paper investigates how highly precise assembly tasks can be automated. Tolerance considered in the present study is in the range of 3 /spl mu/m /spl sim/ 9 /spl mu/m. Currently the assembly task is being operated by skilled human workers. In order to analyze the insertion task, we focus on force sensory information and attitude measurements involved in the high-precision peg-in-hole task of a polygon mirror unit because a position-based analysis under such a narrow dimensional tolerance seems inappropriate. A variety of insertion experiments are conducted by skilled and unskilled subjects for comparison purposes.",

That is, the situation where the platform is at rest and is then subject to an impulsive disturbance. The hydraulic actuators are modelled as simple spring-dashpot systems and the stiffness and damping matrices of the system are derived. It is found that the damping and stiffness matrices are simply proportional to each other and this simplifies the dynamics greatly. The general solution to the equations of motion is a linear combination of eigensolutions. The eigensolutions are damped oscillations about the harmonic screws of the undamped system. The characteristic values associated with each eigensolution can also be found in terms of the undamped frequencies. Finally some remarks are made concerning the possibility of the system being fully damped.",

These components are to support autonomy software which plans and schedules robot activities. CLARAty modifies the conventional 3-level robotic architecture into a 2-layered design: the functional layer and the decision layer. The former provides a representation of the system components and an implementation of their functionalities. The latter is the decision-making engine that drives the former. It globally reasons about the goals, system resources, and system state. The functional layer is composed of a set of interrelated object-oriented hierarchies consisting of active and passive objects that represent the system abstraction levels. We present an overview of the design of the functional layer. It is decomposed into a set of reusable core components and a set of extended components that adapt the reusable set to different hardware implementations. The reusable components provide interface definitions and implementations of basic functionality, provide local executive capabilities, manage local resources, and support decision layer queries.",

        "abstract": "We are trying to induce a quadruped robot to walk dynamically on irregular terrain by using a neural system model. In our previous study, we integrated several reflexes into a CPG (central pattern generator) and realized adaptive 2D walking on terrain of medium degree of irregularity. In this paper, in order to make the role of a CPG be clear, we investigate the relation between parameters of a CPG and the mechanical system by simulations and experiments. In addition, we show a newly developed quadruped robot, of which mechanism is designed to make adaptive 3D walking on irregular terrain be realized more simply. At this moment, 3D walking on flat terrain is realized by using a neural system model consisting of CPG and reflexes.",

We derive the dynamics of the mobile manipulator considering it as the combined system of the manipulator and the mobile platform. The planning problem is formulated as an optimal control problem. To solve the problem, we use the concept of the order of priority. A gradient-based iterative algorithm which synthesize the gradient function in a hierarchical manner based on the order of priority is used. The simulation results of the 2-link planar nonholonomic mobile manipulator are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

This research is directed, mainly, to the understanding of comfortable human movements constrained by the external environment. To get a deeper insight into the crank rotation task, we develop a mathematical model and analyze a weighted minimum norm muscle force distribution scheme that can be used in the resolution of the force redundancy. Analysis of experimental data shows that in comfortable motions a human is likely to modulate the rotational stiffness of the crank. This gives an additional constraint that can be used in the resolution of the force redundancy by optimization techniques.",

The focus of this paper is to solve the two practical problems encountered in optical vision based systems in underwater environments: (1) navigation of AUV when cable is invisible in the image; and (2) selection of the correct cable when there are many similar features appearing in the image. The proposed sensor fusion scheme uses the dead reckoning position uncertainty with a 2D position model of the cable to predict the region of interest in the image. This reduces the processing data, increases the processing speed and avoids tracking other similar features appearing in the optical image. The proposed method uses a priori map of the cable for AUV navigation when the cable features are invisible in the predicted region in the image. An experiment was conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm using the AUV \"Twin-Burger 2\". The experimental results obtained show how the proposed method handles the above-mentioned practical problems.",

        "abstract": "The trend toward multiple-spacecraft missions requires autonomous teams of spacecraft to coordinate their activities when sharing limited resources. The paper describes how an iterative repair planner/scheduler can reason about the activities of multiple spacecraft at abstract levels in order to greatly improve the scheduling of their use of shared resources. By finding consistent schedules at abstract levels, refinement choices can be preserved for use in robust plan execution systems. We present an algorithm for summarizing the metric resource requirements of an abstract activity based on the resource usages of its potential refinements. We find that reasoning about this summary information and that of state constraints can offer exponential improvements in the time to find consistent schedules with an iterative repair planner. We analytically describe the conditions under which these improvements are made and show that sometimes the extra overhead involved does not warrant their use. We apply these techniques within the ASPEN planner/scheduler to a domain where a team of rovers must coordinate their schedules to avoid conflicts over shared resources. Experiments using the ASPEN planner/scheduler in a Mars multi-rover domain support our analyses and compare techniques for controlling decomposition.",

        "abstract": "An important missing piece in the medical robotics literature is the lack of systematic methods to quantitatively compare different manipulator designs, and to evaluate kinematic configurations chosen for telesurgical manipulators in application-critical tasks. Such a quantitative method is especially important during design stage to make an informed decision between various design alternatives. In the paper, a quantitative method to evaluate the kinematic ability of surgical manipulators to perform the critical tasks of suturing and knot tying is presented. The proposed method does not require a physical prototype. This is achieved by running typical tool motions during these tasks through the inverse kinematics of the manipulators and checking if the system can accommodate the desired motions. The system can perform a given motion if the whole trajectory lies continuously within the workspace of the manipulator. Open surgical suturing motion data collected from experiments done with expert surgeons is used as the set of desired tool motions used in the analysis. The method is applied to compare two different wrist configurations of telesurgical slave manipulators, intended for use in minimally invasive surgery, by looking at the requirements on joint ranges and wrist manipulability during these motions.",
