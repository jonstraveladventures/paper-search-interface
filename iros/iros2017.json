        "abstract": "This paper describes a high-frame-rate (HFR) vision system that can detect multiple objects in an image of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels at 12,000 frames per seconds (fps). An optimized algorithm is proposed based on conventional Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithms for hardware implementation. By implementing the proposed algorithm on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) of a high-speed vision platform, multi-object in an image can be detected at 12,000 fps under complex background. In hardware implementation, 64 pixels were processed in parallel with 80 MHz camera clock. Source image and detection results can be transferred to personal computer (PC) in real-time for recording or post-processing. Our developed HFR multi-object detection system was verified by performing several evaluations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper deals with the open-loop characterization of a micromanipulation system actuated by thermocapillary convective flows. Micrometric size objects placed at the air/liquid interface are actuated by heating the surface of the liquid using a laser. The heat generates a surface tension gradient at the interface which induces thermocapillary convective flows that are used to move the objects. In this paper, the performances of this approach are analyzed based on open-loop experiments. Several actuation strategies are proposed and discussed. The experimental results highlight the potential of this approach since velocities up to several millimeters per second are obtained. However the precision of the positioning is not ensured by open-loop actuation, so closed-loop control will be necessary in future works. As a first step towards closed-loop control, this paper proposes a model of the system. This model is based on the open-loop experimental results, but the proposed methodology can be applied to any setup that use thermocapillary convective flows for particle manipulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses an omnidirectional locomotion control to make a biped robot walk back and forth, turn to any direction, move sideways and carry out them seamlessly. This is achieved by integrating smooth-path-tracking and lateral walking controllers that have been proposed by the authors, which is not straightforward because the path tracking is designed to converge to a referential path while the lateral walking aims to go away from the path. It can be avoided by extending the path-tracking controller to consecutively redraw the orbit that passes the middle of the feet. The proposed controller is designed completely in the robot-centric frame, namely, all the references and the manipulated variables are represented from the robot's viewpoint so that the operator can issue the referential values in the first-person view. Additionally, as the robot is ruled by neither a plan of footsteps nor time-dependent trajectories, it can flexibly respond to various perturbations. The validity of the proposed controller is investigated through computer simulations and an application to navigation of the robot is also shown.",

The objects are manipulated in simple harmonic motions and the manipulation speed has been achieved up to 3000 Hz. While the maximum speed was only about 130 Hz in previous works, the speed is advanced with an additional order in this work. Based on the experimental results, we find that the gain decreases along the line of -20 dB/decade in a logarithmic plot. The transfer function based on a theoretical model was employed for interpreting the results. The experimental gain and theoretical gain were well matched. Finally, experiments with red blood cells were performed and it supports the feasibility of applying such ultra-fast manipulation to cell evaluations.",

In this paper, we show that adapting the propulsion mode, the general path following algorithm can be used for any microswimmer behaving as a nonholonomic system. For that purpose, we study a magnetic robot with a flexible tail that mimics the spermatozoa locomotion mechanism. A frequency and amplitude characterization of the flexible swimmer using an oscillating magnetic field is shown. To adapt the propulsion mode, we develop a 3D magnetic field control based on the steering angular velocities which are computed from the path following algorithm in order to propel and steer the flexible robot to reach a desired location in space and achieve for the first time a 3D closed-loop motion control using a swimmer with flexible flagella.",

The sensor streams from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots (UGV) are fused in one consistent map. The UAV camera data are used to generate 3D point clouds that are fused with the 3D point clouds generated by a rolling 2D laser scanner at the UGV. The registration method is based on the matching of corresponding planar segments that are extracted from the point clouds. Based on the registration, an approach for a globally optimized localization is presented. Apart from the structural information of the point clouds, it is important to mention that no further information is required for the localization. Two examples show the performance of the overall registration.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing objects from the point cloud captured by modern 3D sensors is an important task for robots operating autonomously in real-world environments. However, the existing well-performing approaches typically suffer from a trade-off between resolution of representation and computational efficiency. In this paper, raw point cloud normals are fed into the Point Convolution Network (PCN) without any other representation converts. The point cloud set disordered and unstructured problems are tackled by Kd-tree-based local permutation and spatial commutative pooling strategies proposed in this paper. Experiments on ModelNet illustrate that our method has two orders of magnitude less floating point computation in each non-linear mapping layer while it contributes to significant classification accuracy improvement. Compared to some of the state-of-the-art methods using the 3D volumetric image convolution, the PCN method also yields comparable classification accuracy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of 3D object instance recognition and pose estimation of localized objects in cluttered environments using convolutional neural networks. Inspired by the descriptor learning approach of Wohlhart et al. [1], we propose a method that introduces the dynamic margin in the manifold learning triplet loss function. Such a loss function is designed to map images of different objects under different poses to a lower-dimensional, similarity-preserving descriptor space on which efficient nearest neighbor search algorithms can be applied. Introducing the dynamic margin allows for faster training times and better accuracy of the resulting low-dimensional manifolds. Furthermore, we contribute the following: adding in-plane rotations (ignored by the baseline method) to the training, proposing new background noise types that help to better mimic realistic scenarios and improve accuracy with respect to clutter, adding surface normals as another powerful image modality representing an object surface leading to better performance than merely depth, and finally implementing an efficient online batch generation that allows for better variability during the training phase. We perform an exhaustive evaluation to demonstrate the effects of our contributions. Additionally, we assess the performance of the algorithm on the large BigBIRD dataset [2] to demonstrate good scalability properties of the pipeline with respect to the number of models.",

        "abstract": "Suturing is an essential requirement for surgical robots. Current designs of needle drivers require significant forces to be applied so that the needle will not flip or slip between the jaws when inserted into the tissue. The required force implies that most designs are based on rigid instruments with a straight shaft that induces less dexterity. Flexible robotics provides great dexterity to achieve the task, although often it lacks the capability to apply large forces and therefore hold the surgical needle firmly. Solutions can be found in how the needle driver's jaws are designed. This paper presents improved designs for needle grasping tools for flexible robotic instruments, to be produced directly with selective laser melting. Features on the gripping surface were embedded to increase the gripping effectiveness even in the presence of limited grasping force. A detailed characterisation has been performed for each design showing improvements with respect to the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a COM trajectory generation method for 3D walking and skating motion by nonlinear optimization. In our method, we solve the following problems: (1) dealing with both walking and skating motion in the same framework, (2) generating center of mass (COM) trajectory faster than execution time, (3) executing motion with large acceleration. For solving (1) and (2), we calculate the COM trajectory at every step and introduce frictional constraints to the Divergent Component of Motion as terminal conditions. By changing the terminal condition, we can generate both skating and walking motion. Besides, the nonlinear constrained optimization using Gauss Pseudospectral Method is introduced for solving (2) and (3). Thanks to this method, we generate the 3D COM trajectory considering contact constraints and kinematic constraints faster than execution time. Finally, the walking and skating experiment were carried out to confirm the effectiveness of our method using life-sized humanoid HRP-2. Applying the proposed method, HRP-2 could successfully walk at 0.4 [m/s] and skate at 1.0 [m/s].",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 2-point algorithm for relative pose estimation of a monocular camera mounted on a ground vehicle. Specifically, the geometric model is developed by combining two-view geometry with planar motion constraint. Based on the proposed model, the relative camera pose information can be estimated efficiently with at least 2 feature correspondences. Besides, the proposed algorithm can recover rotation independently with translation so that pure rotation can be computed stably under planar motion. Both experiments on synthetic data and in real world are presented. In the synthetic data experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with other well-known algorithms to illustrate its high accuracy and robustness to image noise. In addition, the great robustness of the proposed algorithm to nonplanar motion is demonstrated as well. Furthermore, experiment are carried out based on KITTI Vision Benchmark, and the result indicates that the proposed algorithm has better performance than 5-point algorithm for monocular visual odometry and has a wide range of applicability.",

While the distribution of gas in the air is inherently a 3D phenomenon, most of the previous works have downgraded the problem into 2D search, using only ground robots. In this paper, we have designed a bio-inspired 3D algorithm involving cross-wind L\u00e9vy Walk, spiralling and upwind surge. The algorithm has been validated using high-fidelity simulations, and evaluated in a wind tunnel which represents a realistic controlled environment, under different conditions in terms of wind speed, source release rates and odor threshold. Studying success rate and execution time, the results show that the proposed method outperforms its 2D counterpart and is robust to the various setup conditions, especially to the source release rate and the odor threshold.",

        "abstract": "THIS paper presents the development of a bidirectional fabric-based soft pneumatic actuator requiring low fluid pressurization for actuation, which is incorporated into a soft robotic gripper to demonstrate its utility. The bidirectional soft fabric-based actuator is able to provide both flexion and extension. Fabrication of the fabric actuators is simple as compared to the steps involved in traditional silicone-based approach. In addition, the fabric actuators are able to generate comparably larger vertical grip resistive force at lower operating pressure than elastomeric actuators and 3D-printed actuators, being able to generate resistive grip force up to 20N at 120 kPa. Five of the bidirectional soft fabric-based actuators are deployed within a five-fingered soft robotic gripper, complete with five casings and a base. It is capable of grasping a variety of objects with maximum width or diameter closer to its bending curvature. A cutting task involved bimanual manipulation was demonstrated successfully with the gripper. To incorporate intelligent control for such a task, a soft force made completely of compliant material was attached to the gripper, which allows determination of whether the cutting task is completed. To the authors' knowledge, this work is the first study which incorporates two soft robotic grippers for bimanual manipulation with one of the grippers sensorized to provide closed loop control.",

        "abstract": "Robotic coverage path planning describes the problem of determining a configuration space trajectory for successively covering a specified workspace target area with the robot's end-effector. Performing coverage path planning for mobile robots further requires solving the problem of robot placement, i.e. determining of suitable robot base positions to perform the task. Finding an optimal solution is hard as both problems cannot be solved independently. Combined robot placement and coverage planning is particularly interesting if repositioning of the robot is costly or if simultaneous repositioning and end-effector motion is not desired. In this paper, we present a general approach for combined robot placement and coverage path planning that takes constraints like collision avoidance and static stability into account. In contrast to related approaches, we focus on mobile manipulation tasks that require a fixed placement for executing coverage trajectory segments. The approach is evaluated in two scenarios that exemplify the broad range of possible applications: The coverage of a building facade using a robotic manlift and the coverage of an industrial conveyer belt for maintenance tasks using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.",

However, the intrinsic underactuation of quadrotors may hinder the interaction task and also cause safety issues. In this paper, we present an admittance control-based scheme to perform PHUI with a fully actuated UAV. The system also benefits from the robustness provided by our fully actuated UAV implementation of the adaptive super twisting controller (ASTC). While validating our system in simulation, we also show the superior performance of the fully actuated UAV with respect to a standard quadcopter.",

        "abstract": "Nonlinear optimal control problems are challenging to solve due to the prevalence of local minima that prevent convergence and/or optimality. This paper describes nearest-neighbors optimal control (NNOC), a data-driven framework for nonlinear optimal control using indirect methods. It determines initial guesses for new problems with the help of precomputed solutions to similar problems, retrieved using k-nearest neighbors. A sensitivity analysis technique is introduced to linearly approximate the variation of solutions between new and precomputed problems based on their variation of parameters. Experiments show that NNOC can obtain the global optimal solution orders of magnitude faster than standard random restart methods, and sensitivity analysis can further reduce the solving time almost by half. Examples are shown on two optimal control problems in vehicle control.",

        "abstract": "Recent work in the field of bio-inspired robotic systems has introduced designs for modular robots that are able to assemble into structures (e.g., bridges, landing platforms, fences) using their bodies as the building components. Yet, it remains an open question as to how to program large swarms of robotic modules so that the assembly task is performed as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the problem of designing assembly algorithms is compounded by the scale of these systems, and by the lack of centralized guidance in unstructured environments. The main contribution of this work is a decentralized algorithm to assemble structures with modular robots. Importantly, we coordinate the robots so that docking actions can be parallelized. We show the correctness of our algorithm, and we demonstrate its scalability and generality through multiple scenarios in simulation. Experiments on physical robots demonstrate the validity of our approach in real-world settings.",

        "abstract": "Search and rescue missions and surveillance require finding targets in a large area. These tasks often use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with cameras to detect and move towards a target. However, common UAV approaches make two simplifying assumptions. First, they assume that observations made from different heights are deterministically correct. In practice, observations are noisy, with the noise increasing as the height used for observations increases. Second, they assume that a motion command executes correctly, which may not happen due to wind and other environmental factors. To address these, we propose a sequential algorithm that determines actions in real time based on observations, using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Our formulation handles both observations and motion uncertainty and errors. We run offline simulations and learn a policy. This policy is run on a UAV to find the target efficiently. We employ a novel compact formulation to represent the coordinates of the drone relative to the target coordinates. Our POMDP policy finds the target up to 3.4 times faster when compared to a heuristic policy.",

A key task for firefighters is to observe the \u201cfire front\u201d to chart the progress of the fire and areas it will likely spread next. Lack of information of the fire front causes many accidents. Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans for fire tracking, reducing hazards and saving operation costs. In this paper we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire. Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the UAV team in covering a spreading wildfire.",

We propose a distributed approach considering two main cases. In the first one, the obstacles are distinguishable, i.e., each obstacle is uniquely identifiable, which can be imagined as each obstacle having a different color, and in the second case, the obstacles are not distinguishable. Two possible applications of our algorithms are: 1) Search of a static object in an unknown environment. 2) Damage verification in unknown environments composed by multiple elements (e.g. buildings). The main contributions of this work are the following: 1) The algorithms guarantee exploring the whole environment in finite time even though each robot does not have full information about the part of the environment explored by other robots. 2) The method only requires limited communication between the robots. In both cases distinguishable and indistinguishable obstacles, the robots communicate only at rendezvous. 3) The algorithm scales well to hundreds of robots and obstacles. We tested in several simulations the performance of our algorithms for both cases, in terms of the distance traveled by the robots.",

People with facial paralysis are not able to blink, which leads to dry eyes and could cause permanent damage to the cornea. They are also prone to developing synkinesis during recovery, and a biofeedback-enabled rehabilitation is considered to prevent it. Based on these, we developed a robot system to support eyelid movements on the paralyzed side, based on the eye closure on the healthy side. The robot has a novel mechanism for supporting the eyelid control, made from soft material, which is called Eyelid Gating Mechanism (ELGM). ELGM deforms by simple rotational or linear actuation inputs and its deformation is customized to eyelid movements. Therefore, this robot can provide non-invasive and gentle support for eyelid movements. In this paper, we present the development and performance evaluation of the developed facial wearable robot.",

        "abstract": "Children with severe motor impairments require the use of assistive devices to perform activities of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces are not suited for children due to various factors such as surgical risks. In this paper, we present a non-invasive body-machine interface where upper body movements are recorded by wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) and used to control a robot arm. We develop a novel approach, called the virtual body model (VBM), which allows for control of high number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF). Our results show that participants could use the VBM to control up to five DOFs of a robot arm, and perform a pick-and-place task. Even with minimal training, trajectories of the end effector were smooth and positioning was accurate. These results show the potential of this safe, non-invasive approach to control high DOFs in children.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel four-limbed robot having high mobility capability in extreme environments. At disaster sites, there are various types of environments where a robot must move such as rough terrain with possibility of collapse, narrow places, stairs, vertical ladders and so forth. In this paper, first we categorized extreme environments based on three indexes: unevenness, narrowness, and inclination. To move in such extreme environments, we proposed a four-limbed robot having various locomotion styles such as bipedal/quadrupedal walking, crawling and ladder climbing. The main contribution of this paper is the concept and hardware design of the four-limbed robot. We developed a prototype of the four-limbed robot having commonly structured limbs. The number of DoF for the whole body is 29, with 7-DoFs in each limb and 1-DoF in the trunk. The robot weight is 110 kg, and the height is 1,290 mm when standing on two legs. The end-effector has hook-like shape. Verification of the prototype robot is conducted through simulations and experiments.",

Our method of video logging allows for accurate and automated dolphin location detection using a combination of Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and multi-orientation elliptical blob detection. These data are combined with MARG/IMU measurements to generate a localization estimate through a series of drift-correcting Kalman and gradient-descent filters, finalized with Incremental Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM2) pose-graph localization.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Automated assembly operations have traditionally been carried out using \u201chard automation\u201d, where all parts to be handled during the operation are located at known positions with very high accuracy. Such automation solutions are often mechanically very expensive to implement and also the programming time can be substantial. Hence, hard automation is only suitable for large batch sizes. However, with the upcoming programming paradigms based on joining preprogrammed subtasks (skills) to a complete solution, the programming time can be shortened significantly. Skills are subtasks with well defined interfaces in terms of pre- and postconditions. However, skills still rely on high accuracy as there is no methodology for handling the propagation of inaccuracies when combining the skills. Therefore, skills are typically only useful for hard automation situations. In cases with smaller batch sizes, the high accuracy property will have to be loosened to lower the costs on the hardware side. In this paper, we extend the skill interfaces with a unified formalism for how the skill propagates inaccuracies. The formalism includes how the inaccuracy propagation for a skill can be learned and how the learned propagations can be used to join the skills while also predicting how inaccuracies will propagate through the entire skill chain. We also briefly discuss the perspectives using the formalism to offline search for the most robust combinations of skills for the entire task.",

When interacting with a human operator, intuitiveness of operation is a major concern. To this end, we propose a redundancy solution that allows the mobile base to be fixed when working locally and moves it only when the robot approaches a set of constraints. These constraints include distance to singular poses, minimum of manipulability and distance to objects and angular deviation. Experimental results with a Kuka LWR4 arm mounted on a Neobotix MPO700 mobile base validate the proposed approach.",

The proposed approach utilizes a finite set of low-level motion primitives, each based on a piecewise affine feedback control, to generate complex motions in a gridded workspace. The constraints on allowable sequences of successive motion primitives are formalized through a maneuver automaton. At the higher level, a control policy generated by a shortest path non-deterministic algorithm determines which motion primitive is executed in each box of the gridded workspace. The overall framework yields a highly robust control design on both the low and high levels. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of this framework for multiple quadrocopters maneuvering in a 2D or 3D workspace.",

The model indicates that the velocity and temperature have a strong influence on viscous friction nonlinearly, whereas load torque significantly influences the Coulomb friction linearly and causes a slight Stribeck effect. The friction characteristics were investigated on the collaborative robot joints which are equipped with temperature sensor and harmonic reducer. The proposed model has been verified successfully under wide velocity, temperature and load range. In addition, the permillage of the rated current of the motor is used to scale the value of joint torque, so that the model can be applied in common industrial robot.",

        "abstract": "Frogs are capable of multiple locomotion modes including jumping and swimming, which enables them to adapt to various environmental conditions. This paper demonstrates a frog-inspired robot, which can mimic the swimming motion of a natural frog. The robot is developed based on dielectric elastomer actuators, which exhibits muscle-like behavior such as large voltage-induced deformation, high energy density, fast response and low weight. Inspired by the webbed feet of a frog, the foot actuator of the swimming robot is able to increase its projected area by 66% when subject to high voltage. Actuation of the foot actuators can significantly improve the averaged peak thrust by 34.5%. The total mass of the two dielectric elastomer actuators is 14g which only accounts for 13% of its total mass of 108g. The measured average swimming speed for a square wave voltage of 5kV and 0.25Hz is 19mm/s for the swimming robot. Future work of the project includes optimal design and control of this soft robot.",

        "abstract": "Performing remote manipulation tasks by tele-operation with limited bandwidth, communication delays and environmental differences is a challenging problem. In this paper, we learn a task-parameterized generative model from the teleoperator demonstrations using a hidden semi-Markov model that provides assistance in performing remote manipulation tasks. We present a probabilistic formulation to capture the intention of the teleoperator, and subsequently assist the teleoperator by time-independent shared control and/or time-dependent autonomous control formulations of the model. In the shared control mode, the model corrects the remote arm movement based on the current state of the teleoperator; whereas in the autonomous control mode, the model generates the movement of the remote arm for autonomous task execution. We show the formulation of the model with virtual fixtures and provide comparisons to benchmark our approach. Teleoperation experiments with the Baxter robot for reaching a movable target and opening a valve reveal that the proposed methodology improves the performance of the teleoperator and caters for environmental differences in performing remote manipulation tasks.",

The design consists of a sensory glove that is capable of jointly collecting data of finger poses, hand poses, as well as forces on palm and each phalanx. Specifically, the sensory glove employs a network of 15 IMUs to measure the rotations between individual phalanxes. Hand pose is then reconstructed using forward kinematics. Contact forces on the palm and each phalanx are measured by 6 customized force sensors made from Velostat, a piezoresistive material whose force-voltage relation is investigated. We further develop an open-source software pipeline consisting of drivers and processing code and a system for visualizing hand actions that is compatible with the popular Raspberry Pi architecture. In our experiment, we conduct a series of evaluations that quantitatively characterize both individual sensors and the overall system, proving the effectiveness of the proposed design.",

A unified attitude controller, together with a moment allocation scheme between elevons and motor differential thrust, is developed for all flight modes. A comparison study via real flight tests is performed to verify the effectiveness of using elevons in addition to motor differential thrust. With the well-designed switch scheme proposed in this paper, the aircraft can transit between different flight modes with negligible altitude drop or gain. Intensive flight tests have been performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in both manual and fully autonomous flight mode.",

Two new generalized metrics for quantifying locomotion performance are defined: amplitude-normalized stride correlation, and percent ineffective stance. Six different gaits are run on HAMR to validate the experimental setup and establish baseline performance. Furthermore, HAMR is compared with the cockroach, Blaberus Discoidalis, and with other legged robots. Future studies can leverage the experimental setup to study gait selection and transitions for small legged systems.",

        "abstract": "Human Swarm Interaction (HSI) is a new field which relates to the effective control of robotic swarms by human operators. The iterature has shown that the control of swarms can become quite complicated. On the other hand, Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) can offer intuitive control in a plethora of applications where other interfaces alone (e.g. joysticks) are inadequate or impractical, e.g. for people with motor disabilities. There are multiple types of BMI, but most of them rely on the analysis of ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) signals. The authors have previously shown that swarm behaviors elicit specific brain activity on human subjects that observe them. Motivated by this result, in this work, we present preliminary results of a hybrid BMI that combines information from the brain and an external device. An algorithm for extracting information from the frequency domain of EEG signals that allows integration with the manual task of using a joystick is presented. The hybrid interface shows high accuracy and robustness when used as a brain-robot interface. Moreover, it allows for continuous control variables extracted from the EEG signals. Finally, its efficacy is proven across multiple subjects, while its performance is also demonstrated in the real-time control of a swarm of quadrotors.",

The approach is automatic and generic: non-gaited motions, comprising arbitrary contact postures can be generated along any environment. At the core of our framework is a new steering method that generates trajectories connecting two states of the robot. These trajectories account for the state-dependent, centroidal dynamic constraints inherent to legged robots. The method, of low dimension, formulated as a Linear Program, is really efficient to compute, and can find an application in various problems related to legged locomotion. By incorporating this steering method into an existing sampling-based contact planner, we propose the first kinodynamic contact planner for legged robots.",

The proposed method is an effort to address the leg design challenge in a holistic way, exploiting the coupling between gait parameters, leg design parameters and hardware constraints, while remaining control scheme independent. Optimal body trajectories and footfalls are derived using a simplified centroidal dynamics model, whereas joint trajectories and torques are computed by a more complex dynamic model, incorporating actuation parameters and constraints. The method is applied using real robot parameters to yield an optimal leg design, validated through a realistic trotting simulation experiment. In this experiment, the robot achieves accelerating motion from stance towards the maximum speed predicted by the method.",

        "abstract": "Deployment of camera and laser based motion estimation systems for controlling platforms operating at high speeds, such as cars or trains, is posing increasingly challenging precision requirements on the temporal calibration of these sensors. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, low-cost system for calibrating any combination of cameras and time of flight LIDARs with respect to the CPU clock (and therefore, also to each other). The newly proposed device is based on widely available off-the-shelf components, such as the Raspberry Pi 3, which is synchronized using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) with respect to the CPU of the sensor carrying system. The obtained accuracy can be shown to be below 0.1 ms per measurement for LIDARs and below minimal exposure time per image for cameras. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches also not relying on hardware synchronization by more than a factor of 10 in precision. Moreover, the entire process can be carried out at a high rate allowing the study of how offsets evolve over time. In our analysis, we demonstrate how each building block of the system contributes to this accuracy and validate the obtained results using real-world data.",

        "abstract": "In classical robot-camera calibration, a 6D transformation between the camera frame and the local frame of a robot is estimated by first observing a known calibration object from a number of different view points and then finding transformation parameters that minimize the reprojection error. The disadvantage with this is that often not all configurations can be reached by the end-effector, which leads to an inaccurate parameter estimation. Therefore, we propose a more versatile method based on the detection of oriented visual features, in our case AprilTags. From a collected number of such detections during a defined rotation of a joint, we fit a Bingham distribution by maximizing the observation likelihood of the detected orientations. After a tilt and a second rotation, a camera-to-joint transformation can be determined. In experiments with accurate ground truth available, we evaluate our approach in terms of precision and robustness, both for hand-eye/robot-camera and for camera-camera calibration, with classical solutions serving as a baseline.",

Stimulated by the success in our preceding study that demonstrates the validity of the l\u221e-induced norm as an adequate performance measure, we suggest a systematic methodology to design optimal event-based feedback controller for bipedal models walking on rough terrains. More precisely, we first assume that the system is already equipped with a low-level continuous-time feedback controller, capable of stable flat-ground-walking, and then formulate the design problem of the high-level event-based feedback control as the l1-optimal control problem for discrete-time linear systems defined on the linearized Poincar\u00e8 map. In order to validate the proposed methodology, nonlinear dynamic simulations are conducted with a simple biped model walking on rough terrain. The terrain slope randomly varies at each footstep while the magnitude of slope variation is bounded by some maximum value. Simulation results indicate that the optimal system equipped with the proposed controller can successfully overcome a rough terrain on which the original system could not walk and fall.",

We first construct a variational penalty method, which is used to enforce a constraint. The penalty term is simulated using an asynchronous variational integrator, allowing the penalty part of the system to be simulated using a smaller time step. We compute the Discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations for an equivalent penalty term with a larger time step and then use this rescaled system in the aforementioned variational penalty method, thereby enforcing the constraints. This enables us to incorporate some of the behavior of a very stiff system, which would only be stable on the small time scale, into the system on the large time scale. The effect is better adherence to the constraints, at a larger time step. We demonstrate the method with a simulation of a chain of rigid bodies. We then discuss the potential applications of the integrator and highlight how the work can be used to better interpret the tuned values of the coefficients used in penalty formulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an optimization-based framework for robust multilegged walking motion planning. Previous approaches use fixed gait sequences, and rely on Zero Moment Point (ZMP) to guarantee dynamic stability. While this combination works well on flat ground, it does not generalize to uneven terrain requiring aggressive gait or gait transition. To overcome such difficulties, in this paper, we present an optimization framework, that can plan both the contact location and gait sequence simultaneously in a mixed-integer convex optimization program. Moreover, we rely on the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) stability criterion, which generalizes the ZMP criterion to uneven terrain with friction cone constraints, and we plan the walking motion together with the angular momentum through a convex optimization program. Our approach is successfully tested on a LittleDog quadruped over simulated scenarios. We show that on the flat ground, our planner generates a periodic gait, same as Central Pattern Generator + ZMP planner; while on uneven terrain, our planner can successfully generate a motion containing different gaits, with a center-of-mass motion that respects the friction cone constraints, which are violated by ZMP planners. This improvement clearly demonstrates the advantage of our approach over traditional planning strategies.",

        "abstract": "Pedicle drilling is a crucial and high-risk process in spinal surgery. Due to the respiration and cardiac cycle, the position of spine would fluctuate during operations, which result in an increase of the difficulty in state recognition of pedicle drilling. To guarantee the safety and validity, a model-based compensation method is proposed in this paper. To build the empirical model of vertebral motion, vertebral displacement and tidal volume (Tv) signals are collected from volunteers. To rule out disturbances in original signal, FFT and wavelet transform (DWT) are used to process the experimental signals. In order to select the apt basis for different signals, the root mean square error decision-making method (RMSE-DMM) is introduced. When the filtered vertebral displacement signal is obtained, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to figure out the empirical model. The robot assisted systems (RAS) can easily compensate vertebral fluctuation based on the empirical model. Due to the goal of pedicle drilling is to drill a hole from surface of first cortical layer to the interior of second cortical layer, a new key point recognition algorithm, based on force, proposed in this paper. To verify the effectiveness of compensation and the recognition algorithm, 3 sets of comparison experiments are carried out. And the results of experiment show the compensation method and new key point recognition algorithm perform effectively.",

In this paper, an extension of a previously developed model is proposed that allows for estimation of angular displacements in multi-DOF tendon-driven devices where special attention is given to the coupling effect between DOFs. The proposed model consists of the conventional coupling matrix and a novel elongation matrix which compensates for the coupled hysteretic effect. The model is applied to the problem of position estimation in three DOFs (one pitch and two grasping DOFs) of a da Vinci\u00ae surgical instrument. As a further extension, a preliminary dynamic model is also suggested to deal with high-frequency inputs. According to the experimental results obtained, the proposed quasi-static model can describe the transmission behavior with goodness-of-fit of 76-92 per cent, and the estimates are improved by 35-72 per cent in terms of the RMSE for the proposed dynamic model as compared to the conventional rigid model.",

        "abstract": "Materials exhibiting variable stiffness properties have great potential for use in the growing field of soft robotics. Soft structural materials allow a robot to fit into enclosed spaces, resist shock and vibration, or even reconfigure its geometry and adapt to various environments. Rigid structural materials on the other hand allow environmental interactions through application of force and load-bearing capabilities. Materials that can be selectively switched between these two extremes could greatly expand the functionality of a robot that requires the properties of both. In this paper, we introduce a conductive epoxy composite that is self-softening through Joule heating via direct application of electrical current. The polymer can then become load-bearing and rigid again after being formed into a new shape. We demonstrate the capabilities of this material by attaching a pneumatic actuator and showing that the resulting variable stiffness device can be softened from its initial rigid state, reshape itself using the pneumatic actuator, then become rigid again and hold this new position without additional power being supplied to the actuator.",

Inspecting infrastructure is inherently labor-intensive work and costly. In this paper, we propose a solution to cost-effective infrastructure inspection by developing a multi-functional inspection robot. The robot is equipped with several state-of-the-art non-destructive evaluation (NDE) sensors to perform inspection. The robot is able to perform selected inspection methods in certain areas based on multiple sensor data fusion. With this, the overall inspection time is reduced, which in turn reduces maintenance cost. An inspection framework based on multiple NDE data sensor fusion is proposed. Detailed discussions include robot design, robot navigation and sensor data fusion.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the time-phased deployment of wireless sensor networks, applied to surveillance areas growing in time. The focus herein is on the planning of the time-efficient delivery of static sensors to their designated nodes, given a network configuration. The novelty of the proposed strategy is in that it determines optimal delivery plans for spatio-temporally constrained static-sensor networks using multi-robot teams. The proposed sensor delivery planning strategy starts with an already determined (optimal) network plan specified by sensor placement locations (i.e., nodes) and deployment times. Thus, the goal at hand is to determine the optimal routes for the robots delivering the sensors to their intended locations just-in-time. The travel routes are, thus, determined to maximize spare time for the robots between the nodes. The problem is similar to the multiple travelling salesperson problem, but, with temporal constraints. Namely, sensors must be delivered to their designated nodes at designated (optimized) times in order to maintain the optimal deployment of the network configuration. Furthermore, the strategy is designed to be adaptive to new information that can become available during the search for the mobile target, allowing for replanning of the sensor network (i.e., new sensors locations and new deployment times). Numerous simulated experiments were conducted to validate the proposed strategy.",

        "abstract": "Fulfillment centers located in densely populated urban areas are an ever-growing need for leading online consumer websites. These urban fulfillment centers have limited land mass and must have innovative solutions to transport goods within the available vertical space. This work presents a Multi-Track Elevator (MTE) System, a competitive solution for rapid access and retrieval of goods in high-rise e-commerce fulfillment centers and warehouses. The MTE System consists of multiple vertical rails connected with angular traverse rails that allow multiple carriages to go up and down without collision. A novel turning point system switches track routes so that several carriages can move across the multiple rails for rapidly accessing many floors and collecting diverse goods. Unlike existing vertical-horizontal grid elevators and rail systems, the Roller-coaster type, self-powered carriages on the MTE system do not have to stop at switching points, but can continually move across the network of rails. This work walks through the architecture of the rail network system and techniques for switching multiple rails, followed by the design of vertical turntables for smooth, continuous rail switching. Finally, outlining the use of a simple route optimization algorithm, diverse elevator systems are compared with respect to total traveling time and distance. A proof-of-concept prototype has been built and is presented.",

        "abstract": "Learning object models in the wild from natural human interactions is an essential ability for robots to perform general tasks. In this paper we present a robocentric multimodal dataset addressing this key challenge. Our dataset focuses on interactions where the user teaches new objects to the robot in various ways. It contains synchronized recordings of visual (3 cameras) and audio data which provide a challenging evaluation framework for different tasks. Additionally, we present an end-to-end system that learns object models using object patches extracted from the recorded natural interactions. Our proposed pipeline follows these steps: (a) recognizing the interaction type, (b) detecting the object that the interaction is focusing on, and (c) learning the models from the extracted data. Our main contribution lies in the steps towards identifying the target object patches of the images. We demonstrate the advantages of combining language and visual features for the interaction recognition and use multiple views to improve the object modelling. Our experimental results show that our dataset is challenging due to occlusions and domain change with respect to typical object learning frameworks. The performance of common out-of-the-box classifiers trained on our data is low. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms such baselines.",

        "abstract": "Activities of daily living (ADLs) are important for quality of life. Robotic assistance offers the opportunity for people with disabilities to perform ADLs on their own. However, when a complex semi-autonomous system provides real-world assistance, occasional anomalies are likely to occur. Robots that can detect, classify and respond appropriately to common anomalies have the potential to provide more effective and safer assistance. We introduce a multimodal execution monitor to detect and classify anomalous executions when robots operate near humans. Our system builds on our past work on multimodal anomaly detection. Our new monitor classifies the type and cause of common anomalies using an artificial neural network. We implemented and evaluated our execution monitor in the context of robot-assisted feeding with a general-purpose mobile manipulator. In our evaluations, our monitor outperformed baseline methods from the literature. It succeeded in detecting 12 common anomalies from 8 able-bodied participants with 83% accuracy and classifying the types and causes of the detected anomalies with 90% and 81% accuracies, respectively. We then performed an in-home evaluation with Henry Evans, a person with severe quadriplegia. With our system, Henry successfully fed himself while the monitor detected, classified the types, and classified the causes of anomalies with 86%, 90%, and 54% accuracy, respectively.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art calibration methods typically choose to use a checkerboard as the calibration target for its simplicity and robustness. They however require the complete checkerboard be captured to break symmetry. More recent multi-camera systems such as Google Jump, Jaunt, and camera arrays have limited overlapping field-of-view (FoV) and having all cameras viewing the complete checkerboard is extremely difficult in reality. Tailored patterns such as CALTag [1] introduce new image features within the checker blocks for breaking symmetry but they also break the grid topology. We present a new technique using such patterned calibration targets for a broad range of multi-camera systems. Our key observation is that applying directional gradient filters yields to heterogeneous responses on grid vs. non-grid features: the former are isolated and the latter are highly inter-connected. We therefore apply a simple but highly efficient technique to eliminate non-grid outliers based on connected component analysis and gradient histograms. Finally, we recover the complete grid by approximating each local checkerboard as a parallelogram and imposing the topology constraint. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a number of recent multi-camera systems and our technique significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and robustness.",

Tools such as acceleration policies can naturally support the realization of reactive, adaptive, and compliant robots. These tools require us to model the system dynamics accurately - a difficult task. The fundamental problem remains that simulation and reality diverge-we do not know how to accurately change a robot's state. Thus, recent research on improving inverse dynamics models has been focused on making use of machine learning techniques. Traditional learning techniques train on the actual realized accelerations, instead of the policy's desired accelerations, which is an indirect data source. Here we show how an additional training signal - measured at the desired accelerations - can be derived from a feedback control signal. This effectively creates a second data source for learning inverse dynamics models. Furthermore, we show how both the traditional and this new data source, can be used to train task-specific models of the inverse dynamics, when used independently or combined. We analyze the use of both data sources in simulation and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real-world robotic platform. We show that our system incrementally improves the learned inverse dynamics model, and when using both data sources combined converges more consistently and faster.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a new generalized kinematic formulation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint for serial robotic arms to be useful for implementation in torque-controlled robots. A minimally invasive surgery assisted by a serial robot could be used for inserting a surgical tool through a desired insertion position, i.e. trocar position. The restricted movement caused by the trocar, i.e. the RCM constraint, must be guaranteed by the robotic system in order to avoid injury to the patient. The generalized formulation, presented in this paper, associates the task-space with the RCM constraint coordinates, which are described by the minimum distance between the surgical tool and the trocar position. In order to simultaneously achieve the surgical tool-tip trajectory and the RCM constraint, two control methods are proposed and compared, one using a projection in the null-space, the other by combining both tasks using a task-space augmentation method. Moreover, when additional lower priority tasks have to be implemented in the null-space of the two higher priority tasks, the kinematic formulation simplifies the calculation of the null-space projectors. Furthermore, unlike the previous studies, the formulation represented can be applied not only in a kinematic control but also in a dynamic control approach. Simulations were conducted to validate effectiveness of the proposed formulation, using a planar 4-DOF system as well as the dynamic model of a Kuka LBR 7 iiwa R800 robot arm.",

In comparison with the S-Hex I, the S-Hex II owns smaller dimension, lighter weight, and significantly faster walking speed. We improve and increase the total number of degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the soft dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) from three, used in the S-Hex I, up to five, employed in the S-Hex II, and that provides the promising versatile locomotion ability to the S-Hex II robot.

This solution allows measuring the interaction forces between the surgical instrument and the environment without any changes to the instrument structure and with full adaptability to different robot platforms and surgical tools. A prototype of the sensor has been realized with 3D printed technology for a proof of concept. The static and dynamic characterization of the sensor is provided together with experimental validation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that it is feasible to conduct reliable multi-axis force control motor neuroimaging experiments in humans using a novel five degree-of-freedom Haptic fMRI interface (HFI-5). We demonstrate that HFI-5 supports accurate force and torque control for all its axes. In addition, it minimizes the force-to-torque coupling induced by its closed chain kinematic structure. HFI-5 has low backdrive friction (<; 0.5N; <; 0.05Nm), which improves its haptic transparency. While the device is large and consequently flexible, a linear model can correct kinematic accuracies due to device deflection. Resulting position error measurements are similar in scale to human hand jitter, and are thus satisfactory. To test HFI-5's efficacy, we performed force perception and force discrimination tests with it on four human subjects. The test revealed that humans could readily perceive forces above 1N and could discern forces that were about 33% apart. As such, HFI-5's force range (x:\u00b116.36N; y:\u00b14.62N; z:\u00b16.9N; passively gravity compensated) can support a wide variety of forces that are perceptible and distinguishable. Finally, we performed ten fMRI scans with a human subject who performed a visually guided force-control experiment. Temporal noise patterns in fMRI measurements matched the fMRI baseline (0.8%), which demonstrates that HFI-5's electromagnetic motors do not introduce substantial noise. HFI-5 is thus ready to be used in motor neuroimaging experiments.",

        "abstract": "In an outdoor autonomous navigational context, classic compass sensors such as magnetometers have to deal with unpredictable magnetic disturbances. In this paper, we propose to get inspiration from the insect navigational abilities to design a celestial compass based on linear polarization of ultraviolet (UV) skylight. To compute the solar meridian relative orientation, our 3D-printed celestial compass uses only two pixels created by two UV-light photo-sensors topped with linear polarizers arranged orthogonally to each other, in the same manner that was observed in insects' Dorsal Rim Area ommatidia. The compass was then embedded on our hexapod walking robot called Hexabot. We first tested the UV-polarized light compass to compensate for yaw random disturbances. We then used the compass to maintain Hexabot's heading direction constant in a straight-forward task, knowing the robot has important yaw drifts. Experiments under various meteorological conditions provided steady state heading direction errors from 0.3\u00b0 under clear sky conditions to 1.9\u00b0 under overcast sky, which suggests interesting precision and reliability to make this optical compass suitable for robotics.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems have recently drawn attention in minimally invasive surgeries due to their increased dexterity feature. A major drawback of these systems is image blurring due to lens contamination which cause imaging impairment during up to 40% of surgery time. This paper demonstrates a novel laparoscopic magnetic driven camera system with implemented in-vivo lens cleaning and debris prevention systems. This camera robot can cover 150 degrees field of view inside the abdominal cavity and provide adjustable illumination system to improve the video quality. Design details for different modules, such as anchoring, actuation, video capturing, illumination, debris prevention and lens cleaning of this robot have been provided and discussed. This camera robot can decrease the possibility of lens contamination by creating CO2 gas barrier in front of lens. In case of contamination it can clean the lens in-vivo without removing the camera from abdominal cavity. The lens cleaning module has been tested for water vapor and water droplets. The robot is manufactured and each module has been validated by designed experiments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in the field of wearable robots (WRs), commercial WRs still use traditional direct-drive actuation units to power their joints. On the other hand, in research prototypes compliant actuators are increasingly being used to more adequately address the issues of safety, robustness, control and overall system efficiency. The advantages of mechanical compliance are exploited in a novel modular actuator prototype designed for the knee joint. Due to its modularity, the actuator can be implemented in a knee joint of a standalone or a multi-joint lower-limbs orthosis, for use in gait rehabilitation and/or walking assistance. Differently from any other actuator used in orthotic research prototypes, it combines a Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA) and a Parallel Elasticity Actuation (PEA) unit in a single modular system. Although independent, the units are designed to work together in order to fully mimic dynamic behavior of the human knee joint. In this paper, design aspects and functional evaluation of the new actuator are presented and a rationale for such a design in biomechanics of the human knee joint is given. The VSA subsystem is characterized in a quasi-static benchmarking environment and the results showing main performance indicators are presented.",

The system is powered by novel bending pneumatic muscles which have been combined with contractor pneumatic muscles to provide actuation for the glove. This research has assessed the behaviour of the new bending actuators and demonstrated them in a prototype wrist exoskeleton. An accompanying mathematical model of the force generated by the proposed extensor bending artificial muscles has been developed. The proposed wearable robot is capable of producing flexion-extension and abduction-adduction motions of the human wrist to generate rehabilitation motions. The exoskeleton is designed to fit any adult hand size without the need for any mechanical changes, meaning it can easily be swapped between users.",

The majority of the torso joints are designed exploiting serial or differential mechanisms, while parallel kinematic structures are less used mainly because of their greater design complexity. This paper describes the design and construction of a 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) torso for our new humanoid robot. Three degrees of freedom, namely roll, pitch and heave, have been implemented using a 3 DoF parallel kinematic structure, while the fourth DoF, namely yaw, has been implemented with a rotational joint on top of the parallel structure. The design has been optimized to reduce the cost and the volume of the system. A first prototype of the torso has been constructed and validated with respect to our design requirements. Eventually, experimental tests have been conducted to assess the functionality of the proposed system.",

Considering the Euler integration method, active energy terms are identified. These sources of energy are due to the external torque and the coupled dynamics which can lead to a non-physical behavior of the simulated dynamics. The proposed method dissipates this energy using a variable damper regulated by an energy observer. The new algorithm guarantees not only passivity but also a consistent energetic integration. The integration method is sustained by simulations and tested on a real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulator.",

However, these require a large air compressor, making them heavy, bulky, and therefore inappropriate for use in portable devices. In this study, we proposed and tested a portable pneumatic power source using the chemical reaction between sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. The carbon dioxide generated in the reaction was used as a pneumatic power source. The chemicals used are inexpensive, nontoxic, and readily available. From the result of basic experiment demonstrated in this paper, we conclude that the method can provide enough high pressure (more than 1 MPa) for activating pneumatic actuators and the chemical reaction is safe since it is endothermic reaction. We also demonstrated a novel system that provides continuous mixing of the reagents, using a pressure booster. The system keeps a pressure inside of a tank moderate, and tank can become light weight because it doesn't need to endure high pressure.",

        "abstract": "We present a 3D mesh re-sampling algorithm, carefully tailored for 3D object detection using point pair features (PPF). Computing a sparse representation of objects is critical for the success of state-of-the-art object detection, recognition and pose estimation methods. Yet, sparsity needs to preserve fidelity. To this end, we develop a simple, yet very effective point sampling strategy for detection of any CAD model through geometric hashing. Our approach relies on rendering the object coordinates from a set of views evenly distributed on a sphere. Actual sampling takes place on 2D domain over these renderings; the resulting samples are efficiently merged in 3D with the aid of a special voxel structure and relaxed with Lloyd iterations. The generated vertices are not concentrated only on critical points, as in many keypoint extraction algorithms, and there is even spacing between selected vertices. This is valuable for quantization based detection methods, such as geometric hashing of point pair features. The algorithm is fast and can easily handle the elongated/acute triangles and sharp edges typically existent in industrial CAD models, while automatically pruning the invisible structures. We do not introduce structural changes such as smoothing or interpolation and sample the normals on the original CAD model, achieving the maximum fidelity. We demonstrate the strength of this approach on 3D object detection in comparison to similar sampling algorithms.",

This paper reports a novel architecture for semi-autonomous teleoperation over high-latency telemetry and the results of a 15-subject user study used to evaluate that architecture. The intent-recognition-based traded control (IRTC) architecture recognizes operator intent based on remote scene and task modeling, and automatically trades control to an autonomous reactive subsystem. Each subject participated in one two-hour session during which they controlled a single simulated redundant robotic manipulator with 4000ms of closed-loop latency. Subjects continuously assemble and disassemble a 3D lattice structure with or without IRTC-based assistance. The user study showed that the IRTC system improved operator performance in the simulated multi-object assembly task. All source code for conducting the experiment including the simulation and data processing is available online under a permissive open-source license.",

        "abstract": "Lighting and shading can have a great impact on a robot's ability to recognize, match, and classify objects in indoor scenes. Additionally, the realism of augmented reality applications benefit greatly from understanding the lighting and shading in a scene. To aid in extracting this information from a mobile platform we introduce a novel framework to solve the intrinsic image decomposition problem for RGB-D streams. In our pipeline, the task is formulated as a Bayesian estimation problem. Compared to frame-based methods that must solve a full conditional random field (CRF) optimization problem at each time step, our framework can utilize the knowledge of past frames to predict the intrinsic images at a given frame. Our approach produces more reliable and consistent predictions over time, and our filtering-based framework achieves significant performance gains. Furthermore, our framework can be easily integrated into standard perception loops in many robotic systems that use a similar recursive filtering structure. We show qualitative results on real data and generate quantitative results using ground truth from a photorealistic synthetic dataset produced using a state-of-the-art ray tracer and high fidelity 3D model.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric ceramics(PZT)actuator has been widely used in flexure-guided nanopositioning stage because of their high resolution. However, it is quite hard to achieve high-rate precision positioning control because of the complex hysteresis nonlinearity effect of PZT actuator. Thus, an online RELM algorithm with forgetting property(FReOS-ELM) is proposed to handle this issue. Firstly, we adopt regularized extreme learning machine(RELM)to build an intelligent hysteresis model. The training of the algorithm is completed only in one step, which avoids the shortcomings of the traditional hysteresis model based on artificial neural network(ANN) that slow training speed and easy to fall into the local minimum. Then, based on the regularized on-line sequential extreme learning machine(ReOS-ELM), an on-line RELM algorithm with forgetting property(FReOS-ELM) is designed, which can avoid the computational load of ReOS-ELM in the process of adding new data for learning on-line. In the experiment, a real-time voltage signal with varying frequencies and amplitudes is adopted, and the output displacement data of the nanopositioning stage is also acquired and analyzed. The results powerfully verify that the performance of the established hysteresis model based on the proposed FReOS-ELM is satisfactory, which can be used to improve the practical positioning performance for flexure nanopositioning stage.",

We propose a robotic vision system called the Robotic System for Tree Shape Estimation (RoTSE) to determine tree traits in field settings. The process is composed of the following stages: image acquisition with a mobile robot unit, segmentation, reconstruction, curve skeletonization, conversion to a graph representation, and then computation of traits. Quantitative and qualitative results on apple trees are shown in terms of accuracy, computation time, and robustness. Compared to ground truth measurements, the RoTSE produced the following estimates: branch diameter (mean-squared error 0.99 mm), branch length (mean-squared error 45.64 mm), and branch angle (mean-squared error 10.36 degrees). The average run time was 8.47 minutes when the voxel resolution was 3 mm3.",

        "abstract": "A Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) is designed by placing a passive compliant element between a conventional stiff actuator and link. The intrinsically compliant mechanical structure provides several superiorities, e.g., safety, energy efficiency, high force fidelity, low cost force measurement, high transparency, etc., in advanced robot applications, such as humanoids, quadrupeds and exoskeletons. However, the motion control problem of an SEA is more complicated than that of a conventional stiff actuator due to its higher order dynamics. This paper proposes a novel Active Disturbance Rejection (ADR) based robust force controller for SEAs by combining Differential Flatness (DF) and Disturbance Observer (DOb) in state space. The robust state and control input references are systematically generated in terms of a fictitious variable, namely differentially flat output, estimated disturbances and their successive derivatives. A second order DOb is designed in state space so that disturbances and their first and second order derivatives are estimated. It is experimentally shown that high performance force control applications can be performed without requiring the precise dynamic models of the actuator and environment when the proposed robust force controller is implemented.",

However, existing self-folding machines cannot generate large forces or bear high loads. In contrast, traditional robots are expected to operate under large loads but these robots are generally dense, resulting in heavy machines with relatively low strength-to-weight ratios. In this paper, we present a new self-folding technique that is meter-scale and load-bearing. We demonstrate the design and fabrication of both structural beams and pneumatically actuated joints. We model and measure the stiffness and strength of self-folded structural beams. Finally, we integrate these results into a robotic arm that weighs 0.3 kg and can lift up to 1.0 kg. These results indicate that functional, load-bearing, self-folding robots are possible.",

        "abstract": "Progress has been achieved recently in object detection given advancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of objects and variety of conditions. This work proposes an autonomous process for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection and pose estimation in robotic setups. The focus is on detecting objects placed in cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. In particular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of the environment are physically simulated. The models are placed in physically realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing datasets and on a dataset collected for this paper with a Motoman robotic arm. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms popular training processes relying on synthetic - but not physically realistic - data and manual annotation. The key contributions are the incorporation of physical reasoning in the synthetic data generation process and the automation of the annotation process over real images.",

To further improve the robot mobility and terrain adaptability in unstructured terrain, we propose a new locomotion control method called compound motion pattern (CMP) for multi-limb robots like OCTOPUS. This hybrid locomotion by cooperating the arms and flippers would be effective to adapt to the unstructured terrain due to combining the advantages of crawling and walking. As a preliminary study on CMP, we proposed a fundamental and conceptual CMP while clarifying problems in constructing CMP, and developed a semi-autonomous control system for realizing the CMP. Electrically-driven OCTOPUS was used to verify the reliability and correctness of CMP. Results of experiments on climbing a step indicate that the proposed control system could obtain relatively accurate terrain information and the CMP enabled the robot to climb the step. We thus confirmed that the proposed CMP would be effective to increase terrain adaptability of robot in unstructured environment, and it would be a useful locomotion method for advanced disaster response robots.",

        "abstract": "It is important for a robot to appropriately respond to its surrounding environment and events to communicate smoothly with humans as opposed to following fixed movements specified in advance. In this paper, a simple bi-layered architecture (SB architecture) is proposed to integrate behaviors in two stages: prioritization and weighted averaging. In addition, SB architecture integrates voluntary movements by prioritization and integrates involuntary and reflex movements by weighted averaging, thereby generating robot behaviors that immediately respond to events that occur around the robot. What advantages SB architecture has are that it can easily generate various behaviors by combining multiple behaviors and that it is possible to propose a simple design for robot behavior. Furthermore, since behavior occurs in response to sensors, the robot's behaviors are reactive to the surrounding environment and events. In particular, if a robot performs the behavior necessary for communication with humans, such as changing its gaze and gestures, it is possible to ensure that the robot possesses liveness to promote communication with humans. In addition, since SB architecture has a simple structure to facilitate the design of robots, it is possible to automatically set parameters by optimizing the parameters using pairs of sensor information and ideal behaviors. The optimization of the parameters leads to generating behaviors characterized with liveness by appropriately combining behaviors.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a skull-mounted robotic headframe for intracranial neurosurgery. The headframe is primarily comprised of a pedestal, a Stewart platform, and a linear actuation module interfacing with a mesoscale neurosurgical robot. In addition to kinematic modeling, motion planning is carried out for neurosurgical procedures using the headframe. Due to the symmetric neurosurgical robot and the insertion and retraction motion of the linear actuation module, the headframe includes kinematic redundancy and it is utilized to enhance the positioning accuracy of the system. In this paper, several simulations are conducted to evaluate the headframe workspace, followed by an experimental study of the positioning error of the neurosurgical robot and a proof-of-concept demonstration of the headframe interfacing with the neurosurgical robot.",

        "abstract": "Small robots benefit from the ability to go places where humans cannot and are attractive for numerous practical reasons such as portability and manufacturing simplicity. However, with smaller scale comes more difficulty traversing rough terrain, especially for robots which use wheel-based locomotion. Previous approaches to overcome this drawback have included auxiliary mechanisms such as jumping, transformations of the robot or its appendages, and alternative forms of locomotion such as aerial flight capability. This paper presents a small scale robot that is capable of both ground travel and aerial flight. In combination, these methods of locomotion allow for efficient ground-based movement as well as the ability to overcome obstacles and explore otherwise unreachable locations through air travel. The novel aspect of the robot design is a transformation between ground and air configurations. This feature offers advantages over previous approaches such as a highly compact ground configuration and protection of delicate flight hardware when not in use. In this paper, the robot concept is compared to other approaches to address ground robot mobility drawbacks. This is followed by a detailed design description with a focus on the transformation between the ground and air modes. Lastly, a fully functional prototype is presented which is capable of ground and air locomotion and the transformation between these configurations.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This work presents a method for the use of a soft multi-axis force sensor to determine tissue trauma in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Despite recent developments, there is a lack of effective haptic sensing technology employed in instruments for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). There is thus a clear clinical need to increase the provision of haptic feedback and to perform real-time analysis of haptic data to inform the surgical operator. This paper establishes a methodology for the capture of real-time data through use of an inexpensive prototype grasper. Fabricated using soft silicone and 3D printing, the sensor is able to precisely detect compressive and shear forces applied to the grasper face. The sensor is based upon a magnetic soft tactile sensor, using variations in the local magnetic field to determine force. The performance of the sensing element is assessed and a linear response was observed, with a max hysteresis error of 4.1% of the maximum range of the sensor. To assess the potential of the sensor for surgical sensing, a simulated grasping study was conducted using ex vivo porcine tissue. Two previously established metrics for prediction of tissue trauma were obtained and compared from recorded data. The normalized stress rate (kPa.mm-1) of compression and the normalized stress relaxation (\u0394\u03c3R) were analyzed across repeated grasps. The sensor was able to obtain measures in agreement with previous research, demonstrating future potential for this approach. In summary this work demonstrates that inexpensive soft sensing systems can be used to instrument surgical tools and thus assess properties such as tissue health. This could help reduce surgical error and thus benefit patients.",

        "abstract": "We consider an orienteering problem (OP) where an agent needs to visit a series (possibly a subset) of depots, from which the maximal accumulated profits are desired within given limited time budget. Different from most existing works where the profits are assumed to be static, in this work we investigate a variant that has arbitrary time-dependent profits. Specifically, the profits to be collected change over time and they follow different (e.g., independent) time-varying functions. The problem is of inherent nonlinearity and difficult to solve by existing methods. To tackle the challenge, we present a simple and effective framework that incorporates time-variations into the fundamental planning process. Specifically, we propose a deterministic spatio-temporal representation where both spatial description and temporal logic are unified into one routing topology. By employing existing basic sorting and searching algorithms, the routing solutions can be computed in an extremely efficient way. The proposed method is easy to implement and extensive numerical results show that our approach is time efficient and generates near-optimal solutions.",

        "abstract": "Achieving stable bipedal robotic walking on deformable terrain is an open and challenging problem at the intersection of robotics and physics. Ground deformation introduces underactuation; uncertainty in terrain dynamics further complicates dynamical modeling and control methods. This work provides a stability criterion for flat-footed bipedal locomotion and allows model-based control methods to function on homogeneous deformable granular terrain (e.g. sand and dirt). By characterizing static reaction forces from granular materials, in conjunction with granular resistive force theory (RFT), we model and validate a static stability region for the center of mass (CoM) projection of a biped on a granular surface. We show that this stability region approximates the admissible Zero Moment Point (ZMP) region for walking, rendering common Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) methods valid with our foot placement strategy. By interpreting the stability region as the maximum reaction moment of the terrain, we formulate walking as a hybrid dynamical system and utilize the partial hybrid zero dynamics (PHZD) based methodology to generate walking gaits. Finally, we experimentally validate both the ZMP and PHZD walking gaits on a planar bipedal robot, showing that the stability region criterion permits stable dynamic walking on homogeneous granular terrain.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Trajectory optimization with direct collocation are widely used in various bipedal walking studies, from dynamic simulation in biomechanics to efficient bipedal walking motion generation with multiple contact domains. Although the latter has gained popularity, most of the approaches in this field in general rely on pre-determined contact sequence (domains). This motivates us to use trajectory optimization through contact for generating an efficient and human-like walking gait, because this approach can automatically generate the contact sequence by solving a nonlinear program (NLP) with complementary constraints. However, in this approach the initial guess affects the result significantly, and the direct collocation with Euler method may not be accurate enough for the system dynamics. Therefore, we propose a modified framework and constraints to improve the generated results. We used a zero moment point (ZMP)-based flat-feet walking gait as an initial guess. We also show how to add virtual components like springs at ankle joints to alter the behavior of the resultant walking gait. In addition, considering the one-sided springs at the passive toe joints of the bipedal robot AMBER 3, additional complementary constraints are introduced for a better match of the full dynamics. The results of our modified approach with different constraint conditions are presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "The increasing energy consumption within the industrial sector causes great concerns among numerous countries. Accordingly, an extensive reorientation towards an energy-efficient facility and processes design is essential for innovative production systems. In terms of automated object manipulation, energy efficiency significantly is affected by the physical design as well as by the dynamic characteristics of the manipulator. Since the influence on physical design parameters often is limited, a great impact on energy-efficiency of innovative manufacturing systems may result from an intelligent task management and suitable motion strategies. This contribution identifies energy-efficiency potentials for industrial manipulators in terms of motion design and redundant actuator configurations. In this context, an efficient trajectory planning algorithm is proposed, estimating the energy demand of object manipulation tasks in consideration of dynamic motion parameters as well as redundant actuator configurations. For this purpose, the geometric path as well as the motion law of given trajectories are optimized by a spatial displacement of predefined nodes and by an adjustment of corresponding time intervals. In order to verify its generality, the presented method is applied to the spatial n-PRPaR manipulator exhibiting actuation redundancy. According results show a significant energy reduction, establishing high potentials for an increased efficiency of industrial robots.",

        "abstract": "Twisted string actuators are widely used in different areas of robotics, however, their lifetime remains one of the main concerns for robotics. There are no comprehensive studies that relate the lifetime of a twisted string to its material properties and operation conditions, which can be important to improve the life cycle. This paper provides preliminary results of an extensive experimental study on twisted string actuators, using strings made of different materials and operating in various working conditions. We experimentally investigated the life time of two different strings and provided empiric mathematical model which relates operating conditions of TSAs and string material and properties to their endurance. Based on experimental results, the observations are made that the life cycle of the strings decreases exponentially with the increase in load forces and stroke and increases linearly with the increase in the number of strings.",

        "abstract": "As robots participate in human's daily activities more and more frequently, mobility performance has become one of the main factors determining how robots will share an environment with humans harmoniously in the near future. Among several different kinds of mobile platforms, using omnidirectional configurations is gradually becoming a trend in the robotics community; however, few researchers have addressed the impact of omnidirectional mobility from the perspective of human-robot interaction (HRI). In this paper, we have proposed a socializing model for the robot while participating in an interaction with a group of human peers to achieve its socially optimal position. From a theoretic perspective, we first identify the most prominent features required for social acceptance of robots interacting with multiple humans, backing our arguments with relevant sociological theory. To validate our results, we have conducted experiments where human participants were invited to interact with a robot, which can be constrained to perform either holonomic or nonholonomic motions only. Then, through an observer survey, we testify the appropriateness of utilizing omnidirectional mobility and verify the promotion of social acceptance using the aforementioned features, which is a goal that both the HRI and robotics communities aim to achieve.",

        "abstract": "Precision is an important feature in modern robotics and manipulation technology. Elevation of the robot's end-effector precision depends on different features as stiffness, tolerance etc. which should be considered during the synthesis and design phase of the manipulator. The focus of this study is on the structural stiffness of parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) exhibiting actuation redundancy. It is determined how the stiffness depends on physical and geometrical characteristics of the manipulator and how it is possible to take advantage of redundancy to enhance the stiffness of the manipulator. It is shown that redundantly actuated PKM (RA-PKM) with components made of softer and accordingly lighter materials demonstrate comparable stiffness to the non-redundant manipulators which consequently decrease the required energy for moving the dead-load in operation. Based on the model built in this study, optimizations are conducted and manipulators with optimal morphologies for different tasks are introduced. As a case study, RA-PKM of type n-R RPaRs are considered.",

The proposed framework promotes a fair comparative analysis by maintaining design continuity among system-optimal designs of symmetric and asymmetric VSA configurations. Through a case study of a VSA-powered knee prosthesis, we not only demonstrate that co-design of robots driven by VSAs can provide important performance benefits with respect to sub-system level control-optimal designs, but also provide evidence that relaxing symmetry constraints for certain periodic tasks can result in substantial advantages in performance. Our systematic comparative analysis justifies the use of asymmetric stiffness arrangements for antagonistic VSA-powered robotic systems performing periodic tasks.",

In this paper, we propose the Suction Pinching Hand, which has two underactuated fingers and one extendable and foldable suction finger whose fingertip has a suction cup. This hand can grasp objects in cluttered narrow space using the suction finger. In addition, it can grasp various objects stably using suction and pinch at the same time. The ability to grasp various objects stably of this hand is confirmed by tabletop experiments. We also propose a picking strategy using suction and pinch simultaneously in cluttered narrow space. We evaluate our proposed methods with shelf bin picking experiments. With our methods, a robot can pick various objects in cluttered narrow space.",

Is it possible for the humanoid robot to use this transportation device that is specifically designed for human? Simulation involving a two-wheeled mobile platform (TWMP) and our humanoid robot COMAN (COmpliant HuMANoid Platform) shows that it is indeed feasible without any hardware modification. Regarding the implementation, the full dynamics of the humanoid robot is considered and quadratic optimization is employed to generate whole-body joint torques to realise two types of tasks according to the interaction type between the TWMP and the humanoid robot. The TWMP is considered as unknown disturbance and the humanoid robot has to keep balancing on it in the first type of task. On the contrary, the active movement of the humanoid robot is utilised as an interface to intuitively drive the TWMP in the second type of task. For both tasks, tracking the position of center of mass (CoM) and regulating the angular momentum around it are considered as primary objectives, stabilizing the posture of certain part of its body is optional. In addition, both tasks are repeated on uneven terrain to demonstrate the robustness of the control method.",

This overcomes a limiting factor in robotic precision weeding related to the use of vision-based classification systems trained for species that may not be relevant to specific farms. We present a novel approach to overcome this problem by employing unsupervised weed scouting, weed-group labeling, and finally, weed classification that is trained on the labeled scouting data. This work demonstrates a novel labeling approach designed to maximize labeling accuracy whilst needing to label as few images as possible. The labeling approach is able to provide the best classification results of any of the examined exemplar-based labeling approaches whilst needing to label over seven times fewer images than full data labeling.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an architecture with a two-layered structure for implementing an air-hockey robot that performs tactically in the deployment of entertainment robots. The two-layered architecture is comprised of two components: a tactical component that governs tactics and a skill component that deals with individual shots. The skill layer shoots a puck autonomously by selecting an appropriate way of shooting while considering what is physically feasible. The tactical layer controls the behavior of the skill layer by adjusting a probability function for selecting shooting methods. In this study, we implemented the architecture and conducted experiments to demonstrate its usefulness.",

        "abstract": "A special type of rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), called Quadcopter have prevailed to the civilian use for the past decade. They have gained significant amount of attention within the UAV community for their redundancy and ease of control, despite the fact that they fall under an under-actuated system category. They come in a variety of configurations. The \u201c+\u201d and \u201cx\u201d configurations were introduced first. Literature pertinent to these two configurations is vast. However, in this paper, we define 6 additional possible configurations for a Quadcopter that can be built under either \u201c+\u201d or \u201cx\u201d setup. These configurations can be achieved by changing the angle that the axis of rotation for rotors make with the main body, i.e., fuselage. This would also change the location of the COM with respect to the propellers which can add to the overall stability. A comprehensive dynamic model for all these configurations is developed for the first time. The overall stability for these configurations are addressed. In particular, it is shown that one configuration can lead to the most statically-stable platform by adopting damping motion in Roll/Pitch/Yaw, which is described for the first time to the best of our knowledge.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a unified control framework for controlling a quadrotor tail-sitter UAV. The most salient feature of this framework is its capability of uniformly treating the hovering and forward flight, and enabling continuous transition between these two modes, depending on the commanded velocity. The key part of this framework is a nonlinear solver that solves for the proper attitude and thrust that produces the required acceleration set by the position controller in an online fashion. The planned attitude and thrust are then achieved by an inner attitude controller that is global asymptotically stable. To characterize the aircraft aerodynamics, a full envelope wind tunnel test is performed on the full-scale quadrotor tail-sitter UAV. In addition to planning the attitude and thrust required by the position controller, this framework can also be used to analyze the UAV's equilibrium state (trimmed condition), especially when wind gust is present. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the controller's capacity, and experiments are conducted to show the attitude controller's performance.",

The flexible magnetic catheters used in this context are in some cases not sufficiently dexterous to navigate the complex and patient-specific anatomy of the heart. To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a new approach that relies on the integration of variable stiffness segments into a magnetic catheter. The magnetic variable stiffness (VS) catheter presented here is based on silicone and a low melting point alloy (LMPA) that transforms from a solid to liquid phase upon joule heating. This dramatically changes the bending stiffness of the segment in which it is integrated, improving dexterity. Compared to standard catheters, a VS catheter can partially (just one segment) or completely lock its shape (shape fixity) in order to explore a larger 3D volume inside a magnetic navigation system, thus extending regions of the heart that can be reached for performing ablation procedures.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a classification method for single views of 3D objects with missing data retrieval. A mobile robot equipped with range sensors basically obtains only single view information of a 3D scene. Therefore, large amount of information is missing by self-occlusion, which leads to severe restriction on the object classification exploiting the whole shapes of 3D objects. Humans can precisely identify the objects from single view, since they already have concepts of the entire shape of 3D objects by learning process. Based on these concepts, humans can infer the entire shape and category of the object from a single view. Inspired from this, the proposed algorithm learns concepts in abbreviated form for the shapes of 3D objects, then infers the entire shape and object category from these concepts simultaneously. We apply a generative model based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn the concepts for complex shapes of 3D objects. Our method is evaluated on 3D CAD model dataset, and also compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Re-configurable modular robotic (RMR) systems are advantageous for their reconfigurability and versatility. A new modular robot can be built for a specific task by using modules as building blocks. However, constructing a kinematic model for a newly conceived robot requires significant work. Due to the finite size of module-types, models of all module-types can be built individually and stored in a database beforehand. With this priori knowledge, the model construction process can be automated by detecting the modules and their corresponding interconnections. Previous literature proposed theoretical frameworks for constructing kinematic models of modular robots, assuming that such information was known a priori. While well-devised mechanisms and built-in sensors can be employed to detect these parameters, they significantly complicate the module design and thus are expensive. In this paper, we propose a vision-based method to identify kinematic chains and automatically construct robot models for modular robots. Each module is affixed with augmented reality (AR) tags that are encoded with unique IDs. An image of a modular robot is taken and the detected modules are recognized by querying a database that maintains all module information. The poses of detected module-links are used to compute: (i) the connection between modules and (ii) joint angles of joint-modules. Finally, the robot serial-link chain is identified and the kinematic model is constructed and visualized. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. While implementation with only our RMR is shown, our method can be applied to other RMRs where self-identification is not possible.",

With this method, a vision system is involved in both the task demonstration and reproduction stages, and the speed and accuracy of the task reproduction are adapted according to the context of the demonstration. An expert first demonstrates how to use tools to perform a task, while the tool motion is observed using a vision system. The demonstrations are then encoded using a statistical model to generate a reference motion trajectory. Equipped with the same tools and the learned model, the robot is guided by vision to reproduce the task. The task performance was evaluated in terms of both accuracy and speed. However, simply increasing the robot's speed could decrease the reproduction accuracy. To this end, a dual-rate Kalman filter is employed to compensate for latency between the robot and vision system. More importantly, the robot speed is adapted according to the learned motion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing two tasks: a trajectory reproduction task and a bimanual sewing task. We show that using our vision-based approach, the robots can conduct effective learning by demonstrations and perform accurate and fast task reproduction. The proposed approach is generalisable to other manipulation tasks, where bimanual or multi-robot cooperation is required.",

The forces delivered to the fingertips are controlled by the motor current with the robust control algorithm, and the fingertip position is calculated by forward kinematics.

We show that the tip orientation of the continuum manipulator can be decided completely by pulling-wire lengths, regardless of its whole shape, which is a useful property same as the constant curvature model. Moreover, we can derive the tip position, which depends on the whole shape, by assuming distributed forces along wires mainly due to the friction between the wires and their surrounding materials. Experimental validation results show that, based on the model, we can estimate the tip orientation from pulling-wire lengths with good accuracy and precision. We also provide experimental results for discussion about estimating the tip position with the realistic assumption on the force distribution along wires.",

        "abstract": "As robots begin to inhabit public and social spaces, it is increasingly important to ensure that they behave in a socially appropriate way. However, manually coding social behaviours is prohibitively difficult since social norms are hard to quantify. Therefore, learning from demonstration (LfD), wherein control policies are inferred from demonstrations of correct behaviour, is a powerful tool for helping robots acquire social intelligence. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to learning social behaviours from demonstration. We apply this method to two challenging social tasks for a semi-autonomous telepresence robot. Our results show that our approach outperforms gradient boosting regression and performs well against a hard-coded controller. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm that each element of our method is essential to its success.",

The focus is on adaptively selecting a sequence of wrist poses that achieves accurate recognition by enclosure grasps. It seeks to minimize the number of touches and maximize recognition confidence. The actions are formulated as wrist poses relative to each other, making the algorithm independent of absolute workspace coordinates. The optimal sequence is approximated by Monte Carlo tree search. We demonstrate results in a physics engine and on a real robot. In the physics engine, most object instances were recognized in at most 16 grasps.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Acquiring High Dynamic Range (HDR) photos from several images, with an active shutter providing different exposures (sensor integration periods), has been widely commercialised in photography for static camera positions. In the case of a mobile video sensor (as is the case in robotics), this problem is more difficult due to real-time motion of the sensor which transforms the perspective between the acquired images. HDR approaches for a set of images from different perspectives have therefore been significantly overlooked since this would require sophisticated dense mapping approaches to eliminate the motion component. Recent dense visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) approaches provide this framework, however, few works have attempted to perform HDR visual SLAM. Current approaches are thus highly dependant on illumination conditions and camera shutter settings. In this paper a new approach is proposed that enables 3D HDR environment maps to be acquired actively from a dynamic set of images in real-time. The 6 DOF pose, the dense scene structure and the HDR texture map will be estimated simultaneously with the objective of maximising the dynamic range. This will allow to obtain a radiance map of the scene by fusing a real-time stream of low dynamic range images (LDR) into a graph of HDR key-frame images. In particular, a method is proposed to actively control the shutter based on information theory to optimise the information content of the 3D HDR environment map for RGB-D sensors. As will be shown in the results, a 3D HDR environment map allows mapping (visual SLAM) to take actively advantage of varying luminosity in different parts of the scene.",

        "abstract": "In the present work, we propose an active learning framework based on optimal query paths to efficiently address the problem of tactile object shape exploration. Most previous approaches perform active touch probing at discrete query points, which leads to inefficient touch-and-retract motions. In contrast, in this paper we propose to query information efficient sliding paths instead of only touch locations. This is realized by three components: A Gaussian process implicit surface model represents the shape and uncertainty of the object. A compliant task/force controller framework fuses the information of this GP model into the parameterization of its tasks, which enables the robot to slide over the unknown object safely and robustly. Thirdly, we develop two strategies to solve the proposed active path querying learning problem. Sliding along those query paths not only creates more dense data than touch probing, but additionally greatly reduces the uncertainty of the object. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework both in simulation and on the PR2 robot platform. Furthermore, it is shown that our methodology can be extended to other learning tasks, such as finding a desired surface normal on an unknown object, e.g. for pushing.",

        "abstract": "High accuracy navigation in GPS-deprived environments is of prime importance to various robotics applications and has been extensively investigated in the last two decades. Recent approaches have shown that incorporating sensor's calibration states in addition to the 6DOF pose states may cause better performance of the system. However, these approaches typically consider a passive setting, where robot actions are externally defined. On the other hand, belief space planning (BSP) approaches account for different sources of uncertainty, thus identifying actions that improve certain aspects in inference, such as accuracy. Yet, existing BSP approaches typically do not consider sensor calibration, nor a visual-inertial SLAM setup. In this paper we contribute a BSP approach for active sensor calibration of a visual-inertial SLAM setup. For this purpose we incorporate within the belief both robot's pose and sensor calibration states while considering operation in partially unknown and uncertain environment. In particular, we leverage the recently developed concept of IMU pre-integration and develop appropriate factor graph formulation for future beliefs to facilitate computationally efficient inference within BSP. Our approach is valid for general cost functions, and can be used to identify best robot actions from a given set of candidate actions or to calculate locally-optimal actions using direct trajectory optimization techniques. We demonstrate our approach in high-fidelity synthetic simulation and show that incorporate sensors calibration state into the BSP significantly improved estimation accuracy.",

Studying these aspects on real robots has been proved difficult and therefore results mostly rely on the use of computer simulation. Simple control approaches - based on phase oscillators - have been proposed and exhibit several of these features. In this work, we compare two types of controllers: (a) an open loop control approach based on phase oscillators and (b) the Tegotae-based closed loop extension of this controller. The first controller has been shown to exhibit synchronization features between the body and the controller when applied to a quadruped robot with compliant leg structures. In this contribution, we apply both controllers to the locomotion of a stiff quadruped structure. We show that the Tegotae-controller exhibits self-organizing behavior, such as spontaneous gait transition and critical fluctuation. Moreover, it exhibits features such as the ability to stabilize both asymmetric and symmetric morphological changes, despite the lack of compliance in the leg.",

        "abstract": "Designing and manufacturing actuators using soft materials are among the most important subjects for future robotics. In nature, animals made by soft tissues such as the octopus have attracted the attention of the robotics community in the last years. Suckers (or suction cups) are one of the most important and peculiar organs of the octopus body, giving it the ability to apply high forces on the external environment. The integration of suction cups in soft robots can enhance their ability to manipulate objects and interact with the environment similarly to what the octopus does. However, artificial suction cups are currently actuated using fluid pressure so most of them require external compressors, which will greatly increase the size of the soft robot. In this work, we proposed the use of the ElectroHydroDynamics (EHD) principle to actuate a suction cup. EHD is a fluidic phenomenon coupled with electrochemical reaction that can induce pressure through the application of a high-intensity electric field. We succeeded in developing a suction cup driven by EHD keeping the whole structure extremely simple, fabricated by using a 3D printer and a cutting plotter. We can control the adhesion of the suction cup by controlling the direction of the fluidic flow in our EHD pump. Thanks to a symmetrical arrangement of the electrodes, composed by plates parallel to the direction of the channel, we can change the direction of the flow by changing the sign of the applied voltage. We obtained the pressure of 643 Pa in one unit of EHD pump and pressure of 1428 Pa in five units of EHD pump applying 6 kV. The suction cup actuator was able to hold and release a 2.86 g piece of paper. We propose the soft actuator driven by the EHD pump, and expand the possibility to miniaturize the size of soft robots.",

        "abstract": "In active vision, the camera motion is controlled in order to improve a certain visual sensing strategy. In this paper, we formulate an active vision task function to improve pose estimation. This is done by defining an optimality metric on the Fisher Information Matrix. This task is then incorporated into a weighted multi-objective optimization framework. To test this approach, we apply it on the three image point visual servoing problem which has a degenerate configuration - a singularity cylinder. The simulation results show that the singular configurations of pose estimation are avoided during visual servoing. We then discuss the potential of active vision to be integrated into more complex multi-task frameworks.",

Solutions of the formulated problems are shown for different kinds of bipedal architectures, and comparisons drawn between traditional rigid robots and compliant ones show the energy-efficiency of compliant actuators in the context of locomotion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to achieve online gait adaptation of a dynamically walking biped when collaborating with an external agent-either a human or a robot-acting as a leader. Adaptation occurs without any explicit information on the leader's intended motion; only implicit information is used through the interaction force developed between the leader and the biped. An adaptive supervisory control scheme is proposed and guarantees for boundedness of the state despite switching under external force are provided. The supervisory controller leverages the availability of a library of exponentially stable limit-cycle gaits, and orchestrates switching among them in an online fashion to achieve adaptation. As a result, the range of leader speeds that the biped can adapt to is drastically enlarged while the leader's effort is reduced.",

However, such systems' accuracy is limited by the accuracy of calibration of bias, scale factors, and non-orthogonality of sensor measurements. This paper reports a stable adaptive estimator of measurement bias in six-DOF IMUs and preliminary simulation results employing a commercially available IMU comprising a 3-axis fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) with a 3-axis micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer. A stability proof of the adaptive estimator and preliminary numerical simulation results are reported. The simulation results for a rotating IMU configuration are promising, and further experimental evaluation and extension of the algorithm for the case of a translating IMU configuration typically found on moving robotic vehicles are needed.",

We contribute a reinforcement learning-based approach that allows the robot to reason about its own ability to successfully complete the task given the current target pose and indirectly adjust that pose by prompting the human user. Our approach allows the robot both to trade-off the benefits of adjusting the target position against the cost of bothering the human user while, at the same time, adapting to each user's responses. Our approach was tested in a real-world human-robot collaboration scenario involving the Baxter robot.",

This paper proposes an adaptation of those techniques by addressing two main specificities of robot manipulators. As a first contribution, the design of input shapers for multiple-input and multiple-modes complex robot is studied. Design indicators based on elastic-dynamic model are proposed in order to choose one input shaper design among thousands of possible combinations. As a second contribution, the vibration mode frequency evolution of robot manipulators over their workspace is compensated by an adaptive control scheme. It is proposed to interpolate the modal variations over the workspace and tune the input shaper parameters dynamically. This contribution is implemented on a large scale flexible robot and shows promising results.",

        "abstract": "Modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRs) are mostly used in environments where it is difficult to navigate and explore otherwise. Especially, the shape-changing ability of MSRs makes them more dexterous in these situations compared to fixed-body robots. But when the MSR forms a new configuration, usually, the locomotion pattern for that particular configuration is not known by its constituting robotic modules. The main challenge for modules is to learn how to move in that specific configuration within a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we study the problem where an MSR needs to learn its movement pattern on-the-fly. To solve this problem, we have proposed a game theoretic solution based on multi-agent reinforcement learning using which the constituting modules distributedly learn the best actions that they need to perform to travel more distance in less time. We have implemented this approach in simulation on both ModRED and Yamor MSR platforms. Results show that our approach performs better (up to 7.86 times) in terms of average speed achieved for most of the tested configurations as compared to an existing locomotion learning approach.",

This work extends our previous studies on sensorimotor control strategies for active tactile perception in robotics. First, we present the active Bayesian perception method to actively reposition a robot to accumulate evidence from better locations to reduce uncertainty. Second, we describe the adaptive perception method that, based on a forward model and a predicted information gain approach, allows to the robot to analyse `what would have happened' if a different decision `would have been made' at previous decision time. This approach permits to adapt the active Bayesian perception process to improve the performance in accuracy and reaction time of an exploration task. Our methods are validated with a contour following exploratory procedure with a touch sensor. The results show that the adaptive perception method allows the robot to make sensory predictions and autonomously adapt, improving the performance of the exploration task.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive trajectory tracking problem for a spherical rolling robot driven by a 2DOF pendulum is considered in this paper. A feedback controller is proposed for the goal of tracking the trajectory for the full configuration of the spherical robot. To deal with time-varying uncertainty of the system dynamics, an adaptation mechanism is included in the trajectory tracking controller by parameterizing the system uncertainty with a polynomial function, weighted by unknown constant parameters adjustable by the defined update law. The constructed controller is first tested for the planar hoop-pendulum and then applied to the ball-pendulum system. The convergence to the desired trajectories under the control law is proved and then verified by simulations for tracking circular motions under perturbation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a walking load control strategy with a cane-type robot for gait training. The population of elderly people is increasing in most of the developed countries, and there is a growing demand for caregivers. Assistive robots are expected as a solution to provide aid in order to reduce the burden of caregivers in gait training of elderly people. Our research group has been developing a series of cane-type walking assistive robots named Intelligent Cane on admittance control to provide safe and efficient gait training. We propose an adaptive design method of the admittance control model in order to control user's walking load for the purpose of rapid improvement of user's physical strength. In the proposed method, the cane robot automatically adjusts control parameters of an admittance control model based on a correlation between a set of admittance parameters and a user's walking energy consumption. We conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed adaptive control strategy through a convergence error between estimated walking load and target one while walking training. We confirm the advantage of using the cane robot in rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "Appearance changes due to weather and seasonal conditions represent a strong impediment to the robust implementation of machine learning systems in outdoor robotics. While supervised learning optimises a model for the training domain, it will deliver degraded performance in application domains that underlie distributional shifts caused by these changes. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed via the collection of labelled data in multiple domains or by imposing priors on the type of shift between both domains. We frame the problem in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation and develop a framework for applying adversarial techniques to adapt popular, state-of-the-art network architectures with the additional objective to align features across domains. Moreover, as adversarial training is notoriously unstable, we first perform an extensive ablation study, adapting many techniques known to stabilise generative adversarial networks, and evaluate on a surrogate classification task with the same appearance change. The distilled insights are applied to the problem of free-space segmentation for motion planning in autonomous driving.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Impedance control is commonly implemented for robotic contact applications. Its performance is a function of the dynamic coupling between the environment and the robot's impedance controller: inertia, stiffness and damping. An interaction task may be considered successfully accomplished when the elected performance criteria, such as rise time, overshoot and accommodation are achieved, all in addition to guaranteeing stability. The selection and online changes of impedance parameters for such purpose is considered challenging for practical applications, given the non modeled dynamics of the robot and its intrinsic impedance, uncertainties in the dynamics of environment and tool. This study proposes the usage of a multi-objective genetic algorithm to obtain enhanced impedance controller gains, with the purpose of providing impedance control adaptability to a robot in a real physical interaction application. In this context, a one-degree-of-freedom mechanical contact model is proposed to obtain the values of the objective function. A genetic algorithm is used to obtain the best gains, as this is a nonlinear task. Simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed validating the system performance, which has shown a convergence of less than 6 generations. Tendencies to convergence of controller parameters were observed and discussed.",

The proposed approach is a 3D version of the Social Force Model (SFM) for the field of aerial robots which includes an interactive human-robot navigation scheme capable of predicting human motions and intentions so as to safely accompany them to their final destination. ASFM also introduces a new metric to fine-tune the parameters of the force model, and to evaluate the performance of the aerial robot companion based on comfort and distance between the robot and humans. The presented approach is extensively validated in diverse simulations and real experiments, and compared against other similar works in the literature. ASFM attains remarkable results and shows that it is a valuable framework for social robotics applications, such as guiding people or human-robot interaction.",

Computation time of planning algorithms has significantly decreased in part to using local information as opposed to using a global map for collision avoidance. Safe planning with local information, however, restricts the direction of travel to remain within the perception system's field-of-view (FOV). The vehicle's motion becomes more constrained with body-mounted narrow FOV sensors, reducing vehicle maneuverability and speed. This work presents a relaxed-constraint Model Predictive Control framework that allows motions outside the perception FOV with guaranteed safety. The key aspect of this approach is the ability to safely choose a motion primitive generated in the past. Simulation and hardware results shows the new framework improves time to goal and flight path efficiency in environments with varying levels of clutter.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algebraic approach for the estimation and control of single-link flexible joint robots. Typically, a sensory set to directly measure all robot states is hardly available. Especially in cost-efficient robotic systems as widely used in the industry, robots do not profit from \u2018link-sided\u2019 position measurements for end-effector control tasks but instead rely on easily accessible \u2018motor-sided\u2019 measurements in combination with model-based control strategies. In this paper, we are interested in obtaining online estimates of the unmeasured link position and speed for use in control. To that end, we introduce an algebraic estimation approach which relies only on motor position sensing and an accelerometer mounted near the end-effector. The estimation is based on an algebraic reformulation of the equations of motion which are linear in the unknown variables allowing an estimation process which is of non-asymptotic fashion. The proposed solution is illustrated by simulation and experimentally with an industrial robot. The robot is controlled by a common 2-DOF structure consisting of feed-forward and feedback control loops. Our experimental results show good tracking performance, especially in terms of suppressing residual vibrations.",

        "abstract": "There are driving applications for large populations of tiny robots in robotics, biology, and chemistry. These robots often lack onboard computation, actuation, and communication. Instead, these \u201crobots\u201d are particles carrying some payload and the particle swarm is controlled by a shared control input such as a uniform magnetic gradient or electric field. In previous works, we showed that the 2D position of each particle in such a swarm is controllable if the workspace contains a single obstacle the size of one particle. Requiring a small, rigid obstacle suspended in the middle of the workspace is a strong constraint, especially in 3D. This paper relaxes that constraint, and provides position control algorithms that only require non-slip wall contact in 2D. Both in vivo and artificial environments often have such boundaries. We assume that particles in contact with the boundaries have zero velocity if the shared control input pushes the particle into the wall. This paper provides a shortest-path algorithm for positioning a two-particle swarm, and a generalization to positioning an n-particle swarm. Results are validated with simulations and a hardware demonstration.",

We first estimate the ground plane (X-Y plane) from the two 3D point-clouds and align them to obtain a good estimate of the distance between the ground planes (i.e. tz) and rotations \u03b8x and \u03b8y about the X and Y axis respectively using the Rodrigues rotation formula. The remaining parameters (tx, ty, \u03b8z) are then estimated by maximizing the total mutual information (MI) between the 2D feature maps generated from the multi-modal sensor data. Experimental results using scans obtained by a vehicle equipped with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera are used to validate the robustness of the proposed algorithm over a wide range of initial conditions. The proposed method provides an efficient framework for multi-modal sensor data fusion and provides a robust solution to the scan alignment problem.",

Our framework relies on composing gait primitives corresponding to limit-cycle locomotion behaviors and it produces nominal motion plans that are compatible with the system's dynamics and can be tracked with high fidelity. The low-level controllers of the biped are designed within the Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD) framework. Exploiting the dimensional reduction afforded by HZD and properties of invariant sets of switching systems among multiple equilibria, we obtain polynomial approximations of a reduced order Poincar\u00e9 map and of the net change of the center of mass location over a stride. These polynomials are then incorporated in a high-level Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner to generate nominal plans which are tracked by the biped with drastically low drifting errors, without adversely affecting the time for computation.",

We therefore propose a novel state estimator by fully exploring the characteristic of aerodynamics of multi-rotor UAV. Our state estimator is fast and easy to be implemented. We have tested our estimator with different platforms in different scenes.

Most of current research proposes optimizations for itinerary creation for a single UAV. Contrary to this, our work proposes a distributed algorithm for collecting WSN data using a dynamic set of UAVs, that takes into account that UAVs leave or join the group due to recharging or malfunctions. In our work, we consider that the UAVs only have medium-range communication capability (a few meters) to deliver collected data, similar to the assumptions in related work. Compared to the costly and non-real-time Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)-approach our algorithm delivers approximately 3% more efficient sensor visiting on certain scenarios without using the optimized tour.",

The main objective is to improve the performance and the intuitivity of physical human-robot interaction. Currently, in such interactions, the human user must focus on the task as well as on the robot configuration. Indeed, the user must pay a close attention to the robot in order to avoid limitations such as joint position limitations, singularities and collisions with the environment. The proposed anticipative algorithm aims at relieving the human user from having to deal with such limitations by automatically avoiding them while considering the user's intentions. The framework developed to manage several limitations occurring simultaneously in three-dimensional space is first presented. The algorithm is then presented and detailed for each individual limitation of a spatial RRR serial robot. Finally, experiments are performed in order to assess the performance of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Science is a field of study which aims to extend the autonomy of exploration robots from low level functionality, such as on-board perception and obstacle avoidance, to science autonomy, which allows scientists to specify missions at task level. This will enable more remote and extreme environments such as deep ocean and other planets to be studied, leading to significant science discoveries. This paper presents an approach to extend the high level autonomy of robots by enabling them to model and reason about scientific knowledge on-board. We achieve this by using Bayesian networks to encode scientific knowledge and adapting Monte Carlo Tree Search techniques to reason about the network and plan informative sensing actions. The resulting knowledge representation and reasoning framework is anytime, handles large state spaces and robust to uncertainty making it highly applicable to field robotics. We apply the approach to a Mars exploration mission in which the robot is required to plan paths and decide when to use its sensing modalities to study a scientific latent variable of interest. Extensive simulation results show that our approach has significant performance benefits over alternative methods. We also demonstrate the practicality of our approach in an analog Martian environment where our experimental rover, Continuum, plans and executes a science mission autonomously.",

In order to efficiently plan operations, estimating the 3D pose of a point of interest is as important as detecting it. In this paper we propose a novel bilateral teleoperation architecture where an estimation scheme is exploited for recovering the position of a set of visual features while an operator steers the motion of the quadrotor UAV. The operator acts on a force-feedback master device that produces force cues meant to suggest where to drive the quadrotor for improving the convergence rate of the estimation process. The effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation strategy is validated by means of hardware in the loop simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an autonomous vision-based tracking system is presented to track a maneuvering target for a rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an onboard gimbal camera. To handle target occlusions or loss for real-time tracking, a robust and computationally efficient visual tracking scheme is considered using the Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) tracker and the redetection algorithm. The states of the target are estimated from the visual information. Moreover, feedback control laws of the gimbal and the UAV using the estimated states are proposed for the UAV to track the moving target autonomously. The algorithms are implemented on an onboard TK1 computer, and extensive outdoor flight experiments have been performed. Experimental results show that the proposed computationally efficient visual tracking scenario can stably track a maneuvering target and is robust to target occlusions and loss.",

        "abstract": "Image and point cloud registration methods compute the relative pose between two images. Commonly used registration algorithms are iterative and rely on the assumption that the motion between the images is small. In this work, we propose a fast pose estimation technique to compute a rough estimate of large motions between depth images, which can be used as initialization to dense registration methods. The main idea is to explore the properties given by planar surfaces with co-visibility and their normals from two distinct viewpoints. We present, in two decoupled stages, the rotation and then the translation estimation, both based on the normal vectors orientation and on the depth. These two stages are efficiently computed by using low resolution depth images and without any feature extraction/matching. We also analyze the limitations and observabilty of this approach, and its relationship to ICP point-to-plane. Notably, if the rotation is observable, at least five degrees of freedom can be estimated in the worst case. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we evaluate the initialization technique in a set of challenging scenarios, comprising simulated spherical images from the Sponza Atrium model benchmark and real spherical indoor sequences.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in sampling-based motion planning have exploited concepts similar to those used in the heuristic graph search community, such as computing heuristic cost-to-go estimates and using state-space abstractions to derive them. Following this trend, we explore how the concept of search effort can be exploited to find plans quickly. Most previous work in motion planning attempts to find plans quickly by preferring states with low cost-to-go. Recent work in graph search suggests that following search effort-to-go estimates can yield faster planning. In this paper, we demonstrate how this idea can be adapted to the context of kinodynamic motion planning. Our planner, BEAST, uses estimates of effort that are learned on-line to guide the expansion of a motion tree toward states through which a plan is estimated to be easy to find. We present results with four different simulated vehicles (car, hovercraft, blimp and quadrotor) in six different environments indicating that BEAST is able to find solutions much more quickly and has a higher success rate than previous methods. We see this work as further strengthening the algorithmic connections between motion planning and heuristic graph search.",

The electromagnetic actuated systems can steer the MNPs in vascular network for targeted drug delivery (TDD) systems. However, the real-time monitoring of MNPs remained as an open challenge which limits the application of these systems. In this paper, for the first time a 2D real-time imaging scheme has been developed for the MNPs guidance system. The proposed 2D navigation system based on magnetic particle imaging can allow real-time monitoring of MNPs and provides promising potentials for simultaneous monitoring and steering. In the experiments, MNPs of 45 to 65 nm diameter and 5 nm core (Iron) could be successfully monitored in real-time (update rate of 2 Hz) in 2D. The proposed 2D monitoring system can provide dynamic tracking of MNPs in targeted drug delivery and makes a MPI-based navigation system more feasible.",

It generates electrostatic adhesion forces up to 3.5 N (0.70 kPa) on Ge-coated polyimide film and 1.2 N on MLI blanket, a film composite used for satellite thermal insulation. Extremely low-force gripper engagement (0.08 N) and release (0.04 N) of films is ideal for micro-gravity. Individual fingers generate shear adhesion forces up to 4.76 N (5.04 kPa) using electrostatic adhesive and 45.0 N (47.6 kPa) with a hybrid electrostatic / gecko adhesive. To simulate a satellite servicing task, the gripper was mounted on a 7-DoF robot arm and performed a supervised grasp, manipulate, and release sequence on a hanging, Al-coated PET film.",

This paper presents the mapping component of an end-to-end system for crowdsourcing precise 3D maps with semantically meaningful landmarks such as traffic signs (6 dof pose, shape and size) and traffic lanes (3D splines). The system uses consumer grade parts, and in particular, relies on a single front facing camera and a consumer grade GPS. Using real-time sign and lane triangulation on-device in the vehicle, with offline sign/lane clustering across multiple journeys and offline Bundle Adjustment across multiple journeys in the backend, we construct maps with mean absolute accuracy at sign corners of less than 20 cm from 25 journeys. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end HD mapping pipeline in global coordinates in the automotive context using cost effective sensors.",

Here we consider perception and action as two serial information channels with limited information-processing capacity. We follow [2] and formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes utility under limited information-processing capacity in the two channels. As a solution we obtain an optimal perceptual channel and an optimal action channel that are coupled such that perceptual information is optimized with respect to downstream processing in the action module. The main novelty of this study is that we propose an online optimization procedure to find bounded-optimal perception and action channels in parameterized serial perception-action systems. In particular, we implement the perceptual channel as a multi-layer neural network and the action channel as a multinomial distribution. We illustrate our method in a NAO robot simulator with a simplified cup lifting task.",

        "abstract": "This work uses the intermediary quaternions in the design of a backstepping control technique with integral properties in order to perform an autonomous trajectory tracking using a quadcopter vehicle. Nowadays, in order to determine the orientation of a vehicle, most of the inertial systems of aircrafts can give directly the rotation matrix and taking advantage of this fact, the intermediary quaternions can be determined in a simple way from this matrix. Moreover, one specific orientation corresponds to only one intermediary quaternion and this helps to cope the unwinding phenomenon presented when working with the classical quaternions. The proposed control algorithm is validated numerically and experimentally when the quadrotor follows a circular trajectory. In addition, during the simulation part, some external perturbations and white noise were added in order to test the robustness of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is an invariant extended Kalman filter (EKF) for visual inertial navigation systems (VINS). It is demonstrated that the conventional EKF based VINS is not invariant under the stochastic unobservable transformation, associated with a translation and a rotation about the gravitational direction. This can lead to inconsistent state estimates as the estimator does not obey a fundamental property of the physical system. To address this issue, we use a novel uncertainty representation to derive a Right Invariant error extended Kalman filter (RIEKF-VINS) that preserves this invariance property. RIEKF-VINS is then adapted to the multi-state constraint Kalman filter framework to obtain a consistent state estimator. Both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments are used to validate the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Using multiple cooperative robots is advantageous for time critical Search and Rescue (SaR) missions as they permit rapid exploration of the environment and provide higher redundancy than using a single robot. A considerable number of applications such as autonomous driving and disaster response could benefit from merging mapping data from several agents. Online multi-robot localization and mapping has mainly been addressed for robots equipped with cameras or 2D LiDARs. However, in unstructured and ill-lighted real-life scenarios, a mapping system can potentially benefit from a rich 3D geometric solution. In this work, we present an online localization and mapping system for multiple robots equipped with 3D LiDARs. This system is based on incremental sparse pose-graph optimization using sequential and place recognition constraints, the latter being identified using a 3D segment matching approach. The result is a unified representation of the world and relative robot trajectories. The complete system runs in real-time and is evaluated with two experiments in different environments: one urban and one disaster scenario. The system is available open source and easy-to-run demonstrations are publicly available.",

        "abstract": "An objective performance measure for movement tasks is widely regarded as having utmost relevance for the therapy of movement disorders. Existing systems typically rely on human experts, which is known to produce substantial inter- and intra-rater variability. Present solutions are either based on simple features or invasive motion capture techniques. They typically work on a specific motion task only and fail to generalize to other tasks. In addition, they often require manual offline pre- and post-processing. In this paper we present a novel approach to compute a continuous and objective performance measure online during a patient session, without tedious and time-consuming pre- or post-processing steps. Our approach is able to generalize between different motion capture devices and different motion tasks. It runs on live motion data extracted with a non-invasive marker-less off-the-shelf vision-based tracking system as well as on data extracted from an inertial measurement unit suit. In the experiments we show that our approach is competitive with an offline approach as well as with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Our approach is robust with respect to motion execution speed and it outperforms the offline approach regarding movement task generalization. We show promising results to track the current state of a Parkinson's subject online during a therapy session.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing demand of humans and robots collaborating in a confined workspace, it is essential that robots can react instantaneously to unforeseen events while respecting comfort of human co-workers. As the human pays especial attention to the end-effector movement rather than individual joints in such tasks, we argue that it is necessary to limit exactly these end-effector dynamics directly on SE(3), regardless of any specific coordinate system. Only then it is possible to constrain the robot end-effector in its absolute dynamic values, to enhance human comfort. Common online trajectory generators (OTGs) are either limited to single degrees of freedom (DOFs) or consider decoupled multi-DOF mainly in joint space. While these strategies can be directly applied to Cartesian coordinate systems by using Euler angles for orientation, constraining the change in Euler angles does not lead to the correct angular velocities. In this work we present a novel OTG with constraints on translational and rotational magnitudes on SE(3). Simulations as well as experiments on a KUKA LWR4+ show the potential contribution towards improved Human-Robot-Collaboration.",

Unfortunately, such systems require many cameras and are, consequently, expensive. In this paper, we propose an approach to considerably increase the optical tracking volume without adding cameras. First, when the target becomes no longer visible by at least two cameras we propose a single-view tracking mode which requires only one camera. Furthermore, we propose to rely on controlled cameras able to track the UAV all around the volume to provide 6DoF tracking data through multi-view registration. This is achieved by using a visual servoing scheme. The two methods can be combined in order to maximize the tracking volume. We propose a proof-of-concept of such an optical tracking system based on two consumer-grade cameras and a pan-tilt actuator and we used this approach on UAV localization.",

In contrast to other approaches, we ignore the structure of the environment (e.g., lane markings), focusing purely on following the path driven by the vehicle ahead. Based on the leader's velocity, its distance to the ego vehicle and its recorded path, a continuous-curvature trajectory is generated using Sequential Quadratic Programming. As the optimization process takes the ego vehicle's kinematic and dynamic constraints into account, the resulting trajectory is guaranteed to be feasible and safe. The algorithm was tested extensively during practical experiments with an actual autonomous car. Our tests were conducted in both on- and off-road environments, with speeds ranging from 1 m/s to 15 m/s. Ground truth data shows that the system achieves a high degree of accuracy even in difficult scenarios.",

However, current multicopters for delivery can be dangerous for people, and are difficult to store and transport. Safety issues arise because users are exposed to unshielded spinning propellers. Transportation to the place of deployment and storage is often impaired by the large size that is required for heavy lifting. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing the integration of a quadcopter into a foldable protective cage. The cage provides an all-round protective structure that physically separates the propellers from the environment, ensuring the safety of people. The drone and the cage can be easily folded with a single movement, significantly reducing its size for ease of storage and transportation. This design has been validated with a quadcopter that can lift parcels up to 500 g and reduce its storage volume by 92% when folded.",

Current studies on engineering electrosense focus on designing sophisticated sensors and algorithms for emulating biological functions including localization and identification. This work aimed to develop a planar sensor equipped with a dense electrode array that is capable of providing accurate and dense data for identifying objects of similar volume and aspect ratio, which has been a challenge in underwater sensing. After sensor design and implementation were presented, convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are widely used in digital image recognition, was trained using both simulation and experimental data. In the simulation, the overall success rate on identifying the sphere, cube, and rod is 92.6% by a 28 \u00d7 28 electrode array. In the preliminary experimental tests, a sensor with 16 \u00d7 16 electrode array achieved an overall success rate of 90.4% on identifying a sphere and a rod.",

We present an example on how robot technology is utilized to understand human behavior which is useful to build human-like navigation models. The work consists of three parts, data collection from manual driving participants, habituation modeling and autonomous navigation experimentation. Manual driving data collection consisted of recording human driving control behavior using a robotic wheelchair in a complex labyrinth-like environment, while measuring physiological activity and emotional state via subjective reports (questionnaires). The purpose of this first part was to collect a sufficient representation of the evolution of human driving behavior in a complex environment (23 participants), such that a numerical model could be found to approximate the trend in velocity usage; velocity usage characterizes navigational habituation. The complex environment habituation model was tested and evaluated, on a different set of 16 participants, in a fully autonomous navigation setting where the robotic wheelchair followed a pre-recorded path. Self-reports and physiological measures confirmed that the proposed habitation velocity regulation model provides a more comfortable ride compared to slow and fast pre-defined static velocity profiles.",

Finally, theoretical values of the grip force were calculated according to the analysis, and the actual grip force was measured experimentally.

        "abstract": "3D laser scanners are frequently used sensors for mobile robots or autonomous cars and they are often used to perceive the static as well as dynamic aspects in the scene. In this context, matching 3D point clouds of objects is a crucial capability. Most matching methods such as numerous flavors of ICP provide little information about the quality of the match, i.e. how well do the matched objects correspond to each other, which goes beyond point-to-point or point-to-plane distances. In this paper, we propose a projective method that yields a probabilistic measure for the quality of matched scans. It not only considers the differences in the point locations but can also take free-space information into account. Our approach provides a probabilistic measure that is meaningful enough to evaluate scans and to cluster real-world data such as scans taken with Velodyne scanner in urban scenes in an unsupervised manner.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an anisotropic shadow-based operation assistant method for a multilink-articulated wheeled pipeline-inspection robot by using a single illuminator and camera. By displacing the position of the illuminator relative to that of the head camera, a crescent-shaped shadow appears in the images captured in a bent pipe. The size, position, and orientation of the shadow depend on the robot's orientation around the pipe axis, and the shadow disappears in a certain robot's orientation (anisotropic shadow). Generally, as for shadow based navigation systems, disappearances of the shadow should be avoided because the robot loses its way. However, our previously developed robot (AIRo-2) adapts to a bent pipe without any control when the robot's orientation and the pathway direction of the bent pipe are aligned. By aligning those two specific orientations, we propose operation assistant system to pass through winding pipes. In this paper, the shadow region is extracted using two types of image binarization. The proposed system was experimentally verified in pipelines including seven bent pipes by applying the pathway direction of the bent pipe (obtained from the shadow) to the rolling movement of the robot.",

Each arm provides four degrees of freedom (DOF) for end effector positioning in a kinematic configuration close to the human arm: shoulder pitch, roll and yaw, and elbow pitch. The aluminum frame structure of the arms has been designed with a double purpose: protecting the servo actuators against direct impacts and overloads, and allowing the integration of a compliant transmission mechanism with deflection measurement between the servo shaft and the output link Mechanical joint compliance increases safety in the physical interactions with the environment, removing also joint overloads typical in closed kinematic chain configurations. The dual arm system has been integrated in a hexarotor platform with a visual servoing system for object grasping, evaluating its performance first in a fixed base test bench and later in outdoor flight tests.",

Long, sufficiently even distances can be quickly covered by driving while obstacles can be overcome by stepping. Our quadruped robot Momaro, with steerable pairs of wheels located at the end of each of its compliant legs, allows such locomotion. Planning respective paths attracted only little attention so far. We propose a navigation planning method which generates hybrid locomotion paths. The planner chooses driving mode whenever possible and takes into account the detailed robot footprint. If steps are required, the planner includes those. To accelerate planning, steps are planned first as abstract manoeuvres and are expanded afterwards into detailed motion sequences. Our method ensures at all times that the robot stays stable. Experiments show that the proposed planner is capable of providing paths in feasible time, even for challenging terrain.",

It generates an entire set of motions to finish specific tasks in an environment containing obstacles by exploiting a powerful inverse kinematics (IK) engine. The IK engine can compute solutions allowing the robot to reposition its feet for meeting the task requirements. The presented planning algorithm has two primary beneficial capabilities. First, it is capable of generating a motion plan to complete a task handling multiple ordered or unordered actions. Second, it produces an initial solution very quickly, and then searches for the opportunity to improve the the solution during execution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the NASA-JSC Valkyrie humanoid robot by demonstrating an object pick up task in simulation and a box pick-and-place task in the real world.",

However uncertainties related to joint angle measurements and manipulator geometry are unavoidable, especially when grasping and using different tools or when we do not have access to an accurate robot model, e.g. when we construct a robotic system by hand. The generalized inverse kinematics methods are not applicable when a manipulator stay inside its singular region. We derive the upper bounds on the joint measurement errors and geometric uncertainties, in order to guarantee that the open-chain serial manipulators stay outside the singular region. These bounds in other words enable en effective execution of generalized inverse kinematics methods for a robotic system which is prone to geometric uncertainties.

        "abstract": "Kinematic calibration of a robotic manipulator determines its fabricated dimensions that inevitably deviate, due to manufacturing tolerances, from the specified/designed geometry. Conventional calibration methods achieve this goal by deriving a system of constraint equations from the kinematic structure. Workspace coordinates and the corresponding joint space coordinates are experimentally obtained so that these constraint equations can be solved for the optimal geometric parameters that best fit the data. This paper proposes an alternative kinematic calibration method that leverages response surface methodology to obtain empirical models of direct and inverse kinematics from the same experimental data. The advantages the proposed method include nullifying the requirements of deriving constraint equations and performing joint sensor calibration. In addition, since the developed models are empirical in nature, whether closed-form solutions to the direct or the indirect model is available becomes conveniently inconsequential. Both physical and simulation experiments were conducted on a 3-PSS/S to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method.",

Specifically, we approximate individual belief vectors with a fixed bound on the number of non-zero values they may contain. We prove the correctness and a strong error bound when the \u03c3-approximation is used with the point-based value iteration (PBVI) family algorithms. An analysis compares the algorithm on six larger domains, varying the number of non-zero values for the \u03c3-approximation. Results clearly demonstrate that when the algorithm used with PBVI (\u03c3-PBVI), we can achieve over an order of magnitude improvement. We ground our claims with a full robotic implementation for simultaneous navigation and localization using POMDPs with \u03c3-PBVI.",

Such drawbacks make humanoid robots' locomotion sensitive to external disturbances and compromise robots' agility in unstructured environment. In this work, we specifically focus on the push recovery problem for humanoid robots. We propose an approach to design a nonlinear controller that is robust to external disturbances. It allows the state of the rigid body dynamics to asymptotically converge to the subspace that meet the criteria of balancing, based on the properties of artificial invariant subspace and potential functions. Our algorithm is completely adaptive in real time without requiring trajectory planning in advance. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm base on extensive push recovery experiments on the DARWIN-OP robot platform on flat terrains.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we provide a solution for posturing the anthropomorphic Robonaut-2 hand and arm for grasping based on visual information. A mapping from visual features extracted from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to grasp points is learned. We demonstrate that a CNN pre-trained for image classification can be applied to a grasping task based on a small set of grasping examples. Our approach takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of the CNN by identifying features that capture the hierarchical support relations between filters in different CNN layers and locating their 3D positions by tracing activations backwards in the CNN. When this backward trace terminates in the RGB-D image, important manipulable structures are thereby localized. These features that reside in different layers of the CNN are then associated with controllers that engage different kinematic subchains in the hand/arm system for grasping. A grasping dataset is collected using demonstrated hand/object relationships for Robonaut-2 to evaluate the proposed approach in terms of the precision of the resulting preshape postures. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms baseline approaches in cluttered scenarios on the grasping dataset and a point cloud based approach on a grasping task using Robonaut-2.",

Attention comes in two flavours: the gaze direction (overt attention) and attention to a specific part of the current field of view (covert attention), of which the latter is the focus of the present study. Specifically, we study the effects of attentional masking within pre-trained deep neural networks for the purpose of handling ambiguous scenes containing multiple objects. We investigate several variants of attentional masking on partially pre-trained deep neural networks and evaluate the effects on classification performance and sensitivity to attention mask errors in multi-object scenes. We find that a combined scheme consisting of multi-level masking and blending provides the best trade-off between classification accuracy and insensitivity to masking errors. This proposed approach is denoted multilayer continuous-valued convolutional feature masking (MC-CFM). For reasonably accurate masks it can suppress the influence of distracting objects and reach comparable classification performance to unmasked recognition in cases without distractors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Ground-based teleoperation of robots in space is subject to time delays of several seconds or more. This leads to the use of model-based approaches, where the operator interacts with a model (simulation) of the remote environment and the remote robot attempts to reproduce the results of that interaction. But, it is also desirable for the operator to view (delayed) images from the remote scene. These images, however, are often from one or more monocular cameras mounted on the robot end-effector, which leads to several other problems: unintuitive teleoperation due to the eye-in-hand configuration, limited field of view, and lack of stereo visualization. We present an augmented virtuality interface for teleoperation, which can solve these problems by projecting the real camera images onto a registered 3D model of the environment and allowing the operator to select any desired viewpoint. This approach is suitable when there is at least a partial model of the environment, as is the case for satellite servicing. The proposed method begins with a video survey to register the 3D model to the physical environment, followed by a user interface that presents a stereo visualization of the model, augmented by projections of real camera images onto the model. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare the augmented virtuality images to real camera images taken from the same viewpoint and perform experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the augmented virtuality paradigm for teleoperation. The results suggest that this approach can improve operator situation awareness, potentially leading to better performance, especially when the camera views are unintuitive or limited.",

Robotic manipulation has important significance to improve the operation success rate and reduce the technical threshold, but the problem of inefficiency still exists in batch-cell experiments. In this paper, an automated cell transportation system is designed for batch-cell manipulation. It has some technical aspects such as a cell groove to contain the cells, the micromanipulator and motor stage control methods, and computer vision algorithms. Since the cells are arranged in a line in the groove, the transportation system improves the efficiency of finding the cells in the petri dish. Furthermore, the minimum pressure to drag and release the cell are analyzed theoretically, so that the other cells will not be affected when manipulating one cell. The visual algorithms to detect the cell position and cell holding state are evaluated by porcine oocyte. Experimental results show both algorithm has high success rates: 96% and 100%. Finally, cell rotating experiments are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the transportation system. The average transfer efficiency has been improved by 20% compared to manual operation. The results show that this system can be used in many manipulations.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots that use multiple depth sensors to perceive their environments, rely on extrinsic calibration to combine the individual views from each sensor into a single coherent view of the surroundings. Such extrinsic calibration is tedious to perform manually, and requires that specific scenes to calibrate. Current state of the art automatic approaches do not consider the content of scenes used for calibration, and thus are not robust to partially informative scenes in long-term deployments. In this paper, we present Delta-Calibration, an automated extrinsic calibration technique that takes into account the information in a scene for calibration. Delta-Calibration relies on constrained sensor motion to minimize the effects of desynchronization, and ego-motion estimation from each depth camera to detect significant changes in pose, which we term Delta-Transforms. We derive a solution to the extrinsic calibration using such Delta-Transforms taking into account uncertain axes of motion in the environment, and further infer necessary and sufficient conditions on the Delta-Transforms such that Delta-Calibration results in a unique, non-singular, and numerically stable extrinsic calibration. We present quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of Delta-Calibration at computing extrinsic calibration over different arrangements of depth sensors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Selective weeding is one of the key challenges in the field of agriculture robotics. To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task, actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e., crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real and synthetic images as training data. The reported results confirm the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Recently in tandem with the spread of portable devices for reading electronic books, devices for digitizing paper books, called book scanners, are developed to meet the increased demand for digitizing privately owned books. However, conventional book scanners still have complex components to mechanically turn pages and to rectify the acquired images that are inevitably distorted by the curvy book surface. Here, we present the multi-scale mechanism that turns pages electronically using electroadhesive force generated by a micro-scale structure. Its another advantage is that perspective correction of image processing is applicable to readily reconstruct the distorted images of pages. Specifically, to turn one page at a time not two pages, we employ a micro-scale structure to generate near-field electroadhesive force that decays rapidly and accordingly attracts objects within tens of micrometers. We analyze geometrical parameters of the micro-scale structure to improve the decay characteristics. We find that the decay characteristics of electroadhesive force definitely depends upon the geometrical period of the micro-scale structure, while its magnitude depends on a variety of parameters. Based on this observation, we propose a novel electrode configuration with improved decay characteristics. Dynamical stability and kinematic requirements are also examined to successfully introduce near-field electroadhesive force into our digitizing process.",

Our approach is based on optimization-based maneuver planning that supports dynamic lane-changes, swerving, and braking in all traffic scenarios and guides the vehicle to its goal position. We take into account various traffic constraints, including collision avoidance with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists using control velocity obstacles. We use a data-driven approach to model the vehicle dynamics for control and collision avoidance. Furthermore, our trajectory computation algorithm takes into account traffic rules and behaviors, such as stopping at intersections and stoplights, based on an arc-spline representation. We have evaluated our algorithm in a simulated environment and tested its interactive performance in urban and highway driving scenarios with tens of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. These scenarios include jaywalking pedestrians, sudden stops from high speeds, safely passing cyclists, a vehicle suddenly swerving into the roadway, and high-density traffic where the vehicle must change lanes to progress more effectively.",

In this paper, we present a novel active vision approach for DCC calibration, which directly reduces the parameter uncertainty by selecting calibration measurements using an information theoretic next-best-view policy. Our system automatically selects the next best measurement for the calibration by determining the optimal actuator inputs which minimize the predicted covariance of the extrinsic parameters. We show that our method is able to successfully estimate calibration parameters up to a user specified accuracy with no manual excitation. We test our method in simulation on a variety of actuated mechanisms and validate the results on a real 3 axis gimbal, and demonstrate our approach is able to achieve accurate calibrations using fewer measurement sets when compared to existing approaches.",

Motivating our work is a prior project [1] that manually developed a surface classifier using an accelerometer; to verify our system functionality, we replicate those results with our new automated system and improve on those results, providing a four-surface classifier with a 75% classification rate and a hard/soft classifier with a 100% classification rate. We further verify our system through a field experiment that collects and classifies new data, proving its end-to-end functionality. Overall, our system reduces the time and machine learning expertise needed by the user to develop new time-series classifiers usable by the UAV. The general form of our system provides a valuable tool for automation of classifier creation and is released as an open-source tool [2].",

        "abstract": "Robots are increasingly operating in indoor environments designed for and shared with people. However, robots working safely and autonomously in uneven and unstructured environments still face great challenges. Many modern indoor environments are designed with wheelchair accessibility in mind. This presents an opportunity for wheeled robots to navigate through sloped areas while avoiding staircases. In this paper, we present an integrated software and hardware system for autonomous mobile robot navigation in uneven and unstructured indoor environments. This modular and reusable software framework incorporates capabilities of perception and navigation. Our robot first builds a 3D OctoMap representation for the uneven environment with the 3D mapping using wheel odometry, 2D laser and RGB-D data. Then we project multilayer 2D occupancy maps from OctoMap to generate the the traversable map based on layer differences. The safe traversable map serves as the input for efficient autonomous navigation. Furthermore, we employ a variable step size Rapidly Exploring Random Trees that could adjust the step size automatically, eliminating tuning step sizes according to environments. We conduct extensive experiments in simulation and real-world, demonstrating the efficacy and efficiency of our system. (Supplemented video link: https://youtu.be/6XJWcsH1fk0).",

The model predicts potential moving obstacles from blind intersections to proactively slow down to avoid potential collisions. The derivation of the model is described and its parameters are detailed. The local planner computes smooth trajectories with smooth velocity profiles so that the vehicle can follow the paths without jerk and sudden accelerations resulting in safe and comfortable navigation. Experimental results in simulation and in the real field with an autonomous car, show that the proposed predictive driving framework can reproduce human expert driver's trajectories and velocities when facing blind intersections.",

        "abstract": "Efficient robotic navigation requires a predefined map. Various autonomous exploration strategies exist, which direct robots to unexplored space by detecting frontiers. Frontiers are boundaries separating known space form unknown space. Usually frontier detection utilizes image processing tools like edge detection, thus limiting it to two dimensional (2D) exploration. This paper presents a new exploration strategy based on the use of multiple Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs). The RRT algorithm is chosen because, it is biased towards unexplored regions. Also, using RRT provides a general approach which can be extended to higher dimensional spaces. The proposed strategy is implemented and tested using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Additionally this work uses local and global trees for detecting frontier points, which enables efficient robotic exploration. Current efforts are limited to the single robot case. Extension to multi-agent systems and three-dimensional (3D) space is left for future effort.",

        "abstract": "Software testing is an important tool to ensure software quality. This is a hard task in robotics due to dynamic environments and the expensive development and time-consuming execution of test cases. Most testing approaches use model-based and/or simulation-based testing to overcome these problems. We propose model-free skill-centric testing in which a robot autonomously executes skills in the real world and compares it to previous experiences. The skills are selected by maximising the expected information gain on the distribution of erroneous software functions. We use deep learning to model the sensor data observed during previous successful skill executions and to detect irregularities. Sensor data is connected to function call profiles such that certain misbehaviour can be related to specific functions. We evaluate our approach in simulation and in experiments with a KUKA LWR 4+ robot by purposefully introducing bugs to the software. We demonstrate that these bugs can be detected with high accuracy and without the need for the implementation of specific tests or task-specific models.",

Active vision systems allow to extend the observable workspace by employing active gaze control, i.e. by shifting the gaze to relevant areas in the scene. When moving the eyes, stabilization of the camera images is crucial for successful task execution. In this paper, we present an active vision system for task-oriented selection of view directions and gaze stabilization to enable a humanoid robot to robustly perform vision-based tasks. We investigate the interaction between a gaze stabilization controller and view planning to select the next best view direction based on saliency maps which encode task-relevant information. We demonstrate the performance of the systems in a real world scenario, in which a humanoid robot is performing vision-based grasping while moving, a task that would not be possible without the combination of view selection and gaze stabilization.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a current control scheme for the brushless DC (BLDC) motor is proposed. In order to estimate the phase current, it employs the adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) and measurement of a single DC link current. When estimating the motor phase current, measurement of a single DC link current is scaled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) duty. If the PWM duty is very small, the sensitivity of the measurement noise is dramatically increased. In order to solve this problem adaptive EKF is applied. Therefore, estimated phase current using adaptive EKF prevents the possible occurrence of an unstable situation due to the sensitivity. The accuracy of the proposed current control scheme was confirmed by comparing the estimated current by adaptive EKF and the measured actual phase current. In additions, the effectiveness was verified through the current-control time response of the when the PWM duty for the control was close to zero. By using the proposed current control scheme, robust current control of the BLDC motor was possible with a single DC link current.",

        "abstract": "Camera relocalization plays a vital role in many robotics and computer vision tasks, such as global localization, recovery from tracking failure, and loop closure detection. Recent random forests based methods directly predict 3D world locations for 2D image locations to guide the camera pose optimization. During training, each tree greedily splits the samples to minimize the spatial variance. However, these greedy splits often produce uneven sub-trees in training or incorrect 2D-3D correspondences in testing. To address these problems, we propose a sample-balanced objective to encourage equal numbers of samples in the left and right sub-trees, and a novel backtracking scheme to remedy the incorrect 2D-3D correspondence predictions. Furthermore, we extend the regression forests based methods to use local features in both training and testing stages for outdoor RGB-only applications. Experimental results on publicly available indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, which shows superior or on-par accuracy with several state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "For fast-moving legged robots, the ability to stop rapidly is essential if they are to move safely through unpredictable environments. There is a trade-off between stability and rapidity however, as the forces that slow the robot down also tend to cause a toppling moment. This paper examines how rapid deceleration motions performed on a bipedal robot are affected if it is forced to maintain zero rate of change in angular momentum (ZRAM) throughout the maneuver. By using trajectory optimization to generate over 4000 gait termination motions from speeds comparable to a sprinting human, it was found that the stopping distance could be reduced by 12% and time by 25% by relaxing the ZRAM condition, with greater reductions possible through the addition of a free stabilizing limb. The ability to moderate the pitch of the robot while decelerating was found to be paramount to achieving a rapid stop and thus, a template incorporating an inertial body and stabilizing appendages is proposed to represent these maneuvers.",

        "abstract": "Designing and representing control algorithms is challenging in swarm robotics, where the collective swarm performance depends on interactions between robots and with their environment. The currently available modeling languages, such as UML, cannot fully express these interactions. We therefore propose a new, Behaviour-Data Relations Modeling Language (BDRML), where robot behaviours and data that robots utilise, as well as relationships between them, are explicitly represented. This allows BDRML to express control algorithms where robots cooperate and share information with each other while interacting with the environment.",

We discuss the conditions required for optimal substructure in the single-source search of a roadmap in belief space, demonstrating that there are several desirable cost functions for which this property cannot be achieved. Practical performance issues of BRMS are discussed, including the implications of a commonly-used anti-cycling rule, and the computational complexity realized in practical applications of the technique. We propose a best-first implementation of BRMS, in contrast to the standard breadth-first implementation, which we show to improve the computational cost of search by up to 49% by eliminating unnecessary node expansions - the mechanics of both approaches are compared in detail. A variety of motion planning examples are explored.",

        "abstract": "Active Object Recognition (AOR) has been approached as an unsupervised learning problem, in which optimal trajectories for object inspection are not known and to be discovered by reducing label uncertainty or training with reinforcement learning. Such approaches suffer from local optima and have no guarantees of the quality of their solution. In this paper, we treat AOR as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and find near-optimal values and corresponding action-values of training data using Belief Tree Search (BTS) on the AOR belief Markov Decision Process (MDP). AOR then reduces to the problem of knowledge transfer from these action-values to the test set. We train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network on these values to predict the best next action on the training set rollouts and experimentally show that our method generalizes well to explore novel objects and novel views of familiar objects with high accuracy. We compare this supervised scheme against guided policy search, and show that the LSTM network reaches higher recognition accuracy compared to the guided policy search and guided Neurally Fitted Q-iteration. We further look into optimizing the observation function to increase the total collected reward during active recognition. In AOR, the observation function is known only approximately. We derive a gradient-based update for the observation function to increase the total expected reward. We show that by optimizing the observation function and retraining the supervised LSTM network, the AOR performance on the test set improves significantly.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a binary feature based Loop Closure Detection (LCD) method is proposed, which for the first time achieves higher precision-recall (PR) performance compared with state-of-the-art SIFT feature based approaches. The proposed system originates from our previous work Multi-Index hashing for Loop closure Detection (MILD), which employs Multi-Index Hashing (MIH) [1] for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search of binary features. As the accuracy of MILD is limited by repeating textures and inaccurate image similarity measurement, burstiness handling is introduced to solve this problem and achieves considerable accuracy improvement. Additionally, a comprehensive theoretical analysis on MIH used in MILD is conducted to further explore the potentials of hashing methods for ANN search of binary features from probabilistic perspective. This analysis provides more freedom on best parameter choosing in MIH for different application scenarios. Experiments on popular public datasets show that the proposed approach achieved the highest accuracy compared with state-of-the-art while running at 30Hz for databases containing thousands of images.",

It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are employed by each sensor and no measurements of known landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant biases on each sensor.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a biped foot placement controller based on capture point (CP) feedback control. This capture point feedback controller generates desired Zero Moment Point (ZMP) according to current capture point error. We call this desired ZMP as Control-ZMP (cZMP). Using this cZMP, we constructed (i) a disturbance adapting walking pattern generator, (ii) an ankle torque reference generator, (iii) a landing foot position adjustor and, (iv) a step time adjustor. By applying these controllers, the biped system becomes robust over uneven terrain and external pushing disturbances. We considered cZMP as a key indicator of bipedal walking stability. If the cZMP is within the support polygon, the robot will track the cZMP by using (i) and (ii). If the cZMP is outside of the support polygon, the robot will change footstep position and time by using (iii) and (iv) (COM pattern will be changed by (i) too). Capture point dynamics is described based on a linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model. The performance of the suggested control algorithm is validated in the Choreonoid simulator with a model of DRC-HUBO+ [11], [12].",

The conventional whole body master-slave approaches need static balancing assumption or a certain time length of planning after operator's input. Then, we introduce a set of limitations that allows the robot to execute human's daily dynamic bipedal locomotion, but forbid dangerous motions like the COM will be gone outside of the support region. In the limitations, we regulate COM velocity based on a positional relation of the Divergent Component of Motion (Capture Point) and the both feet, and automatically modify the swing foot contact timing with judging the ZMP is inside or outside of the single foot support region. At last, we conducted some experiments of the real time master-slave locomotion with using two life-sized humanoid robots and confirmed the effectiveness of our novel limitation methods.",

This paper presents a reactive bipedal walking controller against swing foot collision for humanoid robots. This controller is composed of following three components: 1) Swing Foot Trajectory Regenerator, 2) Swing Foot Collision Detector, and 3) Swing Foot Impact Mitigation Controller. By regenerating swing foot trajectory depending on situations, humanoid robots can avoid falling down. However, although humanoid robots detect collision and regenerate a swing foot, collision impact can cause bad effects such as damage and posture rotation. Therefore, to mitigate strong impact, we propose Swing Foot Impact Mitigation Controller, which is composed of two controllers. The proposed method is validated through the experiments by actual humanoid robot CHIDORI. We confirm that CHIDORI can avoid falling down against collision in two situations: walking on the flat ground, and stepping up a stair.",

        "abstract": "The most data-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics are based on uncertain dynamical models: after each episode, they first learn a dynamical model of the robot, then they use an optimization algorithm to find a policy that maximizes the expected return given the model and its uncertainties. It is often believed that this optimization can be tractable only if analytical, gradient-based algorithms are used; however, these algorithms require using specific families of reward functions and policies, which greatly limits the flexibility of the overall approach. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based RL algorithm, called Black-DROPS (Black-box Data-efficient RObot Policy Search) that: (1) does not impose any constraint on the reward function or the policy (they are treated as black-boxes), (2) is as data-efficient as the state-of-the-art algorithm for data-efficient RL in robotics, and (3) is as fast (or faster) than analytical approaches when several cores are available. The key idea is to replace the gradient-based optimization algorithm with a parallel, black-box algorithm that takes into account the model uncertainties. We demonstrate the performance of our new algorithm on two standard control benchmark problems (in simulation) and a low-cost robotic manipulator (with a real robot).",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Surgical interventions are increasingly executed minimal invasively. Surgeons insert instruments through tiny incisions in the body and pivot slender instruments to treat organs or tissue below the surface. While a blessing for patients, surgeons need to pay extra attention to overcome the fulcrum effect, reduced haptic feedback and deal with lost hand-eye coordination. The mental load makes it difficult to pay sufficient attention to the forces that are exerted on the body wall. In delicate procedures such as fetal surgery, this might be problematic as irreparable damage could cause premature delivery. As a first attempt to quantify the interaction forces applied on the patient's body wall, a novel 6 degrees of freedom force sensor was developed for an ex-vivo set up. The performance of the sensor was characterised. User experiments were conducted by 3 clinicians on a set up simulating a fetal surgical intervention. During these simulated interventions, the interaction forces were recorded and analysed when a normal instrument was employed. These results were compared with a session where a flexible instrument under haptic guidance was used. The conducted experiments resulted in interesting insights in the interaction forces and stresses that develop during such difficult surgical intervention. The results also implicated that haptic guidance schemes and the use of flexible instruments rather than rigid ones could have a significant impact on the stresses that occur at the body wall.",

However, most research considers only isolated technical modules. There exist significant gaps between maps generated by SLAM algorithms and maps required for motion planning. This paper presents a complete online system that consists in three modules: incremental SLAM, real-time dense mapping, and free space extraction. The obtained free-space volume (i.e. a tessellation of tetrahedra) can be served as regular geometric constraints for motion planning. Our system runs in real-time thanks to the engineering decisions proposed to increase the system efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset to demonstrate the run-time performance. Qualitative and quantitative results on mapping accuracy are also shown. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a modular in-pipeline climbing robot with a novel compliant foldable OmniCrawler mechanism. The robot has a series of 3 compliant foldable OmniCrawler modules interconnected by links via passive joints. The circular cross-section of the module enables a holonomic motion to facilitate the alignment of the robot in the direction of bends. Additionally, the crawler mechanism provides a fair amount of traction, even on slippery pipe surfaces. These advantages of crawler modules have been further augmented by incorporating active compliance in the module, which helps to negotiate sharp bends in small diameter pipes. Introducing compliance in the crawler module with a single chain-lugs assembly is the the key novelty of this design. For the desirable pipe diameter and curvature of the bends, the spring stiffness value for each passive joint is determined by formulating a constrained optimization problem using the quasi-static model of the robot. Moreover, a minimum friction coefficient value between the module-pipe surface which can be vertically climbed by the robot without slipping is estimated. The numerical simulation results have further been validated by experiments on real robot prototype.",

Inspired by weakly electric fish, a novel electric current communication (termed electrocommunication) system has been developed for small underwater robots in our previous studies. However, collision problems sometimes occur during multiple robots communication because the electrocommunication network shares a common channel. In this paper, a new CSMA/CA-based electrocommunication system is presented to solve this collision problem. An efficient circuit for communication channel state (busy or idle) detection is proposed. After that, a compact Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm is introduced and finally implemented on the system to judiciously avoid collision during multiple robot communication. The effectiveness of the proposed CSMA/CA-based communication system for underwater robot groups is well verified by both simulations and experiments with three robotic fish models.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of overapproximative short-term prediction of arm movement, for safe human-robot co-existence. A trajectory planner for a robot manipulator which formally verifies non-collision requires fast prediction of human future occupancy, which must be accurate yet still account for all possible human movement. This work presents two approaches to this: a novel, simple approach calculated directly in task space, and another approach using a kinematic model of the human based on the authors' previous work. We compare both approaches in an experimental setup with a robot manipulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation and comparison of approaches to formally verified trajectory planning in human-robot co-working. We find that the novel approach has advantages in terms of ease and speed of computation and tightness at short time horizons and is more intuitive to extend to the whole human body; the previous approach offers advantages at longer prediction horizons. We also perform conformance checking to show that both approaches do indeed account for all relevant movement.",

        "abstract": "Technologies in autonomous vehicles have seen dramatic advances in recent years; however, it still lacks of robust perception systems for car detection. With the recent development in deep learning research, in this paper, we propose a LIDAR and vision fusion system for car detection through the deep learning framework. It consists of three major parts. The first part generates seed proposals for potential car locations in the image by taking LIDAR point cloud into account. The second part refines the location of the proposal boxes by exploring multi-layer information in the proposal network and the last part carries out the final detection task through a detection network which shares part of the layers with the proposal network. The evaluation shows that the proposed framework is able to generate high quality proposal boxes more efficiently (77.6% average recall) and detect the car at the state of the art accuracy (89.4% average precision). With further optimization of the framework structure, it has great potentials to be implemented onto the autonomous vehicle.",

These kind of robots can be used for search and rescue applications when proper sensors are used and placed correctly. Finding an adequate position for placing sensors on legged robots with a segmented spine to maximize the information retrieval is not trivial. In this paper, we talk about equipping the salamanderlike robot Pleurobot with necessary sensors to understand its challenges. Our setup gathers visual and inertial information for 3D mapping and localization. To do so, we have come up with three different experimental terrains to analyze the sensing behavior. The results are examples to understanding the behavior of quadrupedal legged robots similar to Pleurobot in search and rescue scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The Freefall Camera (FFC) is a robot designed to film skydivers in free fall and is, to the author's knowledge, the first robot to control its position and terminal velocity relative to another falling object. The robot is equipped with a vision sensor to track objects of a chosen colour. The control surfaces for free fall motion are four vertical ailerons that control planar position and orientation and two retractable flaps that control terminal velocity. To develop a robust controller, equations of motion were created and validated experimentally for movement in the vertical and planar rotational directions. The static and dynamic response of the system were then tested in a vertical wind tunnel to validate the models and use them to design and tune a PID + Filter controller for the free fall flight of the robot. Planar rotation tests showed a decrease in steady state angular velocity and dynamic response gain compared to the model and a slight increase in dynamic response phase shift. This was attributed to the effect of the turbulent air near the shell of the robot. Vertical translation tests showed a decrease in maximum terminal velocity compared to the model, likely due to the effect of air viscosity at higher Reynolds numbers. The models were used to tune a PID + Filter controller to achieve stable target tracking in the rotational and vertical degrees of freedom using image based visual servoing. Controlled flight of the FFC was then tested in a vertical wind tunnel, where the robot was able to successfully track a coloured target within 15\u00b0 of the centre of the field of view.",

The algorithm is based on the idea of tracking circles with different radii in order to control the inter-vehicle phases with respect to a target circumference. We prove that the origin of the error dynamics of the inter-vehicle phases is exponentially stable. Furthermore, thanks to the stability properties of the guidance vector field that guides the vehicles, the algorithm can be extended to other closed trajectories. One of the main advantages of this approach is that the algorithm guarantees the confinement of the team in a specific area, even when communications or sensing among vehicles are lost. We show the effectiveness of the algorithm with an actual formation flight of three aircraft. The algorithm is ready to use for the general public in the open-source Paparazzi autopilot.",

        "abstract": "Classification techniques are useful for processing complex signals into labels with semantic value. For example, they can be used to interpret brain signals generated by humans corresponding to a finite set of commands for a physical device. The classifier, however, may interpret the signal as a command that is different from the intended one. This error in classification leads to poor performance in tasks where the class labels are used to learn some information or to control a physical device. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm to identify which class labels may be misclassified out of a sequence of class labels, when these labels are used in a given learning or control task. The algorithm is based on inference methods using Markov random fields. We apply the algorithm to goal-learning and tracking using brain-computer interfacing (BCI), in which signals from the brain are commonly processed using classification techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the time taken to identify the goal state in control experiments.",

Different kinds of gaits are designed and compared to reduce the vertical fluctuation of COM of the robot and run more smoothly. Advancing in aquatic environments relies on the paddles driven along with the rotating claws while steering is achieved with velocity differential between claws on both sides. Velocities of individual claws are computed and regulated based on gyration radius and angular velocity parameters obtained in experiments, in order to follow ideal trajectories.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A popular class of lidar-based grid mapping algorithms computes for each map cell the probability that it reflects an incident laser beam. These algorithms typically determine the map as the set of reflection probabilities that maximizes the likelihood of the underlying laser data and do not compute the full posterior distribution over all possible maps. Thereby, they discard crucial information about the confidence of the estimate. The approach presented in this paper preserves this information by determining the full map posterior. In general, this problem is hard because distributions over real-valued quantities can possess infinitely many dimensions. However, for two state-of-the-art beam-based lidar models, our approach yields closed-form map posteriors that possess only two parameters per cell. Even better, these posteriors come for free, in the sense that they use the same parameters as the traditional approaches, without the need for additional computations. An important use case for grid maps is robot localization, which we formulate as Bayesian filtering based on the closed-form map posterior rather than based on a single map. The resulting measurement likelihoods can also be expressed in closed form. In simulations and extensive real-world experiments, we show that leveraging the full map posterior improves the localization accuracy compared to approaches that use the most likely map.",

        "abstract": "Policy search methods and, more broadly, reinforcement learning can enable robots to learn highly complex and general skills that may allow them to function amid the complexity and diversity of the real world. However, training a policy that generalizes well across a wide range of real-world conditions requires far greater quantity and diversity of experience than is practical to collect with a single robot. Fortunately, it is possible for multiple robots to share their experience with one another, and thereby, learn a policy collectively. In this work, we explore distributed and asynchronous policy learning as a means to achieve generalization and improved training times on challenging, real-world manipulation tasks. We propose a distributed and asynchronous version of guided policy search and use it to demonstrate collective policy learning on a vision-based door opening task using four robots. We describe how both policy learning and data collection can be conducted in parallel across multiple robots, and present a detailed empirical evaluation of our system. Our results indicate that distributed learning significantly improves training time, and that parallelizing policy learning and data collection substantially improves utilization. We also demonstrate that we can achieve substantial generalization on a challenging real-world door opening task.",

        "abstract": "The developments of robotics inform research across a broad range of disciplines. In this paper, we will study and compare two collision selective neuron models via a vision-based autonomous micro robot. In the locusts' visual brain, two Lobula Giant Movement Detectors (LGMDs), i.e. LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified as looming sensitive neurons responding to rapidly expanding objects, yet with different collision selectivity. Both neurons have been modeled and successfully applied in robotic vision system for perceiving potential collisions in an efficient and reliable manner. In this research, we conduct binocular neuronal models, for the first time combining the functionalities of LGMD1 and LGMD2 neurons, in the visual modality of a ground mobile robot. The results of systematic on-line experiments demonstrated three contributions of this research: (1) The arena tests involving multiple robots verified the effectiveness and robustness of a reactive motion control strategy via integrating a bilateral pair of LGMD1 and LGMD2 models for collision detection in dynamic scenarios. (2) We pinpointed the different collision selectivity between LGMD1 and LGMD2 neuron models, which fulfill corresponding biological research. (3) The utilized micro robot may also benefit researches on other embedded vision systems as well as swarm robotics.",

The environment is represented by a set of key images, which are acquired during a prior mapping phase that defines the path to be followed during the navigation. The switching of key images is done exploiting the common line segments and feature points between the current acquired image and the nearby key images. Based on the key images and the current image, a control law is derived for computing the rotational velocity of a mobile robot during its visual navigation. Using our approach, real-time navigation has been performed in real indoor environment with a Pioneer 3-DX equipped with an on-board perspective camera and the humanoid robot Pepper without the need of accurate mapping and localization nor of 3D reconstruction. We also show that the combination of points and lines increases the number of features that helps in robust and successful navigation especially in those regions where few points or lines can be detected and tracked/matched.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a unified model for camera pose estimation and a novel strategy for pose optimization by combining points and lines in monocular visual odometry. Our proposed unified model treats point and line features equivalently, which is applicable for all the minimal cases requiring the minimum number 3 of point or/and line features and can be easily extended for various circumstances with more additional observations. The core idea is to directly retrieve all stationary points of a cost function which is minimized by the first-order optimality condition without initialization or iteration. The estimated pose is reliable due to robust geometric constraints and the reliable algebraic solver. To refine the camera pose, we propose a novel optimization strategy to minimize the unconstrained Sampson error by taking specific uncertainty for each feature into account to penalize noise more reasonably. Moreover, it is simpler than the conventional bundle adjustment by avoiding the high-dimensional parameter searching. Experimental results on simulated data and real images have sufficiently demonstrated the superiority of our proposed camera pose estimation and optimization method by comparing with state-of-the-art monocular algorithms.",

An initial estimation of the trajectory is designed for each link using SPHS. Afterwards, the initial trajectory enable to find the initial parameters of the FS which are fed to an optimization process that finds the optimal parameters of the FS used for identification purpose. Like this, we can take the advantages of both FS and SPHS and eliminate the disadvantages of each of them. Moreover, a comparison of results between; the proposed method, original FS, and SPHS is taking place to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach. In this vein, a one-way analysis of variance is conducted to compare whether there are significant improvement or not. An PA10 7DoF arm robot serves as test bed for conducting experiments. Findings shows that the optimal trajectory found through the proposed approach requires less computation time compared to original FS which can be an advantage for fast and robust identification.",

        "abstract": "Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) has become a popular approach to performing trajectory optimization for complex, underactuated robots. However, DDP presents two practical challenges. First, the evaluation of dynamics derivatives during optimization creates a computational bottleneck, particularly in implementations that capture second-order dynamic effects. Second, constraints on the states (e.g., boundary conditions, collision constraints, etc.) require additional care since the state trajectory is implicitly defined from the inputs and dynamics. This paper addresses both of these problems by building on recent work on Unscented Dynamic Programming (UDP) - which eliminates dynamics derivative computations in DDP-to support general nonlinear state and input constraints using an augmented Lagrangian. The resulting algorithm has the same computational cost as first-order penalty-based DDP variants, but can achieve constraint satisfaction to high precision without the numerical ill-conditioning associated with penalty methods. We present results demonstrating its favorable performance on several simulated robot systems including a quadrotor and 7-DoF robot arm.",

Whereas feature based scene recognition and pose estimation methods are well established as effective means for estimating motion and recognizing locations, feature-based methods depend critically on the detection of common local features from one view of a scene to another. We focus on place recognition and pose change estimation in the context of large changes in viewing position, even to the extent that no common surfaces are seen between the two views. Our approach is based on using object identities and their inter-relationship to compute pose change. An important secondary outcome of our method is that it simultaneously infers the 3D poses of objects in the scene that are used as features. Such an object-based approach is inspired by a vast literature on human perception and has the potential for great robustness, albeit at the expense of accuracy. We propose a formulation of the problem using pairwise contextual constraints and develop an efficient algorithmic solution. We validate the approach and quantify its performance using the publicly available TUM SLAM dataset [1].",

        "abstract": "Existing robots for multi-scale motion (MSM) are unsuitable for micro-surgery in deep surgical sites where miniaturization and traversal of often tortuous anatomical passageways is required. Also, new emerging surgical paradigms for natural orifice surgery and image-based diagnosis and guidance at the micro-scale level promise to provide accurate verification of tumor resection margins. To overcome the limitations of current robot architectures, and to enable image-based biopsy and micro-surgery in confined spaces, we present a new concept of continuum robots with equilibrium modulation (CREM). CREM robots are a modification of multi-backbone continuum robots that achieve micro-motion by using indirect actuation through modulation of their static equilibrium by change of the distribution of their cross-sectional flexural rigidity. As a first step towards modeling the micro-scale kinematics of these robots, solutions for micro-motion tracking are presented and verified to achieve tracking accuracies of better than 2\u03bcm. Preliminary evaluation of the micro-motion capabilities of a first prototype demonstrates motion resolutions at 1\u03bcm level and hysteresis of less than 10\u03bcm - despite the use of inexpensive actuators with significant backlash. Finally, a demonstration of a first effort at integrating such a robot with a custom-made optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe is presented.",

Traditionally, the linear approximation and circular approximation are widely used to determine the contouring error and cross-coupled gains. However, for linear approximation and circular approximation, the contouring error and cross-coupled gains are calculated sophisticatedly, especially in three-dimensional applications. In this paper, a contouring error vector is established under task coordinate frame, then the contouring error and cross-coupled gains can be easily obtained based on the magnitude and orientation of the contouring error vector. The experimental results on a three-axis CNC machine indicate the proposed approach simplifies the calculation of contouring error and cross-coupled gains.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a control strategy for a power-assisted cart based on its motion state. The power-assisted cart we developed has one motor, a differential gear, and brakes. This cart uses the motor and the differential gear for moving forward, and applying brakes to either wheel allows the cart to turn both left and right. Therefore, the power-assisted cart can support the user when going straight and turning despite having only one motor. In the past we developed a control method that allows to control the cart's speed around the operation point in order to keep its magnitude constant when the cart starts turning. This was necessary, as the differential gear causes a speed change during turning, because of its characteristics. However, the desired behavior when transitioning from straight motion to turning motion is different to the desired behavior when going from turning motion to straight motion. Therefore, in this paper we propose a control method to adjust the speed in the direction of motion based on the state of the cart. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments and discussed the results.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, hydrofoils have become ubiquitous and critical components of high-performance surface vehicles. Twenty-meter-long hydrofoil sailing craft are capable of reaching speeds in excess of 45 knots. Hydrofoil dinghies routinely travel faster than the wind and reach speeds up to 30 knots. Besides, in the quest for super-maneuverability, actuated hydrofoils could enable the efficient generation of large forces on demand. However, the control of hydrofoil systems remains challenging, especially in rough seas. With the intent to ultimately enable the design of versatile, small-scale, high-speed, and super-maneuverable surface vehicles, we investigate the problem of controlling the lift force generated by a flexible, surface-piercing hydrofoil traveling at high speed through a random wave field. We present a test platform composed of a rudder-like vertical hydrofoil actuated in pitch. The system is instrumented with velocity, force, and immersion depth sensors. We carry out high-speed field experiments in the presence of naturally occurring waves. The 2 cm chord hydrofoil is successfully controlled with a LTV/feedback linearization controller at speeds ranging from 4 to 10+ m/s.",

The controller is designed such that the variable stiffness joint acts as a virtual damper that absorbs the kinetic energy of the moving object.

To obtain a critically damped system, the damping coefficient is scheduled on both the output stiffness and the inertia of the system.

First, we introduce a model of a six-legged rimless wheel with a reaction wheel, and develop two controllers for the single-limb and double-limb support phases. For easily achieving precise control of the state variables, we apply a discrete-time output deadbeat control for each phase. We numerically analyze the fundamental properties of the generated gait, and show that the target period of the double-limb support phase must be chosen as a significantly long so that the rear and fore feet are grounded during control of the reaction wheel. The gait efficiency is also analyzed in terms of the walking speed and specific resistance through numerical simulations.",

Every aspect of the controller design is covered, from the formulation and validation of the dynamic model, to the implementation and validation on an actual humanoid robot.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we apply lossless and successive convexification techniques and employ real-time on-board convex optimization to perform constrained motion planning for quadrotors. In general, this problem is challenging for real-time on-board applications due to its non-convex nature. The ability to generate feasible trajectories quickly and reliably is central to operating high-performance aerial robots in populated spaces. Motivated by our earlier research on convexification of non-convex optimal control problems, we use these convexification techniques to cast the problems into one (or a sequence of) Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem(s). In doing so, we are able to attain our solutions by leveraging modern advances in Interior Point Method (IPM) algorithms. Here, we focus on 3-degree-of-freedom trajectory generation, whereby closed-loop control is used to track a translational trajectory computed on-board at the onset of the maneuver. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of convexification techniques used in real-time on-board trajectory generation for high-performance quad-rotor flight. We present two example scenarios: (1) a case where lossless convexification is used to increase the available control envelope, thus enabling an agile flip maneuver, and (2) a case where both convexification techniques are used to compute a path through a flight space containing ellipsoidal keep-out zones. We present flight demonstration results obtained using the Autonomous Control Laboratory's (ACL's) custom quad-rotor platforms and SOCP optimization software. Additionally, computation timing statistics for the example scenarios obtained using a series of mobile ARM and Intel processors show a minimum mean computation time of 36.5 and 122.2 milliseconds, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The expanding 3C (Computer, Communication, and Consumer electronics) manufacturing industry leads to a high demand on the soldering of flexible PCBs. Current manual soldering has the disadvantages of low output, low speed, and low efficiency, and upgrading soldering operations with robotic technologies is mainly limited by the property of deformation of flexible PCBs. In this paper, a novel robotic manipulation system is developed for automatic soldering of flexible PCBs, consisting of the hardware of a dual-arm configuration and the software of a cooperative control scheme. The proposed system works in a sequential manner, in the sense that a Cartesian-space region reaching controller drives an assistive arm to actively contact the PCB first, and a vision-based tracking controller activates a soldering arm after the deformation is stabilized. The proposed formulation eliminates uncertain deformation of flexible PCBs and thus guarantees the feasibility of robotic soldering.",

We are interested in cooperative transport of large objects by teams of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) operating in marine and littoral environments. We consider the cooperative towing problem where individual ASVs connected to a load via cables must coordinate to transport the load along a desired trajectory. We present a differential geometric approach towards the synthesis of open and closed loop strategies for the team. The main advantage of the proposed strategy is the ability to synthesize agent-level controllers that can simultaneously satisfy all the holonomic and non-holonomic constraints within the system.

Since it is infeasible to precompute an optimized schedule due to a limited time horizon, an energy-aware planner is used for adaptively deciding when and where to recharge. The coordination between robots is based on market economy giving them the flexibility to incorporate multiple objectives into a single cost function. The presented policies are evaluated through simulations with different robot team sizes on different maps. We measure the exploration gain in explored area and the exploration cost in traveled distance over time. We compare the market-based approach to a simple first-come, first-served approach.

The novelty of our system is that it leverages multi-modal information in a cross-modal manner: instead of simply fusing information from different modalities, sensor streams are interpreted by leveraging information from another modality. We realize each cross-modal information extraction process using recursive estimation, with each process addressing a perceptual subproblem. Several estimators are then coupled in a cross-modal network, leading to efficient and robust online perception. We demonstrate experimentally that our cross-modal system improves over its uni-modal counterparts, increasing the variability of environments and task conditions in which the robot can robustly perceive the articulated objects. We further demonstrate that these perceptual abilities are sufficiently fast to provide feedback during manipulation actions and sufficiently comprehensive to allow the generation of new manipulation actions.",

The minerals and marine sediments trapped in this mud are also potentially valuable resources. However, seabed exploration has been limited by the complexity and cost of the traditional equipment used. Wide area exploration can be made possible by deploying multiple robots to autonomously search beneath the ocean floor. In this study, we prototyped a sub-seafloor excavation robot for use in seabed exploration. The key system comprised a propulsion unit and an excavation unit that allow the robot to move freely within the seabed. We experimentally demonstrated the ability of the excavation robot to produce curved boreholes with a diameter of 160 mm, a turning radius of 1.67 m, and a depth of 613 mm. Our experimental results confirm that nonlinear excavation is possible using the excavation robot developed.",

        "abstract": "Robots are becoming increasingly prevalent in our society in forms where they are assisting or interacting with humans in a variety of environments, and thus they must have the ability to sense and detect objects by touch. An ongoing challenge for soft robots has been incorporating flexible sensors that can recognize complex motions and close the loop for tactile sensing. We present sensor skins that enable haptic object visualization when integrated on a soft robotic gripper that can twist an object. First, we investigate how the design of the actuator modules impact bend angle and motion. Each soft finger is molded using a silicone elastomer, and consists of three pneumatic chambers which can be inflated independently to achieve a range of complex motions. Three fingers are combined to form a soft robotic gripper. Then, we manufacture and attach modular, flexible sensory skins on each finger to measure deformation and contact. These sensor measurements are used in conjunction with an analytical model to construct 2D and 3D tactile object models. Our results are a step towards soft robot grippers capable of a complex range of motions and proprioception, which will help future robots better understand the environments with which they interact, and has the potential to increase physical safety in human-robot interaction.

Given the payload constraints and long range sensing requirements, cameras are the preferred sensing modality for MAVs. The computation burden of using cameras for obstacle sensing has forced the state of the art methods to construct world representations on a per frame basis, leading to myopic decision making. In this paper we propose a long range perception and planning approach using cameras. By utilizing FPGA hardware for disparity calculation and image space to represent obstacles, our approach and system design allows for construction of long term world representation whilst accounting for highly non-linear noise models in real time. We demonstrate these obstacle avoidance capabilities on a quadrotor flying through dense foliage at speeds of up to 4 m/s for a total of 1.6 hours of autonomous flights. The presented approach enables high speed navigation at low altitudes for MAVs for terrestrial scouting.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses adaptive coverage of a spatial field without prior knowledge. Our application in this paper is to cover a region of the sea surface using a robotic boat, although the algorithmic approach has wider applicability. We propose an anytime planning technique for efficient data gathering using point-sampling based on non-uniform data-driven coverage. Our goal is to sense a particular region of interest in the environment and be able to reconstruct the measured spatial field. Since there are autonomous agents involved, there is a need to consider the costs involved in terms of energy consumed and time required to finish the task. An ideal map of the scalar field requires complete coverage of the region, but can be approximated by a good sparse coverage strategy along with an efficient interpolation technique. We propose to optimize the trade off between the environmental field mapping and the costs (energy consumed, time spent, and distance traveled) associated with sensing. We present an anytime algorithm for sampling the environment adaptively by following a multi-scale path to produce a variable resolution map of the spatial field. We compare our approach to a traditional exhaustive survey approach and show that we are able to effectively represent a spatial field spending minimum energy. We present results that indicate our sampling technique gathering most informative samples with least travel. We validate our approach through simulations and test the system on real robots in the open ocean.",

The main idea of our algorithm is to combine simulated and real rollouts to efficiently find an optimal control policy. While performing rollouts on the robot, we exploit sensory data to learn a probabilistic model of the residual difference between the measured state and the state predicted by a simplified model. The simplified model can be any dynamical system, from a very accurate system to a simple, linear one. The residual difference is learned with Gaussian processes. Hence, we assume that the difference between real and simplified model is Gaussian distributed, which is less strict than assuming that the real system is Gaussian distributed. The combination of the partial model and the learned residuals is exploited to predict the real system behavior and to search for an optimal policy. Simulations and experiments show that our approach significantly reduces the number of rollouts needed to find an optimal control policy for the real system.",

This strategy combines the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Concretely, each agent applies the decentralized ORCA algorithm to compute the collision-avoiding velocities with respect to its neighbors. The derived velocities serve as constraints of a MPC problem whose solution provides the optimal control input that can ensure optimal motion of the agent. The states predicted from the agents' dynamic models are used in the ORCA algorithm to compute the ORCA velocity regions in future steps. This ORCA-MPC combined approach doesn't need a priori the preferred velocity of each agent in comparison to the traditional ORCA algorithm and its existing variants. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that this new algorithm can reduce velocity vibrations in the traditional ORCA algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores a stochastic approach for controlling swarms of independent robots toward a target distribution in a bounded domain. The robot swarm has no central controller, and individual robots lack both communication and localization capabilities. Robots can only measure a scalar field (e.g. concentration of a chemical) from the environment and from this deduce the desired local swarm density. Based on this value, each robot follows a simple control law that causes the swarm as a whole to diffuse toward the target distribution. Using a new holonomic drive robot, we present the first confirmation of this control law with physical experiment. Despite deviations from assumptions underpinning the theory, the swarm achieves the theorized convergence to the target distribution in both simulation and experiment. In fact, simulated and experimental performance agree with one another and with our hypothesis that the error from the target distribution is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of robots. This is evidence that the algorithm is both practical and easily scalable to large swarms.",

On the other hand, its dependency upon the availability of a significant quantity of training samples and its fragility in learning makes it difficult to apply for real world robot tasks. To alleviate these issues we propose Deep Dynamic Policy Programming (DDPP), which combines the sample efficiency and smooth policy updates of dynamic policy programming with the contemporary deep reinforcement learning framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first demonstrated in a simulation of the robot arm control problem, with comparison to Deep Q-Networks. As validation on a real robot system, DDPP also successfully learned the flipping of a handkerchief with a NEXTAGE humanoid robot using a reduced number of learning samples, whereas Deep Q-Networks failed to learn the task.",

Existing research can be roughly divided into correlation based approaches e.g. scan-to-submap matching and feature based methods e.g. bag-of-words (BoW). In this paper, we solve loop closure detection and relative pose transformation using 2D LiDAR within an end-to-end Deep Learning framework. The algorithm is verified with simulation data and on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flying in indoor environment. The loop detection ConvNet alone achieves an accuracy of 98.2% in loop closure detection. With a verification step using the scan matching ConvNet, the false positive rate drops to around 0.001%. The proposed approach processes 6000 pairs of raw LiDAR scans per second on a Nvidia GTX1080 GPU.",

Based on other detection and classification tasks, deep learning based methods are likely to yield the most accurate outputs for detecting lane markers, but require vast amounts of labeled data. We propose to train a deep neural network for detecting lane markers in camera images without manually labeling any images. To achieve this, we project high definition maps for automated driving into our image and correct for misalignments due to inaccuracies in localization and coordinate frame transformations. The corrections are performed by calculating the offset between features within our map and detected ones in the images. By using detections in the actual image for refining the projections, our labels become close to pixel perfect. After a fast, visual quality check, our projected lane markers can be used for training a fully convolutional network to segment lane markers in images. A single worker can easily generate 20,000 of those labels within a single day. Our fully convolutional network is trained only on automatically generated labels. All of our detections are based solely on gray-scale mono camera inputs without any additional information. The resulting network regularly detects clean lane markers at distances of around 150 meters on a 1 Megapixel camera.",

We focus on analyzing the advantages of the 3D point cloud relative to the RGB-D image and try to eliminate the unpredictability of output values that inevitably occurs in regression tasks. To achieve this, we first adopt the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) to encode the point cloud and extract low compact discriminative feature via unsupervised deep learning network. This approach can not only eliminate the dense scale sampling for offline model training but also reduce the distortion by mapping the 3D shape to the 2D plane and overcome the dependence on color cues. Then, we train a Hough forests to achieve multi-object detection and 6-DoF pose estimation simultaneously. In addition, we propose a robust multilevel verification strategy that effectively reduces the unpredictability of output values which occurs in the hough regression module. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach provides effective results comparable to the state-of-the-arts.",

        "abstract": "Skilled robot task learning is best implemented by predictive action policies due to the inherent latency of sensorimotor processes. However, training such predictive policies is challenging as it involves finding a trajectory of motor activations for the full duration of the action. We propose a data-efficient deep predictive policy training (DPPT) framework with a deep neural network policy architecture which maps an image observation to a sequence of motor activations. The architecture consists of three sub-networks referred to as the perception, policy and behavior super-layers. The perception and behavior super-layers force an abstraction of visual and motor data trained with synthetic and simulated training samples, respectively. The policy super-layer is a small subnetwork with fewer parameters that maps data in-between the abstracted manifolds. It is trained for each task using methods for policy search reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the suitability of the proposed architecture and learning framework by training predictive policies for skilled object grasping and ball throwing on a PR2 robot. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by the fact that these tasks are trained using only about 180 real robot attempts with qualitative terminal rewards.",

        "abstract": "Precise localization of robots is imperative for their safe and autonomous navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments. In outdoor scenarios, the environment typically undergoes significant perceptual changes and requires robust methods for accurate localization. Monocular camera-based approaches provide an inexpensive solution to such challenging problems compared to 3D LiDAR-based methods. Recently, approaches have leveraged deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform place recognition and they turn out to outperform traditional handcrafted features under challenging perceptual conditions. In this paper, we propose an approach for directly regressing a 6-DoF camera pose using CNNs and a single monocular RGB image. We leverage the idea of transfer learning for training our network as this technique has shown to perform better when the number of training samples are not very high. Furthermore, we propose novel data augmentation in 3D space for additional pose coverage which leads to more accurate localization. In contrast to the traditional visual metric localization approaches, our resulting map size is constant with respect to the database. During localization, our approach has a constant time complexity of O(1) and is independent of the database size and runs in real-time at ~80 Hz using a single GPU. We show the localization accuracy of our approach on publicly available datasets and that it outperforms CNN-based state-of-the-art methods.",

In particular, we are interested in solutions to this problem that do not require localization, mapping or planning. Additionally, we require that our solution can quickly adapt to new situations (e.g., changing navigation goals and environments). To meet these criteria we frame this problem as a sequence of related reinforcement learning tasks. We propose a successor-feature-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn to transfer knowledge from previously mastered navigation tasks to new problem instances. Our algorithm substantially decreases the required learning time after the first task instance has been solved, which makes it easily adaptable to changing environments. We validate our method in both simulated and real robot experiments with a Robotino and compare it to a set of baseline methods including classical planning-based navigation.",

In this paper, we propose a method for pointwise semantic classification of 3D LiDAR data into three classes: non-movable, movable and dynamic. We concentrate on understanding these specific semantics because they characterize important information required for an autonomous system. To learn the distinction between movable and non-movable points in the environment, we introduce an approach based on deep neural network and for detecting the dynamic points, we estimate pointwise motion. We propose a Bayes filter framework for combining the learned semantic cues with the motion cues to infer the required semantic classification. In extensive experiments, we compare our approach with other methods on a standard benchmark dataset and report competitive results in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show an improvement in the classification of points by combining the semantic cues retrieved from the neural network with the motion cues.",

A dataset of still images and associated gravity vectors was collected and used to perform supervised learning. The network builds on a previously trained network and was trained to be able to approximate the attitude of the camera with an average error of about 8 degrees. Flight test video was recorded and processed with a relatively simple visual odometry method. The aircraft attitude is then estimated with the visual odometry as the state propagation and network providing the attitude measurement in an extended Kalman filter. Results show that the proposed method of having the neural network provide a gravity vector attitude measurement from the flight imagery reduces the standard deviation of the attitude error by approximately 12 times compared to a baseline approach.",

        "abstract": "Search-based planning that uses a state lattice has been successfully applied in many applications but its utility is limited when confronted with complex problems represented by a lattice with many nodes and edges with high branching factor. However, in many seemingly complex problems, proper \u201cform-fitting\u201d can reduce the number of nodes and edges needed to represent the problems, provides a concise state lattice and therefore simplifies the computation. This paper proposes a planning framework which strikes to identify concise representations of problems, creates such \u201cform-fitting\u201d state lattice on which a more concise search can take place. In a sense, we take a conventional state lattice and map it onto a deformed space, and then the motion primitives and heuristics follow. Since the contribution of the paper is not the search approach but rather the means by which the lattice is deformed, any search-based planner can then be easily changed to a corresponding deformed version with no increase in time complexity. This paper demonstrate the benifits of the approach which includes 1) planned path can be followed with few changes in motion primitives and thus can provide global smoothness of planned path; 2) fewer states are expanded and thus shorter time to search solution in state space is required, and 3) fewer states are expanded and thus less memory is required to save the state lattice. We demonstrate the benefit of the proposed approach in illustrative toy examples, as well as robot experiments.",

        "abstract": "In autonomous Mobility on Demand (MOD) systems, customers request rides from a fleet of shared vehicles that can be automatically positioned in response to customer demand. Recent approaches to MOD systems have focused on environments where customers can only request rides through an app or by waiting at a station. This paper develops MOD fleet management approaches for ride hailing, where customers may instead request rides simply by hailing a passing vehicle, an approach of particular importance for campus MOD systems. The challenge for ride hailing is that customer demand is not explicitly provided as it would be with an app, but rather customers are only served if a vehicle happens to be located at the arrival location. This work focuses on maximizing the number of served hailing customers in an MOD system by learning and utilizing customer demand. A Bayesian framework is used to define a novel customer demand model which incorporates observed pedestrian traffic to estimate customer arrival locations with a quantification of uncertainty. An exploration planner is proposed which routes MOD vehicles in order to reduce arrival rate uncertainty. A robust ride hailing fleet management planner is proposed which routes vehicles under the presence of uncertainty using a chance-constrained formulation. Simulation of a real-world MOD system on MIT's campus demonstrates the effectiveness of the planners. The customer demand model and exploration planner are demonstrated to reduce estimation error over time and the ride hailing planner is shown to improve the fraction of served customers in the system by 73% over a baseline exploration approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Movement Primitives (MPs) have been widely used over the last years for learning robot motion tasks with direct Policy Search (PS) reinforcement learning. Among them, Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs) are a kind of MP based on a stochastic representation over sets of trajectories, which benefits from the properties of probability operations. However, the generation of such ProMPs requires a set of demonstrations to capture motion variability. Additionally, using context variables to modify trajectories coded as MPs is a popular approach nowadays in order to adapt motion to environmental variables. This paper proposes a contextual representation of ProMPs that allows for an easy adaptation to changing situations through context variables, by reparametrizing motion with them. Moreover, we propose a way of initializing contextual trajectories without the need of real robot demonstrations, by setting an initial position, a final position, and a number of trajectory interest points, where the contextual variables are evaluated. The parametrizations obtained show to be accurate while relieving the user from the need of performing costly computations such as conditioning. Additionally, using this contextual representation, we propose a simple yet effective quadratic optimization-based obstacle avoidance method for ProMPs. Experiments in simulation and on a real robot show the promise of the approach.",

        "abstract": "While dense visual SLAM methods are capable of estimating dense reconstructions of the environment, they suffer from a lack of robustness in their tracking step, especially when the optimisation is poorly initialised. Sparse visual SLAM systems have attained high levels of accuracy and robustness through the inclusion of inertial measurements in a tightly-coupled fusion. Inspired by this performance, we propose the first tightly-coupled dense RGB-D-inertial SLAM system. Our system has real-time capability while running on a GPU. It jointly optimises for the camera pose, velocity, IMU biases and gravity direction while building up a globally consistent, fully dense surfel-based 3D reconstruction of the environment. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that our dense visual-inertial SLAM system is more robust to fast motions and periods of low texture and low geometric variation than a related RGB-D-only SLAM system.",

        "abstract": "The paper exploits weak Manhattan constraints to parse the structure of indoor environments from RGB-D video sequences in an online setting. We extend the previous approach for single view parsing of indoor scenes to video sequences and formulate the problem of recovering the floor plan of the environment as an optimal labeling problem solved using dynamic programming. The temporal continuity is enforced in a recursive setting, where labeling from previous frames is used as a prior term in the objective function. In addition to recovery of piecewise planar weak Manhattan structure of the extended environment, the orthogonality constraints are also exploited by visual odometry and pose graph optimization. This yields reliable estimates in the presence of large motions and absence of distinctive features to track. We evaluate our method on several challenging indoors sequences demonstrating accurate SLAM and dense mapping of low texture environments. On existing TUM benchmark [19] we achieve competitive results with the alternative approaches which fail in our environments.",

        "abstract": "There have been increasing demands for developing robotic system combining camera and inertial measurement unit in navigation task, due to their low-cost, lightweight and complementary properties. In this paper, we present a Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) system which can utilize sparse depth to estimate 6D pose in GPS-denied and unstructured environments. The system is based on Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF), which benefits from low computation load when compared to optimization-based method, especially on resource-constrained platform. Features are enhanced with depth information forming 3D landmark position measurements in space, which reduces uncertainty of position estimate. And we derivate measurement model to access compatibility with both 2D and 3D measurements. In experiments, we evaluate the performance of the system in different in-flight scenarios, both cluttered room and industry environment. The results suggest that the estimator is consistent, substantially improves the accuracy compared with original monocular-based MSKCF and achieves competitive accuracy with other research.",

        "abstract": "Most recent approaches to 3D pose estimation from RGB-D images address the problem in a two-stage pipeline. First, they learn a classifier-typically a random forest-to predict the position of each input pixel on the object surface. These estimates are then used to define an energy function that is minimized w.r.t. the object pose. In this paper, we focus on the first stage of the problem and propose a novel classifier based on a depth-aware Convolutional Neural Network. This classifier is able to learn a scale-adaptive regression model that yields very accurate pixel-level predictions, allowing to finally estimate the pose using a simple RANSAC-based scheme, with no need to optimize complex ad hoc energy functions. Our experiments on publicly available datasets show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Adaptive robot hands have changed the way we approach and think of robot grasping and manipulation. Traditionally, pinch, fingertip grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks were executed with fully actuated, rigid robot hands and relied on analytic methods, computation of the hand object Jacobians and extensive numerical simulations for deriving optimal and minimal effort grasps. However, even insignificant uncertainties in the modeling space could render the extraction of candidate grasps or manipulation paths infeasible. Adaptive hands use underactuated mechanisms and structural compliance, facilitating by design the successful extraction of stable grasps and the robust execution of manipulation tasks, even under significant object pose or other environmental uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the automated extraction of dexterous, in-hand manipulation strategies / primitives for adaptive hands. To do so, we use a constrained optimization scheme that describes the kinematics of adaptive hands during the grasping and manipulation processes, an automated experimental setup for data collection, a clustering technique that groups together similar manipulation strategies, and a dimensionality reduction technique that projects the robot kinematics to lower dimensional manifolds. In these manifolds, control is simplified and hand operation becomes more intuitive. In this work, we also assess the effect of the extracted manipulation primitives on the object pose perturbations. The efficiency of the proposed methods is experimentally verified for various adaptive robot hands. The extracted primitives can simplify the operation and control of the open-source robot hand designs of the Yale Open Hand project in dexterous manipulation tasks.",

For design analysis and optimization of the Tusk, a simplified model of universal stair climbing was applied. To accommodate stairs without risers and with nose, the assistive track mechanism was applied. To climb the stair regardless of its dimension, length-adjustable mechanism was added. The results indicated the robot with these mechanisms successfully overcame each challenge. The performance was better than most conventional stair-climbing robots in terms of the range of compatible stairs. We expect these new approaches to expand the range of indoor robot operation with minimal cost.",

The proposed mechanism is intended towards simplifying the mechanical and control complexity identified with the robotic legs implemented on quadrupedal platforms capable of dynamic locomotion. First, a survey of high-speed and reduced DOF legged robotic systems is presented to elucidate the design challenges and determine system requirements. Drawing from these requirements, a novel design of a six-bar leg mechanism with a single DOF is proposed. The novelty of the mechanism lies in its ability to trace a path that accommodates the execution of trot-gait by the quadrupedal platform realized by integrating the proposed leg. The kinematics of the mechanism is formulated and a multi-body model is used to perform a series of case studies on the sensitivity of the foot trajectory to the leg's dimensional parameters. Preliminary work on optimization of the foot trajectory is then performed. This research will ultimately assist the future design of quadrupedal robots to test the ability of spatial robotic tails in stabilizing and maneuvering the platform.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive neurosurgical robotic procedure performed under real-time MRI can be achieved with a robot that is head-mounted and fits in a standard MRI bore. The design of a remotely-actuated cable-driven robotic system is presented in this work. A head mounted insertion module has been developed to advance the robot module towards the target brain tumor. The robot module is formed by snapping together a reusable part that leads to the remotely-placed actuators and a disposable part which includes the previously developed spring-based MINIR-II robot. Gear transmission mechanism was implemented in the robot module to transmit the force from the actuators to the end effectors of the robot. The robot module and the insertion module are lightweight and compact with a total weight of 250 g and a total height of 222 mm. This allows the entire setup to be placed vertically on a patient's head in a closed MRI bore. The compact design of the robot module has been achieved, significantly due to the innovative modifications made to the structure of standard spur gears and smart routing of the cables around the gears. The completely MRI-compatible Bowden cable module has been implemented to allow transmission of significant force of around 10 N required for the actuation of the robot. A static friction model has been used to estimate the friction coefficient for the Bowden cable module as a preliminary step towards the complete modeling of the entire robotic system. The relationships between the input displacement and force of the cable at the actuator end and those at the middle and end robot segments were determined through experiments and discussed. A functional robotic system has been presented with the robot being inserted into the phantom tissue and only the end segment actuated back and forth.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an origami-inspired cable-driven continuum manipulator module that offers low-cost, low-volume deployment, light weight, and inherently safe human interaction and collaboration. Each module has a mass of around 110 g and integrates the actuation, sensing, and control sub-systems necessary for operation. The origami structure has 7.311 Nm/rad (0.128 Nm/degree) torsional stiffness while being capable of bending in two directions and changing arclength down to a fully collapsed state. A maximum contraction of 35 mm and bending angle of 35.5 degrees were achieved with 45 mm arc length. The module is capable of passively supporting a 1-kg mass at its tip, or 4 additional serially connected modules, bending approximately 6 degrees in the worst case. We also show that we can actively compensate for external moments by pre-compressing or pre-bending the module. We utilize an inverse kinematic control scheme and use it for both open and closed loop control following a circular trajectory. Our results indicate that the module motion follows the desired trajectory with an RMS error of 0.681 mm in the horizontal (x-y) plane and 0.373 mm in the z-axis with closed-loop control. We also assembled two origami modules in series and drove them independently, demonstrating the proof-of-concept of a modular origami continuum manipulator.",

This paper introduces a new type of high reduction bearingless gearbox which is based on a gearbox with double-row planetary pinion, and can achieve high reduction ratios in a single composite stage. We discuss the practical issues which limit the applicability of the existing double row gearbox, and motivate our innovations. Several advantages of the bearingless gearbox over current approaches in terms of robustness, possible load distribution, manufacturability, and assembly are described. In the concept, all gear components float unconstrained, which is achieved by introducing an additional kinematic constraint that allows planets to be the same, in which case the planet carrier can be substituted with a secondary sun gear. The resulting planetary gearbox can be readily integrated into compact robotic joints. Its few lightweight components can be manufactured with high accuracy with standard machining techniques.",

        "abstract": "Targeting of small lesions with high precision is essential in an early phase of breast cancer for diagnosis and accurate follow up, and subsequently determines prognosis. Current techniques to diagnose breast cancer are suboptimal, and there is a need for a small, MRI-compatible robotic system able to target lesions with high precision and direct feedback of MRI. Therefore, the design and working mechanism of the new Stormram 4, an MRI-compatible needle manipulator with four degrees of freedom, will be presented to take biopsies of small lesions in the MRI scanner. Its dimensions (excluding racks and needle) are 72\u00d751\u00d740 mm, and the system is driven by two linear and two curved pneumatic stepper motors. The T-26 linear motor measures 26\u00d721\u00d716 mm, has a nominal step size of 0.25 mm and the measured maximum force is 63N at 0.65 MPa. The workspace has a total volume of 2.2 L. Accuracy measurements have shown that the mean positioning error is 0.7 mm, with a reproducibility of 0.1 mm. Velocity measurements with 5 m long tubes show a maximum stepping frequency of 8 Hz (maximum force) to 30 Hz (unloaded). These results show that the robot might be able to target lesions with sub-millimeter accuracy within reasonable time for the MRI-guided breast biopsy procedure.",

The magnetic array and the wheel assembly were designed based on the magnetic simulation results. Maintaining the adequate adhesion force as well as the friction force of the wheels were considered in designing the wheels. The crawling robot is equipped with a steering system based on Ackermann steering method hence the steering angles are controlled by an algorithm and actuated using servo motors. The driving system of the robot is equipped with four geared stepper motors and they are controlled separately by the algorithm according to the inputs of the controller. The control architecture and the components used for the robot control system are explained. The operator can remotely control the robot and inspect the hull surface via the camera feed available in the HMI (Human Machine Interface) of the robot. The prototype of the crawling robot was tested in a similar environment and the test results are included in the paper.",

        "abstract": "Soft robots, primarily made out of intrinsically soft materials, have flourished greatly in the past decade due to their advantages such as flexibility and adaptability over rigid-bodied robots. A rich repertoire of soft robots designed from intuitive or biomimetic approaches have been developed to provide new solutions for robots. However, these design approaches are limited by the designers' experience and inspiration, and a systematic design methodology for soft robots is still missing. We tackle this issue by mathematically recasting the design problem under the framework of topology optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, in this paper, we develop a pneumatically actuated soft gripper consisting of three fingers, each finger is able to undergo a free travel bending and deliver a grasping force. Hence, each gripper finger is designed as a continuum compliant mechanism to achieve its maximal bending deformation. The proposed soft gripper with complex shape is directly fabricated through 3D printing technology. Experimental results show that the deflected soft finger is able to achieve a 41\u00b0 free travel bending and generate 0.68N blocked force upon 0.11MPa actuation pressure. This work represents an important step towards the goal of designing soft robots automatically.",

        "abstract": "Observations of fumaroles are important in forecasting volcanic eruptions. However, such observations are dangerous for humans because of volcanic gases and high-temperature steam that surround fumaroles. In previous study, a teleoperated mobile robot was developed to realize remote observations. However, it was observed that typical mobile robots were unable to reach fumaroles on a steep cliff. Therefore, extant research focused on the development of tethered small mobile robots to tackle thsese types of challenging cliffs to observe fumaroles. This study proposes a design of a tethered mobile robot to traverse a steep slope based on the analysis of slip and turnover. A few indoor experimental studies and field experiment were performed to verify the proposed design.",

We proposed a nonlinear optimization process that integrates (a) the control design to obtain the optimal ground reaction force, and (b) the mechanical design to narrow down the choices of motor/gearbox pair. Based on this method, actuators were designed and assembled into a leg prototype with two actuated degrees of freedom. Experiments demonstrated that the leg could achieve a maximum vertical jumping height of 0.62 m (2.4 times of leg length) and maximum forward jumping distance of 0.72 m (2.7 times of leg length).",

        "abstract": "Silicone-based soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) is one of the key interests in soft robotic research. Currently, most of the SPAs bear a similar one-dimensional rod-like shape, regardless of their design and fabrication. There are few prototypes of SPAs with two-dimensional initial shapes, however, they are basically the linear combination of several one-dimensional SPAs. This paper presents a new class of silicone-based SPA named soft robotic pad (SRP). The SRP is shaped into a soft pad with a single flat air chamber and can generate different kinds of motions according to the internal constraint matrix within the SRP. In this paper, the design and fabrication of our SRPs are elaborated in detail, followed by the preliminary characterization of the different SRP prototypes. Although the current design is not optimized, our SRP prototypes prove the feasibility of the design and fabrication of a 2D shape-morphing SPA. With subsequent optimization, the SRP can work robustly in various real-world applications as strong flat artificial muscles for human joint rehabilitation, or as fins in marine robots.",

The proposed prototype consists of a multirotor vehicle in an octo-quadcopter configuration, which is well suited for good transition between mediums. The mathematical model is provided by means of the Newton-Euler formalism, highlighting the impact of the drastic change in density on the vehicle dynamics. A hierarchical controller is employed for attitude tracking, utilizing a proportional control law in cascade with a body angular rate Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Altitude stabilization is achieved by a PID controller with compensation of the restoring forces, while a gain scheduling strategy handles the change of medium. Furthermore, the proposed platform was extensively tested in simulations and real-time experiments under real conditions, with promising results in both mediums, and seamless transition between them.",

This second solution is not the most used by researchers, because of the difficulties to control the magnetic force. In this paper we propose a magnetic actuator prototype based on permanent magnets. In addition to the magnets, the actuator is also composed of a mechanical structure. This structure is used for positioning the permanent magnets, which allows to control the magnetic force generated by the actuator. We demonstrated in simulation and experimentally confirmed the ability of this actuator to generate both pushing and pulling forces.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has seen substantial development in recent decades. In MIS, particularly in laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgery, the surgical site is always crowded. One potential solution is the magnetic anchored and guidance system (MAGS), which liberates instruments from constraint of the accessing port. Current MAGS are all made by rigid components, which relies on articulated joints to maneuver inside the surgical cavity. Moreover, fabricating and assembling the MAGS are difficult due to the small size of the components. In this work, we present the design, modeling, fabrication and testing of a novel soft MAGS endoscope system. The system includes the external controller and the internal unit, which contains a soft body, two magnets and a replaceable wireless camera. It is compact, safe, lightweight and easy to make. Experimental results show that the system could offer stable maneuvering both in lab settings and in porcine model.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative robots, the so-called cobots, that work together with the human, are becoming more and more popular in the industrial world. An example of an application where these robots are useful is the assembly task. In this case, the human and the robot complement each other. On one side, the human can achieve more dexterous tasks, while on the other side, the robot can assist the assembly process to lower the physical and cognitive work load, e.g. to avoid errors, and in the same way reduce absenteeism. This paper describes a novel collaborative architecture for human-robot assembly tasks. The developed architecture is composed of four modules; face recognition, gesture recognition and human-like robot behavior modules are used to enhance the human-robot interaction, while the visual inspection module is utilized for quality control during the assembly process. A collaborative task consisting of the assembly of a box whereby the robot assists the human was designed and implemented on the Baxter robot. This was used as the application use case to validate the developed collaborative architecture.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Water pipe leakage is a common and significant problem around the world. In recent years, an increasing amount of effort has been put into developing effective leak detection solutions for water pipes. Among them, the pressure gradient based method developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology excels for its sensitivity in low pressure, small diameter pipes. It can also work in both plastic and metallic pipes carrying gas or water. However, the method was only verified in static fluid pipes, and the previous sensor designs were unable to detect leaks when there is a significant water flow in the pipe. This is undesired as the inspection can only be performed when water service is shut down. A modeling analysis shows that fluid dynamic effects in the water pipe make the original sensors dynamics too slow to react to leaks. Moreover, this leak detection method is prone to false alarms such as obstacles in the pipes, but there is a lack of studies on this topic. In this paper, we present three things: the design of a new leak sensor that is fast enough to detect leaks in dynamic fluid environments, a prototype for 52mm-inner-diameter pipeline tested in an industrial facility, and a method to differentiate leaks from false alarms supported by the test results.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust controller/observer for UAVs network anomaly estimation which is based on both Lyapunov Krasovkii functional and dynamic behavior of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Several research works on network anomaly estimation have been led using automatic control techniques and provide methods for designing both observer and command laws dedicated to time delay problem while estimating the anomaly or intrusion in the system. The observer design is based on a linearized fluid-flow model of the TCP behavior and must be associated to an AQM (Active Queue Management) to perform its diagnosis. The developed robust controller/observer in this paper has to be tuned by considering the time delay linear state-space representation of TCP model. As a first result, the designed controller/observer system has been successfully applied to some relevant practical problems such as topology network for aerial vehicles and the effectiveness is illustrated by using real traffic traces including Denial of Service attacks. Our first results show promising perspectives for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in a fleet of UAVs.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Surgeries involving interaction with soft tissue like the brain need to minimize shear and normal forces that can cause tissue damage or hemorrhage. Other surgeries require the ability to follow a complex, curved path, such as through an intestine or to a kidney stone. This paper presents a soft catheter that has the potential to aid in these challenging cases. The soft catheter is capable of apical extension in which the tip extends while the rest of the catheter remains stationary. This limits shear forces with the environment, easing movement of a body's tip through a constrained space. The soft catheter is pre-formed to patient-specific trajectories, meaning that normal forces against tissue would only arise due to errors between the actual and desired paths; we show decrease in normal force applied to the environment on the order of 100 compared to a standard catheter in a 30 degree bend. Setting the internal pressure allows for control of catheter stiffness, with a 500 times difference over the range of tested pressures. Manual operation to reach a surgical site requires only holding the correct orientation at the entry point into the body and setting the internal pressure of the catheter. This soft catheter could offer two benefits: the ability to apply low tissue interaction forces and reach challenging locations within the body.",

In this paper, we investigate the applicability of a soft robotic end-effector for ultrasound intervention. A novel, parallel design is derived based on the medical requirements, which addresses common shortcomings in both robotic ultrasound systems and soft robotic devices. Individual actuators are developed and characterized and the performance of the overall platform is evaluated in regards to its stiffness and steerability. It is shown that the platform comprises relatively high longitudinal and transversal stiffness, while still being compliant enough to ensure the safety of the patient. The shear stiffness of the platform is 4.2 times greater than the shear stiffness of an individual actuator. The platform is capable of applying loadings of 10N along its longitudinal axis, which makes it suitable for the given application. Furthermore, the workspace of the platform is suitable to robot-guided ultrasound with a maximum platform rotation range of \u00b114.8\u00b0, while only moving \u00b17mm in space.",

The hand is composed of a single \u201cgrasp\u201d actuator connected via an underactuated differential mechanism to six prismatic actuators arranged into pairs, forming three planar, parallel mechanism fingers that replicate the kinematics of a traditional 6-degree of freedom Stewart platform when grasping an object. This configuration allows for both grasping and accurate manipulation of a range of object sizes/shapes with minimal sensing. We describe the design and fabrication of a prototype hand that incorporates these kinematics and experimentally demonstrate it performing a series of accurate translational and rotational manipulations.",

The paper starts reviewing natural earthworm locomotion behavior, details the bio-inspired concept and design of both the segmental muscle-mimetic unit and the multi-segment earthworm-like robot prototype, and then presents the robot's locomotion models and analysis of the locomotion efficiency of the robot.

The developed tail-sitter requires only the same number of actuators as a normal fixed wing aircraft and achieves attitude control through deflections of the thrust-vectored propeller and ailerons. Thrust vectoring is realized by mounting a simple gimbal mechanism beneath the propeller motor. Both the thrust vector model and aerodynamics model are established, which leads to a complete nonlinear model of the tail-sitter in hovering state. Quaternion is applied for attitude description to avoid the singularity problem and improve computation efficiency. Through reasonable assumptions, a simplified model of the tail-sitter is obtained, based on which a backstepping controller is designed using the Lyapunov stability theory. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

When a system of FREEs are arranged in a planar configuration, they undergo large bending deformations due to internal loads and moments. This paper models the bending behavior of FREEs using a modified three-spring Pseudo-Rigid Body (PRB) model, which is commonly used to capture large bending behavior of flexures. The springs of the PRB model are shown to effectively capture the axial and bending stiffness of contracting FREEs, while an internal force accounts for actuation due to internal pressurization. An optimization process is carried out to fit the PRB model parameters with the experimental response curve of different FREEs with varying length to diameter ratio and fiber angles. Unlike conventional models applied to compliant mechanisms, the model parameters are shown to depend on fluid pressure. The PRB model is used to demonstrate and analyze a pennate arrangement of contracting FREEs that exhibit variable gear ratio behavior. The pennate FREEs can serve as building blocks for the design of soft robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Today, collaborative robots are often taught new tasks through \u201cteaching by demonstration\u201d techniques rather than manual programming. This works well for many tasks; however, some tasks like precise tight-fitting insertions can be hard to recreate through exact position replays because they also involve forces and are highly affected by the robot's repeatability and the position of the object in the hand. As of yet there is no way to automatically detect when procedures to reduce position uncertainty should be used. In this paper, we present a new way to automatically detect insertion tasks during impedance control-based trajectory teaching. This is accomplished by recording the forces and torques applied by the operator and inputting these signals to a convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural network is used to extract important features of the spatio-temporal forces and torque signals for distinguishing insertion tasks. Eventually, this method could help robots understand the tasks they are taught at a higher level. They will not only be capable of a position-time replay of the task, but will also recognize the best strategy to apply in order to accomplish the task (in this case insertion). Our method was tested on data obtained from 886 experiments that were conducted on eight different in-hand objects. Results show that we can distinguish insertion tasks from pick-and-place tasks with an average accuracy of 82%.",

In this study, inspired by active stiffness mechanism of biological muscle, we developed a variable stiffness actuator which can realize precise joint stiffness without torque sensor based feedback control. The actuator consists of two antagonistically allocated DC motors with a variable radius gear transmission mechanism. The equilibrium position and joint stiffness can be independently controlled adjusting the activation level of motors by feedforward control. Theoretically predicted stiffness is realized well.

        "abstract": "As a part of our research on several different types of Giacometti robots, a 20-m-long, considerably light, and simple robot arm, referred to as the Giacometti arm, is developed in this study. Even though the Giacometti arm is not suitable for precise positioning, rapid motion, and high load capacity, which are the aspects most conventional robots focus on, it is designed for extremely specific purposes such as the inspection of otherwise unreachable regions using a small camera at the arm's tip. In addition, it is designed to be essentially safe even if it falls down or hits an object. This aspect is realized using helium-filled balloon bodies and thin pneumatic muscles. In this paper, we designed new Giacometti arm which is 20-m-long, weighs 940 g, and has 20 degrees of freedom. To realize this long arm, we derived a kinematic model of the 20-m-long Giacometti arm, factoring in the air resistance. We verified the model using the arm, and its utility was confirmed at a mock-up facility.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a design method for the mechanism of a robotic arm suitable for a multicopter. The motion of an arm attached to a multicopter can possibly disturb the multicopter attitude. Our aim is to suppress this attitude disturbance by mechanical methods. In the proposed design method, the arm has the following features for suppressing the disturbance of the multicopter attitude. 1. The robotic arm can adjust its center of gravity (COG). 2. In the simplified model, the sum of the angular momentum of the rotating parts constituting the robot arm is equal to zero. These features can compensate for both the displacement of the COG of the arm and the counter torque generated from rotating parts, which cause the disturbance to the multicopter attitude. Since the disturbance of the multicopter attitude can be suppressed mechanically, the robotic arm does not require a special flight control law. In other words, this robotic arm has the advantage of being attached to a multicopter using a common, off-the-shelf, multipurpose flight controller. Furthermore, we discuss the mass distribution, power transmission method, and the moment of inertia of rotating parts, such as the speed reducer, motor, and arm. Additionally, we fabricate a prototype robotic arm with four joints and three degrees of freedom (DOFs), based on the proposed design method. Finally, the experiments showed that the robotic arm suppressed the disturbance of the multicopter attitude caused by the arm motion.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer constitutes the thirteenth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) is the established treatment procedure of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, current techniques for this procedure represent several inadequacies such as inaccurate resection of tumors and high recurrence rates due to the lack of dexterity and limited instrumentation. In this paper we proposed a concept to improve the efficiency of this procedure. Starting from the anatomic challenges, the design and fabrication procedure of a double arm surgical manipulator made of nitinol was presented. A new actuation concept was introduced which enables a surgeon to facilitate ten degrees of freedom simultaneously. Finally, in-vitro experiments regarding workspace and functionality were conducted to evaluate the developed system. The workspace experiments showed that the entire surface of the bladder can be reached by the manipulator. We also demonstrated that with the developed system, basic tasks such as pick-and-place and circular path marking can be performed.",

        "abstract": "Hovering flight is one of the valuable capabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform various missions. It is easily attainable by rotary-wing aircrafts such as a helicopter and multirotor. This flight maneuver, however, remains a significant challenge to a flapping wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV). This paper aims to regulate attitude angles of a FWMAV and maintain an altitude during hovering. For this task, we model dynamic equations of FWMAV to analyze the stability of longitudinal dynamics under the influence of tail wings. In order to examine the effect of the flapping wings on the fuselage, we carry out measurements on the power train. We develop a FWMAV with two pairs of main flapping wings and tail wings, to achieve stable hovering flight. For autonomous control, PID controllers are designed and onboard sensors are used; 9-degree of freedom (DoF) IMU is for attitude regulation and barometer is for an altitude control. For estimating an altitude, we also apply processing filter. Experimental results show that our strategy can accomplish and sustain autonomous hovering of a FWMAV.",

In this work we present a new high performance human size and weight compatible bi-manual manipulation platform that demonstrates notable physical strength and power capabilities. To attain this performance, design features including custom high performance elastic drives and robust light weight structure principles were considered resulting in large payload to robot mass ratio that is greater than 1.5 for short time heavy payloads. The design principles and mechanics of the upper body bi-manual robot are presented providing details on the solutions adopted for the various mechatronics components. The performance of the system actuation and the strength capacity of the overall platform is verified through the execution of heavy payload motion and impact experiments.",

        "abstract": "Applying differential drive robots to cooperative systems introduces difficulties regarding the maneuverability of the cooperative system. These difficulties are caused by the sliding constraint of the plain wheels typically used by differential drive robots and mainly affects the turning capability of the cooperative system. This can be a problem when a cooperative system traverses narrow spaces or manipulates large objects. Conversely, differential drive robots are simple to design and control for single robot tasks. To enable differential drive robots to participate in multi-robot cooperative systems, a novel wheel capable of switching between plain and omni-wheel modes is proposed. By selecting the appropriate mode, differential drive robots would be able to work in both single and multi-robot tasks seamlessly without adding complex control to the single robot case or degrading the maneuverability of the cooperative system. As an initial step, the kinematic modeling and the prototype of the wheel is presented together with tests using two differential drive robots implemented with the proposed wheel.",

A customized trumpet-shaped undercarriage is used to guarantee that the robot can land and move safely. With the aid of a swingable 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF), the robot can not only determine whether there are obstacles but also detect the position and orientation of the OGW, making it suitable for automatic inspection of power lines.

By using a new force distributing compliant structure, the proposed glove can assist high gripping force while adapting to human hand motion, which is difficult for conventional soft robotic gloves. The force distributing compliant structure is comprised of flexible frames, soft fabrics and belts, and can transmit a high force or moment to the distal end, even though the whole structure is flexible. Therefore, the proposed glove can assist gripping without a harmful load or misalignment on the human fingers. The palmar side of the glove is made of a thin and soft fabric and belts to facilitate the transfer of tactile sensation. The proposed assist glove enables the user to manipulate various objects owing to both the softness and high gripping force. The basic concept as well as thorough theoretical analysis about the force distributing compliant structures is described, and the experiments for quantitative validation of the developed assist gripper are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, development and preliminary evaluation of a soft-inflatable exosuit for knee rehabilitation. Soft-inflatable actuators made of heat-sealable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials are fabricated in two different beam-like structures (I and O cross-section actuators) and mechanically characterized for their torque performance in knee-extension assistance. The fabrication procedure of both types of actuators is presented as well as their integration into a lightweight, low-cost and body-conforming interface. To detect the activation duration of the device during the gait cycle, a soft-silicone insole with embedded force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) is used. In evaluation studies, the soft-inflatable exosuit device is tested for its ability to reduce muscle activity during the swing phase of the knee. Using sEMG (surface electromyography) sensors, the rectus femoris muscle group of a healthy individual is recorded while walking on a treadmill at a constant speed, with and without the soft device. Preliminary testing presents a promising 7% reduction in muscle activity and demonstrates the applicability of the soft-inflatable exosuit in knee rehabilitation scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an adjustable knee mechanism for walking assistance devices for the elderly to provide physical gait assistance. The adjustable knee mechanism can assist in flexion/extension motions of the knee joint and compensate for the transitional movements of the knee in the sagittal plane as well as aligning the frontal plane. In order to compensate for the center of rotation, the proposed adjustable knee mechanism is implemented by connecting several rolling cams with unique and precisely calculated contact geometries. The key idea of the proposed mechanism is to realize linear motion and accurate torque transmission by a pulley method using the rolling joint in which the distance of the center between the rolling cams is changed. The proposed articulated joint can effectively deliver the torque required for assistance while adapting to the joint motion of the wearer. This paper describes the mechanical design of this knee mechanism and its implementation on a wearable robot and in preliminary experiments. The performance of the proposed mechanism was verified by simulations and experiments.",

The force sensor uses an array of force sensitive resistors (FSR) with a mechanically pre-loaded structure to perform the force sensing. The sensor has a built-in signal conditioning circuitry to provide on-board power regulation, programmable signal amplification and analog to digital conversion. The sensor is inexpensive and highly sensitive to low-amplitude force, critical in surgical applications. We validate the efficacy of the sensor with two surgical applications - robotic palpation for stiffness mapping and obstacle avoidance for a highly articulated robotic probe (HARP). The results show that the sensor is capable of accurately detecting the stiff inclusions embedded in the tissues as well as detecting obstacles and helping HARP safely navigate around them.",

        "abstract": "Bio-inspired underwater robots have several benefits compared to traditional underwater vehicles such as agility, efficiency, and environmentally friendly body. However, bio-inspired underwater robots developed so far have a single swimming mode, which may limit their capability to perform different tasks. This paper presents a re-configurable bio-inspired underwater robot that can change the morphology to enable multiple swimming modes: octopus-mode and fish-mode. The robot is 60 cm long and 50 cm wide, weighing 2.1 kg, and consists of a re-configurable body and 8 compliant arms that are actuated independently by waterproof servomotors. In the robot, the octopus-mode is expected to perform unique tasks such as object manipulation and ground locomotion as demonstrated in literature, while the fish-mode is promising to swim faster and efficiently to travel long distance. With this platform, we investigate the effectiveness of adaptive morphology in bio-inspired underwater robots. For this purpose, we evaluated the robot in terms of the cost of transport and the swimming efficiency of both the morphologies. The fish-mode exhibited a lower cost of transport of 2.2 and higher efficiency of 1.2 % compared to the octopus-mode, illustrating the effect of the multiple swimming modes by adaptive morphology.",

The robot has distinctive features to climb up and down ladders with a narrow cage, to pass through narrow environments, to move upon scattered debris at disaster sites and to deal with sudden and unexpected contact. The robot also satisfies environmental requirements related to dust, water, and temperature. To implement environmental resistance to a slim body for movement in a narrow environment, cooling of heat sources such as CPUs is a serious problem. Therefore a new cooling structure for humanoid robots is proposed. The proposed robot experiments on the above features are also shown in this paper.",

A purpose of the developed robot is to realize continuous operation for a long time and to improve an action autonomously. we considered three aspects of robustness, mechanical robustness, functional robustness and robustness of an action. Mechanical robustness was confirmed by the experiment that the robot fell down without mechanical failures and continued to work after falling down by using hard points. Functional robustness was designed to use power cable and to wear a suit which can be changed by required functionality. Robustness of an action was achieved as a standing up action using \u201cStateNet\u201d, which realized autonomous error recovery. Finally, we present a methodology to develop a humanoid robot platform which can continue to work in the real world.",

This system is one instance of deployment of our continuously developing open source software for robot audition called HARK (Honda Research Institute Japan Audition for Robots with Kyoto University). To improve the robustness against outdoor acoustic noise, we propose to combine two sound source localization methods based on MUSIC (multiple signal classification) to cope with trade-off between latency and noise robustness. The standard Eigenvalue decomposition based MUSIC (SEVD-MUSIC) has smaller latency but less noise robustness, whereas the incremental generalized singular value decomposition based MUSIC (iGSVD-MUSIC) has higher noise robustness but larger latency. A UAV operator can use an appropriate method according to the situation. A sound enhancement method called online robust principal component analysis (ORPCA) enables the operator to detect a target sound source more easily. To improve the stability of wireless communication, and robustness of the UAV system against weather changes, we developed data compression based on free lossless audio codec (FLAC) extended to support a 16 ch audio data stream via UDP, and developed a water-resistant microphone array. The resulting system successfully worked in an outdoor search and rescue task in ImPACT Tough Robotics Challenge in November 2016.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Developing grasping devices with the capabilities to carry out dexterous tasks similar to human hand are being studied for many decades. To this aim, mathematical analysis such as control of multi-fingered gripper, grasp synthesis algorithms, contact types and their interactions have been explicitly addressed by many researchers. Since human hands are dexterous due to the complex integration of control and numerous sensors, hence they are naturally adaptable to grasp, in-hand manipulation of plurality of object by their construction. On the other hand, artificial grippers require priori knowledge of the payload geometry and configuration to maneuver grasping and manipulation tasks at the very first place. Moreover, theoretical analysis, such as contact kinematics, grasp stability cannot predict the nonholonomic behaviors, and therefore, uncertainties are always present to restrict a maneuver, even though the gripper is kinematically feasible of doing the task. Hence, in general, industrial grippers do exploit simpler mechanisms with least number of fingers and tend to avoid soft materials in the construction primarily to achieve dexterity, reliability, repeatability and speed in the process. However, in-hand manipulation of objects urges certain degrees of flexibility in the gripper design; which is difficult to obtain from a rigid structure and also the use of non-rigid materials reduce speed, accuracy and performance. In this research, a gripper platform named Dexclar (DEXterous reConfigurable moduLAR) is proposed, which addresses the dilemma by combining mechanism and modularity, evaluating payload centric requirements.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method that allows for dexterous manipulation of an object by exploiting contact with an external surface. The technique requires a compliant grasp, enabling the motion of the object in the robot hand while allowing for significant contact forces to be present on the external surface. We show that under this type of grasp it is possible to estimate and control the pose of the object with respect to the surface, leveraging the trade-off between force control and manipulative dexterity. The method is independent of the object geometry, relying only on the assumptions of type of grasp and the existence of a contact with a known surface. Furthermore, by adapting the estimated grasp compliance, the method can handle unmodelled effects. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated with experiments on object pose regulation and pivoting against a rigid surface, where a mechanical spring provides the required compliance.",

What is more, with the increased use of teleoperated humanoid robots, it is important to recognize whether any differences between instructions given to humans and to robots are due to the physical embodiment or to the perceived autonomy of the instructee. In this paper, we present the results of a human-subject experiment in which participants interacted in a collaborative, task-based setting with both a human and a suit-based, teleoperated humanoid robot said to be either autonomous or teleoperated. Our results suggest that humans will use politeness strategies equally with human, autonomous robotic, and teleoperated robotic teammates, reinforcing recent findings that autonomous robots must comprehend and appropriately respond to human utterances that follow such strategies. Our results also suggest variations in how different teammates were perceived. Specifically, our results suggest that human-teleoperated robots were perceived as less intelligent than human teammates; a finding with serious implications for human-robot team dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Fluidically actuated soft robots show a great promise for operation in sensitive and unknown environments due to their intrinsic compliance. However, most previous designs use either flow control systems that are noisy, inefficient, sensitive to leaks, and cannot achieve differential pressure (i.e. can only apply either positive or negative pressures with respect to atmospheric), or closed volume control systems that are not adaptable and prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present a modular, low cost volume control system for differential pressure control of soft actuators. We use this system to actuate three-chamber 3D printed soft robotic modules. For this design, we find a 54% increase in achievable blocked force, and a significant increase in actuator workspace when using differential pressure actuation as compared to the use of only pressure or vacuum. The increased workspace allowed the robot to achieve complex tasks such as writing on a screen with a laser pointer or manipulating fragile objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate a self-healing capability of the combined system by using vacuum to actuate ruptured modules which were no longer responsive to positive pressure.",

We discuss how dimensional analysis, the rules governing how physical quantities are combined, can be used to detect inconsistencies in robot software that are otherwise difficult to detect. Using a corpus of ROS software with 5.9M lines of code, we measure the frequency of these dimensional inconsistencies and find them in 6% (211 / 3,484) of repositories that use ROS. We find that the inconsistency type `Assigning multiple units to a variable' accounts for 75% of inconsistencies in ROS code. We identify the ROS classes and physical units most likely to be involved with dimensional inconsistencies, and find that the ROS Message type geometry_msgs::Twist is involved in over half of all inconsistencies and is used by developers in ways contrary to Twist's intent. We further analyze the frequency of physical units used in ROS programs as a proxy for assessing how developers use ROS, and discuss the practical implications of our results including how to detect and avoid these inconsistencies.",

Because there is no haptic feedback to a user, manipulation of constrained objects is much harder than that of a simple rigid body. In addition, many physics simulator usually suffers from instability in handling the constrained objects in a virtual system. We solve the problem by adding another micro simulator which enforce the constraint between the objects, and guarantees that the rendered image of an object and its physics counterpart always satisfy the given constraint. The experiment shows that the proposed method makes a user manipulate constrained objects with no difficulties in the way that he or she manipulates such objects in the real world.",

        "abstract": "Direct kinematics (DK) of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR) based only on cable lengths measurements is a complex issue even with ideal cables and consequently even harder for more realistic cable models such as sagging cable. A natural way to simplify the DK solving is to add sensors. We consider here sensors that give a partial or complete measurement of the cable direction at the anchor points and/or measure the orientation of the platform of CDPR with 2 or 3 cables and we assume that the measurements are exact. We provide a solving procedure and maximal number of DK solutions for an extensive combination of sensors for CDPR with sagging cables. We show that at least two measurements are necessary for the planar 2 cables case while six are necessary for the spatial 3 cables case. For spatial CDPR with n cables we prove that at least 2n additional sensors will be required to get a closed-form solution of the DK.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the application of semi-dense visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) to the humanoid robotics domain. Challenges of visual SLAM applied to humanoids include the type of dynamic motion executed by the robot, a lack of features in man-made environments and the presence of dynamics in the scene. Previous research on humanoid SLAM focused mostly on feature-based methods which result in sparse environment reconstructions. Instead, we investigate the application of a modern direct method to obtain a semi-dense visually interpretable map which can be used for collision free motion planning. We tackle the challenge of using direct visual SLAM on a humanoid by proposing a more robust pose tracking method. This is formulated as an optimisation problem over a cost function which combines information from the stereo camera and a low-drift kinematic-inertial motion prior. Extensive experimental demonstrations characterise the performance of our method using the NASA Valkyrie humanoid robot in a laboratory environment equipped with a Vicon motion capture system. Our experiments demonstrate pose tracking robustness to challenges such as sudden view change, motion blur in the image, change in illumination and tracking through sequences of featureless areas in the environment. Finally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our stereo reconstruction against a LIDAR map.",

        "abstract": "We present a direct visual odometry algorithm for a fisheye-stereo camera. Our algorithm performs simultaneous camera motion estimation and semi-dense reconstruction. The pipeline consists of two threads: a tracking thread and a mapping thread. In the tracking thread, we estimate the camera pose via semi-dense direct image alignment. To have a wider field of view (FoV) which is important for robotic perception, we use fisheye images directly without converting them to conventional pinhole images which come with a limited FoV. To address the epipolar curve problem, plane-sweeping stereo is used for stereo matching and depth initialization. Multiple depth hypotheses are tracked for selected pixels to better capture the uncertainty characteristics of stereo matching. Temporal motion stereo is then used to refine the depth and remove false positive depth hypotheses. Our implementation runs at an average of 20 Hz on a low-end PC. We run experiments in outdoor environments to validate our algorithm, and discuss the experimental results. We experimentally show that we are able to estimate 6D poses with low drift, and at the same time, do semi-dense 3D reconstruction with high accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other existing semi-dense direct visual odometry algorithm for a fisheye-stereo camera.",

        "abstract": "On novel actuator research in the field of cellular muscle-inspired actuators, skeletal muscles are often used as inspiration due to their modular and compact design and seemingly effortless control. Amongst others, the remaining challenges to tackle are robust designs, energy consumption minimization and control strategies. We have developed a discrete muscle-inspired actuator, in which solenoids can be overpowered and locked to recruit springs in series. This paper describes the spring and electronics design and proposes a binary actuator segmentation for increased resolution. Next, we propose and simulate a control strategy based on a lookup table, to cope with multiple discrete inputs, uni-directional force inputs and solenoid cooling time. Currently, the actuation units and springs are modular and can be tailored easily for specific applications. The resolution is maximized without under utilization of the actuator's capabilities, and our control strategy can currently control 12 motor units in real-time, which can be increased to 30. The experiments confirm the working of the control strategy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm for localizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in GPS denied environments. Localization is performed with respect to a pre-built map of the environment represented using the distance function of a binary mosaic, avoiding the need for extraction and explicit matching of visual features. Edges extracted from images acquired by an on-board camera are projected to the map to compute an error metric that indicates the misalignment between the predicted and true pose of the UAV. A constrained extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework is used to generate an estimate of the full 6-DOF location of the UAV by enforcing the condition that the distance function values are zero when there is no misalignment. Use of an EKF also makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate information from any other system on the UAV, for example, from its auto-pilot, a height sensor or an optical flow sensor. Experiments using a hexarotor UAV both in a simulation environment and in the field are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

To this end, a stereo camera tracks the positions of instrument and patient, a computer then measures the distance to the patient structure and calculates the allowed output power for the instrument. This clinically approved principle requires different systems to exchange data with hard timing constraints. The German research project OR.NET aimed at enabling interoperability of medical devices with a real-time capable network architecture. In this contribution we show how the Navigated Control principle can be applied to various different devices and how it can be integrated into a real-time medical device network based on that architecture. Distributed Navigated Control has the potential to facilitate the integration process for further active instruments and to enable a highly modular system-of-systems. We successfully implemented Distributed Navigated Control for a surgical drill and for the first time for an ultrasonic aspirator. The respective output power of both devices can be limited via the network simultaneously and with hard timing constraints.",

Force control of gear-driven robots has an advantage in its fully variable stiffness in comparison with elastic robots. However, feedback latency makes gear-driven robots vulnerable to impact rising in several milliseconds. It would be resolved by low-latency torque feedback loop in a single joint, but torque sensors are too large for life-sized humanoid robots. We estimate joint torque from motor current and rotation observed in each joint, and give artificial elasticity to joints using compliance control and shock absorption control. Our controller performance is demonstrated by landing experiments.",

Existing methods are effective when applied to actuation systems with mechanical transmissions; however, they cannot be applied to actuation systems that use fluid transmissions owing to the characteristics resulting from fluid parameters. To solve this problem, we propose a stability-guaranteed PD control method that incorporates two observers: one for observing friction and the other is for observing flexible joint effects due to fluid compliance and internal leakage. This allows robots with fluid transmissions to asymptotically converge to the desired position. We verified the proposed approach by conducting simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "Bridging the `reality gap' that separates simulated robotics from experiments on hardware could accelerate robotic research through improved data availability. This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to 1.5 cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world for the purpose of robotic control.",

Our method decomposes the planning problem into two stages: a discrete planner operating on a graph representation of the workspace, and a continuous refinement that converts the non-smooth graph plan into a set of Ck-continuous trajectories, locally optimizing an integral-squared-derivative cost. We account for the downwash effect, allowing safe flight in dense formations. We demonstrate the computational efficiency in simulation with up to 200 robots and the physical plausibility with an experiment with 32 nano-quadrotors. Our approach can compute safe and smooth trajectories for hundreds of quadrotors in dense environments with obstacles in a few minutes.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel omnidirectional stereo camera setup that is formed by two ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) fisheye cameras. The proposed configuration is formed by two 245-degree FOV fisheye cameras, facing opposite directions, that are rigidly mounted on two sides of a rod. The overlapping view in the two fisheye images forms a ring-shaped spatial stereo setup. Our system provides stereo observations with full 360-degree FOV in horizontal directions and 65-degree FOV in the vertical direction. In addition, the two fisheye cameras altogether also provide full spherical monocular coverage of the surrounding environment. We address challenges in camera modeling, fisheye intrinsic calibration, stereo self-calibration, and depth estimation. We develop a lens-specific fisheye camera calibration method that uses manufacturer data for the optical lens to assist with the intrinsic calibration and develop an online self-calibration approach for estimating stereo extrinsic parameters. The overlapping camera views are rectified into stereo image pairs, from which a spatial stereo matching pipeline is developed for depth estimation in all horizontal directions. We show both qualitative and quantitative analysis to validate our approach.",

Fall-risk assessment systems have proven to be helpful in community-based fall prevention programs. One of the risk factors of falling is the deterioration of a person's dual-task performance. For example, gait training, which enhances both motor and cognitive functions, is a multi-target stepping task (MTST), in which participants step on assigned colored targets. To evaluate the dual-task performance during MTST in human living space, projection mapping and robot navigation to maintain a safe distance from the participant are key technologies. Projection mapping is used to evaluate the long-distance dual-task performance, where MTST images are displayed on the floor by the moving DAR. To evaluate the accuracy of the projected target position, experiments for MTST projection using the moving DAR and video analysis are carried out. Additionally, to verify the validity of the MTST by the moving DAR at a constant speed, experiments with several young participants are carried out.",

The planner is coupled with a hierarchical whole-body controller which optimizes the whole-body motion and contact forces by solving a cascade of prioritized tasks.

        "abstract": "As small legged robots for search and rescue are deployed in collapsed buildings with unstructured terrain and steep drop-offs, they run the risk of flipping over and becoming incapacitated. A single degree of freedom low-mass tail is added to a 77.5 g, 18 cm long VelociRoACH legged robot with protective shell, which gives it the capability to dynamically self-right. Quasi-static analysis of terrestrial self-righting gives design requirements for the tail actuator. Dynamic simulation predicts that terrestrial self-righting is slower than aerial self-righting with a massive tail, but can be achieved without adding significant mass away from the base of leg support. Open-loop experiments on terrain with varying friction and roughness show that VelociRoACH can dynamically self-right using tail contact in as little time as 256 ms. Finally, an autonomous self-righting experiment on an obstacle with multiple step drops demonstrates that the robot can detect inversion and rapidly self-right while walking on challenging terrain.",

        "abstract": "We present a real-time pattern generator for dynamic walking over rough terrains. Our method automatically finds step durations, a critical issue over rough terrains where they depend on terrain topology. To achieve this level of generality, we consider a Floating-base Inverted Pendulum (FIP) model where the center of mass can translate freely and the zero-tilting moment point is allowed to leave the contact surface. This model is equivalent to a linear inverted pendulum with variable center-of-mass height, but its equations of motion remain linear. Our solution then follows three steps: (i) we characterize the FIP contact-stability condition; (ii) we compute feedforward controls by solving a nonlinear optimization over receding-horizon FIP trajectories. Despite running at 30 Hz in a model-predictive fashion, simulations show that the latter is too slow to stabilize dynamic motions. To remedy this, we (iii) linearize FIP feedback control into a constrained linear-quadratic regulator that runs at 300 Hz. We finally demonstrate our solution in simulations with a model of the HRP-4 humanoid robot, including noise and delays over state estimation and foot force control.",

In biological systems, spatial encoding in the brain is definitively known to be performed using a fixed-size neural encoding framework - the place, head-direction and grid cells found in the mammalian hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Particularly paradoxically, one of the main encoding centers - the grid cells - represents the world using a highly aliased, repetitive encoding structure where one neuron represents an unbounded number of places in the world. Inspired by this system, in this paper we invert the normal approach used in forming mapping and localization algorithms, by developing a novel place recognition algorithm that seeks out and leverages repetitive, mutually complementary landmark frequencies in the world. The combinatorial encoding capacity of multiple different frequencies enables not only the ability to achieve efficient data storage, but also the potential for sub-linear storage growth in a learning and recall system. Using both ground-based and aerial camera datasets, we demonstrate the system finding and utilizing these frequencies to achieve successful place recognition, and discuss how this approach might scale to arbitrarily large global datasets and dimensions.",

These unobserved deviations in the pose of the object or the contact configuration can make it impossible to solve a given task. In this paper, we presents a new approach to estimate the state of the grasp using only position and torque measurements from the joints of the hand. Based on the popular extended Kalman filter framework, the algorithm estimates the pose of the manipulated object, as well as the contact forces and positions on the surface of the object. It is able to reliably detect new and the loss of contacts and to incorporate this information in the estimation filter.

In contrast to previous feature-based approaches, the proposed method does not employ any assumption on the geometry of the scene (e.g., it does not assume straight lines). It can thus use measurements from all image areas with significant gradient, similarly to direct semi-dense methods. However, in contrast to direct semi-dense approaches, the proposed method's measurement model is invariant to linear changes in the image intensity. The novel edge parameterization and measurement model we propose explicitly account for the fact that edge points can only provide useful information in the direction of the image gradient. We present both Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as results from real-world experimental testing, which demonstrate that the proposed edge-based approach to visual-inertial odometry is consistent, and outperforms the point-based one.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the complete area coverage problem of a known environment by multiple-robots. Complete area coverage is the problem of moving an end-effector over all available space while avoiding existing obstacles. In such tasks, using multiple robots can increase the efficiency of the area coverage in terms of minimizing the operational time and increase the robustness in the face of robot attrition. Unfortunately, the problem of finding an optimal solution for such an area coverage problem with multiple robots is known to be NP-complete. In this paper we present two approximation heuristics for solving the multi-robot coverage problem. The first solution presented is a direct extension of an efficient single robot area coverage algorithm, based on an exact cellular decomposition. The second algorithm is a greedy approach that divides the area into equal regions and applies an efficient single-robot coverage algorithm to each region. We present experimental results for two algorithms. Results indicate that our approaches provide good coverage distribution between robots and minimize the workload per robot, meanwhile ensuring complete coverage of the area.",

        "abstract": "A model of hierarchical Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) enables a mobile robot to learn a spatial representation of its environment directly from images captured during a random walk. After the unsupervised learning phase a subset of the resulting representations are orientation invariant and code for the position of the robot. Hence, they change monotonically over space even though the variation of the sensory signals received from the environment might change drastically e.g. during rotation on the spot. Furthermore, the property of spatial smoothness allows us to infer a navigation direction by taking the difference between the measurement at the current location and a measurement at a target location. In our work we investigated the use of slow feature representations, learned for a specific environment, for the purpose of navigation. We present a straightforward method for navigation using gradient descent on the difference between two points specified in slow feature space. Due to its slowness objective, the resulting slow feature representations implicitly encode information about static obstacles, allowing a mobile robot to efficiently circumnavigate them by simply following the steepest gradient in slow feature space.",

        "abstract": "Robotic lawn-mowers are required to stay within a predefined working area, otherwise they may drive into a pond or on the street. This turns navigation and path planning into safety critical components. If we consider using SLAM techniques in that context, we must be able to provide safety guarantees in the presence of sensor/actuator noise and featureless areas in the environment. In this paper, we tackle the problem of planning a path that maximizes robot safety while navigating inside the working area and under the constraints of limited computing resources and cheap sensors. Our approach uses a map of the environment to estimate localizability at all locations, and it uses these estimates to search for a path from start to goal in belief space using an extended heuristic search algorithm. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it on simulation data recorded on eight different gardens, as well as on a real robot. The experiments presented in this paper show that our approach leads to short computation times and short paths while maximizing robot safety under certain assumptions.",

We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm, which we call bottleneck tree (BTT), on several challenging instances of the problem involving multiple agents, where it outperforms the state-of-the-art cost-map planning technique T-RRT. In addition to its efficiency, BTT requires the tuning of only a single parameter: the number of samples. On the theoretical side, we study the asymptotic properties of our method and consider the special setting where the computed trajectories must be monotone in all coordinates. This constraint arises in cases where the problem involves the coordination of multiple agents that are restricted to forward motions along predefined paths.",

While most similar methods depend heavily on detecting three-dimensional (3D) features, this work focuses on locating two-dimensional (2D) features embedded in 3D data. The main idea is: each stair is a sequence of lines with similar domain of definition, and the staircase is a sequence of such elements. To avoid unnecessary computations, an octree is used to down-sample the environment point-cloud data. The resulting centroids are stored in n arrays, each containing points with equal height. This effectively segments the 3D data into n 2D slices. The Hough transform is used to scan each array for lines. the remainder of the algorithm detects lines with the same domain of definition and determines if sequences that may correspond to stairways exist. If these sequences meet the required tolerances, then a staircase is detected. For each detected stairway a model that contains the width, height, depth, and amount of stairs is returned. The proposed algorithm is able to efficiently locate and model staircases on different poses and is robust to noise from the measured data, as indicated by the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Field studies indicate that European starlings in a flock coordinate utilizing a nearest neighbors approach. This model of communication is known in the biological swarm literature as the topological model. Each starling coordinates with a fixed number of nearest neighbors, and this number is referred to as the topological distance. The presented research evaluates the topological model in the context of a swarm robotics task, where a simulated artificial swarm is tasked to search for and go to a goal in the environment. Specifically, experiments are conducted on a high-fidelity, multi-robot simulator to analyze the performance of the tasked swarm as the topological distance is varied. Connections are drawn between the topological model based on starlings and the Delta-disk model, which is widely used in the robotics community to model agent interaction zones. Using graph measures, conditions under which the two models generate comparable networks are presented.",

        "abstract": "The large dynamic deflections of continuum robots, soft robots, and slender elastic objects can be accurately modeled with classical rod theories in nonlinear elasticity. In this paper, we propose a real-time computational approach for solving the partial differential equations of a dynamic Kirchhoff rod. Our approach is based on implicit time discretization of the Kirchhoff equations and subsequent solution of the resulting continuous spatial boundary value problem at each time step. This modular approach can exhibit low numerical damping, handle arbitrarily large time steps, and provide an accurate, high-order representation of the rod shape in steady-state. We experimentally validated the method by capturing footage of a dynamic rod with a high speed camera and comparing this experimental data with simulations using the proposed approach. Soft-real-time performance is achieved, and the relationship between time step and real-time performance is explored in a plot.",

The aim is to safely land these type of flying vehicles under side wind conditions and on moving surfaces using a robot manipulator arm mounted on the ground. In our previous work, we have considered light UAVs compared to the robot's payload capabilities. In this work, we present a method that enables to realize robot assisted landing for arbitrary combinations of aerial vehicles and robot arms. We show that the combined system is overactuated. This allows to distribute the workload and enables to assist heavy rotorcraft, whose weight would otherwise exceed the nominal payload of the robot arm. The performance of the controller is evaluated in numerical simulations as well as in experiments using a custom-built hexacopter and a KUKA/DLR light-weight robot.",

        "abstract": "Given the wide variety of flight conditions typically encountered by fixed-wing aerial vehicles, the flight performance of a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) depends on many factors. Predicting the performance for a given application requires characterization of both system and environmental components. Furthermore, a SUAV with a transformable airframe increases the number of characterizable states, where each state features a unique set of capabilities. This results in significant differences with respect to power consumption, solar panel orientation, and increases the design limitations on system components. This paper characterizes the energy collection, propulsion, and power electronics subsystems of a transformable SUAV developed at the University of Minnesota. Clear-sky and solar panel models are used to predict the power available for a given location and time. Propulsion system design is validated with flight data, and a proposed model correlates propulsion limits with available energy. Power electronics are modeled and simulated to determine hardware and tracking algorithm efficiencies. Finally, a pulsed battery charging methodology is implemented in hardware and evaluated against conventional charging techniques.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for trajectory generation with B\u00e9zier curves, by considering the wind field and dynamic constraints for small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Atmospheric phenomena affect UAS trajectories, so the wind presence should be considered in order efficiently perform a mission. These missions require precise area decomposition, efficient waypoint sequencing, and a smooth trajectory generation to fulfill the required level of safety and reliability. In this context, a path planning algorithm is presented which incorporates the use of an area decomposition scheme which considers complex shapes and restrictions, in order to provide high levels of coverage. A novel trajectory generation algorithm is proposed, which aims to harvest energy from the atmosphere by taking advantage of the previously estimated wind field and the identified wind features, such as shear wind and discrete gusts, by taking into account flight envelope restrictions. Different test cases and scenarios, including Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations and real telemetry data analysis, are presented to assess the energy gain for the implemented algorithms. The results indicate promising energy gains of almost 15% in voltage saving if the mentioned factors are considered to re-plan the path with the energy-efficient trajectories.",

We focus on robotic tasks dealing with adaptation to the unknown or partially known environment, where the robot has to learn the environment geometry in order to perform the desired task with the given reference forces and torques. The initial motion trajectories are obtained by kinesthetic teaching, whereas the required forces and torques are prescribed by the task. We are interested in incremental learning, which assures smooth and safe operation, aiming at handling of delicate, fragile objects, such as objects made of glass. In order to achieve these goals we propose a new adaptive ILC scheme, where the adaptation is supervised by reinforcement learning. We also show how to apply ILC to orientational motion, taking into account the curved geometry of SO(3). The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified on a bi-manual glass wiping task.",

In this work, we extend the ergodic coverage algorithm to robots operating in constrained environments and present a formulation that can capture sensor footprint and avoid obstacles and restricted areas in the domain.

The most popular simulation techniques are force-based models that need force measurements. In this paper, we explore the applicability of a geometry-based simulation method called meshless shape matching (MSM) for estimating the deformability of objects. The main advantages of MSM are its controllability and computational efficiency that make it popular in computer graphics to simulate complex interactions of multiple objects at the same time. Additionally, a useful feature of the MSM that differentiates it from other physics-based simulation is to be independent of force measurements that may not be available to a robotic framework lacking force/torque sensors. In this work, we design a method to estimate deformability based on certain properties, such as volume conservation. Using the finite element method (FEM) we create the ground truth deformability for various settings to evaluate our method. The experimental evaluation shows that our approach is able to accurately identify the deformability of test objects, supporting the value of MSM for robotic applications.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Financial and social elements of modern societies are closely connected to the cultivation of corn. Due to the massive production of corn, deficiencies during the cultivation process directly translate to major financial losses. The early detection and treatment of crops deficiencies is thus a task of great significance. Towards an automated health condition assessment, this study introduces a scheme for the computation of plant health indices. Based on the 3D reconstruction of small batches of corn plants, an alternative to existing cumbersome Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation methodologies is presented. The use of 3D models provides an elevated information content, when compared to planar methods, mainly due to the reduced loss attributed to leaf occlusions. High resolution images of corn stalks are collected and used to obtain 3D models of plants of interest. Based on the extracted 3D point clouds, an accurate calculation of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the plants is performed. An experimental validation (using artificially made corn plants used as ground truth of the LAI estimation), emulating real world scenarios, supports the efficacy of the proposed methodology. The conclusions of this work, suggest a fully automated scheme for information gathering in modern farms capable of replacing current labor intensive procedures, thus greatly impacting the timely detection of crop deficiencies.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new numeric estimation for dynamic performance of fully-actuated UAV platforms with nonparallel actuation mechanisms. Multi-rotor UAV designs with tilted rotors can achieve fully-actuated performance (net thrust that spans the 6-DoF force-torque space) by tilting the rotors in both cant and dihedral. These orthogonal rotations have different implications on the intrinsic stability of the platform. A numeric estimation of the multi-rotor performances is proposed with an optimization approach to configure the nonparallel thrusters with respect to desired tasks. The new model is applied to Purdues Dexterous Hexrotor UAV and CyPhy Works LVL 1 platform, to illustrate the multi-rotor estimation and optimization. Estimation of these fully-actuated UAVs include precise physical interaction with the environment (Dexterous Hexrotor), hovering efficiency, and influence operating altitude. Experimental results are presented to validate the optimized result with a contact based force control task in preparation for a demo at the DOE Gaseous Diffusion Plant.",

Design guidelines for the robot hardware and software were based on query of clinicians, caregivers and older adults through focus groups, member checks and surveys, to identify what each group believed to be the most important daily activities for older adults to accomplish physically, mentally and socially. After data analysis, hydration and walking encouragement were found to be critical daily activities, becoming the focus of our deployments. The aim of the deployments was to understand the efficacy of human-robot interaction and identify ways to enhance the robot design and programming. Through observation of older adults interacting with the robot and post-interaction surveys filled out by the older adults, conclusions were drawn for further advancement of the robot development to be tested in future deployments. Results overall indicated high perceived usefulness and growing acceptance of the robot by older adults with increased interactions.",

In this paper, we examine how to utilize these MACROs and other mesh-like robots in large regular or semi-regular topologies. We evaluate axial strains and stiffness characteristics for a range of MACRO meshes created using different mesh-primitives, which are drawn from known regular space-filling lattice geometries. We then describe the implications of these results on the design of MACRO structures, including the tradeoffs between different primitives for various structural performance properties.",

The resulting modular architecture is based on FPGA modules that acquire data samples from off-the-shelf tactile sensors based on capacitive transducers and generate and transmit an event-driven readout. This architecture has been specifically implemented for integration on robots with a large number of tactile sensors, to reduce communication bandwidth, power and processing requirements. An asynchronous serial address-event representation protocol further optimises effective data transmission rate (efficiency of 94.1%) and latency (340 ns) with respect to more common transmission protocols (e.g., Ethernet, CAN). We propose two complementary algorithms for the translation of raw-data into events, optimising data rate and bandwidth, or exploiting the asynchronous nature of the event-driven encoding and the temporal information within the sensory signal. Data reduction capability can reach up to 20 % of the correspondent clock-based encoding, with limited information loss due to the compression.",

Modular robots offer a solution to this problem, since they can be reconfigured in various ways from a set of modules. The challenge of choosing the optimal composition for a given task, however, is hard since the search space of compositions is vast. Our approach addresses this problem: instead of finding the cost-optimal solution over all possible compositions individually, we propose a time-efficient composition synthesis method which uses evolutionary algorithms by taking task-related objectives into account. Simulations show that our algorithm finds the cost-optimal module composition with less computation time than other methods in the literature.",

        "abstract": "While solving inverse kinematics on serial kinematic chains is well researched, many methods still seem rather limited in jointly handling more complex geometries, including dexterous multi-finger hands or humanoid robots. In particular, object manipulation and motion tasks would benefit from the ability to define intermediate goals along the kinematic chains, such as an elbow position or wrist orientation. In this paper, we propose a fast hybrid evolutionary approach that is capable of solving inverse kinematics for multiple end effectors simultaneously, leaving high flexibility for specifying full-body postures with different objectives. Accurate solutions can be found in real-time and suboptimal extrema are robustly avoided. Our experimental results on the NASA Valkyrie and Shadow Dexterous Hand demonstrate that the algorithm is fast and can be efficiently applied for different robotic tasks which require flexible control of fully-constrained geometries.",

In this paper, large-scale exercise motion data obtained from a forearm-worn wearable sensor are classified with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Time-series data consisting of accelerometer and orientation measurements are formatted as images, allowing the CNN to automatically extract discriminative features. A comparative study on the effects of image formatting and different CNN architectures is also presented. The best performing configuration classifies 50 gym exercises with 92.1% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Accurate online estimation of the environment structure simultaneously with the robot pose is a key capability for autonomous robotic vehicles. Classical simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms make no assumptions about the configuration of the points in the environment, however, real world scenes have significant structure (ground planes, buildings, walls, ceilings, etc.) that can be exploited. In this paper, we introduce meta-structural information associated with geometric primitives into the estimation problem and analyze their effect on the global structural consistency of the resulting map. Although we only consider the effect of adding planar and orthogonality information for the estimation of 3D points in a Manhattan-like world, this framework can be extended to any type of geometric, kinematic, dynamic or even semantic information. We evaluate our approach on a city-like simulated environment. We highlight the advantages of the proposed solution over SLAM formulation considering no prior knowledge about the configuration of 3D points in the environment.",

        "abstract": "The requirement of flexibility in the modern industries demands robots that can be efficiently and quickly adapted to different tasks. A way to achieve such a flexible programming paradigm is to instruct robots with task goals and leave planning algorithms to deduct the correct sequence of actions to use in the specific context. A common approach is to connect the skills that realize a semantically defined operation in the planning domain - such as picking or placing an object - to specific executable functions. As a result the skills are treated as independent components, which results into suboptimal execution. In this paper we present an approach where the execution procedures and the planning domain are specified at the same time using solely extended Behavior Trees (eBT), a model formalized and discussed in this paper. At run-time, the robot can use the more abstract skills to plan a sequence using a PDDL planner, expand the sequence into a hierarchical tree, and re-organize it to optimize the time of execution and the use of resources. The optimization is demonstrated on a kitting operation in both simulation and lab environment, showing up to 20% save in the final execution time.",

The cross-wire assist device is a soft exosuit with four independently controllable actuators located around at hip joint, and selective actuation allows for the generation of internal/external rotational torque. Turning was most effectively induced using external rotation for the inside leg and internal rotation for the outside leg, which is a combination of human step turning strategy and `ipsilateral crossover' spin turning strategy. The degree of turning increased with applied force level, and multi-subject testing showed that the walking direction all subjects were capable of being modified (average 16.2 degree/m for 80 N); however, there was large variation between subjects.",

        "abstract": "Motor synergies are an important concept in human motor control. Through the co-activation of multiple muscles, complex motion involving many degrees-of-freedom can be generated. However, leveraging this concept in robotics typically entails using human data that may be incompatible for the kinematics of the robot. In this paper, our goal is to enable a robot to identify synergies for low-dimensional control using trial-and-error only. We discuss how synergies can be learned through latent space policy search and introduce an extension of the algorithm for the re-use of previously learned synergies for exploration. The application of the algorithm on a bimanual manipulation task for the Baxter robot shows that performance can be increased by reusing learned synergies intra-task when learning to lift objects. But the reuse of synergies between two tasks with different objects did not lead to a significant improvement.",

In this paper, we study the motion-based multi-sensor extrinsic calibration problem and point out an overlooked defect of traditional least squares estimation in this context. We present a novel calibration approach based-on the Gauss-Helmert estimation paradigm, together with a formulation for multi-sensor motion constraint. Our approach estimates not only the extrinsic parameters but also the pose observation errors, thus recovering the underlying sensor movements that exactly fulfill the motion constraints. Compared to traditional least squares approaches that estimate only the parameters, our approach is statistically optimal, thus is more accurate and robust. We implemented our approach and tested it on real robot. The experiments show that our approach is able to accurately determine the extrinsic configuration of each sensor and can largely improve the accuracy when the noise level is high.",

        "abstract": "Navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in mid-depth water column is notoriously challenging due to the lack of features for reference. In this paper, we propose a flow-aided cooperative navigation (FACON) strategy to improve the navigation performance of a team of AUVs when neither frequent surfacing nor persistent bottom-locking is available. Preloaded ocean current forecasts are referenced by each individual vehicle as it performs dead-reckoning with an inertial navigation system and measures relative current velocities during navigation. A marginalized particle filter is applied by each AUV to track its location, velocity, sensor biases, and local flow perturbation unresolved by the ocean forecast. Meanwhile, AUVs perform distributed cooperative localization based on relative pose measurements and asynchronized local communication when they enter the communication range of one another. Opportunistic information fusion among AUVs is realized through covariance intersection. The performance of the flow-aided navigation scheme of a single AUV is analyzed within a simulated experiment based on field test data. The feasibility of FACON is discussed through simulation in a turbulent, multi-gyre flow field.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents FROST, an open-source MATLAB toolkit for modeling, trajectory optimization and simulation of hybrid dynamical systems with a particular focus in dynamic locomotion. The design objective of FROST is to provide a unified software environment for developing model-based control and motion planning algorithms for robotic systems whose dynamics is hybrid in nature. In particular, FROST uses directed graphs to describe the underlying discrete structure of hybrid system models, which renders it capable of representing a wide variety of robotic systems. Equipped with a custom symbolic math toolbox in MATLAB using Wolfram Mathematica, one can rapidly prototype the mathematical model of robot kinematics and dynamics and generate optimized code of symbolic expressions to boost the speed of optimization and simulation in FROST. In favor of agile and dynamic behaviors, we utilize virtual constraint based motion planning and feedback controllers for robotic systems to exploit the full-order dynamics of the model. Moreover, FROST provides a fast and tractable framework for planning optimal trajectories of hybrid dynamical systems using advanced direct collocation algorithms. FROST has been successfully used to synthesize dynamic walking in multiple bipedal robots. Case studies of such applications are considered in this paper, wherein different types of walking gaits are generated for two specific humanoid robots and validated in simulation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new concept of building soft pneumatic structures by assembling modular units of fabric-based rotary actuators (FRAs) and beams. Upon pressurization, the inner folds of FRA would expand, which causes the FRA module to unfold, generating angular displacement. Hence, FRAs would enable mobility function of the structure and its range of motion. The modular nature of the actuator units enables customized configuration of pneumatic structures, which can be modified and scaled by selecting the appropriate modules. FRAs are also designed to be bladder-less, that is, they are made without an additional layer of inner bladder. Thus, a simple fabrication process can be used to prepare the actuators. In this paper, we studied how the performance of the FRA modules changes with their dimensions and demonstrated how a soft gripper can be constructed using these modules. The kinematic response of the actuator segments of the gripper was analyzed and a pressure control algorithm was developed to regulate the pneumatic pressure of the actuator. The modular based soft robotic gripper alone weighs about 140g. Yet, based on the grip tests, it is able to lift heavier objects (up to 2.4kg), achieving a high payload-to-weight ratio of about 1714%, which is higher than the value reported by previously developed soft pneumatic grippers using elastomeric materials. Lastly, we also demonstrated that the gripper is capable of performing two essential grasping modes, which are power grasping and fingertip grasping, for objects of various shapes.",

We provide a forward simulation model for predicting a plush robot's deformation behavior given some contractions of its internal winches.

To land properly, they will need to be aware of their relative body orientation during free fall and make appropriate adjustments. In this paper, we examine the sensing and actuation necessary for a mechanism to alter its fall under a high rate of spin. We also present a simple new robot, the Binary Robotic Inertially Controlled bricK (BRICK). This device combines information from an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a laser range-finder to track its orientation, and adjusts spin mid-flight by rapidly changing its moment of inertia between two states. An error analysis shows mechanical inaccuracies and uncertainty to be the largest source of variation. Nevertheless, our mechanism is able to fall from arbitrary heights, with arbitrary spin, and always land in a desired orientation.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of detecting fallen people lying on the floor by means of a mobile robot equipped with a 3D depth sensor. In the proposed algorithm, inspired by semantic segmentation techniques, the 3D scene is over-segmented into small patches. Fallen people are then detected by means of two SVM classifiers: the first one labels each patch, while the second one captures the spatial relations between them. This novel approach showed to be robust and fast. Indeed, thanks to the use of small patches, fallen people in real cluttered scenes with objects side by side are correctly detected. Moreover, the algorithm can be executed on a mobile robot fitted with a standard laptop making it possible to exploit the 2D environmental map built by the robot and the multiple points of view obtained during the robot navigation. Additionally, this algorithm is robust to illumination changes since it does not rely on RGB data but on depth data. All the methods have been thoroughly validated on the IASLAB-RGBD Fallen Person Dataset, which is published online as a further contribution. It consists of several static and dynamic sequences with 15 different people and 2 different environments.",

In contrast to proposal generators, our algorithm generates sparse regions, to combat image degradation caused by robot motion, making them more suitable for real-world operation. Furthermore, SDP is able achieve real-time performance (77 frames per second) on a single processor without a GPU. Our algorithm requires no training, and is designed to work with any pedestrian detection algorithm, provided that the input is in the form of a calibrated RGB-D image. We tested our algorithm with four state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors (HOG and SVM [1], Aggregate Channel Features [2], Checkerboards [3], and R-CNN [4]), and show that it improves computation time by up to 30%, with no discernible change in accuracy.",

The combination of this design concept with additive manufacturing (AM) techniques provides huge potential for kinematics design, because of the ability to manufacture complex kinematic structures in one part with integrated adjustable functional elements, i.e. flexure hinges. Considering that there is sparse knowledge of thin-walled structures fabricated using additive manufacturing in current literature, it is obvious that the design of flexure hinge mechanisms for soft robotic applications is challenging today. Therefore, this paper describes software for simulation of plane flexure hinge structures based on investigations on the material characteristics of laser sintered polyamide, especially fatigue strength. Furthermore, the software enables automated design of these flexural structures (e.g. manipulator structures) as STL files, representing the standard interface to all additive manufacturing technologies.",

        "abstract": "The gap between our ability to collect interesting data and our ability to analyze these data is growing at an unprecedented rate. Recent algorithmic attempts to fill this gap have employed unsupervised tools to discover structure in data. Some of the most successful approaches have used probabilistic models to uncover latent thematic structure in discrete data. Despite the success of these models on textual data, they have not generalized as well to image data, in part because of the spatial and temporal structure that may exist in an image stream. We introduce a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that incorporates the ability of convolutional autoencoders to discover features from images that directly encode spatial information, within a Bayesian nonparametric topic model that discovers meaningful latent patterns within discrete data. By using this hybrid framework, we overcome the fundamental dependency of traditional topic models on rigidly hand-coded data representations, while simultaneously encoding spatial dependency in our topics without adding model complexity. We apply this model to the motivating application of high-level scene understanding and mission summarization for exploratory marine robots. Our experiments on a seafloor dataset collected by a marine robot show that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on the task of unsupervised seafloor terrain characterization.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel motion planning algorithm for pouring a liquid body from a source to a target container. Our approach uses a receding-horizon optimization strategy that considers liquid dynamics and various other constraints. To handle liquid dynamics without costly fluid simulations, we use a neural network to infer a set of key liquid-related parameters from the observation of the current liquid configuration. To train the neural network, we generate a dataset of successful pouring examples using stochastic optimization in a problem-specific search space. These parameters are then used in the objective function for trajectory optimization. Our feedback motion planner achieves real-time performance, and we observe a high success rate in our simulated 2D and 3D liquid pouring benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Learning complex robot manipulation policies for real-world objects is challenging, often requiring significant tuning within controlled environments. In this paper, we learn a manipulation model to execute tasks with multiple stages and variable structure, which typically are not suitable for most robot manipulation approaches. The model is learned from human demonstration using a tactile glove that measures both hand pose and contact forces. The tactile glove enables observation of visually latent changes in the scene, specifically the forces imposed to unlock the child-safety mechanisms of medicine bottles. From these observations, we learn an action planner through both a top-down stochastic grammar model (And-Or graph) to represent the compositional nature of the task sequence and a bottom-up discriminative model from the observed poses and forces. These two terms are combined during planning to select the next optimal action. We present a method for transferring this human-specific knowledge onto a robot platform and demonstrate that the robot can perform successful manipulations of unseen objects with similar task structure.",

A swarm of collaborating UAVs may prove more efficient and economically viable compared to other solutions. To identify the merits and limitations of a swarm intelligence approach to remote sensing, we propose here a decentralised multi-agent system for a field coverage and weed mapping problem, which is efficient, intrinsically robust and scalable to different group sizes. The proposed solution is based on a reinforced random walk with inhibition of return, where the information available from other agents (UAVs) is exploited to bias the individual motion pattern. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach under a variety of experimental conditions, accounting also for limited communication range and different routing protocols.",

This motor is comprised of a single cube stator with a through-hole, and a flexible coil spring inserted into the hole. The coil spring, which has a diameter of 10 mm and length of 200 mm, is translated by a vibration generated in the stator. A preload between the stator and the coil spring is important for improving the motor performance. The coil spring inserted into the stator hole generates the preload by expanding in a radial direction. We build a prototype flexible ultrasonic motor, and examine its basic performance parameters such as thrust force, velocity, response time, resolution and flexibility. To demonstrate flexibility, we show the stable thrust force and velocity even when the coil spring is bent to a bending radius of 15 mm.",

While many techniques have been developed for object detection, few are designed to detect arbitrary parts of objects or of the workspace. This paper presents CustomLandmarks, a flexible tool that lets non-roboticists build their own perceptual detectors for many kinds of landmarks. The system components include a simple 3D interface for specifying landmarks, a novel representation for landmarks, and an algorithm for locating landmarks in new scenes. We evaluate the system's detection performance through systematic experiments and by using the system to aid a PR2 robot with several manipulation tasks. Finally, we present a user study showing that novices to the system are able to understand and use CustomLandmarks quickly, creatively, and effectively.",

Due to its built-in compliance, flipping gait, and corkscrew gripper, it can autonomously climb up and down surfaces held at any angle relative to gravity and transition from one surface to another, without complex sensing or control. In this paper, we demonstrate the robot's ability to flip consistently over a flat Velcro surface and 2D Velcro track, where it reliably climbs vertically, upside down and back to a flat surface, completing all the interior transitions in-between.",

We modify the simplest walker (heavy torso, light legs) by incorporating a hip spring, a hip actuator, and a telescopic linear actuator. We consider two stability criteria: one-step dead-beat stabilization for full correction of disturbance in a single step and exponential orbital stabilization using discrete control Lyapunov function. Our findings are as follows: (1) Both control strategies have almost similar robustness as measured by the number of steps walked on stochastic terrain before failure, but both strategies are more robust for changing terrain with step down and less robust for step up. (2) One step dead-beat stabilization is more energy-efficient than exponential stabilization. (3) Control strategy for step up is to decrease foot placement or maintain push-off and for step down is to increase foot placement or decrease the push-off. However, it is most energy-efficient to use foot placement control for step up and push-off control for step down.",

It treats ZMP as an indirect manipulation variable rather than the control variable, and does not need to observe the acceleration. ZMP behavior is only constrained to approach the pivot foot during a step, so that the robot can flexibly accelerate itself. The most distinctive point to the previous methods is that the motion stability is guaranteed based on the capture point only at landing, which improves agility. The optimal input, i.e., the desired position of ZMP, is analytically obtained immediately from the current state of COM, time to land, and the desired landing position, so that it can be implemented with even less computation cost. Though the limitation of the supporting region is not explicitly taken into account, it is guaranteed that the desired ZMP is confined within the region based on its convexity.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we concern the problem of motion planning for a hexapod walking robot crawling in a semi-structured environment where a precise foot-tip positioning is necessary. We propose pipelined approach utilizing an RGB-D camera to perceive and map the forthcoming terrain in 2.5 D which is then processed for available foot-tip positions. The robot motion control is based on sampling-based planning to determine the most suitable leg supporting configurations for the individual body positions in the created terrain map. The individual body positions are connected into a roadmap with taking into account a feasibility of the robot transition between the individual configurations. The resulting trajectory is then planned in the created roadmap using a standard A* planner. The proposed method has been experimentally evaluated in the on-line and onboard setup with a real hexapod crawling robot. The herein reported results support feasibility of the proposed approach for a precise motion planning of small hexapod crawling robot in a semi-structured environment.",

        "abstract": "The presence of force feedback in medical instruments has been proven to reduce tissue damage. In order to provide force feedback, information about the interaction forces between the instrument and the environment must be known. Direct measurement of these forces by commercial sensors is not feasible due to space limitations. Thus, in this study we propose to estimate the interaction forces using strain measurements from Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. These measurements can also be used for shape sensing and as a result both force and shape can be sensed simultaneously. For force sensing two models are proposed and compared. The first is based on a Rigid Link approximation, while the second uses the Cosserat rod theory. The models are validated experimentally using a tendon-driven continuum manipulator that is subjected to forces at the tip. The force estimates from the models are compared to the measurements from a commercial force sensor. Mean absolute errors of 11.2 mN (6.9%) and 15.9 mN (8.3%) are observed for the Rigid Link model and Cosserat model, respectively.",

However, current manipulators are usually stiff position-controlled systems, generating the need to add compliance. In this work, we present Forward Dynamics Compliance Control (FDCC), a new threefold control concept that realizes Cartesian compliance through combining Admittance, Impedance and Force Control into one control strategy. We close the control loop only through a force-torque sensor, allowing a system independent and decoupled configuration of the end effector compliance. As a key component in FDCC, we leverage forward dynamics simulations of a virtual model to directly map Cartesian inputs to joint control commands, leading to excellent stability in singularities. Experiments on three different robotic manipulators verify the key advantages of this approach.",

        "abstract": "The traction force of any moving object on a floor is the frictional force between the object and the floor. Therefore, investigation of the frictional constraint is very important for such moving object on a floor as well as a biped walking robot. Conventionally, the study of frictional constraint of a biped robot was only constrained in translational slip, without considering rotational slip, which is important in actual biped walking. This is one of the causes the walking speed of biped robots lower than the one of human beings. In this paper, an evaluation method of frictional constraints for biped robots is proposed. The translational friction force and the twist frictional torque acting on the biped robot's sole are both deduced and verified for single support phase. First, based on a biped robot model, an approach to calculate the frictional force and torque is deduced as the quantitative expression of frictional constraint. Then, the experimental verification method is designed and the proposed calculation approach is confirmed. Finally, the consideration of the result of experiments is discussed. This approach is expected to be used for helping the realization of fast biped walkings.",

        "abstract": "Estimation of 3D object position is a crucial step for a variety of robotics and computer vision applications including 3D reconstruction and object manipulation. When working in microscale, new types of visual sensors are used such as Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Nowadays, micro- and nanomanipulation tasks, namely components assembly, are performed in teleoperated mode in most of the cases. Measuring object position and orientation is a crucial step towards automatic object handling. Current methods of pose estimation in SEM allow recovering full object movement using its computer-aided design (CAD) model. If the model is not known, most methods allow to estimate only in-plane translations and rotation around camera optical axis. In the literature, SEM is considered as a camera with parallel projection or an affine camera, which means image invariance to z-movement and bas-relief ambiguity. In this paper, authors address the problem of measuring full 3D rotation of the unknown scene for uncalibrated SEM without additional sensors. Rotations are estimated from image triplets by solving a spherical triangle from fundamental matrices only, without need of intrinsic calibration, allowing to avoid parallel projection ambiguities. The presented results, obtained in simulation and on real data, allow validating the proposed scheme.",

This paper introduces GOAT, the Gearless Omnidirectional Acceleration-vectoring Topology - a novel 3-DoF, 3-RSR leg topology combined with a direct-drive or quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation scheme to enable high fidelity proprioceptive force control and multi-modal mobility via high-energy, omni-directional jumping, running, and walking. GOAT's kinematics, mechanical design, actuation, drive electronics, and control algorithms are presented. Experimental results successfully demonstrate a mechanically robust GOAT leg performing a) explosive vertical jumping up to 82 cm b) landing using high fidelity virtual compliance and c) high-speed omnidirectional running/jumping trajectories while mounted on a test rig.",

        "abstract": "Point set registration is a long addressed problem in lots of pattern recognition tasks. This paper presents a robust point set registration algorithm based on optimization of distance between two probability distributions. A major problem encountered in the point to point algorithms is the definition of correspondence between two point sets. This paper follows the idea of some probability based point set registration methods and the point set is represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Through optimizing distance between the two GMMs, the rigid transformation (rotation and translation) between two point sets will be obtained while averting the trouble of finding correspondence. Previous studies used L2 distance, KL distance, etc. to measure similarity between two GMMs, the problem therein is the robustness to noise and outliers, especially when the covariance matrix is large or there exists local minimum. So in this work, the signature quadratic form distance is derived for the distribution similarity measurement. The contribution of this paper is as follows. First, we derive the signature quadratic form distance for GMMs similarity measurement. Second, the signature quadratic form distance is adopted to the point set registration algorithm. And performance of the proposed method compared with some existing widely used point set registration algorithms is also presented. Experimental results show precision and robustness of this algorithm. The results also demonstrate this algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art point set registration algorithms in terms of noise, outliers, partial structures and misalignment initialization, etc.",

        "abstract": "In many sensing and control applications, data are represented in the form of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Considering the underlying geometry of this data space can be beneficial in many robotics applications. In this paper, we present an extension of Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) with input and/or output data on SPD manifolds. As the covariance of SPD datapoints is a 4th-order tensor, we develop a method for parallel transport of high order covariances on SPD manifolds. The proposed approach is experimented in the context of prosthetic hands, with the estimation of wrist movements based on spatial covariance features computed from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals.",

This paper proposes an approach for estimating the orientation between a wearable IMU sensor and the body frame of the wearer using a simple and fast calibration procedure. The proposed approach uses the generalized Hebbian algorithm to incrementally estimate the axis aligned with gravity using acceleration measurements obtained during a static pose, and the axis perpendicular to the saggital plane using gyro measurements obtained during sagittal plane movements. An automated convergence criterion based on the sensor measurement variance is used. The proposed approach is tested in simulation and with human movement and demonstrates excellent and fast calibration performance.",

The efficiency and validity of the proposed parameter estimation and compensation scheme is proved through two experimental evaluations, one when step changes to the COG are applied and one tracking experiment where a compact aerial manipulator is attached to the multirotor and performs sweeping motions.",

However, current gait generation methods do not keep pace with the speed of physical reconfiguration. This work focuses on quickly creating gaits for modular legged robots. We build on a recent method that uses trajectory optimization to design quasi-static gaits given only robot geometry and foot contact patterns. We develop methods to automatically generate contact patterns for new gaits and transitions between them. We show the utility of these methods applied to robots with many limbs, such that limbs can be fluidly reassigned to locomotion, manipulation, or inspection tasks, or to adapt gaits to hardware failures online. We demonstrate gait and transition generation with our modular hexapod and dodecapod robots. The robots switch between gaits that use all limbs for locomotion and those that leave some limbs free to pick up objects or position a camera.",

Harnessing these, requires an understanding of the dynamics of the system, which can be gained using optimization-based methods. The result are motions which make optimal use of the intrinsic behavior, possibly exceeding the performance of an equivalent rigid-body robot. We present a collocation framework which enables both automatic computation of contact-switching patterns and allows the full utilization of the dynamics of the compliant system. The formulation also addresses the problem of redundant torque generation in viscoelastic actuators. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated in simulations as well as experiments with a compliant bipedal robot. The approach is capable of providing gait primitives, longer gait sequences containing multiple steps as well as generating extremely dynamic motions, e.g. somersaults.",

Previous work tackles this problem by exploiting various levels of features with multi-scale deep convolutional neural networks. However, most of the local geometric structure related monocular depth cues are lost when being propagated through convolutional neural network. Moreover, the error of depth cues related to local geometric structures is not considered in the loss function. In this work, we propose the GeoCueDepth convolutional neural network to exploit local geometric structure cues and propose a training loss that takes the geometric error into consideration, which significantly improve the performance of depth prediction in both accuracy and sharpness. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves 0.122 average relative error and 0.078 square relative error on the NYU Depth v2 data set, which outperforms state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation approaches.",

We use data augmentation to overcome the biases of the original dataset and apply transfer learning to adapt the model to new semantic labels in off-road environments. Finally, we fuse the visual and geometric features using a random forest to classify the terrain traversability into three classes: safe, risky and obstacle. We implement the algorithm on our four-wheeled robot and test it in novel environments including both urban and off-road scenes which are distinct from the training environments and under summer and winter conditions. We provide experimental result to show that our algorithm can perform accurate and fast prediction of terrain traversability in a mixture of environments with a small set of training data.",

It typically requires expert knowledge, does not generalize straightforwardly over different tasks and strongly influences the quality of the learned controller. In this paper, we present an autonomous feature construction method for learning low-dimensional manifolds of goal-relevant features jointly with an optimal controller using reinforcement learning. Our method combines information-theoretic algorithms with principal component analysis to performs a return-weighted reduction of the state representation. The method does not require any preprocessing of the data, does not assume strong restrictions on the state representation, and substantially improves the performance of learning by reducing the number of samples required. We show that our method can learn high quality controller in redundant spaces, even from pixels, and outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.",

A detailed study has been done to find out the different ways of implementing these constraints on the motion planner. CHOMP, which is a successful motion planner for articulated robots produces very fast and collision-free trajectories. This nature is important for a local path adaptor in a multi-vehicle path planning for resolving path-conflicts in a very fast manner and hence, CHOMP was adapted. Secondly, this paper also details the experimental integration of the modified CHOMP with the sensor fusion and control system of an autonomous Volvo FH-16 truck and a set of experiments conducted on a real-time environment. Finally, additional simulations were also conducted to compare the performance of the different approaches developed to study the feasibility of employing CHOMP to autonomous vehicles.",

We decouple the trajectory generation problem as front-end path searching and back-end trajectory refinement. Based on the map that is incrementally built onboard, we adopt a sampling-based informed path searching method to find a safe path passing through obstacles. We convert the path consists of line segments to an initial safe trajectory. An optimization-based method which minimizes the penalty of collision cost, smoothness and dynamical feasibility is used to refine the trajectory. Our method shows the ability to online generate smooth and dynamical feasible trajectories with safety guarantee. We integrate the state estimation, dense mapping and motion planning module into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform. We validate our proposed method by presenting fully autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered indoor and outdoor environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In pose graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, incorrect loop closures can seriously hinder optimizers from converging to correct solutions, significantly degrading both localization accuracy and map consistency. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance their robustness in the presence of numerous false-positive loop closures. Existing approaches tend to fail when working with very unreliable front-end systems, where the majority of inferred loop closures are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel middle layer, seamlessly embedded between front and back ends, to boost the robustness of the whole SLAM system. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: 1) the proposed middle layer offers a new mechanism to reliably detect and remove false-positive loop closures, even if they form the overwhelming majority; 2) artificial loop closures are automatically reconstructed and injected into pose graphs in the framework of an Extended Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, reinforcing reliable loop closures. The proposed algorithm alters the graph generated by the front-end and can then be optimized by any back-end system. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate significantly improved accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods and various back-ends, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

We propose a grasp quality measure fabricated for robotic harvesting in which picking a crop from its stem is desired. The proposed metric characterizes a suitable grasp configuration for systematically controlling the failure behavior of an object to break it at the desired location while avoiding damage on other areas. Our approach is based on failure task information and gripper wrench insertion capability. Failure task definition is accomplished using failure theories. Gripper wrench insertion capability is formulated by modeling the friction between the object and gripper. A new method inspired by human pre-manipulation process is introduced to utilize gripper itself as a friction measurement device. The provided friction model is capable of handling the anisotropic behavior of materials which is the case for fruits and vegetables. The evaluation method is formulated as a quasistatic grasp problem. Additionally, the general case of both fully-actuated and under-actuated grippers are considered. As a validation of the proposed evaluation method, experimental results for failing parts using Kuka Light-Weight Robot IV robot are presented.",

This method improves upon the results of a unsupervised feature learning approach that used similar tactile feedback. 1000 different grasps on 100 objects were used to train and test the network.

The hand is made of a non-stretchable thin film, the two ends of which are attached to a soft substrate, forming an enclosed wrinkled shape. When the substrate is elongated, the morphology of the hand changes varied, resulting in a \u201cwrapping\u201d form around the grasped object. This design is applicable to a wide range of objects that can be grasped by the robotic hand. The smallest and biggest sizes of the grasped object are determined by the morphological computation of the film during design of the hand. This design also reduces the uncertainty of position between the hand and the object; i.e., stable grasping can be maintained as long as the object fits within the enclosed form of the hand. A mechanism controlling the morphology of the film using only one actuator, and for grasping food products such as fruits, is proposed. Preliminary results show the potential of the hand's morphology in the design of soft robotic mechanisms.",

A range of dense mapping algorithms have recently been proposed, though few integrate inertial sensing. We build on ElasticFusion, a particularly elegant approach that fuses color and depth information directly into small surface patches called surfels. Traditional inertial integration happens at the level of camera motion, however, a pose graph is not available here. Instead, we present a novel approach that incorporates the gravity measurements directly into the map: Each surfel is annotated by a gravity measurement, and that measurement is updated with each new observation of the surfel. We use mesh deformation, the same mechanism used for loop closure in ElasticFusion, to enforce a consistent gravity direction among all the surfels. This eliminates drift in two degrees of freedom, avoiding the typical curving of maps that are particularly pronounced in long hallways, as we qualitatively show in the experimental evaluation.",

The third finger of HERI Hand is asymmetrically designed in terms of dimensions to emulate the functionality for combining middle finger, ring finger and little finger of a human hand. HERI Hand is equipped with three actuators devoted to the actuation of the flexion of the index finger and thumb, the flexion of the third finger and finally the thumb abduction and adduction motion with the latest drive having no interference with other transmissions. The proposed hand is capable of realizing delicate finger manipulation such as opening a lidded cup, which is super suitable to accomplish in such configuration. At the same time the hand demonstrates high grasping strength capacity thanks to the actuation sizing permitted by the under-actuated configuration. The hand is also equipped with tactile/pressure sensors distributed in the phalanxes, which leaves open the possibility of potential applications for sophisticated finger manipulations taking into account the phalanxes contact forces. Three different sets of experiments were carried out to demonstrate the performance of HERI Hand and validated its functionality.",

This makes it challenging to create compelling and realistic human-robot handshakes, necessitating the consideration of human haptic perception in the design of robot hands. At its most basic level, haptic perception is encoded by contact points and contact pressure distributions on the skin. This motivates our work on measuring the contact area and contact pressure in human handshaking interactions. We present two benchmarking experiments in this regard, measuring the contact locations in human-human/human-robot handshaking and the contact pressure distribution for handshakes with a sensorized palm. We present results from human studies with the benchmarking experiments, providing a baseline for comparison with robot hands as well as presenting new insights into human handshaking. We also show initial work in using these results for the evaluation of robot hands, and progressing towards iterative design of robot hands optimized for social hand interactions.",

In this paper, we propose a variant of Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network(LRCN) to detect road intersection. We call this network as IntersectNet. We pose road intersection detection as binary classification task over sequence of frames. The model combines deep hierarchical visual feature extractor with recurrent sequence model. The model is end to end trainable with capability of capturing the temporal dynamics of the system. We exploit this capability to identify road intersection in a sequence of temporally consistent images. The model has been rigorously trained and tested on various different datasets. We think that our findings could be useful to model behavior of autonomous agent in the real-world.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a generic framework for field surveillance using consumer rotorcrafts and ground vehicles. Building such an autonomous system comes with two key challenges in persistent perception and obstacle avoidance. We begin with explaining two core algorithms to solve the challenges: an auto-landing algorithm that enables a quadrotor to land on a moving ground vehicle at a speed of 6.00 m/s, and an obstacle avoidance algorithm that ensures the safety of the quadrotor during searching process. On the basis of these algorithms, the architecture and infrastructure of Hawkeye framework are presented as well. Hawkeye is designed to be a generic platform with extensibility that allows integration of other domain applications. We demonstrate the potential of Hawkeye framework in a simulated agriculture monitoring mission and report its performance at the end of the paper.",

In this paper we propose a novel BoVW-based technique which additionally incorporates the operational environment's structure into the description, treating bunches of visual words with similar optical flow measurements as single similarity votes. The presented experimental results prove that our method offers superior loop closure detection accuracy while still ensuring real-time performance, even in the case of a low power consuming mobile device.",

        "abstract": "The traditional programming method for industrial robots is teaching by demonstration with a joystick or teaching pendant. However, high precision welding, machining, painting or thermal spraying, and other tasks require pre-computed trajectories, since an operator would not be able to accurately guide the manipulator and achieve suitable results. Giving the CAD model of a 3-D freeform surface, and the operating parameters of the task, this paper describes the methodology and steps involved in off-line programming for automatic trajectory generation. The computed waypoints comprise position, orientation, manipulator's end-effector velocities, and accelerations. This work describes the software platform employed for simulation, surface sampling, the use of radial basis function (RBF) for surface modelling, and intersection of surfaces (marching method) to generate paths. The case study for the developed method is the EMMA project\u2217, a robotic system for in situ high velocity oxy-fuel coating (HVOF) of hydraulic turbine blades. The results highlight the efficacy of the method and the impact of the solution for similar problems.",

But most humanoid robots support their body only in the foot and they use their hand just to manipulate objects because their hands are too weak to support their body. Strong hands are supposed to enable humanoid robots to act in much broader scene. Therefore, we developed new life-size five-fingered hand that can support the body of life-size humanoid robot. It is tendon-driven and underactuated hand and actuators in forearms produce large gripping force. This hand has flexible joints using machined springs, which can be designed integrally with the attachment. Thus, it has both structural strength and impact resistance in spite of small size. As other characteristics, this hand has force sensors to measure external force and the fingers can be flexed along objects though the number of actuators to flex fingers is less than that of fingers. We installed the developed hand on musculoskeletal humanoid \u201cKengoro\u201d and achieved two self-weight supporting motions: push-up motion and dangling motion.",

Therefore, the authors developed a portable robot with a main processor, actuators, motor drivers, a force sensor, and a touch display to assist such high-frequency training at home. To recover the motor function of the upper limbs by voluntary movement, this robot instructs the joint motion based on the force input. Therefore, this study proposes a force control algorithm for the omni-wheel mechanism and a method that estimates the odometry of the omni-wheel mechanism based on the circuit equation of the DC motor without rotary encoders. Moreover, a method that estimates integrated electromyograph patterns based on the force and movement of the robot using a multiple linear regression model is proposed for the evaluation of co-operative movement. The effectiveness of these proposed methods were confirmed by evaluation experiments.",

Until recently, it was difficult to perform the same in human-robot cooperation due to the lack of large-scale tactile systems functionally similar to a human skin. Our approach consists in transforming measurements of sensors distributed on the robot body into a convenient 2D representation of the contact shape, i.e., a contact image, then applying image classification techniques in order to discriminate a human touch from unexpected collisions. Experiments have been performed on a robotic skin composed of 768 pressure sensors integrated on a Baxter robot forearm. More than 1800 contact images have been generated from 43 different persons for training and testing two machine learning algorithms: Bag of Visual Words and Convolutional Neural Networks. The experimental results show that both approaches are valid, obtaining a classification accuracy higher than 96%.",

        "abstract": "The human forearm is composed of two long, thin bones called the radius and the ulna, and rotates using two axle joints. We aimed to develop a forearm based on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance of the human body in order to bring out its benefits. For this, we need to miniaturize the muscle modules. To approach this task, we arranged two muscle motors inside one muscle module, and used the space effectively by utilizing common parts. In addition, we enabled the muscle module to also be used as the bone structure. Moreover, we used miniature motors and developed a way to dissipate the motor heat to the bone structure. Through these approaches, we succeeded in developing a forearm with a radioulnar joint based on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance of the human body, while keeping maintainability and reliability. Also, we performed some motions such as soldering, opening a book, turning a screw, and badminton swinging using the benefits of the radioulnar structure, which have not been discussed before, and verified that Kengoro can realize skillful motions using the radioulnar joint like a human.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new algorithm for human motion estimation using inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements. We model the joints by matrix Lie groups, namely the special orthogonal groups SO(2) and SO(3), representing rotations in 2D and 3D space, respectively. The state space is defined by the Cartesian product of the rotation groups and their velocities and accelerations, given a kinematic model of the articulated body. In order to estimate the state, we propose the Lie Group Extended Kalman Filter (LG-EKF), thus explicitly accounting for the non-Euclidean geometry of the state space, and we derive the LG-EKF recursion for articulated motion estimation based on IMU measurements. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the EKF based on Euler angle parametrization in both simulation and real-world experiments. The results show that for motion near gimbal lock regions, which is common for shoulder movement, the proposed filter is a significant improvement over the Euler angles EKF.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of mixed initiative, shared control for master-slave grasping and manipulation. We propose a novel system, in which an autonomous agent assists a human in teleoperating a remote slave arm/gripper, using a haptic master device. Our system is designed to exploit the human operator's expertise in selecting stable grasps (still an open research topic in autonomous robotics). Meanwhile, a-priori knowledge of: i) the slave robot kinematics, and ii) the desired post-grasp manipulative trajectory, are fed to an autonomous agent which transmits force cues to the human, to encourage maximally manipulable grasp pose selections. Specifically, the autonomous agent provides force cues to the human, during the reach-to-grasp phase, which encourage the human to select grasp poses which maximise manipulation capability during the post-grasp object manipulation phase. We introduce a task-oriented velocity manipulability cost function (TOV), which is used to identify the maximum kinematic capability of a manipulator during post-grasp motions, and feed this back as force cues to the human during the pre-grasp phase. We show that grasps which minimise TOV result in significantly reduced control effort of the manipulator, compared to other feasible grasps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experiments with both real and simulated robots.",

        "abstract": "Automated assembly, especially peg-in-hole insertion, is a common task in manufacturing. In particular, the high-precision assembly is achieved by high-precision manipulator and sensing system. However, uncertainty and various parts for assembly are still challenges for robotic assembly, especially for low-precision robot and sensors. It is noteworthy that human can implement assembly tasks although the precision of the arm and hand is not comparable with a common industrial robot, in which process compliance is the key characteristic of their motion. In this paper, we present a human-inspired compliant strategy for peg-in-hole assembly task using the environmental constraint and coarse force information. In the proposed strategy, a constraint region is designed for motion planning and utilized for eliminating the uncertainty of the initial positioning error of the peg. Force sensor is applied to sense the contact force of which the direction is used to adjust the movement of the peg. Therefore, high-precision sensor is not necessarily required. Inspired by human compliant assembly, a from coarse to fine adjustment strategy is executed. The contribution of our strategy is that high precision assembly task can be solved by low precision system. The constraint region and force guided directional adjustment have increased the robustness of the system. The strategy is carried out in simulation for round peg-in-hole assembly task. The experimental results show that the assembly task can be successfully completed and demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy.",

Combined with the use of model-based residual signals, this approach allows efficient detection of contact points on the robot with simultaneous estimation of the exchanged contact forces. When the robot is kinematically redundant for the original task and undergoes a physical contact, a control scheme accommodates collaboration trying to preserve task execution, or reacts by abandoning the task if the estimated contact forces exceed some safety threshold.

        "abstract": "Wearable robotic systems which aid or enhance human performance are the subject of substantial ongoing research efforts. Soft exosuits to assist with walking represent one class of system that leverage textiles and apparel to provide a lightweight and nonrestrictive means to interface to the lower extremity and apply assistive joint torques via a cable that applies a force across a biological joint. Current embodiments of the soft exosuit use off-the-shelf load cells attached to the distal end of a Bowden cable to measure and control the delivered force. As these systems evolve, we envision replacing all rigid components with compliant, textile-based components. Here we present a new force sensing concept suitable for exosuit applications. The approach is based on micro-machined carbon fiber composite structures encapsulated in elastomer materials as the transducer element, and high-strength, stiff textiles as the load bearing element. The transduction mechanism uses the Poisson effect in the encapsulating elastomer to create electrical contact between the carbon fiber structures. This method allows the sensor to be sensitive in tension while remaining insensitive to bending deformation. We fabricate a prototype sensor capable of detected forces up to 300 N, yet weighing just 2.15 g. The compliant nature of the materials used in fabrication allow the sensor to be flexible. The sensor output is qualitatively very repeatable, yet exhibits moderate drift at peak load. However this drift begins to stabilize over the test duration. These preliminary results demonstrate the promising potential of this sensor technology for soft exosuit systems.",

        "abstract": "Modern autonomous systems such as driverless vehicles need to safely operate in a wide range of conditions. A potential solution is to employ a hybrid systems approach, where safety is guaranteed in each individual mode within the system. This offsets complexity and responsibility from the individual controllers onto the complexity of determining discrete mode transitions. In this work we propose an efficient framework based on recursive neural networks and coreset data summarization to learn the transitions between an arbitrary number of controller modes that can have arbitrary complexity. Our approach allows us to efficiently gather annotation data from the large-scale datasets that are required to train such hybrid nonlinear systems to be safe under all operating conditions, favoring underexplored parts of the data. We demonstrate the construction of the embedding, and efficient detection of switching points for autonomous and non-autonomous car data. We further show how our approach enables efficient sampling of training data, to further improve either our embedding or the controllers.",

        "abstract": "Trajectory optimization is a fundamental problem in robotics. While optimization of continuous control trajectories is well developed, many applications require both discrete and continuous, i.e. hybrid controls. Finding an optimal sequence of hybrid controls is challenging due to the exponential explosion of discrete control combinations. Our method, based on Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), circumvents this problem by incorporating discrete actions inside DDP: we first optimize continuous mixtures of discrete actions, and, subsequently force the mixtures into fully discrete actions. Moreover, we show how our approach can be extended to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) for trajectory planning under uncertainty. We validate the approach in a car driving problem where the robot has to switch discrete gears and in a box pushing application where the robot can switch the side of the box to push. The pose and the friction parameters of the pushed box are initially unknown and only indirectly observable.",

In this work, an upper limb exoskeleton with seven degrees of freedom provides haptic guidance to the user enhancing accuracy of the target position and constant thrust force during drilling tasks. Therefore, an inverse kinematics algorithm is introduced using selective damping, depending on joint velocities to minimize the end effector position error for redundant systems. Additionally, the method recognizes user intention with structurally integrated torque sensors for null space optimization. An implicit, hybrid force-position controller is implemented to perform position controlled drilling tasks with constant thrust force. The performance evaluation with the exoskeleton shows a maximum position error of 1.27 mm and steady-state thrust force response with a maximum overshoot of 1N.",

        "abstract": "In current approaches to combined task and motion planning, usually symbolic planning and sampling based motion-planning are integrated. One problem is here to come up with good samples. We address the problem of identifying useful poses for a robot close to working surfaces such as tables or shelves. Our approach is based on reachability inversion which answers the question: where should the robot be located in order to reach a certain object? We extend the concept from point-based objects to flat polygonal surfaces in order to enable the robot to have a a good grasping position for many objects. Our approach allows to quickly sample multiple distinct poses for the robot from an prior computed distribution. Further we show how sampling from an inverse reachability distribution can be integrated into a CTAMP system.",

The approach computes a domain that should contain the actual robot pose, assuming bounded image measurement errors and landmark position uncertainty. It relies on interval analysis and constraint propagation techniques to rigorously back-propagate the errors through the non-linear observation model. Attitude information from onboard sensors is merged with image observations to reduce the pose uncertainty domain, along with prediction based on velocity measurements. As tracking landmarks in the image is prone to errors, the proposed method also enable fault detection from measurement inconsistencies. This method is tested using a quadcopter UAV with an onboard camera.",

In this paper, we proposed an Image-Based Visual Servoing(IBVS) method for arbitrary planar path following using features directly presented in image space as feedbacks. During experiments we found that IBVS guarantees convergence while not requiring camera calibrations. Furthermore, the proposed path following method is intuitive and flexible, and provides great potentials in various applications.",

The coupler between the actuator and reference has the effect of further reducing the impedance apparent to the environment. Unlike traditional series elastic actuation, where the deformation of a physical spring coupler introduced between an actuator and link is fed back for control, our coupler is located between actuator and reference and its deformation is not fed back for control. The proposed control further employs time-delay estimation to account for the system dynamics that include both the physical and virtual couplers and to realize accurate and robust control over end-effector position and contact forces. We present a simple method for estimating interaction forces and regulating the contact force without a priori knowledge of the environment. A numerical simulation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The use of concentric tube robots has recognized advantages for accessing target lesions while conforming to certain anatomical constraints. However, their complex kinematics makes their safe telemanipulation in convoluted anatomy a challenging task. Collaborative control schemes, which guide the operator through haptic and visual feedback, can simplify this task and reduce the cognitive burden of the operator. Guaranteeing stable, collision-free robot configurations during manipulation, however, is computationally demanding and, until now, either required long periods of pre-computation time or distributed computing clusters. Furthermore, the operator is often presented with guidance paths which have to be followed approximately. This paper presents a heterogeneous (CPU/GPU) computing approach to enable rapid workspace analysis on a single computer. The method is used in a new navigation scheme that guides the robot operator towards locations of high dexterity or manipulability of the robot. Under this guidance scheme, the user can make informed decisions and maintain full control of the path planning and manipulation processes, with intuitive visual feedback on when the robot's limitations are being reached.",

In this paper, we describe a new design of GelSight for robot gripper, using a Lambertian membrane and new illumination system, which gives greatly improved geometric accuracy while retaining the compact size. We demonstrate its use in measuring surface normals and reconstructing height maps using photometric stereo. We also use it for the task of slip detection, using a combination of information about relative motions on the membrane surface and the shear distortions. Using a robotic arm and a set of 37 everyday objects with varied properties, we find that the sensor can detect translational and rotational slip in general cases, and can be used to improve the stability of the grasp.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a design and control approach of a modular off-board actuation system with mono-articular hip exosuit, enabling the instantaneous assistive profile modification of magnitude, shape, and timing. The off-board system consists an actuation unit with two degrees of freedom that can transmit forces to our soft exosuit via Bowden cables. To perform accurate force tracking and cable slack management, we implemented a switching admittance-position control approach that utilizes the advantages of both admittance and position control. In particular, feedforward models (FFMs) are added to the admittance control to compensate variability of individual kinematics, nonlinear hip exosuit stiffness and actuator transmission loss to enable a more accurate force tracking. This system allows us to track force profiles accurately and robustly under normal walking or jogging speed. The performance of force tracking was evaluated on three subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s with various magnitude, shape, and timings of assistive profiles and jogging on a treadmill at 2.3 m/s with varied magnitude of a representative assistance profile. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across different profiles. In case of walking experiments, the errors of the magnitude, RMS-E, and timing were within 2.0 N, 8.4 N, and 1.8% when varying the magnitude, shape, and timing respectively. In case of jogging experiments, the RMS-E was within 3.0 N. This system will be used for future research examining how to individualize assistive profiles for different wearers during walking and jogging.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For certain manipulation tasks, object pose estimation from head-mounted cameras may not be sufficiently accurate. This is at least in part due to our inability to perfectly calibrate the coordinate frames of today's high degree of freedom robot arms that link the head to the end-effectors. We present a novel framework combining pre-touch sensing and deep learning to more accurately estimate pose in an efficient manner. The use of pre-touch sensing allows our method to localize the object directly with respect to the robot's end effector, thereby avoiding error caused by miscalibration of the arms. Instead of requiring the robot to scan the entire object with its pre-touch sensor, we use a deep neural network to detect object regions that contain distinctive geometric features. By focusing pre-touch sensing on these regions, the robot can more efficiently gather the information necessary to adjust its original pose estimate. Our region detection network was trained using a new dataset containing objects of widely varying geometries and has been labeled in a scalable fashion that is free from human bias. This dataset is applicable to any task that involves a pre-touch sensor gathering geometric information, and has been made publicly available. We evaluate our framework by having the robot re-estimate the pose of a number of objects of varying geometries. Compared to two simpler region proposal methods, we find that our deep neural network performs significantly better. In addition, we find that after a sequence of scans, objects can typically be localized to within 0.5 cm of their true position. We also observe that the original pose estimate can often be significantly improved after collecting a single quick scan.",

        "abstract": "The place recognition problem comprises two distinct subproblems; recognizing a specific location in the world (\u201cspecific\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d place recognition) and recognizing the type of place (place categorization). Both are important competencies for mobile robots and have each received significant attention in the robotics and computer vision community, but usually as separate areas of investigation. In this paper, we leverage the powerful complementary nature of place recognition and place categorization processes to create a new hybrid place recognition system that uses place context to inform place recognition. We show that semantic place categorization creates an informative natural segmenting of physical space that in turn enables significantly better place recognition performance in comparison to existing techniques. In particular, this new semantically-informed approach adds robustness to significant local changes within the environment, such as transitioning between indoor and outdoor environments or between dark and light rooms in a house, complementing the capabilities of current condition-invariant techniques that are robust to globally consistent change (such as day to night cycles). We perform experiments using 4 novel benchmark datasets and show that semantically-informed place recognition outperforms the previous state-of-the-art systems. Like it does for object recognition [1], we believe that semantics can play a key role in boosting conventional place recognition and navigation performance for robotic systems.",

This paper proposed a Recurrent Neural Network based controller to address two problems: 1) improving control precision, 2) increasing adaptiveness for robot motion (explained in Section I). RNN was adopted in this work mainly because 1) the problem formulation naturally matches RNN structure, 2) RNN has advantages as an biologically inspired method. The proposed method was explained in detail and analysis shows that the proposed method is able to dynamically regulate outputs to increase the adaptiveness and the control precision. This paper uses Raven II surgical robot as an example to show the application of the proposed method, and the numeral simulation results from the proposed method and three other controllers show that the proposed method has improved precision, improved high robustness against noise and increased movement smoothness, and it keeps the manipulator links as far away as possible from physical boundaries, which potentially increases surgical safety and leads to improved surgical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring safety is a primary goal in physical human-robot interaction. In various collision experiments it was found that the robot's effective mass, velocity, and geometry are the key parameters which influence the human injury severity during an impact. Recently, a velocity controller was proposed that limits the robot speed to a biomechanically safe value, taking into account the mass and the curvature in the direction of movement for a given point of interest. The mass and the geometry depend on the mechanical design, however, the effective mass also depends on the robot configuration. In this paper, we exploit the redundant degree(s) of freedom of a joint torque controlled seven- and eight-DOF robot to minimize the effective mass without affecting the desired Cartesian end-effector trajectory and with the goal to improve the performance of the safe velocity controller at the same time. Given recent results in robotics injury analysis, we analyze when such a redundancy resolution scheme actually improves safety. For the considered robots, we find reflected mass extrema that can be obtained by null space motions, and propose a real-time, torque-based redundancy resolution scheme, which is finally verified in experiments.",

        "abstract": "In the physical human-robot interaction system, improving transparency performance which allows humans to move as if there is no robot is a challenging topic. In general physical human-robot interaction, the multiaxial force sensor is used to control the robot. However the signal measured from the force sensor involves not only the force applied to the robot by the human motion intention but also the influence of the natural force feedback between the robot and the human hand due to the motion of the robot. Therefore, in order to improve the transparency performance, it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the human hand as well as the dynamics of the robot. In this paper, an novel algorithm to improve transparency performance is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses only the multiaxial force sensor and compensates the natural force feedback by using the human hand impedance and further improves the transparency performance which has a limitation adjusting admittance parameters. The validity of the proposed algorithm is described through the system model analysis and the experiment using the hydraulic upper limb exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Automatically correlating plant observable characteristics to their underlying genetics will streamline selection methods in plant breeding. Measurement of plant observable characteristics is called phenotyping, and knowing plant phenotypes accurately and throughout a plant's growth is central to making breeding decisions. In-field plant phenotyping in an automated and noninvasive manner is hence crucial to accelerating plant breeding methods. However, most of the existing methods on plant phenotyping using visual imaging are confined to controlled greenhouse environments. This paper presents an automated method of mapping 2D images collected in an outdoor sorghum field to segmented 3D plant units that are of interest for phenotyping. This method leverages multiple horizontal and vertical viewpoints while capturing 2D images from a robotic platform so as to generate in-field 3D reconstructions of the sorghum plant. We develop and quantitatively evaluate segmentation methods on these 3D reconstructions and also compare against reconstructions obtained from a controlled greenhouse environment. We present analysis that contrasts the role of purely local geometric features and the effect of addition of global context in both datasets. This work furthers capabilities of in-field phenotyping which paves the way forward for plant biologists to study the coupled effect of genetics and environment on improving crop yields.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new teleoperated spherical tensegrity robot capable of performing locomotion on steep inclined surfaces. With a novel control scheme centered around the simultaneous actuation of multiple cables, the robot demonstrates robust climbing on inclined surfaces in hardware experiments and speeds significantly faster than previous spherical tensegrity models. This robot is an improvement over other iterations in the TT-series and the first tensegrity to achieve reliable locomotion on inclined surfaces of up to 24\u00b0. We analyze locomotion in simulation and hardware under single and multi-cable actuation, and introduce two novel multi-cable actuation policies, suited for steep incline climbing and speed, respectively. We propose compelling justifications for the increased dynamic ability of the robot and motivate development of optimization algorithms able to take advantage of the robot's increased control authority.",

The key information for these tasks lies on semantic labels of the scene parts and the motion trajectories of the dynamic objects. In this work, we propose a method that segments the 3D feature trajectories based on their motion behaviours, and assigns them semantic labels using 2D-to-3D label transfer. These feature trajectories are constructed by using the proposed trajectory recovery algorithm which takes the loss of feature tracking into account. We introduce a complete framework for static-map and dynamic objects' reconstruction, as well as semantic scene understanding for a calibrated and moving 2D-3D camera setup. Our motion segmentation approach is faster by two orders of magnitude, while performing better than the state-of-the-art 3D motion segmentation methods, and successfully handles the previously discarded incomplete trajectory scenarios.",

        "abstract": "We wish to minimize the information that a robot maintains to carry out its task. Filters are one way to keep stored state consistent with sensed values, though they may also capture some information about the structure of the world that the robot inhabits. This paper builds on prior work on (improper) filter minimization, but considers a new way to characterize structure in the world. By introducing a probabilistic model, one can define a notion of expected distance between two filters. Then, with such a measure, we pose the question of optimal lossy compression in the sense of having minimal expected distance. The problem retains the NP-hardness of the non-probabilistic worst-case minimization and, consequently, in this paper we focus on developing an effective heuristic algorithm. Our results illustrate that, in settings where the probabilities describe evolution of the world's state, the algorithm can do substantially better than existing worst-case minimization techniques oblivious to such structure.",

We introduce an algorithmic framework to model qualitative information as quantitative constraints on and between states. Our approach, named Sequentially Constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, integrates Hamiltonian dynamics into Sequentially Constrained Monte Carlo sampling. We are able to generate samples that satisfy arbitrarily complex, non-smooth and discontinuous constraints, which in turn allows us to support a wide range of qualitative information. We evaluate our approach for constrained sampling qualitatively and quantitatively with several classes of constraints. SCHMC significantly outperforms the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method) and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, in terms of both the accuracy of the sampling (for satisfying constraints) and the quality of approximation. Compared to Sequentially Constrained Monte Carlo (SCMC), which supports similar kinds of constraints, our SCHMC approach has faster convergence rates and lower parameter sensitivity.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Industrial robotic manipulators can be augmented by a micro-positioning unit in order to increase their precision resulting in a so called macro-micro-manipulator. The micro-positioning unit is typically driven by piezoelectric actuators due to their beneficial properties. However, contact forces during interaction tasks induce deviations from the nominal path that can not be observed due to compliance, lack of sensors in the micro-positioning unit, or unknown interaction dynamics in constrained environments. In this paper, a model-free and decoupled disturbance rejection controller via visual feedback for macro-micro-manipulators is presented. An external stereoscopic vision system is employed to detect deviations from the nominal trajectory. We outline an image segmentation algorithm and the utilized camera calibration technique is based on two-view geometry. Afterwards, the disturbance rejection controller including visual feedback for the macro-micro-manipulator is described. In order to demonstrate the 3D capability of the proposed approach, a microscopic staircase is milled. For comparison, the milling experiment is executed without and with active disturbance rejection by the micro-positioning unit in order to show the increase in precision during the milling task. Results show that the arithmetic mean roughness falls below 2 \u03bcm for the step profiles and the maximum surface height deviation is less than \u00b110 \u03bcm for each steps.",

We present a novel paradigm for incrementally improving a robot's visual perception through active human-robot interaction. In this paradigm, the user introduces novel objects to the robot by means of pointing and voice commands. Given this information, the robot visually explores the object and adds images from it to re-train the perception module.

        "abstract": "We aim to automatically identify all individual leaves in a monocotyledon image. Leaf identification is one of key technologies to acquire plant phenotypes such as a leaf length, a leaf count, and a growth rate. However, it is challenging to identify individual leaves from a monocotyledonous plant image due to their complicated occlusion and similar colors. We adopt a graph-theoretical approach to overcome the leaf occlusion and the color similarity between leaves, and apply a combinatorial optimization technique to simultaneously identify all individual leaves based on local and global characteristics of plants. We propose a plant-wide global optimization to identify all true leaves in a plant, which is formulated as a minimum path cover problem that we call the phytomorphological graph reconstruction. A phytomorphological graph of a plant image is a graph reflecting the plant's structure and is constructed through a plant region extraction and a skeletonization. All candidate leaf paths in the graph are extracted and their leaf path likelihoods are computed from the graph, where the leaf path likelihood means a measure of similarity with true leaves. The candidate leaf paths and their path likelihoods are used in the graph reconstruction process in order to find an optimal subset of the leaf paths which are similar to true leaves and can restore the phytomorphological graph as completely as possible. Experiments show that our proposed system effectively identifies individual leaves from a single 2-dimensional image of rice plants, which enables us to take an accurate and efficient high-throughput measurement of phenotypes for plants.",

The strength of our approach is its simplicity and low runtime which allows for mobile processing applications. We consider scans of single floor, Manhattan-like indoor scenes for which our method creates metric room layouts by detecting walls and performing a subsequent reasoning about their neighborhood relations. The output of our method is a 3D BIM with hierarchical semantic annotations for individual rooms being refined by walls, ceilings, floors and doors. A variety of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our reconstruction results compare well to other state-of-art methods in both reconstruction quality as well as runtime.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a path following method for autonomous wheeled vehicles that combines iterative learning control (ILC) with nonlinear feedback linearization (FBL) to provide anticipatory control action based on stored path following errors over repeated driving trials. By implementing ILC in a fully feedback-linearized space, control corrections are applied to a transformed input, thus allowing for a single back-computation to the nonlinear vehicle's control input. Hence, the approach is comparatively easy to implement and also computationally inexpensive. We first outline the mathematical formulation for this control method and then describe field results from tests conducted by using an industrial-scale wheeled underground mining vehicle in a representative environment to demonstrate effectiveness.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Structure from motion algorithms have an inherent limitation that the reconstruction can only be determined up to the unknown scale factor. Modern mobile devices are equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which can be used for estimating the scale of the reconstruction. We propose a method that recovers the metric scale given inertial measurements and camera poses. In the process, we also perform a temporal and spatial alignment of the camera and the IMU. Therefore, our solution can be easily combined with any existing visual reconstruction software. The method can cope with noisy camera pose estimates, typically caused by motion blur or rolling shutter artifacts, via utilizing a Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother. Furthermore, the scale estimation is performed in the frequency domain, which provides more robustness to inaccurate sensor time stamps and noisy IMU samples than the previously used time domain representation. In contrast to previous methods, our approach has no parameters that need to be tuned for achieving a good performance. In the experiments, we show that the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in both accuracy and convergence speed of the scale estimate. The accuracy of the scale is around 1% from the ground truth depending on the recording. We also demonstrate that our method can improve the scale accuracy of the Project Tango's build-in motion tracking.",

        "abstract": "This paper revisits the formation control problem, whereby a team of mobile robots assemble and maintain a desired geometric shape. However, the types of shapes that are realizable by a given robot team depends directly on the sensing modalities of the individual robots. For example, rigidity-based approaches make use of distance measurements, and the idea is to restrict the motion of the robots so that all inter-robot distances are maintained, thereby ensuring purely rigid motion. Rather than distances, we notice that for certain sensor classes, such as monocular pinhole cameras, only relative angle measurements are available. To this end, we introduce the notion of shape-similar motions, which constitutes a class of angle preserving motions that also preserve the shape of the formation in the sense that rigid motions as well as uniform scalings are permissible. We construct the shape-similarity matrix, whose null-space captures angle preserving motions, and show that by restricting the dimension of the null-space, we can guarantee that motions of the formation preserve the shape. Lastly, we implement a shape-similar controller on a team of differential drive mobile robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Accurate insertion of fine needles is difficult due to needle deflection. Needle deflection in the lower abdomen is particularly complex, as the needle has to pass through various tissues. As the area of the bowel is dominant in lower abdominal insertion, it is important to analyze the deflection during bowel insertion and to control the needle to minimize deflection. Few studies have focused on bowel insertion. We performed a fundamental deflection analysis of needle insertion in the bowel. Moreover, we have proposed an insertion method for minimizing the needle deflection based on our analysis. First, we performed needle insertion at various insertion positions and insertion angles into the hollow-shaped bowel, and determined the trend of the needle deflection during bowel insertion. The results revealed that the needle deflection was increased due to an increase in insertion angle, and therefore insertion angle should be minimized as much as possible. However, during actual bowel needle insertion, there are many situations in which the ideal path cannot be selected due to the arrangement of the bowel loops. We proposed an insertion method that can eliminate the total needle deflections during bowel insertion by controlling the needle tip direction at the breaching of each bowel wall. The results suggest that the needle deflection can be minimized by selecting the insertion path in which the sum of each insertion angle is zero. We verified the results of this insertion method in multiple bowels in in vivo experiments, and showed that it has the potential to be used in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Beside the output-input hysteresis, the longitudinally loaded cables of medical robotics such as RAVEN II exhibit asymmetric saturated strain-load hysteresis loops. This study investigates modeling the hysteresis nonlinearities of these cables using a stop-operator based Prandtl-Ishlinskii (SPI) model that is integrated with a memoryless function. The stop-operator based model is employed to account for the hysteresis nonlinearities, while the memoryless function is introduced to characterize saturation and asymmetric effects. A numerical example is presented to compare the properties of the proposed model with the classic SPI model. The response of the suggested model was evaluated on the hysteresis properties of two different cables subjected to triangular harmonic input of 0 to 0.001 with 6.25 \u00d7 10-5 strain/s. The characterization error of the thick cable was found as 1.55 %, while the error was calculated as 1.25 % for the thin cable. The relative significance of the proposed model was further examined by comparing the measured data with the classic SPI model. The results showed that the classic model yields substantial characterization errors when the asymmetry and saturation effects of the strain-load hysteresis loops are ignored.",

The device consists of an array rigid coupling actuator and an array tactile sensor which configured sensor located on the top of actuator. The actuator includes a frame with rigid coupling made by silicone and a dielectric elastomer actuator(DEA). The movement of the DEA is transferred to touch pad via rigid coupling. Thus, it provides a soft, comport touch feeling and eliminates the danger of applying high voltage to the human skin. The actuator can work at a wide range frequency of 0\u2013150 Hz and produce sufficient force of 50 mN over the human hand threshold. The tactile sensor can measure the pressure, locate the objects and send the feedback signals to control the actuator. In this work, a 8\u00d712 haptic tactile display is made with high resolution. In addition, the high voltage signal processing also developed to generate variable 0\u20133.5 kV, and can control individual cell by using the dynamic scanning actuation algorithm. Then, it can display any shape such as a circle, a smile/sad face, a star, etc. In the future, we will build the \u201cemotion touch pad\u201d system which can transfer a person's emotion to another one via internet.",

        "abstract": "Kinematic redundancy is a characteristic and beneficial property in collaborative robots nowadays as it enhances the flexibility and dexterity of the system. While the robot is manipulating an object, it is often necessary to kinematically reconfigure the robot, for example, when it obstructs the human. For this, internal or so-called null space motions can be carried out which do not affect the main task. In general, it is desirable that the human coworker can anticipate how the robot will move at any time. However, for null space motions this is typically not the case as they are non-intuitive and not suitable for interaction. In this work, we develop intuitive null space interaction behaviors for redundant manipulators, where the human can easily guide the robot. We want to provide users with a tool, that is straightforward to implement and solves real-world problems effectively. Two practical applications for an eight- and ten-DOF robot demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

This paper adopts a human-aided perception paradigm and investigates alternative interactive segmentation methods to allow users to segment a target object or object part. Through a first user study (N=24) we compare four interactive segmentation methods and characterize the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. Next we develop a hybrid segmentation interface and integrate it into an end-to-end human-in-the-loop manipulation system. In a second user study (N=12) we compare the performance of this system to a direct gripper-control system that allows similar manipulation tasks to be performed in challenging scenes. We find that this system enables more efficient manipulation with a lower mental load on the user, while offering a similar task success rate.",

The planner finds such motions by growing a search tree in the combined space of collision-free and contact configurations. The planner reasons efficiently about the accumulated uncertainty by factoring the state in a belief over configuration and a fully observable contact state. We show the uncertainty-reducing capabilities of the planner on manipulation benchmark from the POMDP literature. The planner scales up to more complex problems like manipulation under uncertainty in seven-dimensional configuration space. We validate our planner in simulation and on a real robot.",

        "abstract": "Service robots are being developed as a solution for the implications associated with the aging population. They are intended to be operated by non-expert users and hence human friendly interaction abilities are preferred. Humans prefer to use voice instructions that include uncertain information, lexical symbols and notions instead of instructions with precise quantitative values. Hence, service robots must be capable of interpreting such instructions in human like manner. This paper proposes a method in order to navigate a service robot inside a domestic environment in human friendly manner by using voice instructions that include phrases with uncertain information associated with relative references such as \u201clarge table\u201d, \u201ctable left of the door\u201d and \u201ctable close to the door\u201d. A module called Relative Uncertainty Interpretation (RUI) module has been introduced in order to evaluate the relative references related uncertainties. The RUI module has been implemented by considering the natural tendencies of humans. Experiments have been carried out in an artificially created domestic environment and the results of the proposed system have been compared with the results of a user study in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.",

The current approach to designing a team is to divide the planning into a hierarchy by separating team coordination and task assignment - global planning - from task planning and execution - local planning. The global planner must make assumptions based on simplified models of dynamics and/or opponents, and as such certain conditions are assumed true when globally planning but are not always true at local execution time. In this paper, we describe several algorithms for intra-robot replanning that allow the individual robots to enable the conditions of their tasks. We then demonstrate improvements in task completion when the robots are capable of replanning their task(s) and their teammates' task(s) in a simplified robot soccer domain. We further show preliminary results on learning when to replan.",

In this work we investigate the use of the hydrostatic pressure feedback inside the inflatable actuation chambers to determine the normal and shear forces which are applied to the tip of the robot. For that purpose a nonlinear finite element model is derived and experimentally validated, showing a good approximation between experiment and simulation. The model is then used to derive descriptions for the normal and shear forces applied to the robot tip. The normal force estimation shows good results over the range of experimentally validated tip angles, while the shear force estimation shows good results for small tip deflection angles with an increasing error, with the tip orientation. The algorithm indicates good applicability to force control tasks as the forces are fast to compute.",

Using ensemble approaches for modeling and analyzing stochastic task allocation, we analyze the performance of the proposed strategy subject to different system parameters, and show how different design choices can facilitate early intrusion detection. We further evaluate the performance of our method in realistic scenarios through stochastic simulations for different team sizes.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the well-known problem of codependence between inverse dynamics torque and contact force in bimanual object manipulation is addressed. The common contact constraint, namely rigid grasping, is exploited to decompose the set of dynamics equations into two orthogonally decoupled sets. Subsequently, the inverse dynamics control is formulated in a sub-manifold that is independent of the contact force, leading to analytically correct solutions that do not need to resort to common approximations for the aforementioned codependence problem. The contact force is also analytically computed and, therefore, can be optimally distributed using the torque redundancy. Relying on this prediction is most significant in situations where a force sensor at the end-effector is not present or is faulty. Even in the availability of sensory data, the predicted force may be used to correct typically noisy or delayed when filtered measurements, resulting in improved robustness. Simulation experiments on a planar bimanual manipulation model are presented.",

        "abstract": "Subject of this paper is an industrial gantry robot with elastic behavior. To suppress residual vibrations command shaping filters are widely used. These filters, however, change the shape and duration of the originally commanded trajectory. Therefore, a command shaping filter is proposed which is based on the inverse model of the flexible robot dynamics. To that end, a planar dynamics model of the robot is derived which is suitable for control design. It captures the relevant dynamics of vibrations including the non-minimum phase characteristics. Based on the inverse dynamics, a feedforward filter for vibration suppression is developed. The tracking error due to filter delay is reduced compared to other command shaping techniques. The non-minimum phase properties of the flexible dynamics are avoided by using a virtual reference point for plant inversion. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed Inverse Model Command Shaper compared to other types of filters tuned for vibration suppression.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an investigation of human comfort with a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) through a study offering a comparison of comfort with a sUAV versus a ground vehicle. Current research on human comfort with sUAVs has been limited to a single previous study, which did not include free flight, and while ground vehicle distancing has been studied, it has never been directly compared to a sUAV. The novelty in the approach is the use of a motion capture room to achieve smooth trajectories and precise measurements, while conducting the first free flight study to compare human comfort after interaction with aerial versus ground vehicles (within subjects, N=16). These results will contribute to understanding of social, collaborative, and assistive robots, with implications for general human-robot interactions as they evolve to include aerial vehicles. Based on the reduced stress and distance (36.5cm or 1.2ft) for ground vehicles and increased stress and distance (65.5cm or 2.15ft) for sUAVs, it is recommended that studies be conducted to understand the implications of design features on comfort in interactions with sUAVs and how they differ from those with ground robots.",

        "abstract": "The buildup of inaccuracies from frequent and imperfect data averaging can negatively impact system behavior. One potential culprit is improper orientation averaging, such as when combining data from multiple sensors, or reconciling preferences from multiple agents. In practice, the currently prevalent methodology of averaging 2D orientations is that of adding orientation vectors, which minimizes the Euclidean (or chord) distance among the vectors, instead of the geodesic (or arc) distance, resulting in inaccurate or even entirely incorrect averages. While an arc-minimizing alternative exists, it is only defined for angle averaging, posing an issue if orientations also possess a meaningful magnitude within the domain. In this work, we present an iterative weighted 2D orientation arc-based averaging algorithm that minimizes squared arc-lengths between points, incorporates orientation magnitudes as weights, and allows for multiple equally valid averages to be produced whenever applicable. We compare a vector sum approach and the weighted arc-based approach as applied to collaborative transport with obstacle avoidance, and showcase the behavioral advantages of the arc-based weighted averaging.",

        "abstract": "Stereo vision is commonly used for local obstacle avoidance of autonomous mobile robots: stereo images are first processed to yield a dense 3D reconstruction of the observed scene, which is then used for navigation planning. Such an approach, which we term Sequential Perception and Planning (SPP), results in significant unnecessary computations as the navigation planner only needs to explore a small part of the scene to compute the shortest obstacle-free path. In this paper, we introduce an approach to Joint Perception and Planning (JPP) using stereo vision, which performs disparity checks on demand, only as necessary while searching on a planning graph. Furthermore, obstacle checks for navigation planning do not require full 3D reconstruction: we present in this paper how obstacle queries can be decomposed into a sequence of confident positive stereo matches and confident negative stereo matches, which are significantly faster to compute than the exact depth of points. The resulting complete JPP formulation is significantly faster than SPP, while still maintaining correctness of planning. We also show how the JPP works with different planners, including search-based and sampling-based planners. We present extensive experimental results from real robot data and simulation experiments, demonstrating that the JPP requires less than 10% of the disparity computations required by SPP.",

To this end, we present a novel deep learning based framework that estimates depth, surface normals and surface curvature by only using a single RGB image. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to estimate surface curvature from colour using a machine learning approach. Additionally, we demonstrate that by tuning the network to infer well designed features, such as surface curvature, we can achieve improved performance at estimating depth and normals. This indicates that network guidance is still a useful aspect of designing and training a neural network. We run extensive experiments where the network is trained to infer different tasks while the model capacity is kept constant resulting in different feature maps based on the tasks at hand. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art benchmarks which jointly estimate depths and surface normals while predicting surface curvature in parallel.",

        "abstract": "The ability of robots to estimate their location is crucial for a wide variety of autonomous operations. In settings where GPS is unavailable, measurements of transmissions from fixed beacons provide an effective means of estimating a robot's location as it navigates. The accuracy of such a beacon-based localization system depends both on how beacons are distributed in the environment, and how the robot's location is inferred based on noisy and potentially ambiguous measurements. We propose an approach for making these design decisions automatically and without expert supervision, by explicitly searching for the placement and inference strategies that, together, are optimal for a given environment. Since this search is computationally expensive, our approach encodes beacon placement as a differential neural layer that interfaces with a neural network for inference. This formulation allows us to employ standard techniques for training neural networks to carry out the joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on a variety of environments and settings, and find that it is able to discover designs that enable high localization accuracy.",

Our visual-inertial SLAM system is based on a real-time capable visual-inertial odometry method that provides locally consistent trajectory and map estimates. We achieve global consistency in the estimate through online loop-closing and non-linear optimization. Furthermore, our system supports relocalization in a map that has been previously obtained and allows for continued SLAM operation. We evaluate our approach in terms of accuracy, relocalization capability and run-time efficiency on public indoor benchmark datasets and on newly recorded outdoor sequences. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our system compared to a visual-inertial odometry method and baseline visual SLAM approaches in recovering the trajectory of the camera.",

There exist scale ambiguity, inaccurate pose estimation with little or no baseline, incremental drifts over time in visual-inertial fusion. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust motion capturing method based on the multi-joint kinematic chain using monocular visual-inertial sensors. Our method is able to recover monocular visual scale through the joint geometry constraint. Additionally, we take inertial pre-integration to assist visual outlier removal using Maximum A Posteriori method. Ultimately, the kinematic chain model is leveraged to constrain the associated multiple visual-inertial estimation drifts during long time tracking. In the experiments, we conduct multi-joint capturing on a robotic arm. The quality of motion reconstruction is evaluated by comparing the estimated results with the measurements from an optical motion tracking system OptiTrack.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel generic formulation of Timed-Elastic-Bands for efficient online motion planning of car-like robots. The planning problem is defined in terms of a finite-dimensional and sparse optimization problem subject to the robots kinodynamic constraints and obstacle avoidance. Control actions are implicitly included in the optimized trajectory. Reliable navigation in dynamic environments is accomplished by augmenting the inner optimization loop with state feedback. The predictive control scheme is real-time capable and responds to obstacles within the robot's perceptual field. Navigation in large and complex environments is achieved in a pure pursuit fashion by requesting intermediate goals from a global planner. Requirements on the initial global path are fairly mild, compliance with the robot kinematics is not required. A comparative analysis with Reeds and Shepp curves and investigation of prototypical car maneuvers illustrate the advantages of the approach.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new method for the propagation of semantic labels in RGB-D video of indoor scenes given a set of ground truth keyframes. Manual labeling of all pixels in every frame of a video sequence is labor intensive and costly, yet required for training and testing of semantic segmentation methods. The availability of video enables propagation of labels between the frames for obtaining a large amounts of annotated pixels. While previous methods commonly used optical flow motion cues for label propagation, we present a novel approach using the camera poses and 3D point clouds for propagating the labels in superpixels computed on the unannotated frames of the sequence. The propagation task is formulated as an energy minimization problem in a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We performed experiments on 8 video sequences from SUN3D dataset [1] and showed superior performance to an optical flow based label propagation approach. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the propagated labels can be used to learn better models using data hungry deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based approaches for the task of semantic segmentation. The approach demonstrates an increase in performance when the ground truth keyframes are combined with the propagated labels during training.",

The heuristic is generated by storing minimum spanning trees from a small number of vertices within the PRM graph and using these trees to approximate the cost of a shortest path between any two vertices of the graph. The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper investigates these trade-offs on PRM graphs constructed in randomized environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation. We conclude that the method is preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm or the A* algorithm with conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, self-driving cars are being applied to more complex urban scenarios including intersections, merging ramps or lane changes. It is, therefore, important for self-driving cars to behave socially with human-driven cars. In this paper, we focus on generating the lane change behavior for self-driving cars: perform a safe and effective lane change behavior once a lane-change command is received. Our method bridges the gap between higher-level behavior commands and the trajectory planner. There are two challenges in the task: 1) Analyzing the surrounding vehicles' mutual effects from their trajectories. 2) Estimating the proper lane change start point and end point according to the analysis of surrounding vehicles. We propose a learning-based approach to understand surrounding traffic and make decisions for a safe lane change. Our contributions and advantages of the approach are: 1 Considers the behavior generator as a continuous function in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) which contains a family of behavior generators; 2 Constructs the behavior generator function in RKHS by non-parametric regressions on training data; 3 Takes past trajectories of all related surrounding cars as input to capture mutual interactions and output continuous values to represent behaviors. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to generate feasible and human-like lane-change behavior (represented by start and end points) in multi-car environments. The experiments also verified that our suggested kernel outperforms the ones which were used in a previous method.",

The majority of these methods, however, impose constraints that result from proprioceptive sensors (e.g. IMUs, GPS, Odometry) while ignoring the possibility of explicitly constraining the structure (e.g. point cloud) resulting from the reconstruction process. Moreover, research on on-line interactions between SLAM and deep learning methods remains scarce, and as a result, few SLAM systems take advantage of deep architectures. We explore both these areas in this work: we use a fast deep neural network to infer semantic and structural information about the environment, and using a Bayesian framework, inject the results into a bundle adjustment process that constrains the 3d point cloud to texture-less 3d building models.",

        "abstract": "Interactive agents are becoming increasingly common in many application domains, such as education, healthcare and personal assistance. The success of such embodied agents relies on their ability to have sustained engagement with their human users. Such engagement requires agents to be socially intelligent, equipped with the ability to understand and reciprocate both verbal and non-verbal cues. While there has been tremendous progress in verbal communication, mostly driven by the success of speech recognition and question-answering, teaching agents to appropriately react to facial expressions has received less attention. In this paper, we focus on non-verbal facial cues for face-to-face communication between a user and an embodied agent. We propose a method that automatically learns to update the agent's facial expressions based on the user's expressions. We adopt a learning scheme and train a deep neural network on hundreds of videos, containing pairs of people engaging in a conversation, and without external human supervision. Our experimental results show the efficacy of our model in sustained long-term prediction of the agent's facial landmarks. We present comparative results showing that our model significantly outperforms baseline approaches and provide insightful human studies to better understand our model's qualitative performance. We release our dataset to further encourage research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Being able to fall safely is a necessary motor skill for humanoids performing highly dynamic tasks, such as running and jumping. We propose a new method to learn a policy that minimizes the maximal impulse during the fall. The optimization solves for both a discrete contact planning problem and a continuous optimal control problem. Once trained, the policy can compute the optimal next contacting body part (e.g. left foot, right foot, or hands), contact location and timing, and the required joint actuation. We represent the policy as a mixture of actor-critic neural network, which consists of n control policies and the corresponding value functions. Each pair of actor-critic is associated with one of the n possible contacting body parts. During execution, the policy corresponding to the highest value function will be executed while the associated body part will be the next contact with the ground. With this mixture of actor-critic architecture, the discrete contact sequence planning is solved through the selection of the best critics while the continuous control problem is solved by the optimization of actors. We show that our policy can achieve comparable, sometimes even higher, rewards than a recursive search of the action space using dynamic programming, while enjoying 50 to 400 times of speed gain during online execution.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic framework that allows mobile robots to autonomously learn deep, generative models of their environments that span multiple levels of abstraction. Unlike traditional approaches that combine engineered models for low-level features, geometry, and semantics, our approach leverages recent advances in Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and deep learning to learn a single, universal model of the robot's spatial environment. Our model is fully probabilistic and generative, and represents a joint distribution over spatial information ranging from low-level geometry to semantic interpretations. Once learned, it is capable of solving a wide range of tasks: from semantic classification of places, uncertainty estimation, and novelty detection, to generation of place appearances based on semantic information and prediction of missing data in partial observations. Experiments on laser-range data from a mobile robot show that the proposed universal model obtains performance superior to state-of-the-art models fine-tuned to one specific task, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or SVMs.",

        "abstract": "Deep networks thrive when trained on large scale data collections. This has given ImageNet a central role in the development of deep architectures for visual object classification. However, ImageNet was created during a specific period in time, and as such it is prone to aging, as well as dataset bias issues. Moving beyond fixed training datasets will lead to more robust visual systems, especially when deployed on robots in new environments which must train on the objects they encounter there. To make this possible, it is important to break free from the need for manual annotators. Recent work has begun to investigate how to use the massive amount of images available on the Web in place of manual image annotations. We contribute to this research thread with two findings: (1) a study correlating a given level of noisily labels to the expected drop in accuracy, for two deep architectures, on two different types of noise, that clearly identifies GoogLeNet as a suitable architecture for learning from Web data; (2) a recipe for the creation of Web datasets with minimal noise and maximum visual variability, based on a visual and natural language processing concept expansion strategy. By combining these two results, we obtain a method for learning powerful deep object models automatically from the Web. We confirm the effectiveness of our approach through object categorization experiments using our Web-derived version of ImageNet on a popular robot vision benchmark database, and on a lifelong object discovery task on a mobile robot.",

We present a method to modulate DS depending on an external signal, extending our previous work on Locally Modulated DS (LMDS [1]).

The first application is a task of localization and grasping of objects, using our previous work on compliant tactile exploration. We successfully localize and grasp objects whose position is unknown, using touch in a simulated environment.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven approach for multi-robot coordination in partially-observable domains based on Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) and macro-actions (MAs). Dec-POMDPs provide a general framework for cooperative sequential decision making under uncertainty and MAs allow temporally extended and asynchronous action execution. To date, most methods assume the underlying Dec-POMDP model is known a priori or a full simulator is available during planning time. Previous methods which aim to address these issues suffer from local optimality and sensitivity to initial conditions. Additionally, few hardware demonstrations involving a large team of heterogeneous robots and with long planning horizons exist. This work addresses these gaps by proposing an iterative sampling based Expectation-Maximization algorithm (iSEM) to learn polices using only trajectory data containing observations, MAs, and rewards. Our experiments show the algorithm is able to achieve better solution quality than the state-of-the-art learning-based methods. We implement two variants of multi-robot Search and Rescue (SAR) domains (with and without obstacles) on hardware to demonstrate the learned policies can effectively control a team of distributed robots to cooperate in a partially observable stochastic environment.",

        "abstract": "In many situations, users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed. Depending on the environment and the paths, step-by-step following of the human might not be the optimal solution since better paths for the robot exist. We propose to perform a prediction about the human's future movements and use this information in a reinforcement learning framework to generate foresighted navigation actions for the robot. Since frequent occlusions of the human will occur due to obstacles and the robot's constrained field of view, the estimate about the humans's position and the prediction of the next destination are affected by uncertainty. Our approach deals with such situations by explicitly considering occlusions in the reward function such that the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view. We show in simulated and real-world experiments that our technique leads to significantly shorter paths compared to an approach in which the robot always tries to closely follow the user and, additionally, can handle occlusions.",

        "abstract": "Robots performing everyday tasks such as cooking in a kitchen need to be able to deal with variations in the household tools that may be available. Given a particular task and a set of tools available, the robot needs to be able to assess which would be the best tool for the task, and also where to grasp that tool and how to orient it. This requires an understanding of what is important in a tool for a given task, and how the grasping and orientation relate to performance in the task. A robot can learn this by trying out many examples. This learning can be faster if these trials are done in simulation using tool models acquired from the Web. We provide a semi-automatic pipeline to process 3D models from the Web, allowing us to train from many different tools and their uses in simulation. We represent a tool object and its grasp and orientation using 21 parameters which capture the shapes and sizes of principal parts and the relationships among them. We then learn a `task function' that maps this 21 parameter vector to a value describing how effective it is for a particular task. Our trained system can then process the unsegmented point cloud of a new tool and output a score and a way of using the tool for a particular task. We compare our approach with the closest one in the literature and show that we achieve significantly better results.",

        "abstract": "Posture body variation is one of the ways in which humans skillfully and naturally augment their motion and strength capabilities along specific task-space directions in order to successfully perform complex manipulation tasks. Posture variation also has a significant role in robot manipulation, where manipulability arises as a useful criterion to analyze and control the robot dexterity as a function of its joint configuration. In this context, this paper introduces the promising idea of manipulability transfer, a method that allows robots to learn and reproduce desired manipulability ellipsoids from expert demonstrations. The proposed framework is built on a tensor-based formulation of Gaussian mixture model that takes into account that manipulability ellipsoids lie on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. This geometry-aware method is used to design a manipulability-based redundancy resolution that allows the robot to modify its posture so that its manipulability ellipsoid coincides with the desired one. Experiments in simulation validate the functionality of the proposed approach, which extends the robot learning capability beyond trajectory, force and impedance learning approaches.",

However, most teaching approaches in literature use kinesthetic training and do not include mobile platforms. Here, we present a novel approach to learn joint robot base and gripper action models from observing demonstrations carried out by a human teacher. To achieve this we adapt RGBD observations of the human teacher to the capabilities of the robot. We formulate a graph optimization problem that links observations with robot grasping capabilities and kinematic constraints between co-occurring base and gripper poses. In real world experiments we show that the robot is able to learn complex mobile manipulation tasks such as opening and driving through a door.",

These planning algorithms depend on an accurate model of the performance of the vehicular controllers, which can be highly non-linear. Au et al. proposed a motion planning algorithm to satisfy the arrival requirements in AIM. However, they assumed that the performance models are given for every road and did not discuss how to learn these models. In this paper, we propose an instance-based learning approach to learn the performance models automatically, and argue that instance-based learning is suitable for this learning task because performance models for different roads can have a high correlation with each other. Moreover, an exploration strategy based on the principle of least effort is given to speed up the learning process. Our experiments showed that the instance-based learning method with distance-based exploration strategy offers a faster learning rate than the artificial neural network methods.",

        "abstract": "We design a new approach that allows robot learning of new activities from unlabeled human example videos. Given videos of humans executing the same activity from a human's viewpoint (i.e., first-person videos), our objective is to make the robot learn the temporal structure of the activity as its future regression network, and learn to transfer such model for its own motor execution. We present a new deep learning model: We extend the state-of-the-art convolutional object detection network for the representation/estimation of human hands in training videos, and newly introduce the concept of using a fully convolutional network to regress (i.e., predict) the intermediate scene representation corresponding to the future frame (e.g., 1-2 seconds later). Combining these allows direct prediction of future locations of human hands and objects, which enables the robot to infer the motor control plan using our manipulation network. We experimentally confirm that our approach makes learning of robot activities from unlabeled human interaction videos possible, and demonstrate that our robot is able to execute the learned collaborative activities in real-time directly based on its camera input.",

        "abstract": "In the context of robotic control, synergies can form elementary units of behavior. By specifying task-dependent coordination behaviors at a low control level, one can achieve task-specific disturbance rejection. In this work we present an approach to learn the parameters of such low-level controllers by demonstration. We identify a synergy by extracting covariance information from demonstration data. The extracted synergy is used to derive a time-invariant state feedback controller through optimal control. To cope with the non-Euclidean nature of robot poses, we utilize Riemannian geometry, where both estimation of the covariance and the associated controller take into account the geometry of the pose manifold. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach experimentally in a bimanual manipulation task.",

        "abstract": "A new class of simple, adaptive, under-actuated and compliant robot hands has recently attracted the interest of the robotics community. The under-actuated mechanisms and the structural compliance used in these hands facilitate and robustify not only grasping but also the execution of dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks. Another significant characteristic of the particular hands is that they are able to efficiently grasp a wide range of everyday life objects even under significant object pose uncertainties. However, these hands, are difficult to model due to kinematic constraints introduced by the underactuation and the use of complex flexure joints. Moreover, adaptive hands tend to reconfigure upon contact with the object surface, imposing certain parasitic object motions. In this paper, we propose a learning scheme that uses the contact force measurements collected from tactile sensors to estimate the post-contact reconfiguration of the hand-object system and the imposed parasitic object motion. The learning scheme's estimates are compared with \u201cground truth\u201d data that describe the actual motion of the object and that are collected using a vision based motion capture system. The proposed learning scheme can be used with any type of adaptive robot hand and its efficiency is experimentally validated using extensive paradigms involving different hand designs and various everyday life objects.",

One approach is to use a small dataset collected by human experts: however, high capacity learning algorithms tend to overfit when trained with little data. An alternative is to use simulation. But the gap between simulation and real world remains large especially for perception problems. The reason most research avoids using large-scale real data is the fear of crashes! In this paper, we propose to bite the bullet and collect a dataset of crashes itself! We build a drone whose sole purpose is to crash into objects: it samples naive trajectories and crashes into random objects. We crash our drone 11,500 times to create one of the biggest UAV crash dataset. This dataset captures the different ways in which a UAV can crash. We use all this negative flying data in conjunction with positive data sampled from the same trajectories to learn a simple yet powerful policy for UAV navigation. We show that this simple self-supervised model is quite effective in navigating the UAV even in extremely cluttered environments with dynamic obstacles including humans.

        "abstract": "We present a controller that allows an armlike manipulator to navigate deformable cloth garments in simulation through the use of haptic information. The main challenge of such a controller is to avoid getting tangled in, tearing or punching through the deforming cloth. Our controller aggregates force information from a number of haptic-sensing spheres all along the manipulator for guidance. Based on haptic forces, each individual sphere updates its target location, and the conflicts that arise between this set of desired positions is resolved by solving an inverse kinematic problem with constraints. Reinforcement learning is used to train the controller for a single haptic-sensing sphere, where a training run is terminated (and thus penalized) when large forces are detected due to contact between the sphere and a simplified model of the cloth. In simulation, we demonstrate successful navigation of a robotic arm through a variety of garments, including an isolated sleeve, a jacket, a shirt, and shorts. Our controller out-performs two baseline controllers: one without haptics and another that was trained based on large forces between the sphere and cloth, but without early termination.",

While the main purpose of a handover action is to successfully transfer an object to the user, it is also relevant that the robot takes the user's preferences into consideration when deciding which handover strategy to use. In a recent online study, we found evidence that suggests two important facts: (1) Users find value in a robot capable of performing handover tasks in more than one manner, and (2) Different users display different preferences on how they would like to be handed a requested object. Therefore, in this work we are proposing a novel system for learning handover preferences.

        "abstract": "Probabilistic graphical models, such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), have been used in stochastic spoken dialog systems to handle the inherent uncertainty in speech recognition and language understanding. Such dialog systems suffer from the fact that only a relatively small number of domain variables are allowed in the model, so as to ensure the generation of good-quality dialog policies. At the same time, the non-language perception modalities on robots, such as vision-based facial expression recognition and Lidar-based distance detection, can hardly be integrated into this process. In this paper, we use a probabilistic commonsense reasoner to \u201cguide\u201d our POMDP-based dialog manager, and present a principled, multimodal dialog management (MDM) framework that allows the robot's dialog belief state to be seamlessly updated by both observations of human spoken language, and exogenous events such as the change of human facial expressions. The MDM approach has been implemented and evaluated both in simulation and on a real mobile robot using guidance tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an advanced real-time Visual Inertial Navigation System (VINS) based on Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF). This filter uses Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) for nonlinear measurement update and Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) to optimize the estimate, which in turn provides better system accuracy and stability. The measurement model is developed basing Trifocal Tensor Geometry (TTG), which allows replacing the 3D feature-point reconstruction step as in traditional VINS systems. Alternatively the available Unscented MSCKF [1] based on Unscented Kalman Filter has an implementation issue of executing the square-root operation of the covariance matrix due to the negatively-weighted sigma points, and this may halt the filter operation or even causes the system to fail. The proposed CKF structure has the ability to carry the highly-nonlinear TTG-based measurement model as well as overcome the issue associated with the covariance square-root operation. The MLE based iteration is applied to optimize the visual measurement update where it performs multiple corrections on a single measurement. This procedure helps to minimize the error accumulation allowing the filter to operate for longer durations. The proposed Iterated Cubature MSCKF is tested using KITTI datasets [2] and compared against the Unscented MSCKF and non-iterated Cubature MSCKF.",

Intrusions over secured areas have become common and authorities are actively looking for solutions to detect and localize undesired drones.

In this paper, we examine the use of particle filtering to detect and localize in 3D the position of a RW-UAV based on sound source localization (SSL) over distributed microphone arrays (MAs). Results show that the proposed method is able to detect and track a drone with precision, as long as the noise emitted by the RW-UAVs dominates the background noise.",

This paper provides a method of developing the locally optimal trajectory for aerial manipulation in constrained environments. We first show differential flatness of the aerial manipulation system when the inertial effect due to equipped robotic arm is compensated with the aid of a robust controller. To find the locally optimal path, we parameterize flat outputs as polynomials of time, and formulate a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) problem. Given a convex mesh representation of environment, we obtain a collision-free trajectory in almost real time, by imposing constraints based on a signed distance metric. We also conduct an experiment of operating an object located in a confined space, which validates effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The last decade has seen a massive growth in applications for Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), due in large part to their versatility for data gathering with cameras, LiDAR and various other sensors. Their ability to quickly go from assessing large spaces from a high vantage points to flying in close to capture high-resolution data makes them invaluable for applications where we are interested in a specific target with an a priori unknown location, e.g. survivors in disaster response scenarios, vehicles in surveillance, animals in wildlife monitoring, etc., a task we will refer to scouting. Our ultimate goal is to enable MAVs to perform autonomous scouting. In this paper, we describe a semantic mapping system designed to support this goal. The system maintains a 2.5D map describing its belief about the location of semantic classes of interest, using forward-looking cameras and state estimation. The map is continuously updated on the fly, using only onboard processing. The system couples a deep learning 2D semantic segmentation algorithm with a novel mapping method to project and aggregate the 2D semantic measurements into a global 2.5D grid map. We train and evaluate our segmentation method on a novel dataset of cars labelled in oblique aerial imagery. We also study the performance of the mapping system in isolation. Finally, we show the integrated system performing a fully autonomous car scouting mission in the field.",

        "abstract": "Assessing terrain ahead of a robot when repeating previously driven safe paths can be accomplished by looking for geometric changes (e.g., due to the appearance of humans or other obstacles). Previous work has shown that the incorporation of data-driven learning and place-dependence are useful aspects of making terrain classification viable in challenging terrain. This paper presents a learning, place-dependent (LPD) terrain classifier that uses a probabilistic model of the terrain to improve detection of small obstacles in uncluttered terrain while avoiding false positives in more challenging environments. Specifically, a Gaussian mixture model is used to account for multi-height terrain cells that arise in heavily vegetated areas (where both a ground plane and overhanging vegetation can occupy the same cell). A variational Bayesian technique is used to automatically determine the number of components required for each cell using a Dirichlet prior on mixing proportions and a Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior on the means and covariances of the components. The probabilistic nature of the model allows for the detection of much smaller obstacles in regions that exhibit low variance in the terrain surface, whilst still avoiding false positives in regions where the terrain is highly cluttered (e.g., vegetation). The algorithm is tested on almost 10 km of autonomous traverse and is shown to be able to classify a wider range of obstacles than two baseline change-detection algorithms based on absolute geometric differences.",

The conventional methods are based on contact vertices, where the normal and tangential directions are estimated with respect to each pair of facets or facet and vertex of colliding bodies. However, the normal direction is intrinsically determined based on the solid deformation. This paper proposes a novel method that combines the constraint-based method and the volumetric intersection computation. Since the method estimates a 6-axis resultant force directly, there are two problems that are how to predict the preferred deformation of the volume and how to confirm the friction limit. The idea is to apply the least-square method for the former and to check if the computed force can be resolved into each stress within the friction limit. The proposed method checks the condition with linear programming method through a pyramidal approximation.",

However, in current flying multi-robot systems, such as swarms of quadrotors, these abilities are often only emulated using global communication and global position sensing. This is mainly due to the complexity, cost, weight, or power requirements for such sensors. Here we present a system that can allow for more natural swarming behaviors by enabling direct bearing and elevation sensing, as well as communication between nearby rotor-craft. This system takes advantage of the existing motion of the vehicles propellers, is low power, and can be adapted to existing vehicles with only simple modifications. We describe the system, present a working prototype, show performance of this prototype, and conclude by describing future work integrating the system into a rotor-craft swarm.",

As power constraints are critical to small mobile robots, we develop an extension of active marker pose estimation using color information to solve the marker correspondence problem, and show that this approach is more energy efficient than reflective estimation approaches. We show the feasibility of this approach by localizing a robot navigating in an underwater test tank environment. Detailed analysis is presented characterizing the noise and error properties when estimating robot poses from fixed on-board markers. Moreover, we provide comparisons in power and computational cost for other popular methods of underwater localization.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Fusing RGB and depth data is compelling in boosting performance for various robotic and computer vision tasks. Typically, the streams of RGB and depth information are merged into a single fusion point in an early or late stage to generate combined features or decisions. The single fusion point also means single fusion path, which is congested and inflexible to fuse all the information from different modalities. As a result, the fusion process is brute-force and consequently insufficient. To address this problem, we propose a multi-scale multi-path multi-modal fusion network (M3Net), in which the fusion path is scattered to diversify the contributions of each modality from global and local perspectives. Specially, the CNN streams of each modality are fused with a global understanding path and meanwhile a local capturing path. By filtering and regulating information flow in a multi-path way, the M3Net is equipped with more adaptive and flexible fusion mechanism, thus easing the gradient-based learning process, improving the directness and transparency of the fusion process and simultaneously facilitating the fusion process with multi-scale perspectives. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant and consistent improvements of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.",

An increasing interest in self-driving vehicles has brought the adaptation of semantic segmentation to self-driving systems. However, recent research relating to semantic segmentation is mainly based on RGB images acquired during times of poor visibility at night and under adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, most of these methods only focused on improving performance while ignoring time consumption. The aforementioned problems prompted us to propose a new convolutional neural network architecture for multi-spectral image segmentation that enables the segmentation accuracy to be retained during real-time operation. We benchmarked our method by creating an RGB-Thermal dataset in which thermal and RGB images are combined. We showed that the segmentation accuracy was significantly increased by adding thermal infrared information.",

        "abstract": "We consider a pursuit-evasion problem between humanoids in the presence of obstacles. In our scenario, the pursuer enters the safety area of the evader headed for collision, while the latter executes a fast evasive motion. Control schemes are designed for both the pursuer and the evader. They are structurally identical, although the objectives are different: the pursuer tries to align its direction of motion with the line-of-sight to the evader, whereas the evader tries to move in a direction orthogonal to the line-of-sight to the pursuer. At the core of the control architecture is a Model Predictive Control scheme for generating a stable gait. This allows for the inclusion of workspace obstacles, which we take into account at two levels: during the determination of the footsteps orientation and as an explicit MPC constraint. We illustrate the results with simulations on NAO humanoids.",

The MSM is the combination of the square similarity matrices in three layers, which captures both local and global spatiotemporal features of the trajectories. Next, the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features extracted from the MSM representation are concatenated as the final MSM-HOG trajectory descriptor. Then we train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with the linear kernel for multicalss motion recognition. Finally, rigid body motion recognition experiments on two public datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to characterise the magnetic interaction in neighbouring sets of local electromagnetic actuation (LEMA) actuators in a robotic platform for abdominal surgery. The analysis looks into the affect of the magnetic fields contributed by a stator-rotor set (the actuation unit) located adjacent to the rotor of interest. Each rotor drives one of the degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) on a surgical robotic device. In this study, a two-DOF setup is used for the magnetic interaction analysis, which can be expanded to general case n-DOF setup with the Principle of Superposition of magnetic fields from multiple sources. The magnetic model is then used to compute the dynamics of the system, which involves the equation of motion of the rotors and associated robotic mechanism it drives, and the actuator (electrical) model that takes into account the back EMF generated by the permanent magnet rotors. The magnetic field effect of the neighbouring set onto the rotor is observed by obtaining the speed response of the rotor through simulation so that the dynamic model can be validated against the experimental results. The outcomes are useful for the design specification of the LEMA system configuration, involving the feasible / pragmatic distance between the stator sets such that the interference is minimised, and for the design of the necessary control strategy.",

Thus, finding paths that avoid self-collision is non-trivial. However, rotational joints are often used in industrial robots. We develop a reparameterization of the planning problem called directed reachable volumes that provides an explicit representation of the workspace regions that the joints and end effectors can reach given the placement and orientation of other links. This formulation, while similar in spirit to prior reachable volume work, does not rely on the same restrictive assumptions that preclude prior work from handling rotational joints. We provide primitive planning operations that can be used in the context of state-of-the-art motion planning methods. We present experimental validation of directed reachable volumes by demonstrating a simulated pick-and-place scenario using realistic robots with rotational joints.",

We present algorithms for three tasks: (1) Mapping, i.e., building a representation of the free and obstacle regions of the workspace; (2) Subset Coverage, i.e., ensuring that at least one particle reaches each of a set of desired locations; and (3) Coverage, i.e., ensuring that every free region on the map is visited by at least one particle. These tasks relate to a large body of previous work from robot navigation, both from theory and practice, which is based on individual control. We provide theoretical insights that have potential relevance for fast MRI scans with magnetically controlled contrast media. In particular, we develop a fundamentally new approach for searching for an object at an unknown distance D, where the search is subject to two different and independent cost parameters for moving and for measuring. We show that regardless of the relative cost of these two operations, there is a simple O(log D/log log D)-competitive strategy, which is the best possible. Also, we provide practically useful and computationally efficient strategies for higher-dimensional settings. These algorithms extend to any number of particles and show that additional particles tend to reduce the mean and the standard deviation of the time required for each task.",

In some cases, occupancy information is mapped as part of a SLAM system. In other cases, such as visual SLAM, an occupancy map must be separately created, harnessing localization information. We present a novel occupancy mapping method that adaptively and efficiently takes advantage of improved trajectory estimates from the localization system, without requiring storage of all poses of the trajectory or the sensor information from all poses. Occupancy information is stored in local maps anchored to poses in the trajectory. Local maps are created adaptively depending on the uncertainty of localization. The local maps maintain consistency of occupancy information independently of changes in the localization map due to loop closures or convergence of the estimation algorithm. At any time, a global occupancy map (snapshot map) can be rendered from the local occupancy maps. We evaluate the performance of the system using real data and compare it to two baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "This work focuses on multi-robot coordination based on the Hoplites framework for solving the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem. In particular, we investigate three variations of increasing complexity for the MRTA problem: spatial task allocation based on distance, spatial task allocation based on time and distance, and persistent coverage. The Fast Marching Method (FMM) has been used for robot path planning and providing estimates of the plans that robots bid on, in the context of the market. The use of this framework for solving the persistent coverage problem provides interesting insights by taking a high-level approach that is different from the commonly used solutions to this problem such as computing robot trajectories to keep the desired coverage level. A high fidelity simulation tool, Webots, along with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) have been utilized to provide our simulations with similar complexity to the real-world tests. Results confirm that this pipeline is a very effective tool for our evaluations given that our simulations closely follow the results in reality. By modifying the replanning to prevent having costly or invalid plans by means of priority planning and turn taking, and basing the coordination on maximum plan length as opposed to time, we have been able to make improvements and adapt the Hoplites framework to our applications. The proposed approach is able to solve the spatial task allocation and persistent coverage problems in general. However, there exist some limitations. Particularly, in the case of persistent coverage, this method is suitable for applications where moderate spatial resolutions are sufficient such as patrolling.",

This kind of approach usually is composed by sensors as rate gyros, accelerometers and monocular cameras. Magnetometers and GPS modules generally used for outdoors are absent in the SLAM system observation, since the magnetometer measurements deteriorate in the presence of ferromagnetic materials and the GPS module signals are unavailable indoors or in urban environments. In order to make use of all these sensors, we propose Markovian jump linear systems (MJLS) to model the modes of operation of the navigation system based on available sensors and their reliability. An extended Kalman filter for MJLS fuses the sensor data and estimates the motion using the best mode of operation for each particular time instant. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, in situations that would pose a challenge for standard data fusion techniques.",

        "abstract": "The performance of a master-slave robotic system depends significantly on the ergonomics and the capability of its master device to correctly interface the user with the slave robot. Master manipulators generating commands in task space represent a commonly adopted solution for controlling a range of slave robots while retaining an ergonomic design. However, these devices present several drawbacks, such as requiring the use of clutching mechanics to compensate for the mismatch between slave and master workspaces, and the lack of capability to intuitively transmit important information such as specific joint limits to the user. In this paper, a novel joint-space master manipulator is presented. This manipulator emulates the kinematic structure of highly flexible surgical instruments which it is designed to control. This system uses 6 active degrees of freedom to compensate for its own weight, as well as to provide force feedback corresponding to the slave robot's joint limits. A force/torque sensor integrated at the end effector is used to relay user-generated forces and torques directly to specific joints. This is performed to counteract the friction stemming from structural constraints imposed by the kinematic design of the instruments. Finally, a usability study is carried out to test the validity of the system, proving that the instruments can be intuitively controlled even at the extremities of the workspace.",

We simultaneously build geometric point cloud models of previously unseen instances of known object classes and create a map that contains these object models as central entities. Our system leverages sparse, feature-based RGB-D SLAM, image-based deep-learning object detection and 3D unsupervised segmentation.",

A probabilistic framework of uncertainty considers coping with measurement errors in eye and position estimation. Comprehensive experiments on HRI were conducted with typical tasks including handover in a lab based prototypical manufacturing environment. The methodology is proven to predict standard measures of situation awareness (SAGAT, SART) as well as performance in the HRI task in real-time and will open new opportunities for human factors based performance optimization in HRI applications.",

        "abstract": "The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guiding robotic surgical devices has shown great potential for performing precisely targeted and controlled interventions. To fully realize these benefits, devices must work safely within the tight confines of the MRI bore without negatively impacting image quality. Here we expand on previous work exploring MRI guided robots for neural interventions by presenting the mechanical design and assessment of a device for positioning, orienting, and inserting an interstitial ultrasound-based ablation probe. From our previous work we have added a 2 degree of freedom (DOF) needle driver for use with the aforementioned probe, revised the mechanical design to improve strength and function, and performed an evaluation of the mechanism's accuracy and effect on MR image quality. The result of this work is a 7-DOF MRI robot capable of positioning a needle tip and orienting it's axis with accuracy of 1.37 \u00b1 0.06mm and 0.79\u00b0 \u00b1 0.41\u00b0, inserting it along it's axis with an accuracy of 0.06 \u00b1 0.07mm, and rotating it about it's axis to an accuracy of 0.77\u00b0 \u00b1 1.31\u00b0. This was accomplished with no significant reduction in SNR caused by the robot's presence in the MRI bore, <; 10.3% reduction in SNR from running the robot's motors during a scan, and no visible paramagnetic artifacts.",

The arm and rover are part of a network of collaborative robotic agents aiming to enhance current rescue operations by supporting human operators without burdening them with servicing tasks. The robust autonomy of the system, guaranteed in part through the addition of this robotic arm, is a main contributing factor. Design requirements are derived from the context of the rescue mission and a kinematic analysis is provided that leads to a customized design, including variable stiffness joints for compliant interaction with the environment. Experiments demonstrate the system's ability to perform the required Cartesian trajectory control and manipulation tasks, and to achieve a desired variable end-effector compliance.",

        "abstract": "In the era of autonomous driving, urban mapping represents a core step to let vehicles interact with the urban context. Successful mapping algorithms have been proposed in the last decade building the map leveraging on data from a single sensor. The focus of the system presented in this paper is twofold: the joint estimation of a 3D map from lidar data and images, based on a 3D mesh, and its texturing. Indeed, even if most surveying vehicles for mapping are endowed by cameras and lidar, existing mapping algorithms usually rely on either images or lidar data; moreover both image-based and lidar-based systems often represent the map as a point cloud, while a continuous textured mesh representation would be useful for visualization and navigation purposes. In the proposed framework, we join the accuracy of the 3D lidar data, and the dense information and appearance carried by the images, in estimating a visibility consistent map upon the lidar measurements, and refining it photometrically through the acquired images. We evaluate the proposed framework against the KITTI dataset and we show the performance improvement with respect to two state of the art urban mapping algorithms, and two widely used surface reconstruction algorithms in Computer Graphics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Human-centered environments are rich with a wide variety of spatial relations between everyday objects. For autonomous robots to operate effectively in such environments, they should be able to reason about these relations and generalize them to objects with different shapes and sizes. For example, having learned to place a toy inside a basket, a robot should be able to generalize this concept using a spoon and a cup. This requires a robot to have the flexibility to learn arbitrary relations in a lifelong manner, making it challenging for an expert to pre-program it with sufficient knowledge to do so beforehand. In this paper, we address the problem of learning spatial relations by introducing a novel method from the perspective of distance metric learning. Our approach enables a robot to reason about the similarity between pairwise spatial relations, thereby enabling it to use its previous knowledge when presented with a new relation to imitate. We show how this makes it possible to learn arbitrary spatial relations from non-expert users using a small number of examples and in an interactive manner. Our extensive evaluation with real-world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in reasoning about a continuous spectrum of spatial relations and generalizing them to new objects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery in confined spaces often requires the coordinated use of endoscopes and surgical tools while minimizing visual occlusions. In a robotic system such visual occlusion avoidance has to be achieved autonomously while keeping the surgical end-effector as close as possible to the center of the field of view of the endoscope. This paper presents an investigation of use of redundancy resolution to solve the problem of visual occlusion. Specifically, the paper addresses hard cases where a continuum robot or an ablation catheter emanate from a narrow access channel containing an endoscope. A redundancy resolution method accounting for the kinematics of the continuum robot and allowing for rotation of an angled lens endoscope is presented. A potential field method is used to guide all portions of the continuum arm outside of the visualization cone of the endoscope and a gradient descent method is used to guide the rotation of the endoscope to keep the end-effector as close as possible to the center of the visual field of the endoscope. A simulation case study demonstrates the utility of our method using a recently designed transurethral bladder cancer surgery system as a demonstration platform. Although the context of the problem is bladder surgery utilizing a continuum robot, the method can be generalized to any redundant robot that requires to accomplish a task with minimal visual occlusion.",

To ensure the (much needed) dependability and safety of such applications we forecast an increasing demand for ROS-specific coding standards, static analyzers, and tools alike. Unfortunately, the development of such standards and tools can be hampered by ROS modularity and configurability, namely the substantial number of primitives (and respective variants) that must, in principle, be considered. To quantify the severity of this problem, we have mined a large number of existing ROS packages to understand how its primitives are used in practice, and to determine which combinations of primitives are most popular. This paper presents and discusses the results of this study, and hopefully provides some guidance for future standardization efforts and tool developers.",

Unlike camera images, GPR output is in a non-Euclidean coordinate system because it only detects underground objects relative to road surface. When road surface is non-planar, its output cannot be trivially mapped to a 3D Cartesian system which is necessary for sensor fusion. Since there is no joint coverage between two sensors due to mounting requirements, we design an artificial planar bridge assisted by a planar mirror as the calibration rig. We combine the pinhole camera model with mirror reflection transformation and model the GPR imaging process. We estimate the camera and mirror poses and extract readings from hyperbolas generated from metal balls. We employ the maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the rigid body transformation between the two sensors and provide the closed form error analysis. We have conducted physical experiments to validate our calibration process and shown the average error of 6.67 mm for our calibration model. The result is satisfying considering the GPR signal wave length is 18.75 cm.",

The team is required to start at an initial point and visit a series of objective points before arriving at the final point selected from the set of objective points, where the UGVs will be charged from the solar-powered mobile charging station. This mission is represented as a multi-Hamiltonian Path Problem (mHPP). In order to effectively coordinate the team, an understanding of the mission environment is first obtained by generating a scalar field representation of the solar insolation of the environment from a visual-spectrum image. Then, a cascaded heuristic optimization algorithm, using modified genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is used to generate a time-optimized mission plan for the team of UGVs, which guides each UGV to its assigned objective points and then rendezvous at the final charging location while guaranteeing compliance with the net energy gain constraint. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are verified using an experimental testbed and constructed indoor simulation environments.",

That is, a human mission coordinator can modify tasks during the mission execution, so the tasks have to be dynamically reallocated during the process. Moreover, we assume that communication might not be reliable when vehicles are \u201coutside\u201d, i.e., performing the tasks, and thus we enforce vehicles to come back to their safe spots regularly. To address these requirements, we have developed two models, namely \u201call tasks\u201d and \u201cone round\u201d, and integrated them to the control software. We have evaluated our approach in a field experiment focused on a mine-hunting scenario.",

It has been successfully used in control of humanoid robots to adjust positions of the footsteps in order to satisfy stability constraints. In this paper we show how to adapt such scheme for a quadruped robot utilizing a static walking. The MPC is used to provide a center of mass projection reference, keeping it within support polygons to ensure stability. User is given freedom in choosing the desired dynamical behavior of the reference. The proposed control framework is tested in simulation and on a real quadruped robot. An emphasize is put on generality of such approach which is independent of gait parameters.",

        "abstract": "Robust state estimation and real-time dense mapping are two core capabilities for autonomous navigation of mobile robots. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and visual odometry/SLAM are popular methods for state estimation. However, when working between tall buildings or in indoor environments, GNSS fails due to limited sky view or obstruction from buildings. Visual odometry/SLAM are prone to long-term drifting in the absence of reliable loop closure detection. A state estimation method with global-consistent guarantee is desirable for navigation applications. As for real-time mapping, SLAM methods usually get a sparse map that is not good enough for obstacle avoidance and path-planning, and high-quality dense mapping is often computationally too demanding for mobile devices. Realizing the availability of city-scale 3D models, in this work, we improve our previous work on model-based global localization, and propose a model-aided monocular visual-inertial state estimation and dense mapping solution. We first develop a global-consistent state estimator by fusing visual-inertial odometry with the model-based localization results. Utilizing depth prior from the model, we perform motion stereo with semi-global disparity smoothing. Our dense mapping pipeline is capable of online detection of obstacles that are originally not included in the offline 3D model. Our method runs onboard an embedded computer in real-time. We validate both the state estimation and mapping accuracy in real-world experiments.",

This work presents a monocular 3D tracking algorithm that tracks edges with the aid of an arbitrary 3D mesh model assumed to capture a satellite's shape. The proposed tracker propagates a pose hypothesis between successive frames, using it first to render a depth image and then refining it according to partial matches established between depth and intensity edges. Edge matching relies on fast, local 1D searches along the depth gradient direction. The tracker does not require any pre-processing of the 3D model nor does it make any assumptions regarding its characteristics, as is often the case for other approaches. It is also robust to parts of the tracked satellite being out of view, occluded, shadowed or visually undetected. Experimental results evaluating the accuracy of the tracker and comparing it with established techniques are also included.",

        "abstract": "The proposed work deals with robotic unfolding of a garment that has been placed flat on a table and folded over a certain axis. The algorithm combines image and depth data to detect the bottom and top (folded) layer of the garment. The detection is formulated as a labeling of the garment surface and solved in an energy minimization framework. Once the garment pose is known, several candidate folding axes are generated and used to unfold the garment virtually. The correct folding axis is selected from these candidate axes. The method does not set any constraints on the garment shape; thus it can deal with various types of garments including jackets, pants, shorts, skirts or T-shirts of any sleeve lengths. The garment is unfolded by the dual-arm robot. One arm grasps boundary of the top layer and brings it over the estimated folding axis, while the second arm is holding the bottom layer to prevent the garment from slipping. The perception procedure was tested on the annotated dataset that we are making publicly available. The experimental evaluation of the robotic manipulation is also provided.",

Taking advantage of soft materials and flexible, continuous movements, they have promising applicable prospect. However, their highly internal nonlinearity and unpredictable deformation caused by environmental effects make it difficult to build an exact model for control. In this work, we propose a generalized controller for soft manipulators using an estimated Jacobian-based model derived from structural analysis. The model can be simplified from reasonable assumptions of manipulator structure, and updated to balance conformity to reality and stability. In prototype experiments on an 3D multi-segment soft manipulator, the control method exhibits accuracy as well as adaptability to self gravity and external loads.",

First, we introduce the semicircular-footed compass model and develop the equation of motion, holonomic constraint condition, and equation of collision considering the effect of impulsive frictional force. The paradox in transformation of the impulsive frictional force effect is also discussed. Second, we numerically show that short- and long-period sliding passive compass gaits can be generated under the same condition except the initial condition, and the sliding directions of the fore foot immediately after impact in the two gaits are different from each other. Furthermore, we conduct parametric studies to understand the change tendency of the fundamental gait properties with respect to the system parameters such as the foot radius and frictional coefficient. The simulation results show that the effect of semicircular feet makes it possible for the passive biped to walk on slippery downhill stably in the absence of the hip-damper.",

        "abstract": "In robot to human object handover, the configuration (position and orientation) in which the object is transferred should be selected so that the handover is safe and comfortable for the human. The trajectory on which the robot moves the object to the point of transfer should be also selected so that the robot intention is clear and the handover feels natural to the human. In this paper, we propose to select the configuration for the transfer and the trajectory to reach this configuration based on what humans do in human-human handovers. We describe a human study designed to investigate the human-human handover and propose an ergonomic model that can predict object transfer position observed in the study. A human-robot experiment is then conducted that shows that the proposed model generates transfer positions that match the preferred height and distance relative to the human.",

        "abstract": "LiDAR scanners are commonly used for mapping and localization with mobile robots. But, they cannot see through occlusions, as it occurs in harsh environments, containing smoke, fog or dust. Radar scanners can overcome this problem, but they have lower range and angular resolution, and cannot represent an environment in the same quality. In the following article, we present the integration of fused LiDAR and radar data into a SLAM cycle and continue our work from [1], where we presented first results regarding a feature based and a scan matching-based approach for SLAM in environments with changing visibility using LiDAR and radar sensors. New content in this article, the data fusion takes place on scan level as well as on map level and aims to result in an optimum map quality considering the visibility situation. Additionally, we collected more data during an indoor experiment involving real fog (see Fig. 1). Besides the structure of the environment, we can model aerosol concentration with fused LiDAR and Radar data in parallel to the mapping process with a finite difference model without involving a smoke or gas sensor. Overall, our method allows the modeling of the structure of an environment including dynamic distribution of aerosol concentration.",

Furthermore, simulation and experiment results show that the 2-period limit cycle motion of the asymmetric PRW is more effective, flexible and self-adaptive compared with regular rimless wheel, and more actual applications would be achieved by adopting the general model.",

This problem is relevant when realistic dynamic simulations have to be performed using standard software tools, but also for the design of model-based control laws, and for the implementation of sensorless strategies for collision detection or contact force estimation. A LMI-based approach is used for the identification of the robot dynamics in order to guarantee the physical feasibility of the parameters that is not ensured by standard least-squares methods.

It is implemented entirely in C++ and is designed from the ground up to easily integrate with systems that support any of several major vision and robotics libraries including OpenCV, ROS, ViSP and Eigen. It is also faster and more precise than other existing tracking systems. In order to establish the theoretical basis for its design, a new way to conceptualize registration based trackers is also introduced that decomposes tracking into three sub modules - Search Method, Appearance Model and State Space Model. Along with being a practical solution for fast and high precision tracking, this framework can also serve as a useful research tool by allowing existing and new methods for any of the sub modules to be studied better. Through extensive use of generic programming, the system makes it easy to plug in a new method for any of the sub modules so that it can not only be tested comprehensively with existing methods but also become immediately available for deployment in any project that uses the framework.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mono-camera based simultaneous obstacle recognition and distance estimation method for power transmission lines(PTLs) inspection robot to avoid obstacles on or around them. The proposed robot inspects the PTLs while moving along them between power transmission towers. For autonomous navigation, our robot recognizes obstacles and avoids a collision with them. In addition, it can stop at the ends of the PTLs by recognizing its structures, such as insulators, installed at the ends of them. In order to recognize obstacles or insulators efficiently, initially, a robust PTLs detection method based on vanishing point estimation is proposed since they are installed on or around the PTLs. Then, obstacle models with various scales are built, and multiple regions-of-interest(ROIs) according to the scales of the model are constructed along the detected PTLs. Finally, obstacles are recognized within the multiple ROIs. Because each ROI represents a corresponding scale of the obstacle model to be matched, the proposed approach can efficiently deal with scale changes and also estimate distance between the robot and the obstacle simultaneously with obstacle recognition. Experimental results not only show that the proposed method correctly recognizes obstacles but also that the distance between the robot and the obstacles is estimated efficiently.",

Using a sequence of images from a monocular camera with a fixed focus lens, metric distance to a set of features in the environment is estimated from image blur due to defocus. The blur texture ambiguity which causes scale errors in depth from defocus is corrected in an EKF framework that exploits image velocity measurements. We show in real experiments that our method converges to a metric scale, accurate, sparse depth map and 3D camera poses with images from a monocular camera. Therefore, the proposed approach has the potential to enhance robot navigation algorithms that rely on monocular cameras.",

        "abstract": "Fast and accurate depth estimation is essential for autonomous driving vehicles and autonomous robots. Monocular cameras have been expected to be widely applied due to their lower cost, but since they can't provide depth directly, fast and accurate monocular depth estimation methods are required. This paper proposes a novel method of monocular depth estimation based on flat surface using feature triangulation and two frames per estimation. Experiments under ideal conditions and with the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite showed that the method achieved smaller errors comparing to existing methods that rely on inertial sensors and many frames.",

        "abstract": "In many robotic applications, softness leads to improved performance, robustness, and safety, while lowering manufacturing cost, increasing versatility, and simplifying control. The advantages of soft robots derive from the fact that their behavior partially results from interactions of the robot's morphology with its environment, which is commonly referred to as morphological computation (MC). But not all MC is good in the sense that it supports the desired behavior. One of the challenges in soft robotics is to build systems that exploit the morphology (good MC) while avoiding body-environment interactions that are harmful with respect to the desired functionality (bad MC). Up to this point, constructing a competent soft robot design requires experience and intuition from the designer. This work is the first to propose a systematic approach that can be used in an automated design process. It is based on calculating a low-dimensional representation of an observed behavior, which can be used to distinguish between good and bad MC. We evaluate our method based on a set of grasping experiments, with variations in hand design, controller, and objects. Finally, we show that the information contained in the low-dimensional representation is comprehensive in the sense that it can be used to guide an automated design process.",

In this paper, we present an initial exploration of this process, using hand-chosen morphologies. Four different choices of muscle groups will be actuated on a tensegrity quadruped called MountainGoat: three for a primarily spine-driven morphology, and one for a primarily leg-driven morphology, and the locomotion speed will be compared. Each iteration of design seeks to reduce the total number of active muscles, and consequently reduce the dimensionality of the problem for machine learning, while still producing effective locomotion. The reduction in active muscles seeks to simplify future rapid prototyping of the robot.",

In such robot-rat interactions, the robot should be designed to fully replicate a real rat in terms of morphological and behavioral characteristics. To address this problem, a multi-jointed robot prototype has been modified based on our previous work. We optimally update the forelimb of the robot and redesign the control board to make it more dexterous and increase its behavioral capability. Then, we systematically and kinematically analyze the rotational range of joint variables and the workspace of the robot by using traversal method. To evaluate the motion capability of the modified robot, we propose two quantitative parameters: maximum reachable height (MRH) and minimum bendable distance (MBD). Additionally, we achieve to quantitatively evaluate the behavioral similarity between the robot and rat with the calculated accumulative distance (AD) by using dynamic time warping (DTW). These evaluated methods show high promise to improve the robot-rat interaction to be more similar to rat-rat interaction.",

With a camera placed at the tip of one of the instruments, the CRISP robot can be used to inspect anatomical sites in constrained body cavities in a minimally invasive manner. We introduce a motion planner for CRISP robots that computes manipulations of the flexible instruments outside the body such that the camera can visually inspect a user-specified site of clinical interest inside the body. Our sampling-based motion planner ensures avoidance of collisions with anatomical obstacles inside the body, enforces remote-center-of-motion constraints on the instrument's entry points into the body, and efficiently handles the expensive computation of CRISP robot kinematics. We also extend the motion planner to estimate the set of points inside a body cavity that can be visually inspected by the camera of a CRISP robot for a given setup. We demonstrate our method in a simulated endoscopic medical procedure in the pleural space around a lung.",

We provide an application-independent formulation of MVRP-DDO, as well as a concrete instantiation in a surface mining application. We propose a multi-abstraction search approach to compute an executable plan for the drilling operations of several machines in a very constrained environment.

Moreover, we accurately handle friction at each contact point using contact distribution and frictional impulse solvers, which also account for relative motion.

Particularly, we integrate distance estimations to Ultra-Wideband (UWB) sensors and 3D point-clouds from RGB-D sensors. First, a novel approach for environment mapping is introduced, exploiting the synergies between UWB sensors and point-clouds to produce a multi-modal 3D map that integrates the estimated UWB sensors position. This map is further integrated into a Monte Carlo Localization method to robustly estimate the UAV pose. Finally, the full approach is tested with real indoor flights and validated with a motion tracking system.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot transfer learning allows a robot to use data generated by a second, similar robot to improve its own behavior. The potential advantages are reducing the time of training and the unavoidable risks that exist during the training phase. Transfer learning algorithms aim to find an optimal transfer map between different robots. In this paper, we investigate, through a theoretical study of single-input single-output (SISO) systems, the properties of such optimal transfer maps. We first show that the optimal transfer learning map is, in general, a dynamic system. The main contribution of the paper is to provide an algorithm for determining the properties of this optimal dynamic map including its order and regressors (i.e., the variables it depends on). The proposed algorithm does not require detailed knowledge of the robots' dynamics, but relies on basic system properties easily obtainable through simple experimental tests. We validate the proposed algorithm experimentally through an example of transfer learning between two different quadrotor platforms. Experimental results show that an optimal dynamic map, with correct properties obtained from our proposed algorithm, achieves 60-70% reduction of transfer learning error compared to the cases when the data is directly transferred or transferred using an optimal static map.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a generalized multi-stage Bayesian approach for an unmanned aerial vehicle to estimate the location of a mobile target. The major hardware components of the proposed approach are a camera with a fisheye lens and another camera with a normal lens and a pan/tilt unit. With wide angle of view (AOV), the fisheye lens camera first detects the bearing of the target, and the PT camera next captures the target in its AOV. The recursive Bayesian estimation steadily locates the target in a globally defined space. The paper also proposes a multi-stage detection method for the fisheye lens camera. The level of confidence is defined in association with the probability of detection (POD) for each detection technique, and the fisheye lens enables continuous detection by gradually increasing the POD. The observation likelihood is finally derived from the POD in a generalized manner. The proposed approach was applied to the detection of a mobile target by a multi-rotor helicopter, and results have demonstrated the effectiveness of both the proposed multi-stage Bayesian approach and multi-stage fisheye lens detection method.",

Starting from a Gaussian prior on the relative position of a source, this paper determines the motion of a binaural sensor which leads to the most effective path for localization. To this aim, a reward function is defined as the conditional expectation, over the yet unknown N next observations, of the entropy of the N-step-ahead posterior pdf of the relative source position. The optimal motion of the binaural sensor is obtained from a constrained optimization problem involving the automatic differentiation of the reward function. The method is validated in simulation, and is being implemented on a real-life robotic test bed.",

Pose correspondences between trajectories are mediated by common landmarks represented in a topological map lacking distinct metric coordinates. Despite such lack of explicit metric level associations, we mine preliminary pose level correspondences between trajectories through a novel multi-scale heat-kernel descriptor and correspondence graph framework. These serve as an improved initialization for ICP (Iterative Closest Point) to yield dense pose correspondences. We perform extensive analysis of the proposed method under varying levels of pose and landmark noise and showcase its superiority in obtaining pose matches in comparison with standard ICP like methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of the kind that brings in elements from spectral graph theory to solve the problem of pose correspondences in a multi-robotic setting and differentiates itself from other works.",

        "abstract": "Visual scene understanding is an important capability that enables robots to purposefully act in their environment. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network approach to predict semantic segmentation from RGB-D sequences. The key innovation is to train our network to predict multi-view consistent semantics in a self-supervised way. At test time, its semantics predictions can be fused more consistently in semantic keyframe maps than predictions of a network trained on individual views. We base our network architecture on a recent single-view deep learning approach to RGB and depth fusion for semantic object-class segmentation and enhance it with multi-scale loss minimization. We obtain the camera trajectory using RGB-D SLAM and warp the predictions of RGB-D images into ground-truth annotated frames in order to enforce multi-view consistency during training. At test time, predictions from multiple views are fused into keyframes. We propose and analyze several methods for enforcing multi-view consistency during training and testing. We evaluate the benefit of multi-view consistency training and demonstrate that pooling of deep features and fusion over multiple views outperforms single-view baselines on the NYUDv2 benchmark for semantic segmentation. Our end-to-end trained network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDv2 dataset in single-view segmentation as well as multi-view semantic fusion.",

As it is not easy to make the flight endurance of an aerial robot longer, we study the problem to transport multiple objects at the same time to improve the efficiency of transportation. However, for conventional aerial robots, multiple objects transportation is difficult because the CoG position changes when the number of grasped objects changes, resulting in the instability of the flight. Therefore, to solve this problem, we focus on the multirotor with two-dimensional multilinks proposed in our previous work, which possesses the ability to modify the CoG position actively and can keep the flight stable. First, we introduce the hardware platform including the structure of link module and internal communication system to achieve the extensibility in terms of the link number. We then propose a method to find the optimal form for the multilinks based on the flight stability. Finally, we present experimental results which include aerial transformation and multiple objects transportation.",

However, deciding when and where to take measurements in complex environments remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a new multiresolution mapping approach for informative path planning in terrain monitoring using UAVs. Our strategy exploits the spatial correlation encoded in a Gaussian Process model as a prior for Bayesian data fusion with probabilistic sensors. This allows us to incorporate altitude-dependent sensor models for aerial imaging and perform constant-time measurement updates. The resulting maps are used to plan information-rich trajectories in continuous 3-D space through a combination of grid search and evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our framework on the application of agricultural biomass monitoring. Extensive simulations show that our planner performs better than existing methods, with mean error reductions of up to 45% compared to traditional \u201clawnmower\u201d coverage. We demonstrate proof of concept using a multirotor to map color in different environments.",

        "abstract": "The Non-Anthropomorphic Biped (NABi) has demonstrated agile motion without complex control due to its unique leg alignment in the sagittal plane. This paper presents NABi-S, a small version of NABi. The \u201cS\u201d designation refers to the new spring or \u201csoleus\u201d mechanism used to store energy and stabilize walking. An important feature of NABi-S is its ability to self-stabilize - it can recover from any tipping in the sagittal plane. Using this feature, NABi-S demonstrates stable motion using CPG control, a difficult task to achieve on a biped. In this paper, the soleus prototype is designed and analyzed. An open-loop, CPG algorithm is then implemented, and a parameter space search is performed to optimize robot locomotion.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a SLAM front end called NOctoSLAM. The approach adopts an octree-based map representation that implicitly enables source and reference data association for point to plane ICP registration. Additionally, the data structure is used to group map points to approximate surface normals. The multi-resolution capability of octrees, achieved by aggregating information in parent nodes, enables us to compensate for spatially unbalanced sensor data typically provided by multi-line lidar sensors. The octree-based data association is only approximate, but our empirical evaluation shows that NOctoSLAM achieves the same pose estimation accuracy as a comparable, point cloud based approach. However, NOctoSLAM can perform twice as many registration iterations per time unit. In contrast to point cloud based surface normal maps, where the map update duration depends on the current map size, we achieve a constant map update duration including surface normal recalculation. Therefore, NOctoSLAM does not require elaborate and environment dependent data filters. The results of our experiments show a mean positional error of 0.029 m and 0.019 rad, with a low standard deviation of 0.005 m and 0.006 rad, outperforming the state-of-the-art by remaining accurate while running online.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we presented a high-power, self-balancing, passively and software-controlled active compliant, and wearable hip exoskeleton to provide walking and balance assistance. The device features powered hip abduction/adduction (HAA) and hip flexion/extension (HFE) modules to provide assistance in both sagittal and frontal planes. Each module's actuation unit employs a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) to achieve passive compliance. The hip exoskeleton can work in two basic operation modes: human-in-charge and robot-in-charge. Both modes are integrated into the low-level controller based on the admittance control, making transitions smooth and stable. A new balance controller based on the \u201cextrapolated center of mass\u201d (XCoM) concept is presented for real-time control hip abduction/adduction to keep the center of mass (CoM) within the support polygon. The exoskeleton controller is designed to encourage participation in walking instead of overriding users' intrinsic behavior to achieve effective assistance and training. Our preliminary experiments on a healthy subject using the hip exoskeleton demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the device and controller in assisting locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Model-based control of dynamical systems typically requires accurate domain-specific knowledge and specifications of possibly proprietary system components. In the context of autonomous driving, steering actuator dynamics can be difficult to model due to an integrated proprietary power steering control module. While first-principles models derived from physics laws can often approximate the system behavior, it remains generally difficult to capture non-physically derived behavior based on proprietary software algorithms in the power steering system. To overcome this limitation, this work instead employs a recurring neural network to model the steering dynamics of an autonomous vehicle. The resulting model is then integrated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control scheme to generate feedforward steering commands for embedded control. The proposed approach is compared to traditional first-principles steering modeling through on-vehicle experiments and statistical data validation. As a result, it is shown that the neural network model can be automatically generated with less domain-specific knowledge, can predict steering dynamics more accurately, and perform comparably to a high-fidelity first principles model when used for controlling the steering system of a self-driving vehicle.",

However, many of these robots, like the PR2, use manipulators with high degrees-of-freedom. The complexity of these robots lead to large dimensional state spaces, which are difficult to fully explore. Our previous work introduced the IDRRL algorithm, which compresses the learning space by transforming a high-dimensional learning space onto a lower-dimensional manifold while preserving expressivity. In this work we formally prove that IDRRL maintains PAC-MDP guarantees. We then improve upon our previous formulation of IDRRL by introducing cascading autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, producing the new algorithm IDRRL-CAE. We demonstrate the improvement of this extension over our previous formulation, IDRRL-PCA, in the Mountain Car and Swimmers domains.",

Manufacturers propose new features to take the loading into account and a new generation of industrial robot equiped with double encoding systems are proposed. However, current methods brings some drawbacks when the ratio between the stiffness arm and the wrist one is too high. In this paper, we propose a new approach to take this aspect into account by decoupling the arm identification and the wrist one. We compare then our method regarding two current methods and applied it on this new industrial robot. The results highlight the stability and the quality of the stiffness articular estimation with and without activating the double encoding system.

When using the classical passivity observer, we encounter an energy accumulation problem: if the system stays a long time in stable contact, energy is dissipated and the passivity observer builds up a large value. This causes the passivity controller to be triggered late after the interaction becomes unstable, so we lose the advantage of the passivity controller. In order to deal with this energy accumulation issue, we propose two new passivity observers that allow us to quickly detect potential instability despite the accumulated energy. We prove the theoretical validity of these new observers. In addition, we propose a more generalized way of implementing the passivity based explicit force controller on a multi-DoF manipulator, using a model for the robot and environment that includes sensor flexibility, and a hybrid position/force controller in the operational space framework. The proposed method is experimentally tested with KUKA IIWA, and the improved performance is verified.",

        "abstract": "Stroke rehabilitation technologies have focused on reducing treatment cost while improving effectiveness. Rehabilitation robots are generally developed for home and clinical usage to: 1) deliver repetitive practice to post-stroke patients, 2) minimize therapist interventions, and 3) increase the number of patients per therapist, thereby decreasing the associated cost. The control of rehabilitation robots is often limited to black-or gray-box approaches; thus, safety issues regarding the human-robot interaction are not easily considered. To overcome this issue, controllers working with physics-based models gain more importance. In this study, we have developed an efficient two dimensional (2D) human-robot interaction model to implement a model-based controller on a planar end-effector-type rehabilitation robot. The developed model was used within a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) structure to control the rehabilitation robot. The GPOPS-II optimal control package was used to implement the proposed NMPC structure. The controller performance was evaluated by simulating the human-robot rehabilitation system, modeled in MapleSim\u00ae. In this system, a musculoskeletal model of the arm interacting with the robot is used to predict movement and muscle activation patterns, which are used by the controller to provide optimal assistance to the patient. In simulations, the controller achieved desired performance and predicted muscular activities of the dysfunctional subject with a good accuracy. In our future work, a structure exploiting the NMPC framework will be developed for the real-time control of the rehabilitation robot.",

        "abstract": "In SLAM, the size of the state vector tends to grow when exploring unknown environments, causing the ever-increasing computational complexity. To reduce the computational cost, one needs to continuously marginalize part of previous states (features and/or poses). This can be achieved by using either the null-space operation or Schur complement based marginalization. The former was originally developed particularly for visual-inertial odometry (VIO), while the latter is the standard approach to reduce the state vector in bundle adjustment (BA). In this paper, for the first time ever, we prove that under mild assumptions (i.i.d. white Gaussian noise model and same linearization points) these two techniques retain the same amount of information about the state, which is validated with real-world experiments. Moreover, based on this key insight, we derive analytically the left null-space expressions for multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO, which is verified through Monte-Carlo simulations.",

Our contribution stands mainly in high integration of different modules within the whole-body Quadratic Programing-based controller that has not been yet confronted to tasks demanding high precision in the execution and tuning. This includes the use of a robust visual servoing algorithm which allows the robot to move autonomously to a desired target and the design of specific tasks and estimators: a learning and admittance control that enables the robot to interact smoothly with its environment, and a fast and safe method to autonomously detect correct tool on nut insertion. We then show that the controller indeed enables our humanoid robot to achieve such a high precision task.",

        "abstract": "Achieving object exploration with passive vision and active touch has been under investigation for thirty years. We build upon recent progress in biomimetic active touch that combines perception via Bayesian evidence accumulation with controlling the tactile sensor using perceived stimulus location. Here, passive vision is combined with active touch by providing a visual prior for each perceptual decision, with the precision of this prior setting the relative contribution of each modality. The performance is examined on an edge following task using a tactile fingertip (the TacTip) mounted on a robot arm. We find that the quality of exploration is a U-shaped function of the relative contribution of vision and touch; moreover, multi-modal performance is more robust, completing the contour when touch alone fails. The overall system has several parallels with biological theories of perception, and thus plausibly represents a robot model of visuo-tactile exploration in humans.",

Our system first trains an object detector to generate bounding box candidates from the images. A deep CNN is then used to learn the depth features from these bounding boxes. Finally, these feature maps are post-processed with dense CRF to improve the prediction along class boundaries. The experimental results on our new challenging dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin. Furthermore, from the detected affordances we introduce a grasping method that is robust to noisy data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the full-size humanoid robot WALK-MAN using different objects in real-world scenarios.",

Instead of considering visual measurements on image plane, we use individual planes for each point that are tangent to the unit sphere and normal to the corresponding measurement ray. This way, we combine spherical images captured by omnidirectional camera with inertial measurements within the filtering method MSCKF. The key hypothesis of OVIO is that a wider field of view allows incorporating more visual features from the surrounding environment, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of the motion estimation. Moreover, by using an omnidirectional camera, it is less likely to end up in a situation where there is not enough texture. We provide an evaluation of OVIO using synthetic and real video sequences captured by a fish-eye camera, and compare the performance with MSCKF using a perspective camera. The results show the superior performance of the proposed OVIO.",

The addressed problem combines challenges of the combinatorial optimization of the OP (to select the most rewarding targets and find the optimal sequence to visit them) with the continuous optimization related to the determination of the waypoint locations and suitable headings at the waypoints for the considered Dubins vehicle such that the curvature-constrained path does not exceed the given travel budget and the sum of the collected rewards is maximized. The proposed generalization is called the Close Enough Dubins Orienteering Problem (CEDOP) and novel unsupervised learning approach is proposed to address computational requirements of this challenging planning problem. Based on the presented results, the proposed approach is feasible and provides a bit worse solution of CEDOP than the existing combinatorial approach but with significantly lower computational requirements.",

As the relation between this index and the joint variables of the robot is not straightforward, we have tested different formulations using approximated derivatives. Obstacle avoidance has also been considered and the effect of modifying the Cartesian trajectory during the execution of a task has been thoroughly analyzed. Different scenarios have been conducted in simulation and have proven that our modified inverse kinematics solver is efficient to maximize the manipulability index, even with the additional constraint of obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the relaxation of the trajectory constraints leads to a greater manipulability while ensuring the motion smoothness and satisfying the robot physical limitations.",

        "abstract": "Tendon-driven continuum robots possess versatile application capabilities and have a robust design. The actuation of such robots with non-straight tendons that wrap around the backbone, described by a variable function, offers a lot of untapped potentials. While it has been shown that these continuum robots are able to take up complex shapes using only one actuated segment, the merits of non-straight tendon routing have not been quantified in terms of workspace and motion. In this paper, we show that one additional helically routed tendon can greatly benefit the robot's reachable workspace. For instance, the reachable workspace of a one-segment robot with 3 conventional straight tendons increases by 400 % by adding one helically routed tendon. Furthermore, the dexterity of such a continuum robot is improved, i.e. motion sequences to avoid obstacles or to twine an object for grasping. For the first time, the potential of tendon-driven continuum robots with two segments and helically routed tendons is investigated. The general findings on the merits of helical tendon routing are supported with both simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots require motion planning algorithms that match limitations of on-board computing resources to safely navigate complex environments. In situations where near-optimality is preferential to runtime performance, search spaces that optimize their local connectivity to improve the global optimality of generated solutions are desirable. However, not all nodes in the search space benefit equally from optimization which can result in an inefficient use of computational resources and unnecessary increase in runtime. To address this limitation, we propose an approach called the Selectively Adaptive State Lattice which uses a heuristic based on the local environment to selectively perform optimization and obtain a balance between runtime performance and relative optimality. We present a statistical evaluation of local connectivity optimization and global search with the State Lattice, Adaptive State Lattice, and Selectively Adaptive State Lattice algorithms in randomly generated obstacle fields. We further highlight the performance of each method on a Clearpath Robotics TurtleBot2 in a qualitative physical experiment.",

        "abstract": "We aim to reliably predict whether a grasp on a known object is successful before it is executed in the real world. There is an entire suite of grasp metrics that has already been developed which rely on precisely known contact points between object and hand. However, it remains unclear whether and how they may be combined into a general purpose grasp stability predictor. In this paper, we analyze these questions by leveraging a large scale database of simulated grasps on a wide variety of objects. For each grasp, we compute the value of seven metrics. Each grasp is annotated by human subjects with ground truth stability labels. Given this data set, we train several classification methods to find out whether there is some underlying, non-trivial structure in the data that is difficult to model manually but can be learned. Quantitative and qualitative results show the complexity of the prediction problem. We found that a good prediction performance critically depends on using a combination of metrics as input features. Furthermore, non-parametric and non-linear classifiers best capture the structure in the data.",

In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that the monotonicity of pose uncertainty is preserved when the uncertainty is propagated on Lie groups rather than on Euclidean vector space. After deriving covariance propagated over Lie groups and Euclidean vector space, respectively, the monotonicity of uncertainty in each case is thoroughly investigated. Experiments with simulated and real-world scenarios on dead-reckoning validate our hypothesis on the monotonicity of uncertainty.",

The UV light power and the concentration GelMA hydrogel were optimized to achieve both fabrication of microstructures and live condition of cells. The two-layered toroidal cell structures were fabricated which can mimic the multi-layered structure of blood vessels. The movable microstructures were achieved by the water repellent coating on the substrate surface. Finally, on-chip fabrication of GelMA microstructures and peeling off of the fabricated microstructures were achieved using a microfluidic chip. The results indicate that the fabricated movable GelMA microstructures can be used for further three dimensional assembly to achieve vascular-like tube structures.",

The adaptive means that the robot is capable of adjusting its motion to the behavior of the person being accompanied. Our main objective is to optimize in real time the path performed by the pair human-robot, by modifying dynamically the angle and distance between both throughout different locations of the path. We have defined a new cost function for finding the best planned path that takes into account the cost of the geometrical configuration between the human and the robot. Moreover, we have modified the Extended Social Force Model (SFM) to include the required forces to maintain the angle and distance between the robot and human while the human-robot pair is moving towards the shared goal. The method has been validated throughout a large set of simulations and real-live experiments.",

We present a realistic, cluttered, VR environment for experimentation with household tasks paired with a semantic extraction and reasoning system able to utilize data collected in real-time and apply ontology-based reasoning to learn and classify activities performed in VR. The system performs continuous segmentation of the motions of users' hands and simultaneously classifies known actions while learning new ones on demand. The system then constructs a graph of all related activities in the environment through its observations, extracting the task space utilized by observed users during their performance. The action recognition and learning system was able to maintain a high degree of accuracy of around 92% while dealing with a more complex and realistic environment compared to earlier work in both physical and virtual spaces.",

By introducing a hidden state vehicle center position, vehicle parts particles can be updated efficiently as a whole sharing same motion. With a pre-trained appearance and geometric model, tracker can distinguish parts with rich information from invalid parts to make a more precise prediction. Meanwhile some priori knowledge about the moving pattern of vehicles in well-structured on-road environment is learned, and can be used in the inference of measurement model and motion model to improve tracking performance and efficiency. Experiments were conducted with real data collected in Beijing to examine the performance in different situations on both the advantages and challenges. The Beijing highway dataset for on-road vehicle tracking will be opened to the society. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art approaches. Result demonstrate that the proposed algorithm are able to handle occlusion and aspect ratio change in on-road vehicle tracking problem.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a GPU parallelized SLAM system capable of using photometric and inertial data together with depth data from an active RGB-D sensor to build accurate dense 3D maps of indoor environments. We describe several extensions to existing dense SLAM techniques that allow us to operate in real-time onboard memory constrained robotic platforms. Our primary contribution is a memory management algorithm that scales to large scenes without being limited by GPU memory resources. Moreover, by integrating a visual-inertial odometry system, we robustly track the camera pose even on an agile platform such as a quadrotor UAV. Our robust camera tracking framework can deal with fast camera motions and varying environments by relying on depth, color and inertial motion cues. Global consistency is achieved via regular checking for loop closures in conjunction with a pose graph, as a basis for corrective deformation of the 3D map. Our efficient SLAM system is capable of producing highly dense meshes up to 5mm resolution at rates close to 60Hz fully onboard a UAV. Experimental validations both in simulation and on a real-world platform, show that our approach is fast, more robust and more memory efficient than state-of-the-art techniques, while obtaining better or comparable accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Traditional path-planning involves (1) choosing start and goal points, (2) calculating a path, and (3) following that path. There are, however, many real world scenarios where an agent might need to change its goal and replan, which frequently includes expensively calculating a new path from scratch. We propose an adaptation to RRT\u2217 that locally rewires the RRT\u2217 tree as the robot moves and path costs change. Local rewiring takes advantage of information already existing in the tree and makes small adaptations that accommodate changes. Rewiring adds computational overhead during robot travel, but allows replanning in real time with approximately constant overhead. Empirical studies demonstrate that computational costs are lower than alternative replanners in 2D worlds with moderate obstacle density, and the resulting paths approach optimality as more time is allowed to replan.",

        "abstract": "Modern consumer RGB-D cameras are affordable and provide dense depth estimates at high frame rates. Hence, they are popular for building dense environment representations. Yet, the sensors often do not provide accurate depth estimates since the factory calibration exhibits a static deformation. We present a novel approach to online depth calibration that uses a visual SLAM system as reference for the measured depth. A sparse map is generated and the visual information is used to correct the static deformation of the measured depth while missing data is extrapolated using a small number of thin plate splines (TPS). The corrected depth can then be used to improve the accuracy of the sparse RGB-D map and the 3D environment reconstruction. As more data becomes available, the depth calibration is updated on the fly. Our method does not rely on a planar geometry like walls or a one-to-one-pixel correspondence between color and depth camera. Our approach is evaluated in real-world scenarios and against ground truth data. Comparison against two popular self-calibration methods is performed. Furthermore, we show clear visual improvement on aggregated point clouds with our method.",

Field-based crop stalk detection is a challenging computer vision problem due to occlusion by leaves, similarity of color and texture between stalks and surrounding foliage, and high stalk density within rows. Detecting stalks for grasping adds further challenges such as computation time and computing hardware. The proposed algorithm utilizes multiple stereo images taken from an unmanned ground vehicle and exploits geometric features specific to stalks such as vertical continuity, height, and the direction of surface normals. The described hardware and software pipeline is capable of detecting stalks for a manipulator grasp in approximately 12 seconds, and preliminary results show that hardware improvements can reduce detection time to 4 seconds. The algorithm is tested on 378 point clouds generated from 916 images of Sorghum bicolor, a grain crop. Performance is evaluated according to two methods, demonstrating precision greater than 93%.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Information gathering algorithms aim to intelligently select the robot actions required to efficiently obtain an accurate reconstruction of a physical process, such as an occupancy map, or a magnetic field. Many recent works have proposed algorithms for information gathering. However, these algorithms employ discretization of the state space, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics. Moreover, most algorithms are not suited for online information gathering tasks. This paper presents a novel approach that tackles the two aforementioned issues. Specifically, our approach includes two intertwined steps: a Gaussian processes (GPs)-based prediction that allows a robot to identify highly unexplored locations, and an RRT*-based informative path planning that guides the robot towards those locations. The combination of the two steps allows an online realization of the algorithm, while eliminates the need of discretization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in simulations, as well as with an experiment in which a ground-based robot explores the magnetic field intensity within an indoor environment populated with obstacles.",

The system learns iteratively by retraining a classifier online with the samples collected by the robot over time. A novel aspect of our approach is that errors in training data can be corrected using the information provided by the 3D LiDAR-based tracking. In order to do this, an efficient 3D cluster detector of potential human targets has been implemented. We evaluate the framework using a new 3D LiDAR dataset of people moving in a large indoor public space, which is made available to the research community.

The proposed algorithm can perform online multi-target learning, thus allowing efficient implementations on real robots. Our approach has been tested both offline, on datasets captured from three different robotic systems and online, on a physical system. The proposed algorithm exhibits state-of-the-art performance in terms of generalization ability and convergence. Furthermore, it has been implemented within ROS for controlling a Baxter robot.

        "abstract": "The identification of inertial parameters is crucial to achieve high-performance model-based control of legged robots. The inertial parameters of the legs are typically not altered during expeditions and therefore are best identified offline. On the other hand, the trunk parameters depend on the modules mounted on the robot, like a motor to provide the hydraulic power, or different sets of cameras for perception. This motivates the use of recursive approaches to identify online mass and the position of the Center of Mass (CoM) of the robot trunk, when a payload change occurs. We propose two such approaches and analyze their robustness in simulation. Furthermore, experimental trials on our 80-kg quadruped robot HyQ show the applicability of our strategies during locomotion to cope with large payload changes that would otherwise severely compromise the balance of the robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic failure is all too common in unstructured robot tasks. Despite well-designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. Robots under a sense-plan-act paradigm do not have an additional loop to check their actions. In this work, we present a principled methodology to bootstrap online robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we seek to enable the robot to recognize and expect its behavior, else detect anomalies. We postulated that noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is obtained by segmenting and encoding data. And when wrench information represents a sequence of sub-tasks, the vocabulary represents a set of words or sentence and provides a unique identifier. The grammar, which can also include unexpected events, was classified both offline and online for simulated and real robot experiments. Multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used offline, while online probabilistic SVMs were used to give temporal confidence to the introspection result. Our work's contribution is the presentation of a generalizable online semantic scheme that enables a robot to understand its high-level state whether nominal or anomalous. It is shown to work in offline and online scenarios for a particularly challenging contact task: snap assemblies. We perform the snap assembly in one-arm simulated and real one-arm experiments and a simulated two-arm experiment. The data set itself is also fully available online and provides a valuable resource by itself for this type of contact task. Our verification mechanism can be used by high-level planners or reasoning systems to enable intelligent failure recovery or determine the next most optimal manipulation skill to be used.

The proposed method can simultaneously learn place categories and lexicons while incrementally generating an environmental map. Furthermore, the proposed method has scene image features and a language model added to SpCoA. In the experiments, we tested online learning of spatial concepts and environmental maps in a novel environment of which the robot did not have a map. Then, we evaluated the results of online learning of spatial concepts and lexical acquisition. The experimental results demonstrated that the robot was able to more accurately learn the relationships between words and the place in the environmental map incrementally by using the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Laser Guided Vehicles (LGV) are largely used in industrial contexts for the autonomous dispatching of huge loads. LGVs of automated warehouses are driven by supervisory systems which assign their tasks depending on the process demands. The vehicle workspace is partially structured and it is normally shared with several independent agents like other LGVs, or human operated forklifts, or humans which directly interact with the vehicle itself. For efficiency and for safety reasons, LGVs move along pre-defined paths so that, if an unexpected obstacle is detected, they must be promptly stopped so as to avoid impacts. As shown in the paper, the safety problem is normally handled by limiting the plant productivity. This is clearly an improper approach, which can be overcome by considering a novel velocity planning strategy. The one proposed in this paper guarantees high safety standards, thus preserving the physical integrity of human coworkers, by simultaneously improving the plant productivity.",

One of the challenges for achieving collaboration in a team of robots is mutual tracking and identification. We present a novel pipeline for online vision-based detection, tracking and identification of robots with a known and identical appearance. Our method runs in realtime on the limited hardware of the observer robot. Unlike previous works addressing robot tracking and identification, we use a data-driven approach based on recurrent neural networks to learn relations between sequential inputs and outputs. We formulate the data association problem as multiple classification problems. A deep LSTM network was trained on a simulated dataset and fine-tuned on small set of real data. Experiments on two challenging datasets, one synthetic and one real, which include long-term occlusions, show promising results.",

        "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an interferometric imaging modality with spatial resolution in the micrometer range. The OCT signal can be used to detect small structures to measure deformation or to characterize tissue. Moreover, OCT can be realized through a single optical fiber, i.e., it can be easily integrated with instruments. However, to use OCT for intra-operative guidance its spatial alignment needs to be established. Hence, we consider eye-in-hand calibration between the 1D OCT imaging and a 6D robotic position system. We present a method to perform pivot calibration for OCT and based on this introduce pivot+d, a new 1D to 6D eye-in-hand calibration. We provide detailed results on the convergence and accuracy of our method and use translational and rotational ground truth to show that our methods allow for submillimeter positioning accuracy of an OCT beam with a robot. For pivot calibration we observe a mean translational error of 0.5161 \u00b1 0.4549 mm while pivot+d shows 0.3772 \u00b1 0.2383 mm. Additionally, pivot+d improves rotation detection by about 8\u00b0 when compared to pivot calibration.",

        "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges of humanoid robots is to keep the balance at any moment, as they can be subject to different types of external perturbations. Therefore, push recovery is a relevant issue in humanoid robotics, which still represents an open challenge. In literature, the most used method is based on the capture point, where a reduced model of the robot is used to compute recovery motions. In this paper we want to explore the problem with a different approach, by using whole-body models combined with optimal control. The robot is subject to an external perturbation, which is taken into account in the system dynamics as continuous external force. Optimal control is used to generate whole-body recovery motions by using the whole-body dynamic model of the robot. Instead of the capture point criterion, we optimize for a stable motion that allows to perform recovery within one step, at the end of which the robot is in a state of zero velocity. We apply the method to the model of the humanoid robot HeiCub, where serial springs can be mounted in the knee and ankle pitch actuators to change them into Series Elastic Actuators (SEA). The recovery motion is computed for both the model with and without SEA.",

        "abstract": "This work formulates the multi-vehicle lane change motion planning task as a centralized optimal control problem, which is beneficial in being generic and complete. However, a direct solution to this optimal control problem is numerically intractable due to the dimensionality of the collision-avoidance constraints and nonlinearity of the vehicle kinematics. A progressively constrained dynamic optimization (PCDO) method is proposed to facilitate the numerical solving process of this complicated problem. PCDO guarantees to efficiently obtain an optimum to the original optimal control problem via solving a sequence of simplified problems which gradually judge and reserve only the active collision-avoidance constraints. A first-regularization-then-action strategy, together with the look-up table technique, is developed for online solutions. At the regularization stage, the vehicles form a standard formation by linear acceleration/deceleration only. At the action stage, the vehicles execute lane change motions computed offline and recorded in the look-up table. This makes online motion planning feasible because 1) the computational complexity at the regularization stage scales linearly rather than exponentially with the vehicle number; and 2) online computation at the action stage is fully avoided through data extraction from the look-up table.",

Specifically, we consider a system of multiple AGVs, moving along a predefined roadmap, and utilized for transportation of goods in automated warehouses. Sequential application of task assignment and path planning often gives rise to pathological situations, such as deadlocks, in which AGVs block each other, thus preventing tasks completion. In this paper we propose a method for assigning tasks while taking into account the subsequent path planning, encoding possible conflicts into a conflict graph, that is subsequently utilized for defining constraints of an optimization problem. Simulations are performed on maps of real industrial environments, to compare the proposed method with traditional task assignment.",

PRVO characterizes the space of velocities that would allow each robot to fulfill its share in collision avoidance with a specified probability. PRVO is modeled as chance constraints over the velocity level constraints defined by RVO and takes into account the uncertainty associated with both state estimation as well as the actuation of each robot. Since chance constraints are in general computationally intractable, we propose a series of reformulations which when combined with time scaling based concepts leads to a closed form characterization of solution space of PRVO for a given probability of collision avoidance. We validate our formulation through numerical simulations in which we highlight the advantages of PRVO over the related existing formulations.",

There are two strategies developed to leverage the capability of convolution neural network (CNN) in mining the fundamental and generic features for recognition. First, the early layers of CNN should serve the function to extract feature without specific representation. By applying the concept of transfer learning, the first few layers from the pre-learned VGG model can be used directly without further fine-tuning. To alleviate the computational loading and to increase the accuracy of our partially transferred model, a cross-layer inheriting feature fusion (CLIFF) is proposed by using the information from the early layer in fully connected layer without further processing. The experimental result shows that combination of partial transferred model and CLIFF can provide better performance than VGG16 [1] model with re-trained FC layer and other hand-crafted features like RBPs [2].",

Considering a knee moment and a knee angle varying with a pedal crank angle, the knee extension moment can be supported by a torsion spring storing energy from knee flexion in order to release it as the knee is extended. The reduction of knee extension effort is corresponding to the torsion spring stiffness and activation range. Exoskeleton prototypes were developed for the concept validation. A crossing four-bar mechanism was chosen for the knee joint to provide kinematic compatibility covering extreme knee flexion. Constant power cycling experiment was performed on a cycling trainer by a healthy subject wearing the exoskeletons on both legs. With the torsion spring support, the surface electromyography recorded from some major leg muscles shows the decrease of knee extensor muscle activity as the leg is moving around the pedal crank top dead center. Verifying the reduction of leg muscle fatigue over repetitive contractions in multiple subjects is our future plan of study.",

We first model the vertical flexible beam by using Euler-Bernoulli theory and modal approximation while utilizing certain boundary conditions to take into account the effect of the gravity and interaction wrench between the manipulator-stage system and the beam. To separately achieve two control objectives, i.e. the joint tracking and the vibration suppression, we utilize the passive decomposition to split the dynamics into: 1) the stage and beam dynamics; and 2) its orthogonal complement, which converges to the robotic manipulator dynamics as the vibration is subdued. We further show that the linearized stage-beam dynamics is controllable and design an LQR control to stabilize the beam vibration only by using the stage motion. We also design control for the orthogonal complement dynamics in such a way that it can attain the manipulator joint tracking asymptotically as the vibration is suppressed. Experiments are also performed to verify the manipulator joint tracking while the vibration is suppressed internally via the stage motion.",

In this context, a guidance mechanism is a controller that steers the user towards the desired path when he/she deviates. Passive guidance mechanisms do not directly propel the vehicle and leave the user in control of his/her walk. The inherent safety of passive guidance and the intuitive behaviour of the device make this class of solutions preferable to any other for robot assisted walking. The possible ways to obtain a passive behaviour in robotic walkers either require complex and expensive sensors or generate potentially rough (bang-bang) manoeuvres that are detrimental to the user's comfort. The contribution of this work is a path following controller that simulates passivity using a pair of active motors operating on the rear wheels of the walker. The system estimates and tracks the velocity desired by the user and the motors generate a rotational torque only when a turn toward the path is required. The proposed solution delivers high levels of comfort, does not rely on expensive hardware and preserves all the important properties of a passive mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Microrobots have great potential for microassembly and non-invasive surgery applications. Motivated by studies proposing MRI-guided drug delivery to tumor cells using magnetic micro carriers, this paper studies two major challenges of this problem: (i) microrobot swarm trajectory generation, and (ii) swarm aggregation using a global input. We propose an augmented RRT for trajectory generation to reduce environment interference, and a divide-and-conquer algorithm for swarm aggregation to improve performance. Simulations demonstrate the utility of these approaches in comparison to alternate heuristics. Our trajectory generation and aggregation strategies are implemented on a swarm of ferromagnetic microparticles in oil using a 6-coil electromagnetic system with image feedback.",

        "abstract": "We revisit the classical problem of estimating the dynamic parameters of an unknown payload rigidly held by the robot end effector. The approach relies on the analysis of the symbolic expressions of the robot dynamic coefficients (i.e., combinations of dynamic parameters) when working with and without payload, with no special assumptions on payload structure. The linearity of the associated changes in the dynamic coefficients due to the payload addition is exploited so as to estimate the gravity and inertial parameters of the payload. The procedure is illustrated in simulation on a planar 2R robot with asymmetric payload and through experiments on a 7R KUKA LWR arm with medium payloads. Accurate estimates of non-inertial payload parameters can be obtained even by running the identification scheme on few small motions in a restricted area. The results are shown to be useful for improving the sensorless collision detection capabilities of a robot arm in the presence of an a priori unknown payload.",

They are often equipped with simple sensors such as contact sensors or range finders, which allow them to measure and control their heading angle with respect to environment boundaries. We aim to find minimal control schemes for creating stable, periodic \u201cpatrolling\u201d dynamics for robots that drive in straight lines and \u201cbounce\u201d off boundaries at controllable angles. As a first step toward analyzing high-level mobile robot dynamics in more general environments, we analyze the location and stability of periodic orbits in regular polygons. The contributions of this paper are: 1) proving the existence of periodic trajectories in n-sided regular polygons and showing the range of bounce angles that will produce such trajectories; 2) an analysis of their stability and robustness to modeling errors; and 3) a closed form solution for the points where the robot collides with the environment boundary while patrolling. We present simulations confirming our theoretical results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots have the potential to provide tremendous support to disabled and elderly people in their everyday tasks, such as dressing. Many recent studies on robotic dressing assistance usually view dressing as a trajectory planning problem. However, the user movements during the dressing process are rarely taken into account, which often leads to the failures of the planned trajectory and may put the user at risk. The main difficulty of taking user movements into account is caused by severe occlusions created by the robot, the user, and the clothes during the dressing process, which prevent vision sensors from accurately detecting the postures of the user in real time. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an approach that allows the robot to automatically adapt its motion according to the force applied on the robot's gripper caused by user movements. There are two main contributions introduced in this paper: 1) the use of a hierarchical multi-task control strategy to automatically adapt the robot motion and minimize the force applied between the user and the robot caused by user movements; 2) the online update of the dressing trajectory based on the user movement limitations modeled with the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model in a latent space, and the density information extracted from such latent space. The combination of these two contributions leads to a personalized dressing assistance that can cope with unpredicted user movements during the dressing while constantly minimizing the force that the robot may apply on the user. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method allows the Baxter humanoid robot to provide personalized dressing assistance for human users with simulated upper-body impairments.",

In this paper, we present GLAROT-3D, a translation and rotation invariant 3D signature based on geometric relations. The proposed method encodes into a histogram the pairwise relative positions of keypoint features extracted from 3D sensor data. Since it relies only on geometric properties and not on specific feature descriptors, it does not require any prior training or vocabulary construction and enables lightweight comparisons between landmark maps. The similarity of two point maps is computed as the distance between the corresponding rotated histograms to achieve rotation invariance. Histogram rotation is enabled by efficient orientation histogram based on sphere cubical projection. The performance of GLAROT has been assessed through experiments with standard benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Biologically inspired by the hopping performance of kangaroo, this paper extends the traditional Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model by adding an actuation at hip to composite a tail-actuated SLIP (TSLIP) model as an abstract template for gait controller design. To deal with the intrinsic nonlinearity of stance dynamics in the TSLIP model, an analytical approximation is derived by virtue of perturbation technique with gravity correction. Employing the derived solution to construct the apex return map, a gait controller is further devised with a two-layer nonlinear optimization scheme. The outer loop optimizes the tail motion during stance by matching the energy variation between the current and target apex state while the inner loop subsequently selects the optimum touchdown angle by minimizing the difference between the predictive and target apex vector from stride to stride. Additionally, an extended control strategy that embodies a time-dependent pre-positioned policy for swing-leg working in conjunction with the active tail is devised, requiring no priori knowledge of the ground truth to enhance to hopping performance of the TSLIP system. The simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for tailed hopping system.",

A new definition of the incident angle is introduced and its consistency with respect to relative transformation between scans is demonstrated. A method that uses the Radial distance and Incident Angle (RIA) for scan alignment, that can efficiently estimate the relative transformation between two scans, is proposed. This approach is designed as a preprocessor for fine scan matching and it is able to pre-align scans that have large angular but limited translational displacement. Scans collected with aggressive robot motion in two typical indoor environments as well as benchmark datasets, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of RIA when compared with a range of scan matching algorithms reported in the literature.",

It is limited by communication constraints and to overcome this limitation, this paper formulates the process as a collaboration in which the human scientist and the robot work together to fill in gaps in knowledge to make discoveries. It introduces the science hypothesis map as the probabilistic structure in which scientists initially describe their abstract beliefs and hypotheses, and in which the state of this belief evolves as the robot makes raw measurements. It discusses how to incorporate path planning for maximizing scientific information gain, which is efficiently computed. As proof of concept, this paper describes a geologic exploration problem where a robot uses a spectrometer to infer the geologic composition of different regions in a mining district at Cuprite, Nevada. It shows that the science hypothesis map can infer geologic units with high accuracy, and that exploration using information gain-based path planning has better performance than exploration with conventional science-blind algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an approach that enables the four-limbed robot \u201cWAREC-1\u201d to climb up and down vertical ladders stably. First, the four-limbed robot \u201cWAREC-1\u201d is introduced and dynamic stability conditions in multi-mass model for ladder climbing are proposed as the basis of judging whether a four-limbed robot is stable or not while climbing a vertical ladder. According to the proposed stability conditions, 3 different types of moment will directly affect the stability of the robot on a ladder: gravitational moment, inertial moment and reaction force moment. With the analysis of these 3 kinds of moments and the relationship among them, stability control methods are proposed to maintain stability of the robot on a ladder to the greatest degree and avoid their mutual interference. Combining with the stability conditions and stability control proposed, stable motion planning of climbing up and down a vertical ladder, a motion planning method proposed by the authors that allows independent path and time planning in trajectory planning is also applied to reinforce the efficiency of the stability control. Eventually, results from the simulation and physical robot verify the validity of the proposed control methods.",

        "abstract": "Planning safe, high-speed trajectories in unknown environments remains a major roadblock on the way toward achieving fast autonomous flight. Current state-of-the-art planning approaches use sampling-based methods or trajectory optimization to obtain fast trajectories, whose safety is evaluated by taking into account the current state estimate of the environment. In unknown environments, however, this leads to numerous stops caused by the need for re-planning the trajectory due to unexpected obstacles. In this paper, we propose to use an active perception paradigm for planning. We predict the future uncertainty of the map and optimize trajectories to minimize re-planning risk. This leads to faster and safer trajectories. We evaluate the proposed planning approach in a series of simulation experiments, which show that we are able to achieve safer trajectories with a smaller number of re-planning stops and faster speeds.",

        "abstract": "Non-prehensile manipulation, such as pushing, is an important function for robots to move objects and is sometimes preferred as an alternative to grasping. However, due to unknown frictional forces, pushing has been proven a difficult task for robots. We explore the use of reinforcement learning to train a robot to robustly push an object. In order to deal with the sample complexity of training such a method, we train the pushing policy in simulation and then transfer this policy to the real world. In order to ease the transfer from simulation, we propose to use modularity to separate the learned policy from the raw inputs and outputs; rather than training \u201cend-to-end,\u201d we decompose our system into modules and train only a subset of these modules in simulation. We further demonstrate that we can incorporate prior knowledge about the task into the state space and the reward function to speed up convergence. Finally, we introduce \u201creward guiding\u201d to modify the reward function and further reduce the training time. We demonstrate, in both simulation and real-world experiments, that such an approach can be used to reliably push an object from many initial positions and orientations.

Model-predictive methods offer great promise to address balance in dynamic robots, yet require the solution of challenging nonlinear optimization problems when applied to legged systems. The new proposed PR-MPC approach aims to improve the conditioning of these problems by adding regularization based on heuristic reference policies. With this approach, a unified MPC formulation is shown to generate and stabilize trotting, bounding, and galloping without retuning any cost-function parameters. Intuitively, the added regularization biases the solution of the MPC towards common heuristics from the literature that are based on simple physics. Simulation results show that PR-MPC improves the computation time and closed-loop outcomes of applying MPC to stabilize quadrupedal gaits.",

        "abstract": "Numerous therapeutic transendoscopic procedures exist to treat lesions in the GI tract. However, these procedures are limited by their difficulty and the amount of training required to successfully perform them. The surgeon is tasked with simultaneously steering the distal tip of the endoscope, applying tension to tissue to retract it, and manipulating electro-cautery tools with limited dexterity. We propose a device designed to assist with anchoring and tissue retraction during endoscopic surgical procedures. The designed solution decouples the tissue-grasping function from the movement of the endoscope tip, leaving the surgeon free to use the endoscope tip solely for positioning of electro-cautery or biopsy tools deployed through the endoscope working channel. The anchoring and retraction device uses pop-up book MEMS techniques, allowing for a \u201cflat\u201d structure to expand into a 3-D structure. The proposed device has three main integrated components: a rigid expandable geometric structure, inflatable pneumatic actuators, and a vacuum gripper. These inflatable actuators include internal rigid discs, allowing for resistance to buckling while maintaining the benefits of the established lightweight, low profile actuator design scheme. Proof-of-concept ex vivo testing demonstrates that the integrated device can be used to retract tissue to a height of 13.5 mm, providing access for endoscopy tools to contact a sample of porcine stomach tissue.",

        "abstract": "Present visual servoing approaches are instance specific i.e. they control camera motion between two views of the same object. However, in practical scenarios where a robot is required to handle various instances of a category, classical visual servoing techniques are less suitable. We formulate across instance visual servoing as a pose induction and pose alignment problem. Initially, the desired pose given for any known instance is transferred to the novel instance through pose induction. Then the pose alignment problem is solved by estimating the current pose using the part aware keypoints reconstruction followed by a pose based visual servoing (PBVS) iteration. To tackle large variation in appearance across object instances in a category, we employ visual features that uniquely correspond to locations of object's parts in images. These part-aware keypoints are learned from annotated images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Advantages of using such part-aware semantics are two-fold. Firstly, it conceals the illumination and textural variations from the visual servoing algorithm. Secondly, semantic keypoints enables us to match descriptors across instances accurately. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments in simulation as well as on a quadcopter. Our approach results in acceptable desired camera pose and smooth velocity profile. We also show results for large camera transformations with no overlap between current and desired pose for 3D objects, which is desirable in servoing context.",

        "abstract": "Vacuum-powered Soft Pneumatic Actuator (V-SPA) Modules have been described to afford advantages for rapid development of reconfigurable, multi-DoF soft pneumatic robots powered by vacuum by reducing their logistical complexity, however they also present new challenges in the control of resulting systems. This framework features modules joined together over a simple embedded pneumatic and serial communication network and requires a unique approach to both low-level control implementation and high-level control strategy. We describe the structure and activation characteristics of a V-SPA Module and present practical methods for its control. These methods utilize software generated PWM activation through a unique serial protocol designed for LED networks and a heuristic mapping strategy for simplifying the spherical control of 3-DoF actuator modules.",

In this work we present a method to autonomously dispense a precise amount of fluid using only visual feedback without using precision pouring instruments such as pipettes, syringes or pourers. We model circular and rectangular pouring container geometries. We prove that for square containers we can control the flow by only observing the fluid height in the receiving beaker. We show a systematic approach using a hybrid control scheme that is robust to the initial amount of fluid in the pouring container and inconsistent flow. Specifically we present (a) a model for pouring (b) a model based algorithm to drive a robot arm (c) visual feedback for regulating the pouring rate. We demonstrate this using the Rethink Robotics Sawyer manipulator and mvBluefox MLC202bc camera.",

Unlike many commonly used filter methods, our graph-based localization takes a much larger history of the trajectory into account. In addition, we utilize a multiple-hypothesis approach for data association for increased robustness against the presence of outliers. By incorporating both sparse point features and lane markings, we are able to take advantage of both kinds of features widely available in urban environments as well as highways. Furthermore, by using high level features, we avoid having to store and match against large amounts of data such as dense 3D point clouds. Finally, we evaluate our approach on real driving sequences on city roads.",

        "abstract": "In robotics, vision sensors are used to estimate the poses of objects in the environment. However, it is a fundamental problem that the estimated poses are not always accurate enough for a given robotic task. Proper sensor placement can mitigate this problem. We present a method which can predict the pose uncertainties in the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which is often used as the last critical pose refinement step in a pose estimation system. With our method we thus provide a crucial tool needed for the optimization of a robust pose estimation system. Our method relies on the generation of synthetic depth images in a Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper we demonstrate our method for depth sensors which rely on Kinect v1 like technology. We evaluate our method using real depth sensor recordings from the publicly available BigBird dataset. The evaluation shows that the uncertainty predictions of our method are in better correspondence with real world experimental results than the state of the art analytical method.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the use of a learning approach to predict air-to-ground (A2G) communication strength in support of the communication relay mission using UAVs in an urban environment. To plan an efficient relay trajectory, A2G communication link quality needs to be predicted between the UAV and ground nodes. However, due to frequent occlusions by buildings in the urban environment, modelling and predicting communication strength is a difficult task. Thus, a need for learning techniques such as Gaussian Process (GP) arises to learn about inaccuracies in a pre-defined communication model and the effect of line-of-sight obstruction. Two ways of combining GP with a relay trajectory planner are presented: i) scanning the area of interest with the UAV to collect communication strength data first and then using learned data in the trajectory planner and ii) collecting data and running the trajectory planner simultaneously. The performance of both approaches is compared with Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the first implementation results in slightly better predictions, however the second one benefits from being able to start the relay mission immediately.",

        "abstract": "Ride-sharing, or carpooling, systems with autonomous vehicles will provide efficient and reliable urban mobility on demand. In this work we present a method for dynamic vehicle routing that leverages historical data to improve the performance of a network of self-driving taxis. In particular, we describe a constrained optimization method capable of assigning requests to autonomous vehicles in an informed way, to minimize the expected cost of serving both current and future travel requests. We allow several passengers with independent trips to share a vehicle and allow vehicles to pick additional passengers as they progress through their route. Based on historical data, we compute a probability distribution over future demand. Then, samples from the learned probability distribution are incorporated into a decoupled vehicle routing and passenger assignment method to take into account the predicted future demand. This method consists of three steps, namely pruning of feasible trips, assignment of trips to vehicles and rebalancing of idle vehicles. We show the benefits and trade-offs of this predictive approach in an experimental evaluation with over three million rides extracted from a dataset of taxi trips in New York City. Our method produces routes and assignments that, in expectation, reduce the travel and waiting times for passengers, with respect to a purely reactive approach. Besides the mobility on demand application, the method we present is general and could also be applied to other multi-task multi-vehicle assignment and routing problems.",

The aim of this recognizer is to offer one-step selection of one of the actions ascending, descending, and level walking during five gaits (stair ascent/descent, slope ascent/descent, level walking). The proposed recognizer is executed at the moment of foot contact as estimated by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the pelvis without using direct foot sensors. The proposed recognizer selects the gait by using the relations between the angles formed by the hip and knee joints during the last step. As this study constitutes preliminary work for lower limb exoskeletons, we used a hip exoskeleton integrated with two wireless IMUs on the shank to set up the lower limb exoskeleton sensor configuration. Experiments were used to evaluate IMU-based foot contact estimation with respect to a foot sensor based on a force-sensitive resistor (FSR) for stairs, slopes, and level ground. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the proposed two-tier gait recognizer by using two healthy male subjects in various gait environments.",

        "abstract": "Flexible manipulator enables curvilinear accessibility through small incisions or natural orifices for minimally invasive surgery and diagnosis, which makes it a good choice for minimally invasive surgery. In order to control the robot precisely and safely, the real-time position and shape information of the robot need to be measured well. In this paper, we propose a magnetic tracking based tip pose and shape detection method for wire driven flexible robots. A permanent magnet is mounted at the distal end of the robot. Its magnetic field can be sensed with a sensor array. Therefore, position and orientation of the tip can be estimated utilizing the tracking method. A shape sensing algorithm is then carried out to estimate the real-time shape based on the tip pose. With the tip pose and shape display in the reconstructed visual environment, navigation can be achieved. This method provides the advantages that no sensors are needed to mount on the robot and has no line-of-sight problem. Experimental results verified the feasibility of the proposed method. A navigation error of 1.9mm is achieved.",

The system consists of an informationally structured environment (ISE), an immersive VR display, a stereo camera, an optical tracking system, and a dynamic simulator. In an ISE, a number of sensors are embedded, and information such as the position of furniture, objects, humans, and robots, is sensed and stored in a database. The position and orientation of the immersive VR display are also tracked by an optical tracking system. Therefore, we can forecast the next possible events using a dynamic simulator and synthesize virtual images of what users will see in the near future from their own viewpoint. The synthesized images, overlaid on a real scene by using augmented reality technology, are presented to the user. The proposed system can allow a human and a robot to coexist more safely by showing possible hazardous situations to the human intuitively in advance.",

The PIY Glove is fabricated with Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) using consumer based 3D printing technology to lower fabrication costs and allow patients to 3D print a rehabilitative and assistive device at home. PIY Glove uses a novel, fold based design of 3D printed soft actuators to achieve bending motion in the fingers. Fabrication guidelines of the PIY Glove are laid out and characterization of the glove in terms of its range of motion and grip force are also presented. An EMG control system that achieves control of the PIY Glove is also described. This work paves the way for the implementation of printable pneumatics in real-world applications, particularly robot-assisted hand therapy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Urban transportation is being transformed by mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems. One of the goals of MoD systems is to provide personalized transportation services to passengers. This process is facilitated by a centralized operator that coordinates the assignment of vehicles to individual passengers, based on location data. However, current approaches assume that accurate positioning information for passengers and vehicles is readily available. This assumption raises privacy concerns. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a method that protects passengers' drop-off locations (i.e., their travel destinations). Formally, we solve a batch assignment problem that routes vehicles at obfuscated origin locations to passenger locations (since origin locations correspond to previous drop-off locations), such that the mean waiting time is minimized. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we formalize the notion of privacy for continuous vehicle-to-passenger assignment in MoD systems, and integrate a privacy mechanism that provides formal guarantees. Second, we present a polynomial-time iterative version of the Hungarian algorithm to allocate a redundant number of vehicles to a single passenger. This algorithm builds on the insight that even during peak rush hour there are unoccupied (redundant) traveling vehicles. This strategy allows us to reduce the performance deterioration induced by the privacy mechanism. In particular, it enables the exploration of the trade-off between privacy levels, waiting time, and deployed fleet size. We evaluate our methods on a real, large-scale data set consisting of over 11 million taxi rides (specifying vehicle availability and passenger requests), recorded over a month's duration, in the area of Manhattan, New York. Based on current traffic statistics, our evaluations indicate that privacy can be achieved without incurring a significant loss of performance, and that this loss can be further controlled by varying operator or us...

In this paper, we propose a method to generate three-dimensional map with multilabel occupancy in real-time. Extending our previous work [1] in which only target label occupancy is mapped, we achieve multilabel object segmentation in a single looking around action. We evaluate our method by testing segmentation accuracy with 39 different objects, and applying it to a manipulation task of multiple objects in the experiments. Our mapping-based method outperforms the conventional projection-based method by 40-96% relative (12.6 mean IU3d), and robot successfuly recognizes (86.9%) and manipulates multiple objects (60.7%) in an environment with heavy occlusions.",

        "abstract": "Creating accurate models of stochastically self-assembling systems is a key step in developing control strategies, centralized or distributed, for the self-assembly process. This paper comparatively studies several aspects of developing probabilistic models for programmable self-assembling systems of stochastically interacting modules. In particular, we systematically investigate Markov models as well as hidden Markov models to predict the self-assembly process dynamics. We consider a case study leveraging our fluidic self-assembly robotic system. The ground truth is obtained through a high-fidelity simulation, calibrated using real experimental data. We first consider Markov models and employ the formalism of chemical reaction networks. In order to compute the model parameters, i.e. the reaction rates in the network, three different methods are studied. We then investigate the validity of the underlying well-mixed assumption, and thus the Markov property, for our system through estimation of the diffusion coefficient, through two different approaches. The system is shown to be borderline well-mixed, motivating extension of the initial Markov models to more complex models in order to achieve improved model accuracy. We formulate an automatic method for creating a hidden Markov model starting from a Markov model, based on a previously existing systematic method. Sample trajectories of the models are realized using the Gillespie's method. The resulting hidden Markov model is shown to achieve an improved accuracy over the standard Markov model.",

In the first block, dialogue act-related categories are estimated from the input speech. Considering the correlations between dialogue acts and head motions, the utterances are classified into three categories having distinct nod distributions. Linguistic information extracted from the input speech is fed to a cluster of classifiers which are combined to estimate the utterance categories. In the second block, nod motion parameters are generated based on the categories estimated by the classifiers. The nod motion parameters are represented as probability distribution functions (PDFs) inferred from human motion data. By using speech energy features, the parameters are sampled from the PDFs belonging to the estimated categories. Subjective experiment results indicate that the motions generated by our proposed approach are considered more natural than those of a previous model using fixed nod shapes and hand-labeled utterance categories.",

Since conventional NDT does not generate distributions in cells having fewer point samples than the number threshold, it would be failed to represent the environment if the point cloud is divided by high-resolution cells. Also, it can lead to incorrect estimations of pose variations. To solve the problem, we define the probability of a point sample and compute the mean and covariance based on the probability. Besides, we show that the generalization property of the probabilistic NDT objective function. The probabilistic NDT has two advantages. First, it generates distributions in all of the occupied cells regardless of the resolution of cells. Second, it reduces the degeneration effect by using modified covariance. The experimental results show that all of the occupied cells have distributions even if the point cloud is divided by high-resolution cells and that the probabilistic NDT improves the accuracy of NDT-based registration.",

        "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of generalizing robot control programs over multiple objects, tasks and environments, based on the concept of action descriptions. These are abstract, general, semantic descriptions of an action that are augmented during execution with subsymbolic parameters specific to the context at hand. The parameters are inferred through reasoning rules, which extract the context from the action description and the belief state of the robot. The proposed system scales well with increasing number of reasoning rules required to support the knowledge-intensive manipulation tasks. The architecture combines the high-level robot control program with the reasoning engine in a modular way, thus improving the scalability of the system. The approach is validated in the context of setting a table with a PR2 robot.",

        "abstract": "Many robotic systems achieve position sensing through the use of optical encoders that specify the position of a joint to a certain resolution. Encoders effectively quantize joint space coordinates and introduce position measurement error in the process. This error propagates to operational space coordinates, limiting end-effector position and orientation resolution, and also to joint and operational space coordinate derivatives, manifesting as noise that can vitiate the signal. In this paper, we characterize encoder error in a robotic system. Given encoder specifications, robot kinematics, and discrete transfer functions mapping coordinates to their derivatives, we describe the propagation of quantization error on joint space coordinates to operational space coordinates, joint space coordinate derivatives, and operational space coordinate derivatives. We establish two results for quantization error. The first is a general result useful for establishing worst-case bounds. The second models each quantization as independent additive pseudo quantization noise (PQN) for which stochastic metrics on the error are determined. Experimental data gathered from a Phantom Premium robot/haptic device supports the analytical results.",

We demonstrate that our method reduces the need for stopping while retaining safety guarantees, and thus goals are reached between 1.4 and 3.5 times faster than the standard ROS navigation stack in the tested scenarios.",

While recent results have demonstrated full control as well as biomimetic behaviors such as perching, more complex challenges such as perception and navigation still exist. Typically, challenges in perception-based control can only be solved by experimentation. However, such fly-size MAVs are not widely available to researchers at large due to its intricate manufacturing process and limited mechanical lifetime. To facilitate the development of perception and control algorithms of insect-scale MAVs, we explore an approach of simulating flapping wing aerial vehicle dynamics on a quad-rotor. This work performs detailed analysis of the transformation of control inputs, and demonstrates feasibility by numerically simulating basic flight patterns of models of a RoboBee as well as that of a scaled quad-rotor.",

The quadrotor is assumed to visit a set of reachable points following the shortest path while avoiding the no-fly zones. The problem is solved by using a two-scale proposed algorithm. In the first scale, an efficient tool for cluttered environments based on optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) approach, called multi-RRT* Fixed Node (RRT*FN), is developed to define the shortest paths from each point to their neighbors. Using the pair-wise costs between points provided by the first-scale algorithm, in the second scale, the overall shortest path is obtained by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). Taking into consideration the limited onboard energy, a second alternative based on the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is used. This latter is solved using the savings heuristic approach. The effectiveness of this proposed two-scale algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations and promising results are obtained.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation has enabled humans with motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI) to independently stand and recover some lost autonomic function. Quantifying the quality of bipedal standing under spinal stimulation is important for spinal rehabilitation therapies and for new strategies that seek to combine spinal stimulation and rehabilitative robots (such as exoskeletons) in real time feedback. To study the potential for automated electromyography (EMG) analysis in SCI, we evaluated the standing quality of paralyzed patients undergoing electrical spinal cord stimulation using both video and multi-channel surface EMG recordings during spinal stimulation therapy sessions. The quality of standing under different stimulation settings was quantified manually by experienced clinicians. By correlating features of the recorded EMG activity with the expert evaluations, we show that multi-channel EMG recording can provide accurate, fast, and robust estimation for the quality of bipedal standing in spinally stimulated SCI patients. Moreover, our analysis shows that the total number of EMG channels needed to effectively predict standing quality can be reduced while maintaining high estimation accuracy, which provides more flexibility for rehabilitation robotic systems to incorporate EMG recordings.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile robots, be it autonomous or teleoperated, require stable communication with the base station to exchange valuable information. Given the stochastic elements in radio signal propagation, such as shadowing and fading, and the possibilities of unpredictable events or hardware failures, communication loss often presents a significant mission risk, both in terms of probability and impact, especially in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) operations. Depending on the circumstances, disconnected robots are either abandoned, or attempt to autonomously back-trace their way to the base station. Although recent results in Communication-Aware Motion Planning can be used to effectively manage connectivity with robots, there are no results focusing on autonomously re-establishing the wireless connectivity of a mobile robot without back-tracing or using detailed a priori information of the network. In this paper, we present a robust and online radio signal mapping method using Gaussian Random Fields, and propose a Resilient Communication-Aware Motion Planner (RCAMP) that integrates the above signal mapping framework with a motion planner. RCAMP considers both the environment and the physical constraints of the robot, based on the available sensory information. We also propose a self-repair strategy using RCMAP, that takes both connectivity and the goal position into account when driving to a connection-safe position in the event of a communication loss. We demonstrate the proposed planner in a set of realistic simulations of an exploration task in single or multi-channel communication scenarios.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Aerial surveillance and monitoring demand both real-time and robust motion detection from a moving camera. Most existing techniques for drones involve sending a video data streams back to a ground station with a high-end desktop computer or server. These methods share one major drawback: data transmission is subjected to considerable delay and possible corruption. Onboard computation can not only overcome the data corruption problem but also increase the range of motion. Unfortunately, due to limited weight-bearing capacity, equipping drones with computing hardware of high processing capability is not feasible. Therefore, developing a motion detection system with real-time performance and high accuracy for drones with limited computing power is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a visual-inertial drone system for real-time motion detection, namely REDBEE, that helps overcome challenges in shooting scenes with strong parallax and dynamic background. REDBEE, which can run on the state-of-the-art commercial low-power application processor (e.g. Snapdragon Flight board used for our prototype drone), achieves real-time performance with high detection accuracy. The REDBEE system overcomes obstacles in shooting scenes with strong parallax through an inertial-aided dual-plane homography estimation; it solves the issues in shooting scenes with dynamic background by distinguishing the moving targets through a probabilistic model based on spatial, temporal, and entropy consistency. The experiments are presented which demonstrate that our system obtains greater accuracy when detecting moving targets in outdoor environments than the state-of-the-art real-time onboard detection systems.",

Surfel-based reconstruction algorithms associate each RGB-D frame pixel to a surfel in the model. As the reconstruction progresses, surfel color and position are the average of all observations. Our proposed algorithm is designed to enhance position discontinuities and to produce sharper colors, to facilitate subsequent segmentation steps on the 3D model. During reconstruction, several colors and positions are tracked for each surfel. Only at the end of reconstruction phase the most frequent value is chosen through a Winner Takes All policy. The result has been compared to the standard averaging policy of reconstruction algorithms. Experiments have been performed using both Flood Fill and Supervoxel-LCCP segmentation and by applying two segmentation evaluation metrics. Results show that the proposed method is suitable to enhance a surfel-based model for object segmentation purposes.",

The system is based on a Monte-Carlo Localization system that uses RGBD odometry for the prediction stage. The update step takes into account the sewer network topology for discarding wrong hypotheses. Moreover, this step is further refined whenever a discrete element of the network (i.e. manhole) is detected. To this end, another RGBD camera pointing upwards is used for precise manhole detection. A Convolutional Neural Network has been successfully trained for classifying images with and without manholes with 96% accuracy over the tested dataset. The complete system has been validated with real data obtained from the sewers of Barcelona yielding accurate localization results. All the logs and code used in the context of this paper are publicly available.",

Our experiments in the RGB-D TUM dataset [34] effectively show a better accuracy and robustness in CPU real time than direct RGB-D SLAM systems that make use of the GPU. The key ingredients of our approach are mainly two. Firstly, the combination of a semi-dense photometric and dense geometric error for the pose tracking (see Figure 1), which we demonstrate to be the most accurate alternative. And secondly, a model of the multi-view constraints and their errors in the mapping and tracking threads, which adds extra information over other approaches. We release the open-source implementation of our approach1. The reader is referred to a video with our results 2 for a more illustrative visualization of its performance.",

        "abstract": "Exploring and mapping previously unknown environments while avoiding collisions with obstacles is a fundamental task for autonomous robots. In scenarios where this needs to be done rapidly, multi-rotors are a good choice for the task, as they can cover ground at potentially very high velocities. Flying at high velocities, however, implies the ability to rapidly plan trajectories and to react to new information quickly. In this paper, we propose an extension to classical frontier-based exploration that facilitates exploration at high speeds. The extension consists of a reactive mode in which the multi-rotor rapidly selects a goal frontier from its field of view. The goal frontier is selected in a way that minimizes the change in velocity necessary to reach it. While this approach can increase the total path length, it significantly reduces the exploration time, since the multi-rotor can fly at consistently higher speeds.",

In such cases, it is desirable for the robot to achieve a given high-level task despite interference. Ideally, the robot must decide its next action as it observes the changes in the world, i.e. act reactively. In this paper, we consider a reactive planning problem for finite robotic tasks with resource constraints. The task is represented using a temporal logic for finite behaviors and the robot must achieve the task using limited resources under all possible finite sequences of moves of other agents. We present a formulation for this problem and an approach based on quantitative games. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through a manipulation case study.",

In this paper, we develop a trajectory generation algorithm for a vehicle in an unknown environment with wind disturbances, that relies only on the vehicle's on-board distance sensors and communication with other vehicles within a finite region to generate a smooth, collision-free trajectory. The proposed trajectory generation algorithm can be used in conjunction with high-level planners and low-level motion controllers, as demonstrated. The algorithm provides guarantees that the trajectory does not violate the vehicle's thrust limitation, sensor constraints, or a user-defined clearance radius around other vehicles and obstacles. Simulation results of two quadrotors moving through an unknown building environment with obstacles demonstrates the trajectory generation performance.",

        "abstract": "The ability to drive autonomously in heterogeneous environments without GPS, pattern identification (e.g. road following), or artificial landmarks is key to field robotics. To address this challenge, we present a complete waypoint navigation framework for unmanned ground vehicles. A Velodyne PUCK VLP-16 LiDAR and an IMU are mounted on an autonomous, full size utility vehicle and used for localization within a previously created base map. We redesign a six degrees of freedom LiDAR SLAM algorithm to achieve 3D localization on the base map, as well as real-time vehicle navigation. We fuse the low-frequency, high precision SLAM updates with high-frequency, odometric local state estimates from the vehicle. The navigation costmap consists of a 2D occupancy grid which is computed from the 3D base map. Relying on this setup, the vehicle is capable of navigating through a complex site completely autonomously. The test site has densely and sparsely built areas, bushland, industrial activities, pedestrians, and other manned or unmanned vehicles. Extensive testing was done using both current and outdated base maps for comparisons, and a high precision RTK-GPS was used for ground truth. So far, more than 60 km of completely autonomous driving has been performed without a single system or navigation failure.",

        "abstract": "Elderly people have particular needs in performing bathing activities, since these tasks require body flexibility. Our aim is to build an assistive robotic bath system, in order to increase the independence and safety of this procedure. Towards this end, the expertise of professional carers for bathing sequences and appropriate motions has to be adopted, in order to achieve natural, physical human - robot interaction. In this paper, a real-time end-effector motion planning method for an assistive bath robot, using on-line Point-Cloud information, is proposed. The visual feedback obtained from Kinect depth sensor is employed to adapt suitable washing paths to the user's body part motion and deformable surface. We make use of a navigation function-based controller, with guarantied globally uniformly asymptotic stability, and bijective transformations for the adaptation of the paths. Experiments were conducted with a rigid rectangular object for validation purposes, while a female subject took part to the experiment in order to evaluate and demonstrate the basic concepts of the proposed methodology.",

It becomes even more important for a shared control vehicle like an electric wheeled walker, since the safety of the vehicle and the user depend on the correct classification of obstacles. This work describes a method for pose estimation of four-wheeled vehicles, which utilizes the fixed resolution of digital elevation maps to generate a detailed vehicle model. The vehicle's wheels are also approximated using digital elevation maps, allowing efficient calculation of wheel to ground contact points and therefore fast and accurate estimation of valid vehicle poses. To evaluate the proposed method, pose estimates are compared to three datasets including ground truth poses: one created using an external tracking system and two created by simulations of wheeled robots. It is also shown that the method is fast enough for real time operation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Dexterous manipulation has broad applications in assembly lines, warehouses and agriculture. To perform large-scale manipulation tasks for various objects, a multi-fingered robotic hand sometimes has to sequentially adjust its grasping gestures, i.e. the finger gaits, to address the workspace limits and guarantee the object stability. However, realizing finger gaits planning in dexterous manipulation is challenging due to the complicated grasp quality metrics, uncertainties on object shapes and dynamics (mass and moment of inertia), and unexpected slippage under uncertain contact dynamics. In this paper, a dual-stage optimization based planner is proposed to handle these challenges. In the first stage, a velocity-level finger gaits planner is introduced by combining object grasp quality with hand manipulability. The proposed finger gaits planner is computationally efficient and realizes finger gaiting without 3D model of the object. In the second stage, a robust manipulation controller using robust control and force optimization is proposed to address object dynamics uncertainties and external disturbances. The dual-stage planner is able to guarantee stability under unexpected slippage caused by uncertain contact dynamics. Moreover, it does not require velocity measurement or expensive 3D/6D tactile sensors. The proposed dual-stage optimization based planner is verified by simulations on Mujoco. The simulation video is available at [1].",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel real-time method for tracking salient closed boundaries from video image sequences. This method operates on a set of straight line segments that are produced by line detection. The tracking scheme is coherently integrated into a perceptual grouping framework in which the visual tracking problem is tackled by identifying a subset of these line segments and connecting them sequentially to form a closed boundary with the largest saliency and a certain similarity to the previous one. Specifically, we define a new tracking criterion which combines a grouping cost and an area similarity constraint. The proposed criterion makes the resulting boundary tracking more robust to local minima. To achieve real-time tracking performance, we use Delaunay Triangulation to build a graph model with the detected line segments and then reduce the tracking problem to finding the optimal cycle in this graph. This is solved by our newly proposed closed boundary candidates searching algorithm called \u201cBidirectional Shortest Path (BDSP)\u201d. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are tested on real video sequences as well as during a robot arm pouring experiment.",

Current trajectory generation methods for multicopters achieve high success rates in cluttered environments, but assume that the environment is static and require prior knowledge of the map. In the presented study, we use the results of such planners and extend them with a local replanning algorithm that can handle unmodeled (possibly dynamic) obstacles while keeping the MAV close to the global trajectory. To ensure that the proposed approach is real-time capable, we maintain information about the environment around the MAV in an occupancy grid stored in a three-dimensional circular buffer, which moves together with a drone, and represent the trajectories by using uniform B-splines. This representation ensures that the trajectory is sufficiently smooth and simultaneously allows for efficient optimization.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach to enlarge the impedance range of admittance-type haptic interfaces. Admittance-type haptic interfaces have advantages over impedance-type haptic interfaces in the interaction with high impedance virtual environments. However, the performance of admittance-type haptic interfaces is often limited by the lower boundary of the impedance that can be achieved without stability issue. Especially, it is well known that low value of inertia in an admittance model often causes unstable interaction. This paper extends recently proposed input-to-state stable approach [1] to further lower down the achievable impedance in admittance-type haptic interfaces with less conservative constraint compared with the passivity-based approaches. The primary challenge was identifying the nonlinear hysteresis components which are essential for the implementation of the input-to-state stable approach. Through experimental investigation and after separating and merging the admittance model and the position controller, the partial admittance model (from the measured human force to the desired velocity) and the velocity controller (from the velocity tracking error to the controller force) were found having counter-clockwise hysteresis nonlinear behavior. Therefore, it allows implementing the one-port input-to-state stable (ISS) approach for making both components dissipative and ISS. An additional advantage of the proposed ISS approach is the easiness of the implementation. No model information is required, and the network representation is not necessary, unlike the passivity-based approaches. Series of experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach in term of significantly lowering the achievable impedance value compared with what the time-domain passivity approach can render.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile microrobots can be used as on-chip remote micromanipulation tools to handle with delicate samples, such as cells and biological tissues. Many efforts have been made to improve microrobots actuation, controllability and power consumption. However, stiction phenomena occurring between the robot and the substrate on which it is moving are still a big issue to deal with. In this paper stiction problem is addressed with a new approach. To begin, the two contact surfaces are coated with low friction materials combination (Al2O3/Si3N4) and different roughnesses are taken into account, in order to find the best combination and to ensure uniform sample conditions. Tests have been made, proving that a rough bottom surface of microrobots moving on a Si3N4 coated glass substrate minimizes stiction events. Starting from this surface combination, the powering algorithm of the electromagnetic field generation system is changed: oscillations perpendicular to the robot trajectory are added to the standard actuation power to overcome static friction while parallel ones are used to avoid dynamic friction, which speeds down the robot. The new powering algorithm is adapted in realtime by visually tracked position and speed of the microrobots. Both the fabrication process flow and the powering algorithm are fully described in the paper. Coatings and adaptive powering show promising results: they manage to reach a long time closed-loop position control stability of the microrobot and they can be applied to find the smoothest path between two points after having performed a surface scanning to map the in-plane stiction distributions. Enhanced position control accuracy and the demonstrated robustness in long term motion control through the proposed approaches could be an important asset to on-chip microrobots toward their biological or micromanufacturing applications.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes an online foot position compensator (FPC) for improving the robustness of biped walking. The proposed FPC learns foot placement parameters through sensory feedback and preview control theory to re-plan the trajectories of the center of mass (CoM) and gait pattern; the re-plan is based on the online generation of a walking pattern using the policy gradient reinforcement learning method (PGRL) to reject external perturbations and recover the walking position. A method of upper-body posture control is also presented to further improve the ability of humanoid robots to suppress external disturbances. The proposed posture controller stabilizes the robot by utilizing hip joints to modulate the upper-body posture in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated by simulations on a full-body NAO humanoid robot.",

Our key idea is to use the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the Complex Morlet wavelet to transform force signals into feature vectors amenable to machine learning algorithms. Our method uses these feature vectors to train a classifier that recognizes different actions. We demonstrate our approach in a system that records human activities with an instrumented set of tongs. Our system successfully identifies a wide range of actions based on a small set of labeled examples.",

We proposed a Recursive Neural Network model, which takes the user instructions and data acquired by laser range finder as input, and outputs control velocities to make the mobile robot navigate in an unknown indoor environment. Instructions are using commonly verbal expressions, and instead of establishing models to represent the semantic meanings, we use the concept of word vectors to feed the information directly into the neural network models. Using human-controlled navigating records as training data, robots learn how to execute navigations according to various of different instructions. Experiments were conducted under both simulation and real world environments, and results show that the robot can successfully navigate to the goal positions without having any prior knowledge about the environments.",

The improvements enable robots to do robust regrasp planning using 10,000s of grasps and their relationships in interactive time.

        "abstract": "This paper reports the electrostatic regulation of surface traction of a quadruped soft robot to improve its locomotion efficiency. The soft robot, containing five pneumatic channel networks (PneuNets) in different parts of its body, is actuated to achieve undulated locomotion. Electrostatic adhesion is applied to the bottom surface of each robot leg, by using a thin elastomeric adhesion pad embedded with interdigitated comb electrodes. The adhesion pad is fully compatible with the soft robot structure, and is able to adjust the level of surface traction on the robot leg during locomotion. We calibrate the adhesion force generated by the pad as a function of its size and the applied electrostatic voltage. We demonstrate the control of the moving direction and speed of the soft robot on horizontal surfaces with different frictional and electrical characteristics, by adjusting the level of electrostatic adhesion. With the electrostatic traction control, the robot can also climbing up an inclined metal surface with a low coefficient of friction, which cannot be achieved by the same robot without adhesion pads. This work illustrates the important role of surface friction on locomotion of the soft robot, and provides an efficient solution to surface traction control of soft robots.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) depends critically on the choice of reward functions used to capture the desired behavior and constraints of a robot. Usually, these are handcrafted by a expert designer and represent heuristics for relatively simple tasks. Real world applications typically involve more complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structure. In this paper we take advantage of the expressive power of temporal logic (TL) to specify complex rules the robot should follow, and incorporate domain knowledge into learning. We propose Truncated Linear Temporal Logic (TLTL) as a specification language, We propose Truncated Linear Temporal Logic (TLTL) as a specification language, that is arguably well suited for the robotics applications, We show in simulated trials that learning is faster and policies obtained using the proposed approach outperform the ones learned using heuristic rewards in terms of the robustness degree, i.e., how well the tasks are satisfied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed RL approach in a toast-placing task learned by a Baxter robot.",

We study the hardness of two different relay placement problems: 1) a chain formation of multiple relay robots to transmit information from an operator to a single unit; and 2) a spanning tree of relays connecting multiple remote units to the operator. We first build a communication map data structure from a layered graph that contains the positions of the relays as the unit moves. This structure is computed once and reused throughout the mission, significantly reducing plan re-computation time when compared to the best-known solution in the literature. Second, we create a min-arborescence tree that forms a connected component among the operator, relays, and units, and that has an optimal communication cost. Finally, we validate our ideas through software simulations, hardware experiments, and a comparison of our approach to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "In this work we present a new robotic system, Salto-1P, for exploring extreme jumping locomotion. Salto-1P weighs 0.098 kg, and has an active leg length of 14.4 cm. The robot is able to perform a standing vertical leap of 1.25 m, continuously hop to heights over 1 m, and jump over 2 m horizontally. Salto-1P uses aerodynamic thrusters and an inertial tail to control its attitude in the air. A linearized Raibert step controller was sufficient to enable unconstrained in-place hopping and forwards-backwards locomotion with external position feedback. We present studies of extreme jumping locomotion in which the robot spends just 7.7% of its time on the ground, experiencing accelerations of 14 times earth gravity in its stance phase. An experimentally collected dataset of 772 observed jumps was used to establish the range of achievable horizontal and vertical impulses for Salto-1P.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a core element of every autonomous mobile robot. The underlying engine of a SLAM system is its back-end, which aims at optimally estimating the trajectory and map of the environment based on sensor data abstractions. Over the past decade, SLAM solutions based on graph optimization approaches prevailed over the filtering based solutions, since they dominated in performance over a wider range of applications. In this paper we propose a novel filtering based SLAM back-end based on the exactly sparse delayed state filter (ESDSF) derived on Lie groups (LG-ESDSF). The proposed filter retains all the good characteristics of the classic ESDSF, but also respects the state space geometry by employing filtering equations directly on Lie groups. We have compared our SLAM system with two current state-of-the-art SLAM solutions, namely ORB-SLAM and LSD-SLAM, on the KITTI vision benchmark suite. Test results show that the proposed SLAM based on the LG-ESDSF back-end can achieve same level of accuracy as the methods based on the graph optimization techniques, while maintaining lower computation times.",

        "abstract": "Occupancy grid maps are a popular method for representing the environment in the context of robot navigation tasks. However, occupancy grid maps can have a high memory demand that grows quadratically with the range of the sensor. In this paper, we introduce a memory-efficient map representation that is based on a constant set of individual scans. To make these scan-based maps suitable for autonomous robot navigation, we propose probabilistically sound methods for both mapping and localization. To solve the mapping problem, our approach incrementally selects scans based on the additional information they provide relative to the scans previously selected. Using these selected scans, we perform an Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) approach with a sensor model optimized for the scan-based representation of our map. We present extensive experiments in which we evaluate our approach using real world data recorded in a garage parking scenario with an autonomous car as well as a robot localization problem in an indoor environment. The results demonstrate that our approach can cope with high sensor noise and that it achieves comparable localization accuracy while at the same time consuming only a fraction of memory compared to regular occupancy grid maps.",

Control inputs for both subtasks are provided by the human operator. The commands are projected onto the spaces of subtasks using a command mapping strategy. Analogously, measured interacting forces are projected onto the space of feedback signals, provided to the human via wearable fingertip haptic devices through a feedback mapping strategy.

We present plume front and cross sectional survey results, where the robot is driven along visible plume boundaries and plume cross sections, respectively. Datasets collected during the experiments are shown together with statistical parameters that quantify the fine-scale plume structure. Experimental evidence shows that the assumption of the existence of a continuous and fixed-value concentration curve used in existing theoretical work for plume front tracking appears too strong for real ocean plumes. The datasets provide characteristic parameters that can be used for further development and verification of simulation models of ocean pollution plumes.",

While there have been some successes in robotics using deep learning, it has not been widely adopted. In this paper, we present a novel robotic grasp detection system that predicts the best grasping pose of a parallel-plate robotic gripper for novel objects using the RGB-D image of the scene. The proposed model uses a deep convolutional neural network to extract features from the scene and then uses a shallow convolutional neural network to predict the grasp configuration for the object of interest. Our multi-modal model achieved an accuracy of 89.21% on the standard Cornell Grasp Dataset and runs at real-time speeds. This redefines the state-of-the-art for robotic grasp detection.",

        "abstract": "As robotic systems become more popular in household environments, the complexity of required tasks also increases. In this work we focus on a domestic chore deemed dull by a majority of the population, the task of ironing. The presented algorithm improves on the limited number of previous works by joining 3D perception with force/torque sensing, with emphasis on finding a practical solution with a feasible implementation in a domestic setting. Our algorithm obtains a point cloud representation of the working environment. From this point cloud, the garment is segmented and a custom Wrinkleness Local Descriptor (WiLD) is computed to determine the location of the present wrinkles. Using this descriptor, the most suitable ironing path is computed and, based on it, the manipulation algorithm performs the force-controlled ironing operation. Experiments have been performed with a humanoid robot platform, proving that our algorithm is able to detect successfully wrinkles present in garments and iteratively reduce the wrinkleness using an unmodified iron.",

        "abstract": "Robot assisted surgery has become increasingly popular with the rapid development of more sophisticated robotic systems. Nevertheless, there are still many tedious surgical tasks that remain to be performed manually by surgeons with high supervisions. One example is to tie a surgical knot during the surgery, which includes the processes of needle threading, suture looping, suture tail grasping and suture pulling. In this research, we present a new method for robotic suture looping process. This method is based on a spatial trajectory planning for the surgical instruments, where challenges such as suture slippage and potential collisions between the instruments could be eliminated. In contrast to conventional looping process, a dynamic control scheme is proposed to optimize the time and workspace required to complete the process. Vision information is incorporated in order to enable closed loop control of the robotic system with Linear Quadratic (LQ) controller. A series of experiments were conducted in order to examine the performance of the proposed control scheme and the results confirmed that surgical knots can be successfully tied robotically, offering new insights to the field of automated robotassisted surgery.",

        "abstract": "To ensure system integrity, robots need to proactively avoid any unwanted physical perturbation that may cause damage to the underlying hardware. In this paper, we investigate a machine learning approach that allows robots to anticipate impending physical perturbations from perceptual cues. In contrast to other approaches that require knowledge about sources of perturbation to be encoded before deployment, our method is based on experiential learning. Robots learn to associate visual cues with subsequent physical perturbations and contacts. In turn, these extracted visual cues are then used to predict potential future perturbations acting on the robot. To this end, we introduce a novel deep network architecture which combines multiple sub-networks for dealing with robot dynamics and perceptual input from the environment. We present a self-supervised approach for training the system that does not require any labeling of training data. Extensive experiments in a human-robot interaction task show that a robot can learn to predict physical contact by a human interaction partner without any prior information or labeling.",

        "abstract": "Modern automation demands mobile robots to be robustly localized in complex scenarios. Current localization systems typically use maps that require to be built and interpreted by experienced operators, increasing deployment costs as well as reducing the adaptability of robots to rearrangements in the environment. In contrast, architectural floor plans can be easily understood by non-expert users and typically represent only the non-rearrangeable parts of buildings. In this paper we propose a system for robot localization in architectural CAD drawings. Our method employs a simultaneous localization and mapping approach to online augment the floor plan with a map represented as a pose-graph with LiDAR measurements. Whenever the environment is accurately mapped in the vicinity of the robot, we use the graph to perform relative localization. We thoroughly evaluate our system in challenging real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that our method is able to robustly track the robot pose even when the floor plan shows major discrepancies from the real-world. We show that our system achieves sub-centimeter accuracy and is suitable for real-time application.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the question of measuring attitude using magnetometer-equipped Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) when in the presence of magnetic disturbance. Specifically, for use in micro-observational class underwater vehicles. Such vehicles' small size and mobility suit activities in coral reefs but often face significant magnetic interference due to high metal debris content, especially in artificial reefs. Their small size also means motor thrusters are situated closer to the magnetometers, producing additional interference. An Adaptive Indirect Kalman Filter is proposed that uses IMU and motor speed measurements to deal with two main sources of disturbances: magnetic fields from foreign objects, and from the vehicle's own motors rotating in slow speed. The method has been evaluated using a custom underwater vehicle made in HKUST, and results show that the proposed method is able to obtain accurate orientation representations even when approaching objects with strong magnetic fields or when the motors are producing interference by rotating in slow speeds.",

Inspired by the pendulumlike movements in gibbons' arboreal locomotion, the controllers are designed to synchronize the brachiator with a virtual oscillator. Two schemes are proposed: a model-dependent feedback linearization scheme and a sliding-mode scheme that is independent of the system model. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed schemes are robust to the arbitrary initial configurations of the brachiator and the limitation in the motor torque at the elbow joint. Furthermore, both controllers enable the underactuated robot to brachiate along a structural member with an upward slope.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Ropeways must be stopped when there is strong cross-wind because the ensuing oscillations are a safety risk. In this paper, we developed a controller for an actuated mass onboard the gondola aiming to increase the gondola's damping, thus reducing the oscillations and permitting operation to continue. We modeled the gondola as a pendulum, acknowledged the limitation on the actuated mass' displacement, and included input and parametric uncertainty. We synthesized the controller through a two-step process. First, we used numerical optimization to compute a static full state feedback controller specifically designed to reduce the effects that cross-wind gusts and random disturbances have on the gondola. For this purpose, we included a wind model in the cost function. Then, we used this controller in a model to synthesize an H\u221e controller with reduced actuator requirements. Analysis of the linearized system showed that the proposed H\u221e controller robustly stabilized the system despite the modeled uncertainty. Furthermore, it made the peak magnitude of the gondola's oscillations in the median of 1005 simulations 51.4 percent less than that of the uncontrolled system, and 19.3 percent less than that of the system using a passive dynamic vibration absorber.",

In this context, we compare the weighted voter model [25] with a three-valued model that incorporates an intermediate belief state meaning either `uncertain' or `indifferent'. We focus particularly on the trade-off between speed of convergence to a shared belief, and robustness to the presence of unreliable individuals in the population. By means of both simulation and embodied experiments in real robot swarms of 400 Kilobots, we show that the three-valued model is much more robust than the weighted voter model, but with decreased speed of convergence.",

Even though our method is independent of the edge detection algorithm, we show that the use of state-of-the-art machine-learned edges gives significant improvements in terms of robustness and accuracy compared to standard edge detection methods. In contrast to approaches that heavily rely on the photo-consistency assumption, edges are less influenced by lighting changes and the sparse edge representation offers a larger convergence basin while the pose estimates are also very fast to compute. Further, we introduce a measure for tracking quality, which we use to determine when to insert a new key frame. We show the feasibility of our system on real-world datasets and extensively evaluate on standard benchmark sequences to demonstrate the performance in a wide variety of scenes and camera motions. Our framework runs in real-time on the CPU of a laptop computer and is available online.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to leverage magnetic information from a Magneto-Inertial Measurement Unit - an IMU sensor augmented with an array of magnetometers, called MIMU hereafter - in a vision/inertial navigation system (VINS). This ego-motion estimation problem is formulated as an optimization over a sliding window fusing data from the MIMU with features tracked in a monocular camera image stream. The novelty of our approach lies in the formulation of preintegrated magnetic measurements that are computed from successive measurements of the local variations of the magnetic field, in the line of the preintegration of IMU data introduced in [1]. The resulting magnetic error terms participate to the minimized cost function along with the classical reprojection and IMU error terms. Our experiments show the benefits of this fusion. On the one hand, the added magnetic information from the MIMU allows to complement the VINS in cases where vision does not provide useful information during an extended period of time; on the other hand, vision does extend the operational domain of the navigation system compared to a pure MIMU solution, in particular for the outdoor portions of the trajectory.",

Due to the non-linearity of VINS, a poor initialization can severely impact the performance of either filtering-based or graph-based methods. Our approach starts with a vision-only structure from motion (SfM) to build the up-to-scale structure of camera poses and feature positions. By loosely aligning this structure with pre-integrated IMU measurements, our approach recovers the metric scale, velocity, gravity vector, and gyroscope bias, which are treated as initial values to bootstrap the nonlinear tightly-coupled optimization framework. We highlight that our approach can perform on-the-fly initialization in various scenarios without using any prior information about system states and movement. The performance of the proposed approach is verified through the public UAV dataset and real-time onboard experiment. We make our implementation open source, which is the initialization part integrated in the VINS-Mono1.",

The original Mean-Shift algorithm has been improved in three ways. First, a color-depth Joint Probability Density Function is proposed for taking into account both depth and color information. Secondly, we propose an occlusion detection mechanism which can handle long-term occlusions even when objects move fast and unpredictably. Finally, when multiple views are available, we combine the tracking outcomes from all the RGB-D sensors in our network to deal with the identity confusion problem and enhance the overall tracking performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust, realtime and has yielded a marked improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art in terms of tracking quality. As a further contribution, we released our work as open-source in order to provide the best benefit to the wide Computer Vision and Robotics community.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, applications of visual tracking algorithms has seen a substantial growth with deployments in intelligent robots such as drones for human tracking. The algorithms for such tasks has to be efficient in terms of computational cost while been robust, accurate and fast. Object tracking algorithms based on handcrafted heuristics and constraints are widely used in uav applications. The handcrafted heuristics are mostly implemented for task-oriented applications which limits the extensions in uav's capability beyond the predefined functions. This paper considers the challenges of tracking and landing an autonomous uav on a speed high moving target, and presents a visual tracking algorithm that integrates correlation filters with deep comparison network for real-time tracking with state-of-the-art accuracy. The method first tracks the target upto translation using an online learnt model via local search technique. The changes in scale is estimated by a deep comparison network (DCN) instead of the commonly used pyramidal approach. In a single network evaluation, DCN can estimate the changes in scale as well as compensate the drifting of the tracker by refining the object region estimated by the correlation filters. The network is end-to-end trained which attempts to learn a powerful matching function for object localization using a known template. Generally, the integrated framework can be viewed as coarse-to-fine level motion estimation. Moreover, the framework can redetect the lost target without a need for a separate detector.",

To this end, we introduce an invariant, compact gesture representation which facilitates robust and efficient online gesture recognition even for very small training data sets. The proposed two-stage recognition approach permits reliable gesture classification as well as convenient parameter extraction in the presence of typical disturbances affecting TSSs attached to manipulator links.

A numerical approach is introduced to compute the invariance function for constraints with arbitrary relative degree. The method is then applied to robot force control, enhancing force regulation performance, in terms of steady state error and convergence speed, despite model mismatch and measurement noise. Its effectiveness is experimentally validated and compared to previous results of set invariance control on a hybrid force/position task performed with a 6 degrees of freedom industrial robot equipped with a force/torque sensor.",

By leveraging ORB-SLAM [1], the proposed system consists of stereo matching, frame tracking, local mapping, loop detection, and bundle adjustment of both point and line features. In particular, as the main theoretical contributions of this paper, we, for the first time, employ the orthonormal representation as the minimal parameterization to model line features along with point features in visual SLAM and analytically derive the Jacobians of the re-projection errors with respect to the line parameters, which significantly improves the SLAM solution. The proposed SLAM has been extensively tested in both synthetic and real-world experiments whose results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Event cameras are a new technology that can enable low-latency, fast visual sensing in dynamic environments towards faster robotic vision as they respond only to changes in the scene and have a very high temporal resolution (<; 1\u03bcs). Moving targets produce dense spatio-temporal streams of events that do not suffer from information loss \u201cbetween frames\u201d, which can occur when traditional cameras are used to track fast-moving targets. Event-based tracking algorithms need to be able to follow the target position within the spatio-temporal data, while rejecting clutter events that occur as a robot moves in a typical office setting. We introduce a particle filter with the aim to be robust to temporal variation that occurs as the camera and the target move with different relative velocities, which can lead to a loss in visual information and missed detections. The proposed system provides a more persistent tracking compared to prior state-of-the-art, especially when the robot is actively following a target with its gaze. Experiments are performed on the iCub humanoid robot performing ball tracking and gaze following.",

Furthermore, we introduce a task space decomposition approach which removes the coupling effects between contact force controller and the other non-contact controllers. Finally, we verify our control performance on a quadruped robot and compare its performance to a standard inverse dynamics approach on hardware.",

        "abstract": "Scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been widely used for characterization and manipulation in micro/nano field. However, existing SEMs can only provide images for samples from one single direction. This limitation sometimes would lead to misleading results. In order to provide multidirectional SEM imaging, a nanorobotic manipulation system with a rotation robot is designed and integrated with SEM. During the robot's rotation, samples fixed on the robot can be viewed by SEM from multi-direction, instead of one direction. The rotation robot is able to rotate 360\u00b0 along one rotation axis. To facilitate the multidirectional imaging, an automatic alignment method is put forward. This automatic alignment is to align samples to the rotation robot's rotation axis, so that during rotation, samples wouldn't move out of SEM's field of view (FOV). Alignment results are given to justify the proposed alignment method. Magnetic wires have been observed from multi-direction to demonstrate the nanorobotic manipulation system's potential application in mic.ro/nano defect study.",

Existing approaches that tackle the problem of semantic motion segmentation consist of long multistage pipelines and typically require several seconds to process each frame. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network architecture that learns to predict both the object label and motion status of each pixel in an image. Given a pair of consecutive images, the network learns to fuse features from self-generated optical flow maps and semantic segmentation kernels to yield pixel-wise semantic motion labels. We also introduce the Cityscapes-Motion dataset which contains over 2,900 manually annotated semantic motion labels, which is the largest dataset of its kind so far. We demonstrate that our network outperforms existing approaches achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset, as well as in the more challenging Cityscapes-Motion dataset while being substantially faster than existing techniques.",

        "abstract": "Small 3D LIDAR and a multimodal-based localization are fundamentally important for autonomous robots. This paper describes presentation and demonstration of a sensor and a method for LIDAR-image based localization. Our small LIDAR, named SPAD LIDAR, uses a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD). The SPAD LIDAR incorporates laser receiver and environmental light receiver in a single chip. Therefore, the sensor simultaneously outputs range data and monocular image data. By virtue of this structure, the sensor requires no external calibration between range data and monocular image data. Based on this sensor, we introduce a localization method using a deep convolutional neural network (SPAD DCNN), which fuses SPAD LIDAR outputs: range data, monocular image data, and peak intensity data. Our method regresses LIDAR's position in an environment. We also introduce improved SPAD DCNN, designated as Fast SPAD DCNN. To reduce the computational demands of SPAD DCNN, Fast SPAD DCNN integrates range data and peak intensity data. The integrated data reduces runtime without greatly increasing localization error compared to the conventional method. We evaluate our SPAD DCNN and Fast SPAD DCNN localization method in indoor environments and compare its performance. Results show that SPAD DCNN and Fast SPAD DCNN improve localization in terms of accuracy and runtime.",

        "abstract": "Active depth cameras suffer from several limitations, which cause incomplete and noisy depth maps, and may consequently affect the performance of RGB-D Odometry. To address this issue, this paper presents a visual odometry method based on point and line features that leverages both measurements from a depth sensor and depth estimates from camera motion. Depth estimates are generated continuously by a probabilistic depth estimation framework for both types of features to compensate for the lack of depth measurements and inaccurate feature depth associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of triangulating depth from both point and line observations to validate and obtain precise estimates. Furthermore, depth measurements are exploited by propagating them through a depth map registration module and using a frame-to-frame motion estimation method that considers 3D-to-2D and 2D-to-3D reprojection errors, independently. Results on RGB-D sequences captured on large indoor and outdoor scenes, where depth sensor limitations are critical, show that the combination of depth measurements and estimates through our approach is able to overcome the absence and inaccuracy of depth measurements.",

        "abstract": "In order to perform autonomous sequential manipulation tasks, perception in cluttered scenes remains a critical challenge for robots. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach for robust sequential scene estimation and manipulation - Sequential Scene Understanding and Manipulation (SUM). SUM considers uncertainty due to discriminative object detection and recognition in the generative estimation of the most likely object poses maintained over time to achieve a robust estimation of the scene under heavy occlusions and unstructured environment. Our method utilizes candidates from discriminative object detector and recognizer to guide the generative process of sampling scene hypothesis, and each scene hypotheses is evaluated against the observations. Also SUM maintains beliefs of scene hypothesis over robot physical actions for better estimation and against noisy detections. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our approach is able to perform robust estimation and manipulation.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of selecting from a choice of possible grasps, so that impact forces will be minimised if a collision occurs while the robot is moving the grasped object along a post-grasp trajectory. Such considerations are important for safety in human-robot interaction, where even a certified \u201chuman-safe\u201d (e.g. compliant) arm may become hazardous once it grasps and begins moving an object, which may have significant mass, sharp edges or other dangers. Additionally, minimising collision forces is critical to preserving longevity of robots which operate in uncertain and hazardous environments, e.g. robots deployed for nuclear decommissioning, where removing a damaged robot from a contaminated zone for repairs may be extremely difficult and costly. Also, unwanted collisions between a robot and critical infrastructure (e.g. pipework) in such high-consequence environments can be disastrous. In this paper we investigate how the safety of the post-grasp motion can be considered during the pre-grasp approach phase, so that the selected grasp is optimal in terms of applying minimum impact forces if a collision occurs during the desired post-grasp manipulation. We build on the methods of augmented robot-object dynamic model and \u201ceffective mass\u201d and propose a method for combining these concepts with modern grasp and trajectory planners, to enable the robot to achieve a grasp which maximises the safety of the post-grasp trajectory, by minimising potential collision forces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several experiments with both simulated and real robots.",

Rather than using an evenly distributed spatial seeding procedure, our method uses visual saliency to guide the process of supervoxel generation. This results in densely distributed, small, and precise supervoxels in salient regions which often contain objects, and larger supervoxels in less salient regions that often correspond to background. Our approach largely improves the quality of the resulting supervoxel segmentation in terms of boundary recall and under-segmentation error on publicly available benchmarks.",

In this paper, a 7-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) redundant robotic system consisting of a 6-DOF manipulator and a 1-DOF turntable is used for the industrial inspection problem. A Set Covering Problem (SCP) is formulated to select suitable viewpoints that satisfy the inspection requirements, and a Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP) is formulated to determine both the robot poses and the visiting sequences. While previous studies solve the two problems separately, we formulate the SCP and GTSP problems as a combined sequencing SC-GTSP problem. A Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (RKGA) is then used to solve the combined SC-GTSP problem in a one-step optimization process. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we applied the proposed method to several motion planning cases. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous approaches by requiring up to 28.1% less total inspection time.",

        "abstract": "Camera-based navigation within a given three-dimensional map enables heterogeneous robotic systems to share maps and use more abstract environment models like floor plans. This paper builds upon our previous work, and addresses the problem of how to combine 3D distance information from the map and the current visual image from the robot's camera in order to navigate within this map. The underlying assumption is that features which cause depth changes are also likely to create visual gradients. Based on this assumption, the similarity of visual image and depth images that are synthesized from the 3D map can be used to evaluate pose hypothesis. This paper integrates this idea into a Monte Carlo localization approach and additionally presents its application to path following. The presented approach is evaluated on a synthetic datasets that provides perfect knowledge of the ground truth, as well as two real-world datasets acquired by a heterogeneous robotic team: a proof-of-concept dataset in a scattered indoor environment, and a challenging corridor dataset.",

With few exceptions, such approaches only admit simple constraints and objectives, such as collision-avoidance and reaching a goal state. In this work we leverage the best of two worlds: the scalability of sampling-based motion planning and the precise formal guarantees of temporal logic. We present an incremental sampling-based algorithm that synthesizes a motion control policy satisfying a bounded Signal Temporal Logic formula over properties of a given environment. Our key insight is that we can bias the selection of samples using a quantitative measure of how well the best path in the current tree of samples satisfies the specification. This allows us both to converge to a path that satisfies the specification, and to improve upon an existing path, i.e. to satisfy the specification with maximum robustness. We illustrate the performance of our method in several case studies.",

Furthermore, a novel leveraged cost function is proposed to represent a policy function using deep neural networks by reformulating the objective function of leveraged Gaussian process regression using the representer theorem.

By using a sparse version of the state's information matrix, we are able to improve the high computational cost of examination of all candidate actions. We also present an in-depth analysis for the general case of approximated decision making, and use it in order to set bounds over the induced error in potential revenue. The scalability of the method allows balancing between the degree of sparsification and the tolerance for this error, in order to maximize its benefits. The approach differs from recent methods by focusing on improving the decision making process directly, and not as a byproduct of a sparsification of the state inference. Eventually, we demonstrate the superiority of the approach in a SLAM simulation, where we manage to maintain the accuracy of the solution, while demonstrating a significant improvement in run time.",

        "abstract": "Efficient exploration of unknown terrains by extraterrestrial rovers requires the development of strategies that reduce the entropy in the geological classification of a given terrain. Without such intelligent strategies, teleoperation of the rover is reliant either on human intuition or on the exhaustive exploration of the entire terrain. This paper highlights the use of low-resolution reconnaissance using satellite imagery to generate plans for rovers that reduce the overall uncertainty in the various geological classes. This becomes pivotal when exploration to collect diverse samples is resource constrained through exploration budgets and transmission bandwidths. We put forward two major contributions - a science-aware planner that uses information gain and a novel method of estimating this information gain. We propose an exploration strategy, based on the Multi-Heuristic A*, to solve the trade-off between optimizing path lengths and geological exploration through Pareto-optimal solutions. We show that our algorithm, which explicitly uses projected entropy-reduction in planning, significantly outperforms science-agnostic approaches and other science-aware strategies like greedy best-first searches. We further propose a feature-space based entropy formulation in contrast to the frequently used differential entropy formulation and show superior results when reconstructing the unsampled data from the set of sampled points.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a search-based planning method to compute dynamically feasible trajectories for a quadrotor flying in an obstacle-cluttered environment. Our approach searches for smooth, minimum-time trajectories by exploring the map using a set of short-duration motion primitives. The primitives are generated by solving an optimal control problem and induce a finite lattice discretization on the state space which can be explored using a graph-search algorithm. The proposed approach is able to generate resolution-complete (i.e., optimal in the discretized space), safe, dynamically feasibility trajectories efficiently by exploiting the explicit solution of a Linear Quadratic Minimum Time problem. It does not assume a hovering initial condition and, hence, is suitable for fast online re-planning while the robot is moving. Quadrotor navigation with online re-planning is demonstrated using the proposed approach in simulation and physical experiments and comparisons with trajectory generation based on state-of-art quadratic programming are presented.",

Moreover, this segmentation is achieved without any explicit kinematic representation. Our work demonstrates the usefulness of this invariant framework in segmenting a variety of humeral movements, which are performed at different speeds across different subjects. Our results indicate that this invariant framework has high computational reliability despite the inherent variability in human motion.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel method for classifying 3D objects that is particularly tailored for the requirements in robotic applications. The major challenges here are the comparably small amount of available training data and the fact that often data is perceived in streams and not in fixed-size pools. Traditional state-of-the-art learning methods, however, require a large amount of training data, and their online learning capabilities are usually limited. Therefore, we propose a modality-specific selection of convolutional neural networks (CNN), pre-trained or fine-tuned, in combination with a classifier that is designed particularly for online learning from data streams, namely the Mondrian Forest (MF). We show that this combination of trained features obtained from a CNN can be improved further if a feature selection algorithm is applied. In our experiments, we use the resulting features both with a MF and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). With SVM we beat the state of the art on an RGB-D dataset, while with MF a strong result for active learning is achieved.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a workflow algorithm for timely tracking of the tool tip during cell manipulation using a template-based approach augmented with low level feature detection. Doing so addresses the problem of adverse influences on template-based tracking during tool-cell interaction while maintaining an efficient track-servo framework. This consideration is important in developing autonomous robotic vision-guided micromanipulators. Our method facilitates vision-guided micromanipulation autonomously without manual interventions even during tool-cell interaction. This is done by decomposing the process to four scenarios that operate on their respective mode. The self-initializing mode is first used to localize and focus a region of interest (ROI) which the tip lies in. Once in focus, the tip is manipulated using a unified visual track-servo template-based approach. A reinitialization mechanism will be triggered to prevent tracking from being interrupted by partial cell occlusion of the tracking ROI. This mechanism uses the self-initializing concept combining motion cue and low-level feature detection to localize the needle tip. Following the reinitialization, we further recover tracking of the needle tip using a mechanism that updates the base template. This adaptive approach ensures uninterrupted tracking even when the cell is interacting with the tool and under deformation. Results demonstrated that with the newly incorporated mechanisms, the localized position improved from an error of more than 50% to less than 10% of the specimen size. When there is no specimen in the scene the new workflow shows no adverse effect on the localization through 270 tracked frames. By incorporating reinitialization and recovery to this workflow algorithm, we hope to initiate the first step towards uncalibrated autonomous vision-guided micromanipulation process.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates self-reconfiguration of a modular robotic system, which consists of a cluster of modular vehicles that can attach to each other by a connection mechanism. Thereby, they can form a desired morphology to meet task specific requirements. Reconfiguration can be needed due to limitations from dimensions of passable corridors for an underwater maintenance task, for supplemental instrumentation that is available on a particular robot, or as remedial action if one robot in a cluster suffers from malfunction. Being crucial for autonomous underwater vehicles, energy consumed is employed as a heuristic. The paper shows how the Basic Theta* algorithm can be guided by an energy criterion to calculate a transition from start- to goal morphology. Individual robots are guided while minimizing the overall energy for propulsion and for balancing restoring forces and moments in morphologies. The properties of the proposed self-reconfiguration algorithm are evaluated through simulations and preliminary model tank experiments. The energy based heuristic for reconfiguration is compared to a traditional solution that minimizes the Euclidean distance.",

Our method focuses on selecting the most relevant parts of the RGBD input by continuously updating appearance classifiers in conjunction with the spatial occupancy of the target. Fine-grained regions selected via the learned bottom-up saliency, together with spatial cues of the 3D shape model, are used to identify and localize the target via shape registration. The subsequent 3-D pose estimate along with positive and negative labels from the registration are used for online learning appearance.

In recent years, there has been great progress in semantic segmentation and geometric 3D mapping. However, it is still challenging to combine these two tasks for accurate and large-scale semantic mapping from images. In the paper, we propose an incremental and (near) real-time semantic mapping system. A 3D scrolling occupancy grid map is built to represent the world, which is memory and computationally efficient and bounded for large scale environments. We utilize the CNN segmentation as prior prediction and further optimize 3D grid labels through a novel CRF model. Superpixels are utilized to enforce smoothness and form robust PN high order potential. An efficient mean field inference is developed for the graph optimization. We evaluate our system on the KITTI dataset and improve the segmentation accuracy by 10% over existing systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for jointly estimating road layout and segmenting urban scenes semantically by applying a relative location prior. The proposed method is based on the conjecture that some relevant elements in urban environments tend to be located in a predictable manner. This belief can be modeled as a location prior to help a segmentation algorithm infer latent labels in images more accurately. In order to apply these structural characteristics, a set of special coordinates, referred to as road-normal coordinates, are defined which are perpendicular to the road. These coordinates are determined by estimating the most fittable road layout based on a marginal probability obtained from an existing segmentation algorithm. All possible segments in an image are projected into the road-normal coordinates with the aid of depth information from sensor measurements, and the pre-trained location prior is applied to each segment as an additional potential of a conditional random field (CRF) model. The proposed method is evaluated on the publicly available KITTI dataset including images and corresponding 3D point clouds.",

        "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a core problem of many robotic applications, including simultaneous localization and mapping. The Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) is a method that fits a number of Gaussian distributions to the data points, and then uses this transform as an approximation of the real data, registering a relatively small number of distributions as opposed to the full point cloud. This approach contributes to NDT's registration robustness and speed but leaves room for improvement in environments of limited structure. To address this limitation we propose a method for the introduction of semantic information extracted from the point clouds into the registration process. The paper presents a large scale experimental evaluation of the algorithm against NDT on two publicly available benchmark data sets. For the purpose of this test a measure of smoothness is used for the semantic partitioning of the point clouds. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the accuracy, robustness and speed of NDT registration, especially in unstructured environments, making NDT suitable for a wider range of applications.",

Standardized line tests are executed to determine ideal cut parameters in three different types of porcine tissue. STAR is then programmed with the ideal cut setting for porcine tissue and compared against expert surgeons using open and laparoscopic techniques in a line cutting task. We conclude with a proof of concept demonstration using STAR to semi-autonomously resect pseudo-tumors in porcine tissue using visual servoing. When tasked to excise tumors with a consistent 4mm margin, STAR can semi-autonomously dissect tissue with an average margin of 3.67 mm and a standard deviation of 0.89mm.",

We extend previous work that solves this coverage problem as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) by introducing a practical heuristic algorithm to reduce runtime while maintaining near-optimal path length. Furthermore, we show that generating an optimal coverage path is NP-hard by reducing from the Exact Cover problem, which provides justification for our algorithm's conversion of Dubins coverage instances to TSP instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithm does indeed produce length paths comparable to optimal in significantly less time.",

This paper shows place categorisation from 3D data without any training phase. We show that, by leveraging the NDT histogram descriptor to compactly encode 3D point cloud appearance, in combination with standard clustering techniques, it is possible to classify public indoor data sets with accuracy comparable to, and sometimes better than, previous supervised training methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to outdoor data, with an added benefit of being able to hierarchically categorise places into sub-categories based on a user-selected threshold. This technique relieves users of providing relevant training data, and only requires them to adjust the sensitivity to the number of place categories, and provide a semantic label to each category after the process is completed.",

To achieve this, robots must be able to reliably distinguish crops from weeds on different fields and across growth stages. In this paper, we tackle the problem of separating crops from weeds reliably while requiring only a minimal amount of training data through a semi-supervised approach. We exploit the fact that most crops are planted in rows with a similar spacing along the row, which in turn can be used to initialize a vision-based classifier requiring only minimal user efforts to adapt it to a new field. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it on real farm robots operating in different countries. The experiments presented in this paper show that with around 1 min of labeling time, we can achieve classification results with an accuracy of more than 95% in real sugar beet fields in Germany and Switzerland.",

Collision avoidance requires trajectory prediction and the performance of a collision avoidance system can be improved by extending the prediction horizon. We describe an algorithm that predicts the trajectory of a small, fixed-wing UAS using an estimate of its orientation. First, a computer vision algorithm locates specific feature points of the threat aircraft in an image. Next, the POSIT algorithm uses these feature points to estimate the pose (position and attitude) of the threat. A sequence of pose estimates is then used to predict the trajectory of the threat aircraft in order to avoid a collision. To assess the algorithm's performance, the predictions are compared with predictions based solely on position estimates for a variety of encounter scenarios. Simulation and experimental results indicate that trajectory prediction using orientation estimates provides quicker response to a change in the threat aircraft trajectory and better prediction and avoidance performance.",

        "abstract": "Grasping and manipulation of biological tissue are crucial processes during minimally invasive surgery (MIS). To enable atraumatic and reliable grasping, it would be useful to detect slip of the grasped object. Because tissue is moist, conformable, and delicate, and because the sensor must work in a surgical environment, this application requires a departure from conventional slip sensing methods. We present a technology and method based on hot-wire anemometry to detect slip while grasping wet, conformable materials and discuss how this approach may be extended to graspers used in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). We present our design and the results from characterization tests as well as experimental results that demonstrate its ability to detect planar direction of slip of wet, compliant objects.",

        "abstract": "Although there is an abundance of planar fiducial-marker systems proposed for augmented reality and computer-vision purposes, using them to estimate the pose accurately in robotic applications where collected data are noisy remains a challenge. This is inherently a difficult problem because these fiducial marker systems work solely within the RGB image space and the resolution of cameras on robots is often constrained. As a result, small noise in the image would cause the tag's detection process to produce large pose estimation errors. This paper describes an algorithm that improves the pose estimation accuracy of square fiducial markers in difficult scenes by fusing information from RGB and depth sensors. The algorithm retains the high detection rate and low false positive rate characteristics of fiducial systems while making them much more robust to size, lighting and sensory noise for pose estimation. The improvements make the fiducial tags suitable for robotic tasks requiring high pose accuracy in the real world environment.",

A deep neural network architecture is introduced to effectively perform modality fusion and reliably predict steering commands even in the presence of sensor failures. The proposed network is trained on our own dataset, from LiDAR and a camera mounted on a UGV taken in an indoor corridor environment. Comprehensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the robustness of our network architecture is performed to show that the proposed deep learning neural network is able to autonomously navigate in the corridor environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fusion of the camera and LiDAR modalities provides further benefits beyond robustness to sensor failures. Specifically, the multimodal fused system shows a potential to navigate around static and dynamic obstacles and to handle changes in environment geometry without being trained for these tasks.",

In this paper, we address a long-standing bottleneck associated with the difficulty of finding paths through narrow passages. Whereas most prior work considers the narrow passage problem as a sampling issue (and the literature abounds with heuristic sampling strategies) very little attention has been paid to the design of new effective local planners. Here, we propose a novel sensory steering algorithm for sampling-based motion planning that can \u201cfeel\u201d a configuration space locally and significantly improve the path planning performance near difficult regions such as narrow passages. We provide computational evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed local planner through a variety of simulations which suggest that our proposed sensory steering algorithm outperforms the standard straight-line planner by significantly increasing the connectivity of random motion planning graphs.",

        "abstract": "Tactile object shape identification is important for robotic hands to perform dexterous manipulation. Most of the proposed approaches concentrate on specific object recognition. This limits their application into more realistic environments where a larger amount of objects are present. We present a method that performs object shape identification independently on the size and location of the object within the hand. This method allows sequential learning of new shapes. The method combines proprioceptive signatures and contact normal information to build a descriptor that reduces the impact of the size and pose of the object on recognition rate. Sequential training is performed with a collection of Neural Forests (NF). This allows adding new objects to the training set so that training the model from scratch is avoided. Extensive experiments reveal that the combination of multiple modalities (e.g. contact normals, proprioceptive information) is beneficial to the system accuracy, and that results for sequential learning are on par with its batch counterpart. This makes sequential training advantageous because it is less time consuming. Results showed that both techniques depict similar results and perform with at least 83% in a 7-shapes case scenario in a simulated environment. Experiments are made with a real shadow hand using a NF trained on simulated data.",

Shape completion is accomplished through the use of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). The network is trained on our own new open source dataset of over 440,000 3D exemplars captured from varying viewpoints. At runtime, a 2.5D pointcloud captured from a single point of view is fed into the CNN, which fills in the occluded regions of the scene, allowing grasps to be planned and executed on the completed object. Runtime shape completion is very rapid because most of the computational costs of shape completion are borne during offline training. We explore how the quality of completions vary based on several factors. These include whether or not the object being completed existed in the training data and how many object models were used to train the network. We also look at the ability of the network to generalize to novel objects allowing the system to complete previously unseen objects at runtime. Finally, experimentation is done both in simulation and on actual robotic hardware to explore the relationship between completion quality and the utility of the completed mesh model for grasping.",

        "abstract": "The determination of a flexible needle shape during the insertion is an important issue in minimally invasive surgery techniques. This is especially critical when considering conventional surgery procedures where a surgeon usually determines how to proceed needle insertion further based on the current needle trajectory inserted into tissue during biopsy and removal of malignant tissues in the body. In this paper, we propose a new method to determine the shape of a needle that is being inserted, together with the curvature measurement data obtained by fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) sensors inside the needle. This approach can be particularly advantageous to the situations where visual guidance (such as by ultrasound probes) is not easily applicable. The description of a needle shape is based on the elastic rod theory and Lie-group-theoretic approach. We also present the comparison between two different calibration methods, which have an impact on the quality of the results of the proposed method. In order to verify the proposed method, needle trajectories by the model are compared with experimental data obtained by image analysis, which in turn emphasizes the capability of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Reconstruction of dynamic objects in a scene is a highly challenging problem in the context of SLAM. In this paper, we present a real-time monocular object localization system that estimates the shape and pose of dynamic objects in real-time, using video frames captured from a moving monocular camera. Although the problem seems to be ill-posed, we demonstrate that, by incorporating prior knowledge of the object category, we can obtain more detailed instance-level reconstructions. As opposed to earlier object model specifications, the proposed shape-prior model leads to the formulation of a Bundle Adjustment-like optimization problem for simultaneous shape and pose estimation. Leveraging recent successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object keypoint localization, we present a CNN architecture that performs precise keypoint localization. We then demonstrate how these keypoints can be used to recover 3D object properties, while accounting for any 2D localization errors and self-occlusion. We show significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art monocular competitors for 2D keypoint detection, as well as 3D localization and reconstruction of dynamic objects.",

        "abstract": "Snake like continuum robots are increasingly used for minimally invasive surgery. Most robotic devices of this sort that have been reported to date are controlled in an open loop manner. Using shape sensing to provide closed loop feedback would allow for more accurate control of the robot's position and, hence, more precise surgery. Fiber Bragg Gratings, magnetic sensors and optical reflectance sensors have all been reported for this purpose but are often limited by their cost, size, stiffness or complexity of fabrication. To address this issue, we designed, manufactured and tested a prototype two-link robot with a built-in fiber-optic shape sensor that can deliver and control the position of a CO2-laser fiber for soft tissue ablation. The shape sensing is based on optical reflectance, and the device (which has a 4 mm outer diameter) is fabricated using 3D printing. Here we present proof-of-concept results demonstrating successful shape sensing - i.e. measurement of the angular displacement of the upper link of the robot relative to the lower link - in real time with a mean measurement error of only 0.7\u00b0.",

Noticing the fact that when a continuum manipulator wraps around an object in a whole-arm grasping, its own shape is indicative of the shape of the object, our approach enables learning and recognition of object classes based on the shapes of continuum wraps. It offers the following advantages: (1) recognition of objects that are not easily detected by vision, such as transparent objects, and (2) highly efficient recognition of such objects of varied sizes due to high-level and rich shape information in each wrap, unlike recognition based on tactile sensing via conventional grasping. Simulation and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "The strong resource limitations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pose various challenges for UAV applications. In persistent multi-UAV surveillance, several UAVs with limited communication range and flight time have to repeatedly visit sensing locations while maintaining a multi-hop connection to the base station. In order to achieve persistence, the UAVs need to fly back to the base station in time for recharge. However, simple motion planning algorithms can result in mutual movement obstructions of UAVs caused by the constraints. We introduce two planning algorithms with different planning horizons and cooperation and compare their performance in simulation studies. It can be seen that the short horizon uncooperative strategy can outperform other strategies if a sufficient number of UAVs is used. The full horizon strategy can generate a solution visiting all sensing locations if the existence conditions for such a solution are fulfilled.",

        "abstract": "Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgical systems suffer from one major limitation which is the lack of interaction forces feedback. The restricted sense of touch hinders the surgeons' performance and reduces their dexterity and precision during a procedure. In this work, we present a sensory substitution approach that relies on visual stimuli to transmit the tool-tissue interaction forces to the operating surgeon. Our approach combines a 3D diffeomorphic deformation mapping with a generative model to precisely label the force level. The main highlights of our approach are that the use of diffeomorphic transformation ensures anatomical structure preservation and the label assignment is based on a parametric form of several mixture elements. We performed experimentations on both ex-vivo and in-vivo datasets and offer careful numerical results evaluating our approach. The results show that our solution has an error measure less than 1mm in all directions and an average labeling error of 2.05%. It can also be applicable to other scenarios that require force feedback such as microsurgery, knot tying or needle-based procedures.",

Our framework is based on the combination of a biomechanical model of the organ with a set of projective constraints influencing the deformation of the model. To enforce convergence towards a global minimum for this ill-posed problem we interactively provide a rough (rigid) estimation of the pose. We show that our approach allows for the estimation of the non-rigid 3D pose while relying only on 2D information. The method is evaluated experimentally on a soft silicone gel model of a liver, as well as on real surgical data, providing augmented reality of the liver and the kidney using a monocular laparoscopic camera. Results show that the final elastic registration can be obtained in just a few seconds, thus remaining compatible with clinical constraints. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our approach according to both the initial alignment of the model and the silhouette length and shape.",

In order to remain robust to modeling error and shifts in payload dynamics, agents must simultaneously perform estimation and control tasks. However, the optimal estimation actions are often not the optimal actions for accomplishing the control tasks, and thus agents trade between exploration and exploitation. This work frames the problem as a Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process and solves it online using Monte Carlo tree search and an extended Kalman filter to handle Gaussian process noise and parameter uncertainty in a continuous space. MCTS selects control actions to reduce model uncertainty and reach the goal state nearly optimally. Certainty equivalent model predictive control is used as a benchmark to compare performance in simulations with varying process noise and parameter uncertainty.",

The problem assumes that a camera (eye) is rigidly mounted to the gripper (hand) of a robot arm and aims to find the transformation between them. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for hand-eye calibration without the use of a calibration target. First we employ feature extraction and matching, followed by an initial hand-eye calibration step using 2-view matches. In an iterative process, we then alternately employ triangulation and bundle adjustment to optimize the reconstruction and the hand-eye calibration result. Unlike in structure from motion and traditional hand-eye calibration, during this process we always determine the global camera poses using the hand poses and the estimated hand-eye transformation. Synthetic-data and real-data experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed approach, and the results indicate that the accuracy of our approach is superior to state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the speed of our algorithm is faster than existing methods.",

        "abstract": "In the context of coordination of mobile multi-robot/agent networked teams, we present an integrated model that simultaneously addresses two problems arising in multi-robot missions: (i) task allocation and task scheduling; and (ii) communication provisioning in the multi-hop mobile ad hoc network built by the team. The integrated model is based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, which is solved in a centralized mode. For the communication part, the model solution outputs data routing policies and data transmission schedules that are aimed to maximize data delivery throughput to/from control centers. The trade-off between task and network performance optimization is strategically controlled. A refinement procedure is defined that allows to further improve communications by also minimizing network delays. We report a computational analysis of the integrated MILP model and an evaluation of the impact of a number of parameters on the trade-off between computational load and quality of the output. Results show that the model is computationally affordable for reasonably sized scenarios, and can effectively balance different performance trade-offs.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a single-shot approach for recognising clothing categories from 2.5D features. We propose two visual features, BSP (B-Spline Patch) and TSD (Topology Spatial Distances) for this task. The local BSP features are encoded by LLC (Locality-constrained Linear Coding) and fused with three different global features. Our visual feature is robust to deformable shapes and our approach is able to recognise the category of unknown clothing in unconstrained and random configurations. We integrated the category recognition pipeline with a stereo vision system, clothing instance detection, and dual-arm manipulators to achieve an autonomous sorting system. To verify the performance of our proposed method, we build a high-resolution RGBD clothing dataset of 50 clothing items of 5 categories sampled in random configurations (a total of 2,100 clothing samples). Experimental results show that our approach is able to reach 83.2% accuracy while classifying clothing items which were previously unseen during training. This advances beyond the previous state-of-the-art by 36.2%. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach in an autonomous robot sorting system, in which the robot recognises a clothing item from an unconstrained pile, grasps it, and sorts it into a box according to its category. Our proposed sorting system achieves reasonable sorting success rates with single-shot perception.",

        "abstract": "A Marangoni propulsion is exhibited by some aquatic insects such as rove beetles as a means of rapid escaping by secreting surfactant that lowers the surface tension behind them. Inspired by their locomotion, we proposed a non-tethered miniature robot that can skim and steer on the water surface without employing oscillatory movements of limbs. To make a robot afloat on water surface using the surface tension while attaining higher support force, a circular footpad with an equilateral triangular cross section was used. Other types of cross section shapes such as a circle and a square were also considered; however, their maximal support force obtained from numerical solution was less than an equilateral triangle. The robot had four circular footpads, which coated with superhydrophobic spray, and weighed 18.5 gram including on-board electronics, a battery, and two servo motors. During the experiment, the robot could successfully skim over the water surface by dripping methanol behind and change its moving direction by lowering a small oar either left or right side.",

First, we solve a facility location problem of finding the optimal depot position to minimize the distance traveled by the grain carts. Next, we formulate the scheduling problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. For a rectangular field, we present two schemes which allow the grain carts to unload all the combine harvesters without interrupting the harvesting activity. Finally, for both schemes, we present a relation between the physical parameters of the vehicles that need to be satisfied in order to meet the scheduling constraints.",

In this paper, the effect of both the configuration of the snake robot (shape) and the friction between the snake robot and ground on a wrench applied to another object are studied. It is assumed that the snake robot has anisotropic friction with the ground, a property that has been proved to be essential for locomotion. The extreme cases of no friction and ideal unbounded friction can be both studied at the same time, making the model and conclusions very versatile and possible to apply to any coefficient of friction. The model and metrics are tested in a study case.",

        "abstract": "For robotic vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in pedestrian-rich environments, it is important to model subtle human behaviors and navigation rules (e.g., passing on the right). However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.",

We derive an approximation of this mechanism by employing a neural network learning architecture on synthetic data of collective navigation behaviors. Our planner makes use of this mechanism as a tool for interpreting the context and understanding what future behaviors are in compliance with it. The planning agent makes use of this understanding to determine a personal action that contributes to the context in the most clear way possible, while ensuring progress to its destination. Our simulations provide evidence that our planning framework results in socially competent navigation behaviors not only for the planning agent, but also for interacting naive agents. Performance benefits include (1) early conflict resolutions and (2) faster uncertainty decrease for the other agents in the scene.",

Our approach computes time-varying behaviors of each pedestrian using Bayesian learning and Personality Trait theory. These psychological characteristics are used for long-term path prediction and generating proxemic characteristics for each pedestrian. We combine these psychological constraints with social constraints to perform human-aware robot navigation in low- to medium-density crowds. The estimation of time-varying behaviors and pedestrian personalities can improve the performance of long-term path prediction by 21%, as compared to prior interactive path prediction algorithms. We also demonstrate the benefits of our socially-aware navigation in simulated environments with tens of pedestrians.",

        "abstract": "Continuing research efforts in robot-assisted rehabilitation demand more adaptable and inherently soft wearable devices. A wearable rehabilitative device is required to follow the motion of the body and to provide assistive or corrective motions to restore natural movements. Providing the required level of fluidity in wearable devices becomes a challenge for rehabilitation of more sensitive and fragile body parts, such as the face. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actuation method based on a tendon-driven robotic origami (robogami) and a soft sensing method based on a strain gauge with customized stretchable mesh design. The proposed actuation and sensing methods are compatible with the requirements in a facial rehabilitative device. The conformity of robogamis originates from their multiple and redundant degrees of freedom and the controllability of the joint stiffness, which is provided by adjusting the elasticity modulus of an embedded shape memory polymer (SMP) layer. The reconfiguration of the robogami and the trajectory and directional compliance of its end-effector are controlled by modulating the temperatures, hence the stiffness, of the SMP layers. Here we demonstrate this correlation using simulation and experimental results. In this paper, we introduce a thin and highly compliant sensing method for measuring facial movements with a minimal effect on the natural motions. The measurements of the sensors on the healthy side can be used to calculate the required tendon displacement for replicating the natural motion on the paralyzed side of the face in patients suffering from facial palsy.",

        "abstract": "The constantly increasing amount of machines operating in the vicinity of humans makes it necessary to rethink the design approach for such machines to ensure that they are safe when interacting with humans. Traditional mechanisms are rigid and heavy and as such considered unsuitable, even dangerous when a controlled physical contact with humans is desired. A huge improvement in terms of safe human-robot interaction has been achieved by a radically new approach to robotics - soft material robotics. These new robots are made of compliant materials that render them safe when compared to the conventional rigid-link robots. This undeniable advantage of compliance and softness is paired with a number of drawbacks. One of them is that a complex and sophisticated controller is required to move a soft robot into the desired positions or along a desired trajectory, especially with external forces being present. In this paper we propose an improved soft fluidic rotary actuator composed of silicone rubber and fiber-based reinforcement. The actuator is cheap and easily manufactured providing near linear actuation properties when compared to pneumatic actuators presented elsewhere. The paper presents the actuator design, manufacturing process and a mathematical model of the actuator behavior as well as an experimental validation of the model. Four different actuator types are compared including a square-shaped and three differently reinforced cylindrical actuators.",

They have evolved to occupy an extremely diverse range of natural environments and to locomote in complex three-dimensional structures without articulated joint or hydrostatic control. These animals make excellent bio-inspiration for the field of soft robotics because of their diversity and adaptability. In this paper, we present SquMA Bot, a caterpillar-inspired soft robot. The robot's body is primarily composed of a soft viscoelastic foam, and it is actuated using a motor-tendon system. SquMA Bot is able to mimic the inching gait of a caterpillar and can use its flexible body to adapt to a range of environments. This bio-inspired prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of a soft robot as a potential tool for exploring environments too dangerous for humans.",

Thanks to the material mechanical characteristics similar to those of silicone elastomers, the actuator exhibits a bending angle of 170.3 \u00b0 and a blocked force of 0.34 N at the applied pressure of 25 kPa. These values are comparable to elastomer based pneumatic actuators. As a validation example, two actuators are integrated to form a gripper capable of handling various objects, highlighting the high performance and applicability of the edible actuator. These edible actuators, combined with other recent edible materials and electronics, could lay the foundation for a new type of edible robots.",

The robot consists of inflatable air bladders that adaptively control head deviations from target while ensuring patient safety and comfort. The adaptive-neuro controller combines a state feedback component, a feedforward regulator, and a neural network that ensures correct adaptation. States are measured by a 3D vision system.

Here, we show that LM electronics can be used to combine pressure sensing with proximity detection and remote finger tracking - sensing modalities not previously demonstrated in a soft electronic skin (E-Skin). This is accomplished with a novel architecture composed of 9 capacitive sensors arranged in two layers and placed below a spiral-shaped pressure transducer. The E-skin is composed of eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) LM alloy and Pt-cured EcoFlex 0030 elastomer. The multi-modal sensor is able to detect the proximity and motion of a finger as it moves above the sensor and is able to detect touch and pressure once the finger comes into contact. Proximity sensing and contact pressure are distinguish by comparing changes in capacitance and resistance of the embedded LM circuitry. Measurements on a cm-scale prototype suggest proximity sensing with a range of 8.7 cm and maximum contact pressure of 110 kPa.",

        "abstract": "Visual markers are useful tools that aid autonomous robots in object recognition and pose measurement; however, conventional markers have two fundamental problems in orientation estimation: (1) inaccurate estimation in the frontal direction and (2) pose ambiguity. We previously developed a visual marker \u201cLentiMark\u201d that solves problem (1). In this paper, we propose a solution to problem (2) by improving LentiMark. For this purpose, we use two wavelike slices that change two-tone patterns according to the angle of visual line. The new marker enables stable and robust pose estimation without pose ambiguity. We solve the two biggest problems of visual markers in the framework of small planar markers. We verify the efficiency of our method through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Whilst Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) possess a variety of promising capabilities, their high energy consumption severely limits applications where flight endurance is of high importance. Reducing energy usage is one of the main challenges in advancing aerial robot utility. To address this bottleneck in the development of unmanned aerial vehicle applications, this work proposes an bioinspired mechanical approach and develops an aerial robotic system for greater endurance enabled by low power station-keeping. The aerial robotic system consists of an multirotor MAV and anchoring modules capable of launching multiple tensile anchors to fixed structures in its operating envelope. The resulting tensile perch is capable of providing a mechanically stabilized mode for high accuracy operation in 3D workspace. We explore generalised geometric and static modelling of the stabilisation concept using screw theory. Following the analytical modelling of the integrated robotic system, the tensile anchoring modules employing high pressure gas actuation are designed, prototyped and then integrated to a quadrotor platform. The presented design is validated with experimental tests, demonstrating the stabilization capability even in a windy environment.",

        "abstract": "Place recognition is an essential part of robot localization and mapping problems. Using lower data-rate sensors like 2D scanning laser rangefinders enables the robots to use less memory and computation in building maps. However, place recognition by a vehicle with 6-DOF dynamics like a quadrotor in unstructured, 3D environments like forests is challenging, especially with a sensor that only measures a planar slice of the environment. This paper extends the 2D geometry-based place recognition system of [1] to a challenging forest envirnoment with a novel procedure for selecting stable and salient 2D laser interest points using Dirichlet process clustering (DP-means). This method is tested on both synthetic and real data from a forest trail and compared with [1]. The result reveals the importance of salient interest point selection in allowing accurate and fast place recognition. Our approach also ensures a low bandwidth representation of visited areas, making it suitable for real-time, multi-agent SLAM applications.",

This paper presents the implementation of a standing posture control system on a low-cost, commercially available hexapod robot platform. The Virtual Model Control (VMC) strategy is implemented, along with a simple method for foot force distribution and a direct force control method that can be used with position control of low-cost joint actuators. The controller was experimentally tested on level and uneven terrain, as well as on a dynamic balance board. Ground truth measurements of the tests revealed that the results compared favorably to those obtained on more expensive, custom designed platforms.",

A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is constructed to register the object nodes towards the noisy point cloud. To deal with occlusion, the coherent point drift (CPD) regularization is applied on the mixture model, so as to maintain the topological structure from previous sequences of data and to infer the object states in occluded area. The state estimation is further refined by running a dynamic simulation in parallel, which guarantees the estimates to satisfy the object's physical constraints. A series of rope tracking experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed state estimator. It is shown that the object can be tracked robustly with sensor noise, outliers and massive occlusion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the analytic solution of a fundamental open problem in the framework of state estimation/nonlinear observability, which is the Unknown Input Observability problem (UIO problem). The problem consists in deriving the analytic criterion that allows us to automatically obtain the state observability in presence of disturbances (or unknown inputs). In other words, the problem is to extend the well known observability rank condition to the case when the dynamics are also driven by unknown inputs. Enunciated in the seventies by the control theory community, this problem was only solved in the linear case. The solution here provided holds for nonlinear systems in presence of a single unknown input. The first part of the paper presents this analytic solution. Very surprisingly, the complexity of the overall analytic criterion is comparable to the complexity of the observability rank condition. The second part of the paper applies this analytic criterion to a robotics system when its dynamics are affected by an external disturbance (e.g., due to the presence of wind). To corroborate the results of our observability analysis we perform extensive simulations and we show that, a simple estimator based on an Extended Kalman Filter, provides results that agree with what we could expect from the observability analysis.",

We also describe a straightforward derivation of the relationship between the angular momentum and whole center of mass. Second, we design two control laws for achieving stable stealth walking. During the single-limb support phase, the stance- and swing-leg angles are strictly controlled to follow the desired trajectories so that the swing foot lands on the ground stealthily at the end of this phase. During the double-limb support phase, the angular position and velocity of the upper body are controlled to follow the desired trajectory for returning them to the initial state. Through numerical simulations, the fundamental gait properties and change tendencies are investigated.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control method for steering three dimensional (3D) dynamically walking bipeds that are engaged in cooperative tasks such as object transportation. Towards achieving safe interaction with a leading human (or robot) collaborator, the walking biped is required to exhibit compliance at the port of interaction, while simultaneously adapting its walking pattern in response to the perceived interaction forces. To address these issues, we propose a method that fuses impedance control of the biped's arm with position control of its legs in a way that the biped adaptively modifies its stepping pattern according to the collaborator's intentions. The method is applied on a 3D bipedal robot that is driven in the workspace by a collaborator, whose intention is communicated to the biped through the interaction force.",

Identified challenges include better use of state estimation to and reasoning with uncertainty, spreading out tasks to specialized robots, and implementing representative joining methods. This paper proposes replacing 1) self-correcting mechanical linkages with generalized joints for improved applicability, 2) assembly serial manipulators with parallel manipulators for higher precision and stability, and 3) all-in-one robots with a heterogeneous team of specialized robots for agent simplicity. This paper then describes a general assembly algorithm utilizing state estimation. Finally, these concepts are tested in the context of solar array assembly, requiring a team of robots to assemble, bond, and deploy a set of solar panel mockups to a backbone truss to an accuracy not built into the parts. This paper presents the results of these tests.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the main abilities that the robots need to maintain is to efficiently communicate with people in a humanly manner. Thus, human activity recognition (HAR) would be an integral part of such a human-robot interaction system. One of the major challenges in HAR is that the individuals perform their activities in different manners. Furthermore, there is a very wide range of different types of activities that the robots would require to understand. Some activities are simple, quick and short (e.g., sit down), while many others are complex, have many details and span through a long range of time (e.g., wearing contact lens). In this paper, we model the recognition of activities into a sequence-labeling problem and propose a new probabilistic graphical model (PGM) that can recognize both short/long-range activities, by introducing a hierarchical classification model and including extra links and loopy conditions in our PGM. To optimize the PGM and obtain its parameters during training, we use a structured prediction technique, a general framework that involves latent structured support vector machines (LSSVM) and hidden-state conditional random fields (HCRF). We evaluate our method on two widely used datasets (CAD-60 & UT-Kinect) that contain both activity types. Our obtained results are promising and show that our method can recognize both types of activities effectively, while most of the previous works only focused on one of these two major types. We further explore distributed processing techniques, since our method can easily be distributed over processing nodes. We also propose an efficient divide-and-merge technique to further speedup the training step.",

        "abstract": "Manta ray's pectoral fins have been a great source of inspiration for propulsive mechanism of autonomous underwater vehicles, due to their propulsive capability. The geometry (shape) and flexibility factors of these fins have been hypothesized to be determinants of the propulsive capability of the fins in terms of thrust generation. In particular, the sweep angle factor has been omitted from previous studies, where it has been commonly set to about 30 degrees. This paper investigates the effects of sweep angle on thrust generation of oscillatory pectoral fins. Forty different fins were designed and fabricated to be experimented in a water channel, which involved measurement of thrust generated by the fins. The experiment was conducted under free stream (0.5 m/s) and still water conditions. Five different sweep angles (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 degrees) were incorporated into eight base designs of different flexibility characteristics to make up the 40 fins. To consider only sweep angle, other geometrical factors were not varied. Within the range of the sweep angle considered, the experimental results showed that sweep angle has no significant influence on the fins' thrust generation, under both free stream and still water conditions. Overall, it can be concluded that sweep angle may not be a determinant of oscillatory pectoral fins' thrust generation.",

Previous works on quadruped robots mostly used the simplified model with massless legs. However, in reality, a leg consists of two or three segments with mass and inertia. We study herein the bounding of quadruped robots with a model closer to a real animal, i.e., a model having articulated legs with joints with stiffness and damping properties, and a passive spinal joint, to obtain an insight into the robot's dynamic behaviors. The effects of spine flexibility were investigated on quadrupedal bounding gait by changing dynamic properties and hardware parameters and then comparing the performance of models with and without a spinal joint. The model comparisons revealed that body flexibility significantly increased stride length and strongly affected the dynamic of the body and the energy efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to supervisory control of a DaVinci surgical robot. At present, such robots are controlled by teleoperation, with dissimilar kinematics of the operator interface vs. the robot. As a result, it can be difficult for the operator to visualize the kinematic restrictions on the robot, particularly for desired extended, precise trajectories, such as circular needle driving. The interface presented here constitutes a means to elevate the operator from teleoperation mode to supervisory mode. The operator interacts directly with a point-cloud display, allowing selection of task specifications from which the system automatically computes and executes precise trajectories to achieve the task goals. The intent is to allow the operator to focus on task specifications and rely on automation to achieve faster and more precise execution.",

However, there are many use cases in which direct teleoperation is not feasible such as disaster areas with poor communication as posed in the DARPA Robotics Challenge or robot operations on spacecraft far from Earth. Presented is a solution that combines the Affordance Template Framework for object interaction with TaskForce for supervisory control in order to accomplish high-level task objectives with basic autonomous behavior from the robot. This framework has allowed the robot to take corrective actions before requesting assistance from the user. This work is demonstrated with Robonaut 2 removing a Cargo Transfer Bag from a simulated logistics resupply vehicle for spaceflight using a single operator command. This was executed with 80% success with no human involvement and 95% success with limited human interaction. This technology sets the stage to do any number of high-level tasks using a similar framework, allowing the robot to accomplish tasks with minimal to no human interaction.",

In this work, we aim to model and mimic this behaviour in low Reynolds number fluids using externally actuated soft robotic sperms. We numerically investigate the effects of transition between planar to helical flagellar propulsion on the swimming characteristics of the robotic sperm using a model based on resistive-force theory to study the role of viscous forces on its flexible tail. Experimental results are obtained using robots that contain magnetic particles within the polymer matrix of its head and an ultra-thin flexible tail. The planar and helical flagellar propulsion are achieved using in-plane and out-of-plane uniform fields with sinusoidally varying components, respectively. We experimentally show that the swimming speed of the robotic sperm increases by a factor of 1.4 (fluid viscosity 5 Pa.s) when it undergoes a controlled transition between planar to helical flagellar propulsion, at relatively low actuation frequencies.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a simple control scheme for the two-legged dynamic climbing robot, the ParkourBot. Inspired by the swing leg retraction (SLR) method used on running robots, we propose to implement an SLR controller that does not require an actual apex crossing event as an initiator. The familiar SLR control for running is initiated when the center of mass (CoM) of the robot reaches the apex of its trajectory. Often, dynamic climbing gaits do not reach an apex. We therefore define an alternative initiator named, the virtual apex. We evaluate two simple models, the conservative spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model, and the more realistic non-conservative SLIP model. We show, in simulation, that using SLR we are able to stabilize and control the otherwise unstable conservative SLIP model. We also show, that using the SLR significantly increases the robustness of the non-conservative SLIP model. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on the ParkourBot climbing robot.",

        "abstract": "Target registration error (TRE) is widely adopted to evaluate the accuracy of a paired-point rigid registration (PPRR). However, TRE is defined in such a way that target localization error (TLE) is not considered. In this paper, we first propose a new type of error that is referred to as total target registration error (TTRE). The statistical model of TTRE is derived that we take the TLE in two spaces to be registered into consideration. Results in the first simulation show that the developed model can accurately estimate the simulated TTRE root-mean-square (RMS) (RMS percent differences|| <; 1.5% \u00b1 2%) in all test cases. When all elements of diagonal FLE and TLE covariance matrices are independently generated from a uniform distribution that spans from 0 to 1mm and the number of fiducials N \u2265 6, the mean and covariance matrix of TTRE are well modelled. We have also theoretically proved and validated through the second simulation that TTRE and fiducial registration error (FRE) are uncorrelated (correlation coefficient (CC) <; 0.1). Finally, TTRE and TRE were found to exhibit a low correlation (0.37 <; CC <; 0.46).",

        "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms can be expensive to deploy, in particular, those used in robotics applications that perform many variations of the same task. Solutions to one variation of a task may be found via Reinforcement Learning algorithms, and are typically modeled as a vector of N parameters encoding the robot's behavior policy. When N is large or executing robot trials is time-consuming, searching in the space of solutions becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we introduce a method that allows robots to generalize behaviors by analyzing solutions to a small number of previously-trained related tasks. This allows for approximate policies for novel tasks to be rapidly estimated. We present a method that achieves this type of generalization by performing nonlinear regression directly on the policy manifold \u2014 i.e., the solution space spanned as we change the parameters describing tasks. Because tasks are typically described by few parameters, the corresponding policy manifold has few degrees of freedom, which leads to low-dimensional surfaces. We exploit this property to construct a function that maps task parameters to policy parameters (a parameterized skill). Our method uses manifold clustering techniques to deal with discontinuous manifolds, a challenging situation arising from physical obstacles or robot constraints. We evaluate our method on a set of robot manipulation tasks and show that it can efficiently estimate policies for novel tasks from a small number of training examples.",

        "abstract": "An important question in imitation learning is how to generalize a learned motion to novel situations. The motion generalization depends on a set of features which can be represented as feature vectors spanning a feature space, called query space. The purpose of generalization is to find a mapping from this query space to the motion primitive space (MP space). In this paper, we address the problem of generalization of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to new queries by applying locally weighted regression (LWR) with radial basis functions (RBF). Since two DMPs differ only in their non-linear part, we transform the problem of DMP generalization to a regression analysis problem. We introduce a task-oriented regression algorithm with a cost function that takes task constraints into consideration and which relies on model switching to solve the problem of poor DMP generalization when using a single regression model for the entire query space. The evaluation shows that our algorithm outperforms related approaches in the literature in terms of generalization capabilities.",

        "abstract": "We present a task-oriented grasp model, that encodes grasps that are configurationally compatible with a given task. For instance, if the task is to pour liquid from a container, the model encodes grasps that leave the opening of the container unobstructed. The model consists of two independent agents: First, a geometric grasp model that computes, from a depth image, a distribution of 6D grasp poses for which the shape of the gripper matches the shape of the underlying surface. The model relies on a dictionary of geometric object parts annotated with workable gripper poses and preshape parameters. It is learned from experience via kinesthetic teaching. The second agent is a CNN-based semantic model that identifies grasp-suitable regions in a depth image: regions where a grasp will not impede the execution of the task. The semantic model allows us to encode relationships such as \u201cgrasp from the handle.\u201d A key element of this work is to use a deep network to integrate contextual task cues, and defer the structured-output problem of gripper pose computation to an explicit (learned) geometric model. Jointly, these two models generate grasps that are mechanically fit, and that grip on the object in a way that enables the intended task.",

        "abstract": "Tele-operation in the presence of environmental constraints is a well-studied problem, where the difficulties of the transparency-stability trade-off have been elucidated by several important studies. While at the state-of-art, passivity-based stabilizers appear to provide the best insight and command over this problem, recent work by our group has proposed an alternative approach, which consists in measuring and replicating the master's limb endpoint impedance on the slave robot in real-time. Tele-impedance control offers advantages in certain conditions, e.g. where master-slave communications are low quality. However, force feedback remains necessary when visual feedback is impaired or transparency and telepresence in the remote environment is of major concern. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve the Tele-Impedance with Force Feedback (TIFF) so as to have a seamless control scheme that subsumes the performance advantages of both, while still guaranteeing stability and transparency. Experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed technique in addressing the drawbacks of the two concepts.",

        "abstract": "Intraoperative 3D imaging has great potential for enhancing surgical visualization. This is especially so in ophthalmic surgery where live volumetric imaging from optical coherence tomography systems recently incorporated into surgical microscopes has freed surgeons from the otherwise universal top-down viewpoint. New viewpoints, however, disorient surgeons when directions of their hand motions and viewed tool motions do not align. We propose introducing a robotic surgery system to decouple surgeons' hands from their tools and ensure that viewed tool motions align in arbitrary viewpoints. We present a framework entitled Arbitrary Viewpoint Robotic Manipulation (AVRM) which governs how hand and tool motions should interact to minimize disorientation and thereby enable operations from desirable but previously untenable viewpoints. A crossover study in which 20 subjects completed mock surgical scenarios with an AVRM testbed system demonstrated that arbitrary viewpoints do not improve task performance unless automatic hand-tool misalignment correction is provided. When provided together with arbitrary viewpoints, automatic hand-tool misalignment correction reduces task completion time by 50% on average compared to a fixed top-down viewpoint.",

        "abstract": "Robotic teleoperation in cluttered environments is attracting increasing attention for its potential in hazardous scenarios, disaster response, and telemaintenance. Although haptic feedback has been proven effective in such applications, commercially-available grounded haptic interfaces still show significant limitations in terms of workspace, safety, transparency, and encumbrance. For this reason, we present a novel robotic teleoperation system with wearable haptic feedback for telemanipulation in cluttered environments. The slave system is composed of a soft robotic hand attached to a 6-axis force sensor, which is fixed to a 6-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. The master system is composed of two wearable vibrotactile armbands and a Leap Motion. The armbands are worn on the upper arm and forearm, and convey information about collisions on the robotic arm and hand, respectively. The position of the manipulator and the grasping configuration of the robotic hand are controlled by the user's hand pose as tracked by the Leap Motion. To validate our approach, we carried out a human-subject telemanipulation experiment in a cluttered scenario. Twelve participants were asked to teleoperate the robot to grasp an object hidden between debris of various shapes and stiffnesses. Haptic feedback provided by our wearable devices significantly improved the performance of the considered telemanipulation tasks. All subjects but one preferred conditions with wearable haptic feedback.",

The navigation task consists of driving the robot towards a visual target in the presence of environment (static or moving) obstacles.

To perform such task, the robot must avoid the obstacles while maintaining the target in its field of view. The approach is validated in both simulated and real experiments.",

With the objective of fully autonomous flight, we power our quadrotor using a wired tether. We compensate for the tether in our control of the robot by assuming a static catenary curve of fixed length between the robot and the power source, and model the forces and torques produced. We evaluate accuracy of hovering and flight on simple paths, and compare the results to untethered flight.",

The goal of the HERA project is to provide theoretically well-founded and practically usable logic-based machine ethics tools for implementation in robots. The novelty is that HERA implements multiple ethical principles like utilitarianism, the principle of double effect, and a Pareto-inspired principle. These principles can be used to automatically assess moral situations represented in a format we call causal agency models. We discuss how to model moral situations using our approach, and how it can cope with uncertainty about moral values. Finally, we briefly outline the architecture of our robot IMMANUEL, which implements HERA and is able to explain ethical decisions to humans.",

We aim to magnetically manipulate diverse microrobots in medical applications with respect to surgical or biopsy tasks within insiders of the human head such as to perform brachytherapy with the helical microswimmer, etc. For this reason, we proposed a novel, a magnetically actuated system called the HyBrid system with the conceptual design in capability of generating both uniform and gradient magnetic fields. The system consists of three different coil setups orthogonally arranged over a large workspace which is available to let the human head inserted into. The simulation results of the magnetic field generation expressed that its performance is suitable and feasible towards magnetically manipulation within the human head, and more efficient than 3D-Helmholtz coil system under the same conditions.",

        "abstract": "Consider a setting where robots must visit sites represented as nodes in a graph, but each robot may fail when traversing an edge. The goal is to find a set of paths for a team of robots which maximizes the expected number of nodes collectively visited, while guaranteeing that the paths satisfy a notion of \u201cindependence\u201d formalized by a matroid (e.g. limits on team size, number of visits to regions), and that the probabilities that each robot survives to its destination are above a given threshold. We call this problem the Matroid Team Surviving Orienteers (MTSO) problem, which has broad applications such as environmental monitoring in risky regions and search and rescue in dangerous conditions. We present the MTSO formally and detail numerous examples of matroids in a path planning context. We then propose an approximate greedy algorithm for selecting a feasible set of paths and prove that the value of the output is within a factor ps/ps + \u03bb of the optimum, where ps is the per-robot survival probability threshold and 1/\u03bb \u2264 1 is the approximation factor of an oracle routine for the well known orienteering problem. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying it to a scenario where a team of robots must gather information while avoiding pirates in the Coral Triangle.",

        "abstract": "Planning kinodynamically feasible trajectories for autonomous vehicles is computationally expensive, especially when planning over long distances in unstructured environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planner, called the Maverick planner, which can find such trajectories efficiently. It comprises two parts: a waypoint planner that uses a simplified vehicle model and an RRT* planner that respects full kinodynamic constraints. The waypoint planner quickly finds a directed graph of waypoints from start to goal, which is then used to bias sampling and speed up computation in RRT*. The Maverick planner is capable of anytime planning and continuous replanning. It has been tested extensively in simulation and on real vehicles. When planning on a sensor-generated map of the SwRI test track it can find a feasible path over 0.5 km in under 16 ms, and refine that path to within 1% of the local optimum in 0.5 seconds.",

It allows high-level control algorithms, wireless communication, and computationally expensive operations such as real-time image processing to be handled by a Raspberry Pi, while the e-puck's microcontroller deals with low-level motor control and sensor interfacing. Although two similar extension boards for the e-puck robot platform already exist, they are now out-dated and expensive in comparison. Our open-source hardware design and supporting software infrastructure offer an inexpensive upgrade to the e-puck robot, transforming it into the Pi-puck - a modern and flexible new platform for mobile robotics research.",

Should a task only require a partial localization of the object, our method selects the appropriate information gathering actions to register the desired features. We use probabilistic methods to reason over the distribution of the estimated object poses in the 6-DOF configuration space. We introduce the datum-based particle filter to handle intrinsic tolerances between each of the sections of the object. We describe two alternative methods for the particle filter system: one using the full joint belief and the other reasonably simplifying the belief to achieve a better ability to scale. We present simulation results for both proposed methods to show the advantages of our approaches.",

        "abstract": "To improve the obstacle surmounting performance of the quad-rotor vehicle, this paper focuses on designing, kinematically and dynamically characterizing a novel deformable quad-rotor that is based on the scissor-like foldable structures. The foldable structure allows that the volume of the quad-rotor can be tuned to dynamically adapt variously sized obstacles and small spaces. To generate the controllable deformation, the actuated angulated elements that are the essential components of the scissor-like foldable structure play an important role. The element design, its actuation mechanism and the corresponding configuration patterns for the new quad-rotor are presented in the paper in detail. The simulations on deformation properties and obstacle surmounting ability are then performed to verify the deformation capability of the structure. In addition, experiments were extensively conducted to test the controlled deformation of the structure as well to investigate the deformation induced effects to the activated quad-rotor airframe and its aerodynamics. All implementation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed deformable quad-rotor design, that is, it enables the new quad-rotor having excellent obstacle surmounting performance, adaptability, flight maneuverability, as well as minimal aerodynamics influences during deforming.",

The robots developed so far are either rather expensive or unsuitable for manipulation tasks. This article presents the result of a project which wishes to demonstrate the feasibility of an affordable humanoid robot. R1 is able to navigate, and interact with the environment (grasping and carrying objects, operating switches, opening doors etc). The robot is also equipped with a speaker, microphones and it mounts a display in the head to support interaction using natural channels like speech or (simulated) eye movements. The final cost of the robot is expected to range around that of a family car, possibly, when produced in large quantities, even significantly lower. This goal was tackled along three synergistic directions: use of polymeric materials, light-weight design and implementation of novel actuation solutions. These lines, as well as the robot with its main features, are described hereafter.",

This research compares three different spine morphologies in the planar case, namely the rigid, revolute and prismatic spine. Using a wide range of robots sampled from the design space (200 robots sampled at random), large-scale trajectory optimization (60 seed points per robot per spine morphology) was used to determine the best spine morphology in terms of stride averaged acceleration. Bootstrapping was performed on the results to achieve a better statistical representation and this revealed that for 75% of the robots, a prismatic spine design is the most effective at rapid acceleration, followed by the revolute spine at 6% and rigid spine at 18%.",

        "abstract": "We present a simple and efficient mathematical framework suitable for generating motion in the context of a variety of robotic motion tasks ranging from low-level motor control up to high-level locomotion planning. Our concept is based on a one-dimensional second-order model that allows analytic computation of its inverse dynamics while respecting physical constraints. This makes it a particularly useful tool for tasks that are expressed only as a start and goal state, such as animation key frames or way points in path planning. By means of time synchronization, the model extends easily to an arbitrary number of dimensions in a way that the target is reached in all dimensions at the same time. The framework excels in terms of execution time, which lies in the microsecond range even for high-dimensional trajectory generation tasks. We demonstrate our method in two different settings - full-body trajectory generation and path planning - and show its benefits in comparison with current state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents methodologies for dexterous manipulation by an underactuated robotic soft gripper with a low DOF. While the softness and passive joints provide a stable grasp, the manipulations become challenging owing to the complexities of modeling and state estimation. To investigate the drawbacks, target manipulations using a support surface and gravity are defined in this study. By realizing the target manipulations, methodologies for utilizing both the support surface and gravity in manipulation are validated. For manipulation utilizing the support surface, the key states - at which the type of gripper motion primitive changes - are defined, and gripper motion at the key states is produced with a DNN-based motion generator. For manipulation utilizing gravity, the fall risk of the object is formulated as a constraint for a criterion function, and a parameters-online-exploration based methodology is adopted. The validity of the methodologies is demonstrated through several experiments.",

This method (called the Centroid Method) uses a 3D point cloud representation of the terrain to determine tire-ground interaction, and a linear spring to determine the corresponding tire forces. Simulation results of tire force estimation of the Centroid Method are compared against the experimentally validated MF-Swift model, including on a fractal terrain surface which simulates a rough off-road terrain. The results show that the Centroid Method performs well for longitudinal and vertical tire force estimation especially for lower frequencies up to about 8-21Hz. Although the Centroid Method does not provide the same detail as the advanced tire models such as MF-Swift, it is significantly less complex and simpler to implement for enabling efficient on-board UGV navigation decision making.",

        "abstract": "Real-time tool segmentation from endoscopic videos is an essential part of many computer-assisted robotic surgical systems and of critical importance in robotic surgical data science. We propose two novel deep learning architectures for automatic segmentation of non-rigid surgical instruments. Both methods take advantage of automated deep-learning-based multi-scale feature extraction while trying to maintain an accurate segmentation quality at all resolutions. The two proposed methods encode the multi-scale constraint inside the network architecture. The first proposed architecture enforces it by cascaded aggregation of predictions and the second proposed network does it by means of a holistically-nested architecture where the loss at each scale is taken into account for the optimization process. As the proposed methods are for real-time semantic labeling, both present a reduced number of parameters. We propose the use of parametric rectified linear units for semantic labeling in these small architectures to increase the regularization of the network while maintaining the segmentation accuracy. We compare the proposed architectures against state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks. We validate our methods using existing benchmark datasets, including ex vivo cases with phantom tissue and different robotic surgical instruments present in the scene. Our results show a statistically significant improved Dice Similarity Coefficient over previous instrument segmentation methods. We analyze our design choices and discuss the key drivers for improving accuracy.",

The resulting algorithm is tested and compared to FABMAP visual localization, over data acquired by a Pepper robot in an office building. Several constraints were applied during acquisition to make the experiment fitted to real-life scenarios. Without any tuning, early-fusion surpasses the performances of visual localization by a significant margin: 94% of estimated localizations are less than 5m away from ground truth compared to 81% with visual localization.",

        "abstract": "We address the integrated planning and control problem that enables a single follower robot (the \u201cphotographer\u201d) to maintain a moving target (the \u201csubject\u201d) in its field of view for as long as possible. We propose a real-time pursuit algorithm that seamlessly handles the often neglected, yet unavoidable, scenario in which the target escapes the follower's field of view; a scenario that simple, reactive controllers are ill-equipped to handle. Our algorithm aims to minimize the expected time until visual contact is re-established, which enables the photographer to track the subject for as long as possible, even in the presence of loss of visibility. At the core of our pursuit algorithm is an efficient method for sampling plausible trajectories from different homotopy classes. We do this by generating topologically distinct shortest paths by using the Voronoi diagram. We use these paths to make informed, model-based predictions of the likely future locations of the target, given a history of observations. Given these predictions, our algorithm produces pursuit trajectories that approximately minimize the expected time to recover visual contact. We show that constraining the predictive pursuit problem to the space of homotopy classes condenses the expanse of possibilities that our algorithm must consider, which enables target tracking in large occupancy grids, as opposed to many POMDP methods that are constrained to small environments. We benchmark the tracking behavior of our algorithm against the baseline of human subjects who performed the same set of pursuit tasks in simulation, as well as against two other pursuit algorithms that only take into account paths from a single homotopy class. We show that considering homotopy alternatives in 2D pursuit improves the tracking performance and that our algorithm does at least as well as humans in most pursuit scenarios.",

We also propose an estimation method of the load acting on the TSA using the mathematical model. This relationship has been verified in experiment. A contribution of this research is that the actuation load can be estimated by use of internal structure in TSA which in some circumstances can result in a simpler system compared to direct measurement of load in line.",

        "abstract": "We present a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) system, built with inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, for autonomously following trails in unstructured, outdoor environments such as forests. The system introduces a deep neural network (DNN) called TrailNet for estimating the view orientation and lateral offset of the MAV with respect to the trail center. The DNN-based controller achieves stable flight without oscillations by avoiding overconfident behavior through a loss function that includes both label smoothing and entropy reward. In addition to the TrailNet DNN, the system also utilizes vision modules for environmental awareness, including another DNN for object detection and a visual odometry component for estimating depth for the purpose of low-level obstacle detection. All vision systems run in real time on board the MAV via a Jetson TX1. We provide details on the hardware and software used, as well as implementation details. We present experiments showing the ability of our system to navigate forest trails more robustly than previous techniques, including autonomous flights of 1 km.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we examine joint torque tracking as well as estimation of external torques for the KUKA Lightweight Robot (LBR) IIWA. To support physical human-robot interaction tasks, we need smooth estimation that allows detection of delicate external events and good control to hide inertial forces. Unfortunately a transmission nonlinearity in the motor to joint gearing injects vibrations and limits the performance of the built-in torque controller and observer. We confirm the nonlinearity to be a spatially periodic deflection between the motor and joint. Identification of this behavior allows us to generate more accurate joint position measurements. We also design a matching spatial filter to remove the vibrations from joint torque measurements. Experiments on an LBR IIWA show that compensating for the nonlinearity provides smoother external torque estimates and improves the torque tracking performance. Furthermore, we are able to increase the gain margin more than three fold over the built-in controller.",

        "abstract": "When designing a user-friendly Mobility Assistive Device (MAD) for mobility constrained people, it is important to take into account the diverse spectrum of disabilities, which results to completely different needs to be covered by the MAD for each specific user. An intelligent adaptive behavior is necessary. In this work we present experimental results, using an in house developed methodology for assessing the gait of users with different mobility status while interacting with a robotic MAD. We use data from a laser scanner, mounted on the MAD to track the legs using Particle Filters and Probabilistic Data Association (PDA-PF). The legs' states are fed to an HMM-based pathological gait cycle recognition system to compute in real-time the gait parameters that are crucial for the mobility status characterization of the user. We aim to show that a gait assessment system would be an important feedback for an intelligent MAD. Thus, we use this system to compare the gaits of the subjects using two different control settings of the MAD and we experimentally validate the ability of our system to recognize the impact of the control designs on the users' walking performance. The results demonstrate that a generic control scheme does not meet every patient's needs, and therefore, an Adaptive Context-Aware MAD (ACA MAD), that can understand the specific needs of the user, is important for enhancing the human-robot physical interaction.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Modern robotic systems often consist of a growing set of information-producing components that need to be appropriately connected for the system to function properly. This is commonly done manually or through relatively simple scripts by specifying explicitly which components to connect. However, this process is cumbersome and error-prone, does not scale well as more components are introduced, and lacks flexibility and robustness at run-time. This paper presents an algorithm for setting up and maintaining implicit subscriptions to information through its semantics rather than its source, which we call semantic subscriptions. The proposed algorithm automatically reconfigures the system when necessary in response to changes at run-time, making the semantic subscriptions adaptive to changing circumstances. To illustrate the effectiveness of adaptive semantic subscriptions, we present a case study with two SoftBank Robotics NAO robots for handling the cases when a component stops working and when new components, in this case a second robot, become available. The solution has been implemented as part of a stream reasoning framework integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS).",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used in scientific or industrial operations over the past years. AUV missions require the vehicle to perform a set of actions autonomously and return to the operators. These missions are currently mostly planned offline by the human operators. Existing solutions in commercial planning software usually only provide an estimate of the mission execution time. The uncertain and dynamic underwater environment can have an effect on the mission performance. More time and energy may be required, disallowing successful mission execution. This work proposes the usage of the correlated orienteering problem (COP) that maximises the utility of a sensing mission while respecting energy and time constraints. We propose a heuristic-based on genetic algorithms (GA) for the solution of the COP. This heuristic is compared against optimal mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) solutions. Results show that the quality of the heuristic solution is in the worst tested case 5.5% less than the 1% optimal solutions. The heuristic proves to be at least 3 times more time efficient than the optimal MIQP solutions in the worst case. The heuristic is finally tested on an embedded platform showing its ability to be used on real robotic platforms.",

First, by balancing the forward speed and the stability of the robot, a straight slithering gait is modelled, under which the robot can march straight, fast, and stably. Then, for the purpose of steering, the straight slithering gait is modified into a biased slithering gait. The relationship between turning radius and gait parameters is analyzed by the resistive force theory. With the head composition algorithm, we investigate the orientation problem of the snake robot's head module to obtain stable visual information during the locomotion process. Finally, with the guidance of the vision sensor mounted in the head module, target tracking simulations and prototype experiments are conducted to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the slithering gait in autonomous locomotion scenarios.",

This paper presents a set-up that can achieve autonomous flight in an indoor environment with avoidance of both static obstacles and other pocket-drones. The pocket-drones use only on-board sensing and processing implemented on a STM32F4 microprocessor (168MHz).

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of estimating the pose of tactile elements (i.e. taxels) composing a robotic skin covering the whole body of a robot. This problem arises when a robot skin technology has to be integrated into an already existing robotic platform. To date, the integration process is done by hand and it is not possible to predict where the sensor will be placed on the robot body. This paper presents a novel approach based on a RGB-D camera and exploiting the motion capabilities of the robot for activating the skin sensors. The method uses the measurements of the camera to reconstruct the unknown robot body outer shape and to compute how the area can be touched by the robot. The taxels responses and the related contact centroids are used for estimating the position of the sensors. Our method is based on few assumptions and is a step towards a calibration procedure that can be executed autonomously by a robot. Experiments performed on the Baxter robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach obtaining an average position error less than 2mm.",

Follow-the-leader (FTL) deployment, with CTR body following its tip, is being integrated as a design constraint in order to minimize the device invasiveness. A design procedure is proposed and developed in the context of olfactory cell inspection. Stability issues of CTR are considered with theoretical validation of FTL deployment. Finally, an experimental assessment in lab conditions is being conducted that includes the device deployment and the reproduction of scanning task for imaging. The whole surface to be inspected can be accessed, and 20 \u03bcm resolution of the CTR tip is observed.",

The sample trajectories and the hybrid limit cycle of the dynamical system are stabilized using locally valid Time Varying LQR controller policies which probabilistically cover a bounded region of state space. The original LQR Tree algorithm builds such trees for non-linear static and non-hybrid systems like a pendulum or a cart-pole. We leverage the idea of LQR trees to plan with a continuous control set, unlike methods that rely on discretization like dynamic programming to plan for hybrid dynamical systems where it is hard to capture the exact event of discrete transition. We test the algorithm on a compass gait model by stabilizing a dynamic walking hybrid limit cycle with point foot contact from random initial conditions. We show results from the simulation where the system comes back to a stable behavior with initial position or velocity perturbation and noise.",

        "abstract": "Large robotic collectives provide advantages such as resilience to mechanical failure of single agents and increased capabilities for search and coverage based applications. However, a lack of rapid and free-form manufacturing processes remains a barrier to high-volume fabrication of mechanically heterogeneous robotic swarms. Self-folding laser-machined structures have the potential to enable heterogeneous robotic swarms. As an initial step to realizing a functional robotic collective, we focus on the design and characterization of the locomotion of an individual laminate manufactured robot. We look to a vibration-based locomotion technique that uses flexible structures or bristles to enhance the effects of vibration, allowing for fast locomotion (i.e. a \u201cbristle-bot\u201d). However, previous bristle-bot implementations have not allowed for controllable steering behaviors with high locomotion speeds. We describe the extension of existing two dimensional bristle-bot models to a three dimensional model that explores parameters that govern linear and angular velocity. We implement an autonomous laminate-manufactured bristle-bot inspired robot capable of linear velocities of up to 23 cm/s and turning rates of 2 rad/s. Moving towards automated manufacturing, we also demonstrate a self-folding bristle-bot structure that uses a linear compression laminate to achieve a uniform leg fold angle.",

Our approach maximizes a formal definition of search effectiveness given finite search effort. We account for false positive measurements and variation in the performance of the search sensor due to geographic variation of the seafloor. We compare near-optimal search paths that can be computed in real-time with optimal search paths for which real-time computation is infeasible. We show how sonar data acquired for locating targets at a specific location can also be used to characterize the performance of the search sonar at that location. Our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments where search paths are planned using sonar data previously acquired from Boston Harbor.",

        "abstract": "Many model-based Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms have been proposed in the past decade, often restricted to the type of camera optics, or the underlying motion manifold observed. We envision robots to be able to learn and perform these tasks, in a minimally supervised setting, as they gain more experience. To this end, we propose a fully trainable solution to visual ego-motion estimation for varied camera optics. We propose a visual ego-motion learning architecture that maps observed optical flow vectors to an ego-motion density estimate via a Mixture Density Network (MDN). By modeling the architecture as a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE), our model is able to provide introspective reasoning and prediction for ego-motion induced scene-flow. Additionally, our proposed model is especially amenable to bootstrapped ego-motion learning in robots where the supervision in ego-motion estimation for a particular camera sensor can be obtained from standard navigation-based sensor fusion strategies (GPS/INS and wheel-odometry fusion). Through experiments, we show the utility of our proposed approach in enabling the concept of self-supervised learning for visual ego-motion estimation in autonomous robots.",

        "abstract": "Multi-person tracking with a robotic platform is one of the cornerstones of human-robot interaction. Challenges arise from occlusions, appearance changes and a time-varying number of people. Furthermore, the final system is constrained by the hardware platform: low computational capacity and limited field-of-view. In this paper, we propose a novel method to simultaneously track a time-varying number of persons in three-dimensions and perform visual servoing. The complementary nature of the tracking and visual servoing enables the system to: (i) track several persons while compensating for large ego-movements and (ii) visually control the robot to keep a selected person of interest within the field of view. We propose a variational Bayesian formulation allowing us to effectively solve the inference problem through the use of closed-form solutions. Importantly, this leads to a computationally efficient procedure that runs at 10 FPS. The experiments on the NAO-MPVS dataset confirm the importance of using visual servoing for tracking multiple persons.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a vision-based control strategy for tracking a ground target using a novel vision sensor featuring a processor for each pixel element. This enables computer vision tasks to be carried out directly on the focal plane in a highly efficient manner rather than using a separate general purpose computer. The strategy enables a small, agile quadrotor Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) to track the target from close range using minimal computational effort and with low power consumption. To evaluate the system we target a vehicle driven by chaotic dual-pendulum trajectories. Target proximity and the large, unpredictable accelerations of the vehicle cause challenges for the UAV in keeping it within the downward facing camera's field of view (FoV). A state observer is used to smooth out predictions of the target's location and, importantly, estimate velocity. Experimental results also demonstrate that it is possible to continue to re-acquire and follow the target during short periods of loss in target visibility. The tracking algorithm exploits the parallel nature of the visual sensor, enabling high rate image processing ahead of any communication bottleneck with the UAV controller. With the vision chip carrying out the most intense visual information processing, it is computationally trivial to compute all of the controls for tracking onboard. This work is directed toward visual agile robots that are power efficient and that ferry only useful data around the information and control pathways.",

In this paper, designed trajectory by using Non Uniform Basis Spline (NUBS) curve and control strategy, by using proposed trajectory, to effectively overcome obstacles are presented. The trajectory designed by NUBS curve has several advantages: 1) local modification, 2) tracking velocity control for each domain, and 3) low degree trajectory with a large number of control points. The robot gets remarkable effectiveness when these advantages are used to generate the trajectory for walking and overcoming obstacles. By implementation of the proposed control strategy, quadruped robot can walk over obstacles while keeping its gait, speed and balance without collision although adjusting relatively preferable state which is more suitable position or posture of the walking robot shortly before encountering obstacles is not required. The proposed trajectory and control strategy are discussed, and performance is validated through experimental evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Locomotion at low Reynolds numbers is a topic of growing interest, spurred by its various engineering and medical applications. This paper presents a novel prototype and a locomotion algorithm for the 3-link planar Purcell's swimmer based on Lie algebraic notions. The kinematic model, based on Cox theory of the prototype swimmer is a driftless control-affine system. Using the existing strong controllability and related results, the existence of motion primitives is initially shown. The Lie algebra of the control vector fields is then used to synthesize control profiles to generate motions along the basis of the Lie algebra associated with the structure group of the system. An open loop control system with vision-based positioning is successfully implemented which allows tracking any given continuous trajectory of the position and orientation of the swimmer's base link. Alongside, the paper also provides a theoretical interpretation of the symmetry arguments presented in the existing literature to generate the control profiles of the swimmer.",

        "abstract": "The auto-encoder method is a type of dimensionality reduction method. A mapping from a vector to a descriptor that represents essential information can be automatically generated from a set of vectors without any supervising information. However, an image and its spatially shifted version are encoded into different descriptors by an existing ordinary auto-encoder because each descriptor includes a spatial subpattern and its position. To generate a descriptor representing a spatial subpattern in an image, we need to normalize its spatial position in the images prior to training an ordinary auto-encoder; however, such a normalization is generally difficult for images without obvious standard positions. We propose a transform invariant auto-encoder and an inference model of transform parameters. By the proposed method, we can separate an input into a transform invariant descriptor and transform parameters. The proposed method can be applied to various auto-encoders without requiring any special modules or labeled training samples. By applying it to shift transforms, we can achieve a shift invariant auto-encoder that can extract a typical spatial subpattern independent of its relative position in a window. In addition, we can achieve a model that can infer shift parameters required to restore the input from the typical subpattern. As an example of the proposed method, we demonstrate that a descriptor generated by a shift invariant auto-encoder can represent a typical spatial subpattern. In addition, we demonstrate the imitation of a human hand by a robot hand as an example of a regression based on spatial subpatterns.",

In this paper we propose an origami-inspired method of addressing these key issues by designing and manufacturing a foldable, deployable, and self-righting version of the origami robot Tribot. Our latest Tribot prototype can jump as high as 215 mm, five times its height, and roll consecutively on any of its edges with an average step size of 55 mm. The 4 g robot self-deploys nine times of its size when released. A compliant roll cage ensures that the robot self-rights onto two legs after jumping or being deployed and also protects the robot from impacts. A description of our prototype and its design, locomotion modes, and fabrication is followed by demonstrations of its key features.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Multi-robot teleoperation systems benefit from human's capabilities in adaptation to new environments and decision-making in the presence of uncertainty and complexity. In these applications, usually a human operator determines the general behaviour of the multi-robot team via selecting and controlling a leader robot while the follower robots coordinate with the team autonomously. Trust is a major factor in human's allocation of autonomy among the team of robots. A trust-based online leader selection strategy is proposed in this work for multi-robot bilateral haptic teleoperation with applications in collective position tracking and synchronization. Human-to-robot trust is computed and utilized as a dynamic criterion to select the leader. Also, robot-to-human trust is used to dynamically scale the haptic force feedback cues so that the operator receives smaller force feedback when his/her performance in leading the team is higher. This reduces the physical workload of the operator. Due to the trust-based leader switching and force feedback scaling, the stability of the closed-loop system may be lost. We guarantee this stability via passivity-based techniques. Finally, our experimental results indicate that the trust-based leader selection strategy can reduce task completion time by 35.25% and formation error by 41.64% compared to a non-leader switching strategy.",

A critical problem for soft robots is the capability to estimate their shapes to enable closed-loop control for precise motion. In this paper, we propose a new low-cost sensor that can be leveraged for shape estimation of soft robots. This sensor, recently discovered as an artificial muscle, can be conveniently fabricated from low-cost conductive sewing threads. We recently found that the resistance will increase if the fabricated sensor is elongated due to an external force [1]. Since the sensor is inherently soft, it can be embedded into soft robots to estimate the shape. We establish a physics-based model to predict the external force and the displacement if the resistance is given and experimentally validate its correctness. Moreover, to demonstrate the sensing capability, we embed the proposed sensor into soft materials and successfully measure two curvatures of a two-segment soft robot. Therefore, the proposed sensor has the potential to estimate complicated shapes of soft robots to enable closed-loop control.",

Despite advances in sensing, in particular related to 3D video, the methodologies to process the data are still subject to research. We demonstrate superior results by a system which combines recurrent neural networks with convolutional neural networks in a voting approach. The gated-recurrent-unit-based neural networks are particularly well-suited to distinguish actions based on long-term information from optical tracking data; the 3D-CNNs focus more on detailed, recent information from video data. The resulting features are merged in an SVM which then classifies the movement. In this architecture, our method improves recognition rates of state-of-the-art methods by 14% on standard data sets.",

        "abstract": "This research teams an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to augment and automate marine mass casualty incident search and rescue in emergency response phase. The demand for real-time responsiveness of those missions requires fast and comprehensive situational awareness and precise operations, which are challenging to achieve because of the large area and the flat nature of the water field. The responders, drowning victims, and rescue vehicle are far apart and all located at the sea level. The long distances mean responders cannot clearly discern the rescue vehicle and victims from the surrounding water. Furthermore, being at the same elevation makes depth perception difficult. Rescue vehicle and victims at different distances from the responder will always appear to be close together. This makes it almost impossible for the responders to accurately drive the USV to the victims in time. This paper proposes the use of a UAV to compensate for the lack of elevation of the responders and to automate search and rescue operations. The benefit of this system is two fold: 1) the UAV provides responders with an overhead view of the field, covers larger area than direct visual, and allows more accurate perception of the situation, and 2) it automates the rescue process so that the responders can focus on task-level needs instead of tediously driving the USV to the victims. Thirty autonomous navigation trials in 4 rescue scenarios prove the first known successful implementation of a small UAV visually navigating a USV.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an ultra-wideband (UWB) aided localization and mapping system that leverages on inertial sensor and depth camera. Inspired by the fact that visual odometry (VO) system, regardless of its accuracy in the short term, still faces challenges with accumulated errors in the long run or under unfavourable environments, the UWB ranging measurements are fused to remove the visual drift and improve the robustness. A general framework is developed which consists of three parallel threads, two of which carry out the visualinertial odometry (VIO) and UWB localization respectively. The other mapping thread integrates visual tracking constraints into a pose graph with the proposed smooth and virtual range constraints, such that a bundle adjustment is performed to provide robust trajectory estimation. Experiments show that the proposed system is able to create dense drift-free maps in real-time even running on an ultra-low power processor in featureless environments.",

        "abstract": "SONAR mapping of underwater environments leads to dense point-clouds. These maps have large memory footprints, are inherently noisy and consist of raw data with no semantic information. This paper presents an approach to underwater semantic mapping where known man-made structures that appear in multibeam SONAR data are automatically recognised. From a set of SONAR images acquired by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and a catalogue of `a-priori' 3D CAD models of structures that may potentially be found in the data, our algorithm proceeds in two phases. First we recognise objects using an efficient, rotation-invariant 2D descriptor combined with a histogram matching method. Then, we determine pose using a 6 degree-of-freedom registration of the 3D object to the local scene using a fast 2D correlation, refined with an iterative closest point (ICP)-based method. Once the structures located and identified, we build a semantic representation of the world based on the initial CAD models, resulting in a lightweight yet accurate world model. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on field data acquired by an AUV in Loch Linnhe, Scotland. Our method proves to be suitable for online semantic mapping of a partially man-made underwater environment such as a typical oil field.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is important to register oceanographic data into a geo-referenced coordinate system. Knowing the location of the sampling is critical. For a marine robotic network, the location of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) can be measured using a Global Positioning System (GPS), however the navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is more challenging. In this paper, we present a method for determining the position of underwater vehicles from a moving USV using the relative range information provided by an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL)/acoustic modem. The navigation method uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to update the states predicted from a model-based dead-reckoning technique. Since the vehicle model is relative to the surrounding fluid, we have introduced two environmental states in the state matrix. Such a modification allows us to quantify the effects induced by the ocean current on the vehicle's speed. Beyond that, the method uses a limited number of sensors, only attitude sensors and an USBL/acoustic modem, offering an alternative for AUVs without expensive instruments such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Experiments are conducted to evaluate the range-based navigation method on a hybrid Slocum underwater glider with an USV. As a result from the reference trial, the estimated glider position stays within the error of 15 meters comparing to the measured position of a surface buoy where the glider is attached. In the open-water trial, trajectories estimated from the range-based navigation are compared with dead-reckoning paths and current-compensated dead-reckoning paths (reference). As a result, the distance errors are bounded with the proposed navigation method while the dead-reckoning errors grow without bound.",

        "abstract": "We present a robust multi-robot convoying approach that relies on visual detection of the leading agent, thus enabling target following in unstructured 3-D environments. Our method is based on the idea of tracking-by-detection, which interleaves efficient model-based object detection with temporal filtering of image-based bounding box estimation. This approach has the important advantage of mitigating tracking drift (i.e. drifting away from the target object), which is a common symptom of model-free trackers and is detrimental to sustained convoying in practice. To illustrate our solution, we collected extensive footage of an underwater robot in ocean settings, and hand-annotated its location in each frame. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical comparison of multiple tracker variants, including the use of several convolutional neural networks, both with and without recurrent connections, as well as frequency-based model-free trackers. We also demonstrate the practicality of this tracking-by-detection strategy in real-world scenarios by successfully controlling a legged underwater robot in five degrees of freedom to follow another robot's independent motion.",

We propose an unified approach which, for a query image, finds a set of candidate images together with feature matching results. By considering the local geometric consistency of neighboring features, we can find more and better feature matches even in challenging situations. Since the proposed forward/backward matching and non-linear diffusion run very efficiently, they can be used in the candidate image selection and improve the image retrieval performance significantly.

This is part of a bigger project which will see the actuation and control of an intent-driven exoskeleton. The limited time stroke survivors have with their therapists means that they can not often get enough training. During active-assisted training, therapists guide the paralysed limb through a movement only after detecting visual or haptic cues of the motion intent from the patient. Aiming to replicate therapist practices of recognising patients' intention to move, a pilot study of a tactile system is performed. The system will perform consistently even with patients who have low muscle strength and control ability. Currently available devices for detecting muscle activity do not offer the robustness and performance necessary; Electromyography (EMG) sensors, a well-established method, is affected by factors like skin moisture and BCI (Brain Computer Interface) has a slow response time. The proposed tactile sensing system is a simple yet robust solution both from a sensing as well as a usability point of view. Pilot experiments have been performed with a healthy subject emulating low muscle activation conditions. An overall accuracy of 80.45% is achieved when detecting forearm and arm muscle contractions and hence motion intent.",

It consists of two input configurations for endoscope type (straight or oblique endoscope) and operation type (direct or indirect operation). Direct operation is used for wide area motion based on direct operation of the force-controlled arm, and indirect operation is for fine and precise movement to adjust the visual field by tool tracking or joystick manipulation. These were tested by doctors and development members as subjects. It was then confirmed that both operation types can be effective. We also discuss about the importance of detecting contact with organs from outside the patient's body (without sensors near the tool tip) and evaluate the feasibility of this feature with external force estimation function for force-controlled arm as a first step. As a result, it was found that the external forces in the insertion direction to the trocar can be estimated with an error of about \u00b10.2 N and up to 1.0 N on the other directions. Therefore we confirmed that contact detection function can be effective.",

        "abstract": "The successes of teleoperation scenarios for mobile robots depends on a stable and reliable communication link. The environment information collected by the robot - represented by 2D or 3D images - has to be provided with a high resolution and a low delay to ensure a fast and precise system response. But in most realistic applications, the communication parameters fluctuate strongly over time. It is necessary to monitor the communication link continuously to react in case of reduced bandwidth and increased delay. But which environment information and correspondingly which bandwidth is necessary to control a robot safely? Due to a missing reliable rule set we investigated this question for a UAV scenario based on two different environment representations (camera images, gridmaps). We designed a simulator based study and evaluated the capability of the participants to control a robot in case of delayed or coarsely rasterized information. Although our study involved only non-experts, we found some interesting first results. While the performance of our participants depends strongly on the delay, it is nearly independent on the image resolution, which suggests downsampling as a valid response for bandwidth decrease. We also found that participants generally struggle with using grid map for controlling the robot. However, this type of interfaces requires far less bandwidth than images. They also excel in situations with higher delays, which makes them the tool of choice when there are really bad channel conditions.",

        "abstract": "Haptic feedback for minimally invasive surgery is a widely debated topic, especially force sensors for this kind of application are thoroughly researched. The current state-of-the-art includes several realization options, but none of them are suitable to be integrated in small diameter instruments. In this work, we present a new approach for the generation of haptic feedback by using two separate feedback mechanisms for spatial kinesthetic and unidirectional tactile feedback in a teleoperation system with a parallel kinematic slave robot and the design of the corresponding user interfaces. Kinesthetic forces are measured with proximal sensors in the robot kinematic and displayed with a delta-type kinematic mechanism. Tactile signals are acquired with an acceleration sensor placed closely at the tip of the robot manipulator and conveyed open-loop by a vibrating cylinder to the user's palm. Kinesthetic forces up to 15 N can be displayed up to a frequency of 50 Hz. The tactile interface displays accelerations up to 15m/s for frequencies from 50 Hz to 1000 Hz. The combination of the two interfaces allows the display of high-fidelity haptic feedback with greatly reduced requirements on the interface components.",

        "abstract": "Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) actuators have been used as exoskeletons because of their inherited compliance and high power-weight ratio. However, creating accurate models remains difficult mainly due to the compliance issue; the model can be changed by the force applied by the user. Therefore, both user and robot actions need to be considered for sufficient excitation of PAMs that are equipped in exoskeleton robots, unlike typical rigid actuators that can only be sufficiently excited by robot actions. In this paper, we propose a user-robot collaborative excitation approach for PAM model identification as an active learning framework for sequentially collecting data by deriving and executing optimal user and robot actions at each step with Gaussian processes. The optimal actions, which are executed by the robot, are displayed on a monitor that enables the user to execute them. We conducted experiments using a powered elbow exoskeleton with a PAM actuator. Experimental results show that our method can more efficiently identify the PAM model than a standard model identification method that does not use any data acquired through user-robot collaboration.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for safe tracking of a moving target in cluttered environments using a quadrotor. The key contribution of our work is a formulation that enables the generation of safe and dynamical feasible tracking trajectories that satisfy arbitrary relative motion patterns (circling, parallel tracking, undirectional tracking, etc.) with respect to the target. In our framework, forming the desired relative motion pattern between the quadrotor and the target only requires a generative function that specifies relative positions at different time instants. Our method generates samples to fit a piecewise-polynomial representation of the desired relative motion pattern and embeds it into a cost function for solving valid tracking trajectories via quadratic programming. Collision avoidance is achieved by squeezing the trajectory into a collision-free flight corridor, and dynamical feasibility is achieved by enforcing bounds on corresponding derivatives. Both of which can be written as linear constraints for the quadratic programming. Our approach is lightweight and can be implemented for real-time target tracking. We use a simulated cluttered environment and multiple desired relative motion patterns to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Construction automation has historically been driven by top-down implementations of specific tasks, which are neither responsive nor resilient to dynamic situations, and often require centralized control or human supervision. Previous work on robotic assembly has generally neglected to consider forces acting on the structure, whether in the completed structure alone or throughout the building process. In this paper, we investigate the utility of local force measurements in guiding construction by a distributed team of strut-climbing robots, focusing on a scenario involving building an unsupported span out across a gap in a two-dimensional vertical plane, as a step towards building a bridge. We show that such measurements enable robots to build structures that cantilever significantly further than those built by robots without access to such information, while maintainig stability throughout the building sequence. We consider both structures securely anchored to the ground and those resting unanchored atop it, using a counterbalancing approach in the latter case to permit cantilevering. The principles explored in simulation are also demonstrated in hardware, including a prototype strut-climbing robot and truss components, incorporating a cost-effective sensor implementation that reports the requisite force information.",

        "abstract": "Admittance control is a widely used approach for guaranteeing a compliant behavior of the robot in physical human-robot interaction. When an admittance-controlled robot is coupled with a human, the dynamics of the human can cause deviations from the desired behavior of the robot, mainly due to a stiffening of the human arm, and thus generate high-frequency unsafe oscillations of the robot. In this paper we present a novel methodology for detecting the rising oscillations in the human-robot interaction. Furthermore, we propose a passivity-preserving strategy to adapt the parameter of the admittance control in order to get rid of the high-frequency oscillations and, when possible, to restore the desired interaction model. A thorough experimental validation of the proposed strategy is performed on a group of 26 users performing a cooperative task.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in LOC technology have made it possible to analyze cells in microfluidic devices in a microscopic environment. Vision-based cell analysis systems have a limitation in their analysis range owing to the small view area of the microscopic objective lens; thus, an expansion of the view area of microscopic observation is required. In this paper, we propose a view expansion system for photomicroscopy using the observing point movement of a Galvano mirror. We develop a prototype of the proposed view expansion system that consists of a microscope, Galvano mirror, and vision system. Then, the visual field of the developed microscopic view expansion system is derived experimentally. Finally, our system is demonstrated through panoramic image developing experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by comparing it with a normal microscopic video shooting area.",

        "abstract": "In grasp detection, the robot estimates the position and orientation of potential grasp configurations directly from sensor data. This paper explores the relationship between viewpoint and grasp detection performance. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the approximate position and orientation of a desired grasp is known in advance and we want to select a viewpoint that will enable a grasp detection algorithm to localize it more precisely and with higher confidence. Our main findings are that the right viewpoint can dramatically increase the number of detected grasps and the classification accuracy of the top-n detections. We use this insight to create a viewpoint selection algorithm and compare it against a random viewpoint selection strategy and a strategy that views the desired grasp head-on. We find that the head-on strategy and our proposed viewpoint selection strategy can improve grasp success rates on a real robot by 8% and 4%, respectively. Moreover, we find that the combination of the two methods can improve grasp success rates by as much as 12%.",

Furthermore, these small differences are often only observable from certain viewpoints or may even require information from multiple viewpoints to fully verify. We introduce and compare three approaches to selecting viewpoints for verifying successful execution of tasks: (1) a random forest-based method that discovers highly informative fine-grained visual features, (2) SVM models trained on features extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks, and (3) an active, hybrid approach that uses the above methods for two-stage multi-viewpoint classification. These approaches are experimentally validated on an IKEA furniture assembly task and a quadrotor surveillance domain.",

Traditional motion planners for mobile ground robots with a laser range sensor mostly depend on the obstacle map of the navigation environment where both the highly precise laser sensor and the obstacle map building work of the environment are indispensable. We show that, through an asynchronous deep reinforcement learning method, a mapless motion planner can be trained end-to-end without any manually designed features and prior demonstrations. The trained planner can be directly applied in unseen virtual and real environments. The experiments show that the proposed mapless motion planner can navigate the nonholonomic mobile robot to the desired targets without colliding with any obstacles.",

        "abstract": "We propose a reactive locomotion strategy, called height reflex, that is useful to address big elevation changes in the terrain (e.g. when a quadruped robot has to step down from a high platform). In these cases the swing leg can lose mobility creating issues in the subsequent steps. The height reflex is a foot trajectory replanning strategy that redistributes the swing motion (in a smart way) to the stance legs to \u201clower\u201d the whole trunk and to aid the foothold searching motion. To spread the motion we exploit a massless link model of the robot with virtual dampers at the joints, which is used to replan the feet trajectories. The proposed approach is able to incorporate kinematic limits, it is easy-to-tune, computationally efficient and suitable for real-time implementations. The reflex is implemented and experimentally evaluated on the 80 kg hydraulic quadruped HyQ. With our approach we were able to address high steps, up to 24 cm which is 30% of HyQ leg length and 53% of its retractable leg range.",

We exploit differential flatness and B-Splines to parametrize the system trajectories in terms of a finite number of control points, which can then be optimized by Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The control strategy is similar to a Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach for modifying online the reference trajectory in order to account for noise, disturbances and any non-modeled effect.

A contactless coordinated motion can be achieved using vision, mounting a camera either on the robot end-effector or on the human. We consider here one instance of such a visual coordination task, with the robot end-effector that should maintain a prescribed position with respect to a moving RGB-D camera while pointing at it. For the 3D localization of the moving camera, we compare three different techniques and introduce some improvements to the best solution found for our application. For the motion tracking problem, we introduce a relaxed version of the pointing part of the task. This allows to take advantage of the redundancy of the robot, distributing the control effort over the available degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by V-REP simulations and experiments with the 7-dof KUKA LWR manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Environment-constrained grasping exploits beneficial interactions between hand, object, and environment to increase grasp success. Instead of focusing on the final static relationship between hand posture and object pose, this view of grasping emphasizes the need and the opportunity to select the most appropriate, contact-rich grasping motion, leading up to a final static grasp configuration. This view changes the nature of the underlying planning problem: Instead of planning for static contact points, we need to decide which environmental constraint (EC) to use during the grasping motion. We propose a method to make these decisions based on depth measurements so as to generate robust grasps for a large variety of objects. Our planner exploits the advantages of a soft robot hand and learns a hand-specific classifier for edge-, surface-, and wall-grasps, each exploiting a different EC. Additionally, we show how the model can continuously be improved in a contextual multi-armed bandit setting without an explicit training and test phase, enabling the continuous improvement of a robot's grasping skills throughout life time.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses recursive markerless estimation of a robot's end-effector using visual observations from its cameras. The problem is formulated into the Bayesian framework and addressed using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filtering. We use a 3D rendering engine and Computer Aided Design (CAD) schematics of the robot to virtually create images from the robot's camera viewpoints. These images are then used to extract information and estimate the pose of the end-effector. To this aim, we developed a particle filter for estimating the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors to capture robust characteristic features of shapes in both cameras and rendered images. We implemented the algorithm on the iCub humanoid robot and employed it in a closed-loop reaching scenario. We demonstrate that the tracking is robust to clutter, allows compensating for errors in the robot kinematics and servoing the arm in closed loop using vision.",

The unique problems that arise due to the positivity of the string tensions required to maintain the static stability and desirable stiffness of the structural system are shown to bring about interesting opportunities to optimize for the redundancy in the actuation process. The static stability consideration, coupled with the nonlinear dynamics and the sensor models introduce additional algebraic constraints in implementation of both kinematic and model based dynamic controllers for tensegrity systems. Approaches to develop kinematic and dynamic control techniques are detailed in this paper. A bench top experimental setup consisting of a simple tensegrity system is utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of the output feedback control approach developed in the paper. Near real time image measurements are utilized to drive the output error used in the control scheme.",

First, a smoothness prior is proposed and verified by using synthetic and real panoramic images. Then a mismatch removal method is developed for panoramic images based on such smoothness prior. Finally, an interpolation function for the motion flow is obtained simultaneously as a byproduct of mismatch removal, and the focus-of-expansion or focus-of-contraction is used to determine homing directions. The proposed visual homing can be used alone. Also the mismatch removal method can be used as a pre-processing method, and integrated with any other visual homing method which depends on precious keypoints matching. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by a panoramic dataset for visual homing.",

        "abstract": "Visual inertial odometry (VIO) gained lots of interest recently for efficient and accurate ego-motion estimation of robots and automobiles. With a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) rigidly attached, VIO aims to estimate the 3D pose trajectory of the device in a global metric space. We propose a novel visual inertial odometry algorithm which directly optimizes the camera poses with noisy IMU data and visual feature locations. Instead of running separate filters for IMU and visual data, we put them into a unified non-linear optimization framework in which the perspective reprojection costs of visual features and the motion costs on the acceleration and angular velocity from the IMU and pose trajectory are jointly optimized. The proposed system is tested on the EuRoC dataset for quantitative comparison with the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial odometry and on the mobile phone data as a real-world application. The proposed algorithm is conceptually very clear and simple, achieves good accuracy, and can be easily implemented using publicly available non-linear optimization toolkits.",

A particle filter framework is employed for jump-free localization on the driven path of the leading vehicle.

Making such interpretations, however, requires the ability to perceive the relevant feature(s) from the observed human behavior. With visual sensing alone, robots are typically limited to perceiving only the human's overt motion in the form of joint angles and positions. Ideally, robots designed to interface with humans would also be able to infer information as to how the human is controlling itself from that overt motion. In this study, we investigated if and how humans might be able to visually sense changes in limb mechanical impedance of others. Results indicated that humans can visually perceive changes in joint stiffness from the motion of a two-link planar arm, suggesting that humans can extract information regarding how humans control limb impedance from kinematic information. These findings have important implications for applications where robots must interpret the motor actions of humans, such as during robot imitation learning and human-robot physical interaction.",

A kinematic model of soft robots is obtained thanks to the Finite Element Method (FEM) computed in real-time. The FEM allows to obtain a prediction of the Jacobian matrix of the robot. This allows a first control of the robot, in the actuator space. Then, a second control strategy based on the feedback of infrared cameras is developed to obtain a correction of the effector position. The robust stability of this closed-loop system is obtained based on Lyapunov stability theory. Otherwise, to deal with the problem of image features (the marker points placed on the end effector of soft robot) loss, a switched control strategy is proposed to combine both the open-loop controller and the closed-loop controller. Finally, experiments on a parallel soft robot driven by four cables are conducted and show the effectiveness of these methods for the real-time control of soft robots.",

        "abstract": "Manipulation tasks requiring high precision are difficult for reasons such as imprecise calibration and perceptual inaccuracies. We present a method for visual task outcome verification that provides an assessment of the task status as well as information for the robot to improve this status. The final status of the task is assessed as success, failure or in progress. We propose a deep learning strategy to learn the task with a small number of training episodes and without requiring the robot. A probabilistic, appearance-based pose estimation method is used to learn the demonstrated task. For real-data efficiency, synthetic training images are created around the trajectory of the demonstrated task. We show that our method can estimate the task status with high accuracy in several instances of different tasks, and demonstrate the accuracy of a high-precision task on a real robot.",

        "abstract": "Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) that operate in unstructured, unexplored environments require fast and flexible local planning, which can replan when new parts of the map are explored. Trajectory optimization methods fulfill these needs, but require obstacle distance information, which can be given by Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs). We propose a method to incrementally build ESDFs from Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDFs), a common implicit surface representation used in computer graphics and vision. TSDFs are fast to build and smooth out sensor noise over many observations, and are designed to produce surface meshes. We show that we can build TSDFs faster than Octomaps, and that it is more accurate to build ESDFs out of TSDFs than occupancy maps. Our complete system, called voxblox, is available as open source and runs in real-time on a single CPU core. We validate our approach on-board an MAV, by using our system with a trajectory optimization local planner, entirely on-board and in real-time.",

Essential to this is the ability to combine traditional \u201cankle strategy\u201d balancing with step timing and location adjustment techniques. In doing so, the robot is able to step quickly to the necessary location to continue walking. In this work, we present both a new swing speed up algorithm to adjust the step timing, allowing the robot to set the foot down more quickly to recover from errors in the direction of the current capture point dynamics, and a new algorithm to adjust the desired footstep, expanding the base of support to utilize the center of pressure (CoP)-based ankle strategy for balance. We then utilize the desired centroidal moment pivot (CMP) to calculate the momentum rate of change for our inverse-dynamics based whole-body controller. We present simulation and experimental results using this work, and discuss performance limitations and potential improvements.",

A preliminary experiment shows that the force is proportional to the pitch angle of the UAV when it contacts the bridge pier. A bridge pier contact experiment shows that our developed UAV can control contact force between its end-effector and the bridge pier; mean error of the contact force is 4.27 \u00b1 3.64 [N] against 20[N] desired force.",

The method yields torque-frequency diagrams that are suitable to benchmark torque controllers, formulate actuator design specifications and compare as well as select actuators for a specific torque control application. The paper exemplifies the method on a WALK-MAN leg actuator with locked actuator output and the more practical case of a varying load inertia.",

We leverage the concept of `experiences' in visual perception for robotics, accounting for bias in the data a robot sees by fitting object detector models to a particular `place'. The key question we seek to answer in this paper is simply: how do we define a place? We build bespoke pedestrian detector models for autonomous driving, highlighting the necessary trade off between generalisation and model capacity as we vary the extent of the `place' we fit to. We demonstrate a sizeable performance gain over a current state-of-the-art detector when using computationally lightweight bespoke place-fitted detector models.",

        "abstract": "Current research interests for humanoid robots include cost, static stability, and human-likeness. With the help of well-developed locomotion controllers, human-like gait has been realized on humanoid robots with higher energy efficiency and increased motion speed. However, such results are based on the walking function of bipedal robots, running function has been less touched or investigated. Different from walking, running could cause more injuries when human cope with the impact from the ground. In this paper, we define a new foot strike pattern that describes the instinctive human running manner and the performance of a group of adults is collected and analysed for comparison of different foot strike patterns. This helps with lower limbs' injury prevention by proving that most of the impact transient is reduced in the new foot strike pattern for both the shod and the barefoot conditions. Therefore, the newly defined foot strike pattern can be considered as an alternative option to reduce the injury of running activities. Furthermore, it would be possible to apply the foot strike pattern mechanism in humanoid robots, not only to extend the service life from the collision and vibration damage of the components, but also to make robots more human-like.",

Our approach solely relies on laser and radar data and learns a classifier based on Random Forests to predict when it is safe to cross the road. We present extensive experimental evaluations using real-world data collected from multiple street crossing situations which demonstrate that our approach yields a safe and accurate street crossing behavior and generalizes well over different types of situations. A comparison to alternative methods demonstrates the advantages of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Wire detection is a key capability for safe navigation of autonomous aerial vehicles and is a challenging problem as wires are generally only a few pixels wide, can appear at any orientation and location, and are hard to distinguish from other similar looking lines and edges. We leverage the recent advances in deep learning by treating wire detection as a semantic segmentation task, and investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for the same. To find an optimal model in terms of detection accuracy and real time performance on a portable GPU, we perform a grid search over a finite space of architectures. Further, to combat the issue of unavailability of a large public dataset with annotations, we render synthetic wires using a ray tracing engine, and overlay them on 67K images from flight videos available on the internet. We use this synthetic dataset for pretraining our models before finetuning on real data, and show that synthetic data alone can lead to pretty accurate detections qualitatively as well. We also verify if providing explicit information about local evidence of wiry-ness in the form of edge and line detection results from a traditional computer vision method, as additional channels to the network input, makes the task easier or not. We evaluate our best models from the grid search on a publicly available dataset and show that they outperform previous work using traditional computer vision and various deep net baselines of FCNs, SegNet and E-Net, on both standard edge detection metrics and inference speed. Our top models run at more than 3Hz on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 with input resolution of 480\u00d7640, with an Average Precision score of 0.73 on our test split of the USF dataset.",

        "abstract": "The use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) for studying Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) offers many benefits, including decreased cost and risk as well as increased experimental control and repeatability. Previous work has shown that people reliably underestimate distances in VR; however, the effect of this underestimation on gesture recognition has not been characterized. This work contributes to the validation of immersive VR as a platform for HRI investigation and simulation for training in industry. A matched pair of studies compared the location preferences of human participants when viewing gestures generated by a robot in both virtual and physical environments. Participants were asked to select up to three optimal locations within a bounded region at which they perceived the robot's gesture to be the clearest. We found that the use of VR did increase the preferred proxemic distance (\u03c72 (1) = 18.046, p <; 0.001) by approximately 642 \u00b1 96mm. The difference in viewing angle between the virtual and physical environments was not significant, with a 95% confidence interval limiting the difference within -8.6\u00b0 to +7.9\u00b0. Observations relating gesture features to optimal viewing locations are also presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study on collaborative manipulation between an autonomous robot and multiple users. We investigate how different motion types impact people's ability to understand the robot's goals in a multi-user scenario. We propose an approach based on Collaborative Probabilistic Movement Primitives to generate the robot's movements, exploiting predictability and legibility of movement to express intentions through motion. We compare the impact on the interaction of using only either predictable or legible movements, and propose a third approach - hybrid motion - that selects, in each situation, whether to execute a predictable motion or a legible motion, depending on what the robot perceives as more efficient for the multi-user collaboration effort. To test the impact of the three motion types in the context of a collaborative task, we run a user study using a Baxter robot that autonomously serves cups of water to three users upon request. Our results show that, in the particular case where all users simultaneously request water, the hybrid motion performs better than the other two.",
